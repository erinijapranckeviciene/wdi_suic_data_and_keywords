AB France currently has a very high level of prisoner suicides. Between 2005 and 2010, the mean annual rate was 18.5 suicides per 10,000 prisoners seven times higher than for the general population. In this article, we begin by describing how suicide has changed since the mid-nineteenth century, highlighting the increasingly specific nature of suicide among prisoners versus non-prisoners. We then analyse the associations between individual characteristics and suicide risk, based on information from the French prison service's database on all prison terms served in France between 1 January 2006 and 15 July 2009. Over this period, nearly 378,000 terms were observed (corresponding to more than 221,000 person-years) and 378 suicides were identified. Our results confirm the vulnerability of pre-trial detainees, and show that isolation, be it physical or social, is a key component of suicide risk, along with the type of offence resulting in a prison sentence. Improving the conditions of detention is one of the priorities of prevention policies now being implemented, but the nature of the offence must also be taken into account as a suicide risk factor.

DE suicide; France; the press; Grub Street; Paris; medicalisation;

AB This article investigates the manner in which the French press of the late eighteenth century treated the suicides of Grub Street writers. The main argument is that the secularisation of suicide allowed for new attitudes toward self-inflicted death. One finds that the underground press callously mocked the suicides of hack writers. Secondarily, the article challenges the notion that suicide became 'medicalised' in the eighteenth century, and that contemporaries viewed it solely as an act of insanity.

AB Background. - Suicide is a complex and multifactorial phenomenon. The number of work-related suicides is difficult to assess in France. There are nevertheless some data available to document this problem. The aim of this study is to describe suicide attempts (SA) and suicide mortality according to occupation in France.
   Methods. - The description of SA relies on the "Barometre Sante 2005", a cross-sectional representative survey conducted by the tripes in France. The study population includes 6264 men and 7389 women in employment at the time of the survey. The prevalence of all life SA is described according to occupational category (one and two digits). Data on suicide mortality before the age of 65 comes from the Cosmop project, conducted by the Department of Occupational Health/InVS, and based on data from the "Echantillon demographique permanent"/Insee linked to medical causes of death from the French national death registry (CepiDc/Inserm). People included was born in France, employed at one of censuses (1968, 1975, 1982 and 1990, 187,938 men, 150,683 women). Relative risks for suicide mortality were estimated for the last known occupational category and economic sector.
   Results. - The prevalence of life course SA was higher among women than among men (6.6% vs 3.1%); an opposite situation was observed for mortality. Regarding, salaried people, categories of manual workers and clerks are the most affected by SA and mortality from suicide whereas executives are the least concerned. Farmers were little affected by SA (0.4% men, 4.1% women) but experienced the highest rate of mortality by suicide (RR = 3.1 men, RR = 2.2 women). Among women, compared to non market sectors, the agricultural and equipment goods sectors exhibited an excessive risk of mortality from suicide.
   Conclusion. - This study points out SA and mortality from suicide inequalities by occupational categories and to a lesser extent by economic sector. These results provide a first assessment on suicide according to occupation in France. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY

DT Article
DE Suicide; social representations; France; Brittany; prevention
ID ATTITUDES; IDEATION; CORE; RISK
AB Background: Suicide is a major worldwide public health issue. Various studies showed that individual attitudes toward suicide change in a region with high suicide rate. Attitudes are one of the components of a global and complex system: social representations (SRs).
   Aims: In France, the Brittany region has an abnormally high death rate due to suicides. Our research focuses on the SRs of suicide in this region. The hypothesis underlying this project is that suicide SRs are different between an area with a high suicide rate and a region less affected by suicide.
   Method: A comparative study between the Brittany and Alsace regions, with the latter showing a statistically much lower suicide rate. The persons polled responded to a three-word free-association task around the question For you, suicide is ...?' An analysis of word frequency and evocation rank was then carried out.
   Results: In confirmation of our hypothesis, SRs were different between Brittany and the control region.
   Conclusion: The study's results open new avenues of research, specific to Brittany, in terms of the collective or individual effects of suicides, in terms of psycho-pathological conditions - essentially on depression, and in terms of training, on the stereotypes associated with suicide.

ID INTERVENTION
AB Issue. - Suicide is a major problem of public health around the world, and if suicidal mortality rates have declined in recent years, the elderly remain a category of the world's population at major risk of suicide. Seventeen percent of deaths by suicide across the world are individuals over the age of 65. The existence of suicidal ideas for an individual in this age group increases the risk of suicide attempt in the year by 34. In France, about a little less than a quarter of suicides belong to persons over 60-years-old. More risk factors found in the international literature are in the foreground of mental disorders and in particular the major depression episode, then secondarily addictions, neuro-degenerative disorders as well as pain and other diseases. Depression is found in 60% to 90% of suicides. We notice also that older people privileged the general practitioner as interlocutor to discuss their problems and worries much more than psychiatrists or psychologists. In fact, two-thirds of the elderly who committed suicide had consulted their general practioner in the month prior to suicide and half in the 10 last days. That raises the question of the identification of depression and the evaluation of suicidal risk. On the other side, there is an abundant literature about psychosocial risk factors especially on the influence of isolation and lack of social support as well as on conflicts and family losses. In France, more than 4 million of the elderly live alone. So, while the world population is increasing and life expectancy lengthens, it is important to already act for elderly suicide prevention.
   Perspectives. - Suicide prevention actions whose efficacity have been demonstrated around the world are designed as part of multimodal strategies combining several levers of action. The consensual recommendations for prevention of elderly suicide recommend the association of actions on the reduction of depression and combating social isolation in connection with the training of front-line actors such as general practitioners. As a result of these experiments and recommendations, the first francophone multimodal strategy was developed to act both on depression and social isolation: the Cooperation Quebec France sur la depression et l'isolement (CQFDi) program which will be implemented in France and Quebec in 2019.
   Conclusion. - It has been proven that multimodal suicide prevention strategies allow a reduction in the number of suicides. The CQFDi program focuses on at risk of suicide population and aims to reduce the suicide rate of elderly people in France. (C) 2018 L'Encephale, Paris.

AB In response to recent research documenting a link between early substance use and suicidal behaviors among youth, the current study sought to examine the associations between ages of substance use initiation and suicidal behavior among students in France and the USA.
   Cross-sectional logistic regression analyses based on the 2003 European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) survey (France; n = 13,187) and the 2003 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) (United States; n = 15,136) assessed associations between early substance use initiation (i.e., alcohol, cigarette and cannabis/marijuana) and suicide ideation and attempts while controlling for potential confounders.
   Early alcohol use initiation (ORadj = 1.52; 95% CI 1.17-1.97) and early cannabis/marijuana use initiation (ORadj = 2.90; 95% CI 2.20-3.83) were associated with suicide attempt in France. Early smoking was associated with suicide attempt in both France (ORadj = 1.92; 95% CI 1.55-2.37) and the USA (ORadj = 1.53; 95% CI 1.02-2.28). Sex differences were also noted.
   The associations between substance use initiation and suicidal behaviors differed in the United States and France. These findings, placed into context, can assist the development and implementation of prevention strategies that seek to reduce the harmful consequences of early substance use among youth.

AB After being condemned and imprisoned in Lisbon by the Portuguese Inquisition, Luis Mendes de Franca exiled himself in late 1683 to France, where his descendants adopted the family name Mendes France. In 1695, at the age of 55 years, Luis Mendes committed suicide in Bordeaux by a pistol shot that decapitated him. The inquest conducted at that time concluded that Luis Mendes was insane and thus not guilty of the crime of suicide. We hypothesize that he used a flint stone-type pistol loaded with an extraordinarily, p large quantity of black gunpowder. Using available information oil historic firearms, ammunition, and powder, coupled with the preserved testimony of historic figures, we propose a reconstruction of this drama and a diagnostic approach to the psychiatric aspects of the suicide.

AB Background: Public health policies aim to prevent suicide in the general population. Assessing their effectiveness is required to further guide public health policies. The present article focuses on the French paradox. The French health care system was classified as the best in the world according the World Health Organization (WHO). However, suicide rates in France remain high compared to other European countries. The aim of the present article was to analyze (i) the evolution of suicide Age-Standardized Death (ASDRs) in France during the last three decades and the associations with socio-economic parameters and (ii) to understand which populations may specifically benefit from further targeted suicide prevention policies.
   Methods: The database of the World Health Organization (WHO), freely available, was explored in April 2015. ASDRs were calculated each year by ratio between the number of deaths by suicide and the total population (per 100,000 inhabitants). Number of deaths by gender and age were also analyzed.
   Results: Overall, ASDR suicide has decreased since 1987 in France (-32.8% between 1987 and 2010). However, France kept the same rank (10/26) when compared to other European countries between 1987 and 2010. The relative burden of suicide in all-causes mortality increased during the same period (+28.2%) while the total number of deaths by suicide increased only slightly (+3.9%). More specifically, the number of deaths by suicide increased substantially in 135-541 years old ( +40%) and 754+ years old (+27%) males, and in 135-541 (+41%) years old females. Between 2000 and 2010, suicide rates significantly decreased when yearly mean income increased, and when general and psychiatric care beds decreased.
   Conclusion: Although ASDR suicide has decreased in France since 1987, this decline is quite modest when considering its universal access to care, the prevention of depression and suicide public policies. Suicide prevention public policies should focus on evaluation and improvement of prevention and care in the 135-541 years old population, and in the males aged 75+. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

ID UNEMPLOYMENT; PARASUICIDE
AB Suicide mortality rates decreased in France from 1996 to 1999, and a difference was observed between the 11 regions which have implemented suicide prevention programmes (Programmes regionaux de sante (PRS)) and the 11 others which have not launched PRS of this kind. The former regions showed a sharper decrease in their suicide mortality rates than the latter. In the present study, the explanatory factors underlying these differential regional trends were examined using an ecological model. Principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple regression procedures provided consistent findings in terms of the main factors associated with the male and female mortality rates, which were found to be unemployment problems and economic inequalities, respectively. However, these factors do not explain the differential regional trends. The suicide mortality rates were negatively correlated with regional lithium prescription rates in the case of males, whereas alcohol withdrawal drug prescription rates were positively correlated in the case of females. It is still difficult to conclude whether the PRS definitely had positive effects. However, no single variable alone can account for all the trends in the suicide rates. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A suicide pact is the decision of two or more people to die together. This event is rare. The majority of suicide pacts victims are married, socially isolated, with a serious physical illness in one or both partners. We performed a retrospective study of all cases of suicide pacts leading to death between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2010 referred to the Forensic Medicine Department of Tours (France). Six cases were recorded as suicide pacts. Firearms were the preferred means of death. Five suicide notes were discovered. For some cases, it was difficult to establish whether death was the result of a suicide pact or of a homicide-suicide without the consent of the victim. An objective element, such as a suicide note and motive, is required to prove that a suicide pact is involved. The prevalence of mental disorders is hard to assess. In France, psychological autopsies are not performed in such cases, as the investigation is usually very sparse after the death of both individuals.

AB Our objective was to determine whether the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup in 1998 had a short-term impact on the number of suicides in France. Exhaustive individual daily data on suicides from 1979 to 2006 were obtained from the French epidemiological center on the medical causes of death (CepiDCINSERM; France). These data were analyzed using the seasonal ARIMA model. The overall effect of the World Cup was tested together with potential specific impact on days following the French team games. Between 11th June and 11th July, a significant decline of 95 suicides was observed (-10.3%), this effect being the strongest among men and people aged between 30 and 44. A significant decrease was also observed for the days following French team games (-19.9%). Our results are in favor of an effect of nationwide sport events on suicidal behaviors and are consistent with other studies. Many of the theories explaining the relationship between sports and suicide are related to sense of belongingness and social integration, highlighting the importance of social link reinforcement in suicide prevention.

AB ObjectiveThe overall rate of suicide in French Guiana is estimated at 6 per 100,000, a rate that is lower than in mainland France. Given the frequent reports of suicide in Amerindian communities, our hypothesis was that this figure fails to capture a more contrasted reality. Our objective was to refine estimates and determine suicide rates in remote villages of French Guiana.MethodsWe included patients for whom a suicide attempt or suicide was mentioned in medical records. The Health centers were grouped into two zones according to geographical remoteness.ResultsThe highest suicide rates observed in the remote Amerindian villages of Camopi and Trois Sauts were, respectively, 118 and 78/100,000. The median age at the time of suicide was significantly younger in remote zones [23years (95% CI 21.59-25.06)] than in non-remote zones[27years (95% CI 24.47-29.31)]. The most frequent methods were hanging (78%) and intoxication (22%).ConclusionsThe suicide rate in remote areas in French Guiana was eight times higher than in France. The suicide of young people in remote areas in French Guiana and specifically in Amerindian villages must be better understood and prevented with contextualized and adapted care.

AB Background: Suicidality risk-factors between countries with similar economic and religious background have been rarely compared, especially within genders.
   Methods: Lifetime prevalence of suicide ideation, plans, and attempts in the ESEMeD surveys were stratified on four separate groups: French women, Spanish women, French men, and Spanish men. Outcome odds-ratios (OR) were modelled within each group using logistic regression including demographic characteristics, lifetime mood/anxiety disorders, parental bonding, marital status, and health service-use.
   Results: Lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts was 3.4% in France (1.1% men, 5.4% women) and 1.5% in Spain (1.2% men, 1.7% women), with a significantly greater gender difference in France (p = 0.001). Regarding risk-factors, French women reported suicide attempt more commonly with authoritarian mothers (OR = 1.51; 95%CI = 1.04-2.18), unlike Spanish women (OR = 0.77; 95%CI = 0.51-1.15) (p<0.001). Spanish men showed more than eight-times higher odds of suicide attempt with overprotecting mothers than French men (p = 0.03). General practitioner(GP)-use was significantly protective of suicide attempt among Spanish women (OR = 0.08; 95%CI = 0.02-0.35) with no effect in French women (OR = 1.03; 95%CI = 0.54-2.00) (p = 0.01). No significant differences in the effect of marital status, any lifetime antidepressant use, mental disorders, or religiosity on suicide attempt were observed between France and Spain within gender-stratum.
   Limitations: Parental bonding is retrospective and potentially influenced by mental state. Response rate was considerably lower in France than in Spain.
   Conclusions: Suicidality risk-factors play different roles across genders between France and Spain. Parental bonding dimensions may be interpreted differently according to country, underlining cultural importance. As recommended by WHO, mental health decisions must involve GPs in conjunction with psychiatrists or psychologists. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE epidemiology; suicide; elderly; retirement homes

AB Background: Suicide in the elderly attracts less attention that in the young. However it is more frequent among the former. The retirement home receives the populations most isolated from their families and those most vulnerable from a psychological and physical point of view. The aim of this research is to provide information concerning suicide in the elderly in France, to specify the means employed and to compare suicide rates at home and in retirement homes
   Methods: The statistics utilized are those of population size (censuses) and medical causes of death. With these latter causes a relation cannot be made between place of residence and place where the death by suicide is registered. They therefore underestimate suicide rates which are only considered at the home or retirement home. Consequently different estimations have been made.
   Results: Suicide rates are higher in the retirement home than at home for both sexes. However, for men, the suicide rates in retirement homes are similar to those recorded for isolated men living at home. On the contrary, for women, the retirement home seems to constitute a specific risk in itself with suicide rates quite distinct from the other situations studied. In the retirement homes, conversly to men, it is the youngest women, (65 to 74 years) who have the highest rates. Hanging is the most prevalent mean of suicide both at home end in the retirement homes. Jumping from a high place is the second-mean utilized in the retirement homes where fire arms and consumption of substances. are less represented
   Conclusions: There are few studies in France concerning suicide in the elderly. Due to the demographic evolution, the number of suicides among the aged May well increase considerably in the years to come.

AB The continuous surveillance of suicide and attempted suicide cases was added to the tasks of the French Sentinel Network of General Practitioners (GPs) in 1999. In 2001, 9700 suicides were estimated to have occurred and an estimated 61500 attempted suicide cases were diagnosed by GPs, representing approximately 40% of cases nationwide. The majority of suicide and attempted suicide cases involved women (67%) and 43% of all cases involved patients aged 25-44 years. The faciltity rate increased with age. About 80% of GPs complied with the current recommendation to refer patients who had attempted suicide to hospital.

SO REVUE D EPIDEMIOLOGIE ET DE SANTE PUBLIQUE
LA French
DT Article
DE Suicide attempts; Mental suffering; Emergency call center SAMU;
   Hospitalisations; Psychiatry; Nord - Pas-de-Calais (France)
AB Background. - There are very few permanent indicators of mental health in France; suicidal behavior is often only understood on the basis of deaths by suicide.
   Method. - The epidemiological interest and methodological limits of four medico-administrative databases from which data on suicide attempts can be extracted have been the subject of a study in the Nord - Pas-de-Calais Region of France: telephone calls for emergency medical assistance after suicide attempt (2009 to 2011), admissions in emergency services with a diagnosis of suicide attempt (2012), medical-surgical hospital admissions as a result of suicide attempt (2009 to 2011), and psychiatric admissions with a diagnosis of suicide attempt (2011).
   Results. - Usable data were provided by one of two emergency medical assistance units, five of thirty emergency departments and all medical-surgical and psychiatric units; in data from the latter two sources, a unique anonymous identifier gave individual statistics, while the first two covered only suicide attempts. In 2011, the number of suicide attempt calls per 100,000 inhabitants was 304, whereas the number of hospitalisations with this diagnosis was 275; rates are highest in men between 20 and 49 years of age, and in women below 20 years of age and between 40 and 49. Sources are seen to be very homogeneous with regards to the average age at which suicide took place (between 37.8 and 38.5 years, depending on the source), and to the sex (55.0% to 57.6% of women). In 2011, the number of patients with a diagnosis of suicide attempt treated in psychiatry is 2.6 times lower than the number hospitalised for suicide attempt in medical-surgical units (3563 vs 9327).
   Conclusion. - Permanent gathering of data, and the large volume of data recorded, should encourage the use of these databases in the definition and assessment of mental health policy: an increased contribution from emergency call centers and emergency services, and the coding of the suicidal nature of intoxications by a few clearly under-declaring units, must however be achieved in order to improve this source of information.

TI Social inequalities in suicide mortality:: Spain and France, 1980-1982
   and 1988-1990
SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
AB In this study we analyzed the socioeconomic differences in mortality from suicide in the economically active male population aged 25-64 years in Spain and France in 1980-1982 and 1988-1990; in the case of Spain the data came from the Eight Provinces Study (Regidor, Gutierrez-Fisac, & Rodriguez, 1995). Individuals were grouped into four categories: professional/managerial, clerical/sales/ service, agricultural, and manual workers. For 1980-1982, among those aged 2544, professionals and managers had the lowest risk of mortality in Spain, and clerical/sales/service workers in France. These socioeconomic differences in mortality increased in 1988-1990. In 1980-1982, among those aged 45-64, clerical/ sales/service workers had the lowest risk of mortality from suicide relative to the other occupational groups in both countries, but this difference was not maintained in 1988-1990. Thus, differences in suicide mortality for men by occupational status depended in the present study upon both the nation studied and the time period chosen for study.

AB Background. - Despite a large media coverage of the phenomenon, the number of work-related suicides is currently unknown in France. There are nevertheless some data available to document this important issue. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of an epidemiological surveillance system for work-related suicides designed to quantify and describe work-related suicides mainly according to economic sectors and occupational categories.
   Methods. - Existing data sources in France were identified and evaluated for their relevance and their potential use in a multi-sources surveillance system. A regional pilot study was performed using the main relevant sources identified to investigate different aspects of the system design.
   Results. - Four major data sources were identified to be used to describe work-related suicides: death certificates, social insurance funds, data collected by the officers of the labor inspectorate and data collected from autopsy reports in forensic departments. The regional pilot study gave an estimate of 28 cases of work-related suicide in two years.
   Conclusion. - The findings point out the difficulties involved and the criteria for successful implement of such a system. The study provides some solutions for carrying out this system, the achievement of which will depend upon particular resources and partners' agreements. Recommendations for the next steps have been made based on this work, including possible collaboration with forensic departments, which collect essential data for surveillance.

AB This study provides a full table of the mortality of prisoners in France. It is based on the 246 files archived at the French Ministry of Justice for individuals who died in 2011. Seven out of ten deaths were violent, primarily suicides and drug overdoses or medicinal poisonings. The analysis confirms excess mortality from suicide among male prisoners compared with the general population, as well as excess mortality due to other violent causes. Conversely, natural-cause mortality is lower among male prisoners than for males in the general population. The use of suspensions of sentence for medical reasons partly explains this result. For a given age group, the perpetrators of serious offences present a higher risk of death, whether due to violence or natural causes, than the perpetrators of less serious offences. The risk of violent death is also higher among pretrial detainees than among convicts. The description of the circumstances of death highlights the need for better alert systems and improved management of health incidents, especially at night.

DT Article
AB This paper examines how the suicide of a teenager illuminated a longstanding ideological divide in fin-de-siecle France. Five days after his arrival at the Maison Paternelle, an internationally renowned, privately-operated establishment for bourgeois boys, Gaston Contard committed suicide. The suicide was quickly sensationalized in the press and resulted in a wide-ranging investigation by public prosecutors who charged the institution's director with illegal imprisonment. Although acquitted, this was a pyrrhic victory as the event marked a critical turning point in the relationship between private power, state control and paternal authority as it pertained to the incarceration and socialization of troubled youths.

AB Background. - Since the 1990s, several studies have found higher rates of suicide attempts in homosexuals and bisexuals than in heterosexuals. The current challenge is to identify risk factors for targeting prevention. The aim of this paper was to determine, for the first time in France, the prevalence of suicide attempts over a 12-month period and associated factors in a population of men and women who self-identified as homosexuals or bisexuals.
   Methods. - A convenience sample cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2011 using an anonymous self-administered questionnaire made available in the gay press, and Internet sites targeting the gay or lesbian community. Among the persons completing the questionnaire, 10,100 men and 2963 women residing in France answered the questions on suicide attempts. The factors associated with suicide attempts during the previous 12 months were identified by logistic regression.
   Results. - Lifetime prevalence for suicide attempts was 16% in men and 18% in women; 12-month prevalence was 1.6% in men and 1.9% in women. Factors independently associated with suicide attempts in the past 12 months in men and women were lack of occupational activity, victim of sexual abuse, termination of a long-term relationship, excessive alcohol consumption in the past 12 months, depression, and in addition, in men, living in a small locality, victim of verbal or physical aggression and use of anxiolytics.
   Conclusion. - According to our results, the fight against homophobia is an important element for the prevention of suicide attempts among homosexual and bisexual men. Indeed, in addition to traditional risk factors for suicide attempt, a significant association was also found with homophobic aggression in the past year. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Background: Previous studies have identified factors associated with admission to hospital after suicide spectrum behaviors. In this study, we aim to identify specific factors associated with psychiatric hospitalization after self-poisoning. Given earlier findings suggesting that alcohol use disorder is not associated with hospital admission, we also aim to consider its impact, as well as blood alcohol concentrations, on hospitalization decisions after a suicide attempt.
   Methods: We studied the association between demographic features, suicide intent, psychiatric characteristics and admission to hospital in self-poisoning patients in an emergency department in France.
   Results: Suicide intent, a past history of suicide attempts, bipolar disorder and depression were associated with psychiatric hospital admissions. Despite alcohol use disorder being known to be associated with a suicide risk, it was not linked with psychiatric hospitalization. A positive blood alcohol concentration in the emergency department likewise had no association with admission to a psychiatric ward for inpatient care.
   Conclusions: Our findings were similar to those reported for other suicide spectrum behaviors. Alcohol use disorder was not associated with admission for inpatient psychiatric care, whereas depression clearly was. The cause of this discrepancy must be determined in future research.

AB Background The factors most strongly associated with suicide are age and gender-more men than women, and, more people over 65 kill themselves. As a number of Governments have targets to reduce suicide levels we compare elderly suicide rates over a 20-year period in England and Wales. And the major Western countries focusing upon age and gender.
   Method WHO mortality data were used to calculate three-year average General Population Suicide Rates (GPSR) for 1979-1981 to 1997-1999 and rates of people aged 65-74 and 75+ suicide by gender to provide ratios of change and a statistical comparison of England and Wales and the Major Western countries over the period.
   Results Male GSPR: '65-74' suicide ratios fell significantly in six countries and in three for the '75+'. Female GSPR: '65-74' suicide ratios fell in every country except Spain. Proportionately, there were more suicides in the over 65s in countries with an 'extended family' tradition, Spain, Italy, Germany, France and Japan, than in the five 'secular' countries. England and Wales male '65-74' suicide fell significantly more than Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Netherlands and the USA, and did significantly better than the other countries for all female senior citizen suicides.
   Conclusion Suicide of the over-65s has improved in seven countries, especially in England and Wales, who had the greatest proportional reduction, which reflects well upon the psycho-geriatric and community services. However, in all countries, male 65-74 rates did not match the female out so extra efforts are needed to improve male rates. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB A spatial analysis of data for French departements assembled in the 1830s by Andre-Michel Guerry and Adolphe d'Angeville examines the impacts of modernization and resistance to governmental "Frenchification" policies on measures of violence and its direction. In the context of Unnithan et al.'s integrated model of suicide and homicide, high suicide rates in the northern core and a predilection for violence against others in the southern periphery may be consistently interpreted in terms of theories of the civilizing process and internal colonialism. Alternative explanations of southern violence in 19th-century France are explored and rejected, and additional theoretical applications are suggested.

AB Background: Suicide within the Amerindian community of Camopi (1741 inhabitants) in French Guiana has been an increasing problem widely reported in the media leading the French Government to mandate a parliamentary mission to investigate the matter. The purpose of the study was to describe this phenomenon and identify factors associated with suicide attempts. Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted from the health centers' medical records. All suicide attempts and suicides committed between 2008 and 2015 by Amerindians living in Camopi and Trois Sauts were compiled. Contextual factors and suicide representations were also analyzed. Results: During the study period, the annual attempted suicide rate and the suicide rate were higher in the last 3 years. The overall annual rate was equal to 6.9/1741 or 396 per 100, 000 inhabitants for attempted suicide and 172 per 100,000 inhabitants for suicide, which is more than 10 times higher than the suicide rate in mainland France. The mortality rate was 30.4% versus 8.2% in mainland France. The 10-20 year-old age group represented 70% of suicide deaths. There was no significant difference between genders. A recent death and interpersonal conflict were the main stressful life events reported by respondents (55 and 52%, respectively). Alcohol addiction (30% of the respondents) was associated with suicide attempts under the influence of alcohol (p = 0.03). Repetition of suicide attempts was associated with cannabis consumption (p = 0.03). Depression was reported among 45% of the respondents. A third of respondents reported having been abused during their childhood. Over half of respondents reported that their suicide attempt was motivated by a spirit (58%). Conclusions: Despite limitations due to the small population size and limited time frame, this is the first study to describe the epidemiology of suicide among Amerindians living in Camopi. In contrast with other French territories, the suicide rate was very high, the sex ratio was balanced and younger age groups were most affected.

ID HISTORICAL TRAUMA; RISK-FACTORS; CANADA; INUIT
AB A debate that took place in France in the early 20th century still has much to tell us about the interpretation and strategies of intervention of suicide, particularly the cohort effect of aboriginal youth suicide. The act of suicide, for Durkheim, was inseparable from the problem of social cohesion, with extremes in solidarity and regulation predictably reflected in high rates of suicide. For Gabriel Tarde, by contrast, suicide was seen as an outcome of changeable ideas found in processes of innovation and imitation among creatively receptive individuals. This latter approach remains overlooked in favor of a growing reliance on conceptions of historical trauma and conditions of social disintegration. Recognizing the idea of suicide itself as a potential locus of solidarity opens up other possibilities for responding to and intervening in suicide crises or clusters.

ID WALES; JAIL
AB Background: Suicide rates are high among prisoners but little is known about the precise weight of each risk factor.
   Methods: We collected data on the periods of imprisonment of all adult males incarcerated in France between 1 January, 2006 and 15 July, 2009. We used survival analyses from the incarceration to its end, censored by the observation period. We calculated suicide rates and performed a Cox model to assess the link between prisoners' imprisonment characteristics and suicide risk.
   Results: Overall, 301,611 periods of imprisonment were observed and 353 suicides were recorded. The suicide rate was 17.9 suicides per 10,000 person-years (95% CI: 16.1-19.9). The hazard ratio (HR) of suicide risk was high for placements in a disciplinary cell (15.7, 95% CI: 10.6-23.5) and varied depending on the main offence (homicide: 7.6, 95% CI: 5.3-10.9, rape: 4.6, 95% CI: 3.2-6.6, other sexual assault: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.9-4.6, other violent offence: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.5-2.8, compared with other offences). HR was lower when visits from relatives were observed (0.4, 95% CI: 0.3-0.5) and higher if a hospitalization was observed (1.6, 95% CI: 1.3-2.0). After conviction, HR halved with respect to the remand period, but there was no difference by sentence length. HR was higher if incarceration occurred after age 30 (1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.7). Foreigners tended to have lower risks than French prisoners, with the exception of those incarcerated for rape.
   Conclusions: The suicide rate in prison is generally much higher than in the general population. This study has replicated previous international findings, highlighting the impact of the type of offence on suicide risk. Suicide prevention programmes must consider the high risk associated with incarceration for a criminal offence against a person. With regard to the impact of visits from relatives and placements in a disciplinary cell, further work should be conducted from a psychological perspective to examine the effects of physical and social isolation.

AB Background
   Suicide risk is high among people living with HIV (PLHIV). This study aimed to identify major correlates of suicide risk in a representative sample of PLHIV in France, in order to help target individuals who would benefit from suicide risk screening and psychiatric care.
   Methods
   The ANRS VESPA2 cross-sectional survey (April 2011-January 2012) collected sociodemographic, medical and behavioral data from 3,022 PLHIV recruited in 73 French HIV hospital departments. The study sample comprised the 2,973 participants with available self-reported data on suicide risk (defined as having either thought about and planned to commit suicide during the previous 12 months or attempted suicide during the same period of time) and medical data on comorbidities. Weighted Poisson models adjusted for HCV co infection and significant clinical variables were used to estimate the relationship between suicide risk and HIV transmission groups, experience with HIV disease and other psychosocial factors.
   Results
   Suicide risk was reported by 6.3% of PLHIV in the study sample. After adjustment for HIV immunological status and HCV co-infection, women (IRR [95%Cl]:1.93 [1.17; 3.19]) and men who have sex with men (MSM) (1.97 [1.22; 3.19]) had a higher suicide risk than the rest of the sample. Moreover, the number of discrimination-related social contexts reported (1.39 [1.19; 1.61]), homelessness (4.87 [1.82; 13.02]), and reporting a feeling of loneliness (4.62 [3.06; 6.97]) were major predictors of suicide risk.
   Conclusions
   Reducing the burden of precarious social conditions and discrimination is an important lever for preventing suicide risk among PLHIV in France. Comprehensive care models involving peer/community social interventions targeted at women and MSM need to be implemented to lower the risk of suicide in these specific subgroups of PLHIV.

AB Suicide is a major public health problem worldwide, with about 1.5 million deaths each year: France ranks 7th in the EU. Patients with depression account for the majority of completed suicides. As most of these individuals are not adequately treated, it is conceivable that better treatment of depression would reduce suicide mortality. However, the last ten years have seen a controversy over a possible suicidogenic effect of antidepressants. Here we summarize data from the different types of studies that have cast a shadow over these drugs which can save lives when used effectively to treat depression. Better knowledge of the pathophysiology of "suicidal behaviour disorder" should identify therapeutic targets for innovative agents capable of preventing suicide.

AB Rationale. -Within the framework of an evaluation program for the prevention of suicide in Brittany conducted by the academic department of psychiatry (University of Rennes, Brittany, France), we have addressed the issue of the potential. usefulness of psychological. autopsy as a tool. for the better comprehension of suicide risk factors.
   Method. -We reviewed the appropriate literature in 30 articles found amongst those obtained from the "Medline" database. These articles were selected according to the quality of their methodology. For the MedLine data retrieval. search, the following keywords were used: "psychological autopsy", "psychiatric autopsy", "psychological autopsy and methodology", "psychiatric autopsy and methodology". This review's objective was to determine, firstly the nature and the content of psychological autopsies, secondly to evaluate their use as a methodological toot to assist the comprehension and prevention of suicide. Finally, it was also to assess its feasibility for use in France.
   Results. - The majority of the published studies using psychological autopsy for the evaluation of suicide expertise came from Scandinavian or Anglo-Saxon countries. Schneidman [Schneidman ES. The psychological autopsy. Suicide Life Threat Behav 1981;11:325-40], whose aim was to clarify the causes of sudden death related to psychological circumstances, focused on suicidal intentions and the symptoms exhibited. He coined the term: "psychological autopsy". Gradually, the definition of psychological autopsy has evolved and is now being used for the evaluation of death by suicide with a single goal in mind: to retrospectively identify any suicidal predictive and risk factors available at the time of the event. At present, no unequivocal definition of "psychological autopsy" has been put forth. However, this formerly only descriptive procedure is now becoming more analytical in nature (comparison of psychiatric profiles between pre- and postmortem assessments, research on precipitating factors, comorbidity studies...). Presently, it corresponds to a methodological toot to be used essentially for case reports that vary a great deal and do not permit cross-comparisons with other case-studies. For the past fifteen years, case-control studies in this field have become more frequent with various choices of control groups: healthy subjects with no psychiatric history, as well as attempted suicides, with or without a psychiatric history. Partial standardization of autopsy procedures is now possible with some data extracted from police inquiries, medical charts, or data gathered following interviews with the deceased patient's relatives.
   Conclusion. - In the aggregate, the literature review showed that the aims of psychological autopsy include understanding and prevention of suicide in a population-based sample. It seems difficult to generalize with results from other population references. In France, the use of psychological autopsy as a standardized toot for the assessment of suicidal behaviors would be difficult, due to the complexity of the procedures involved: data coming from external sources, such as medical sources, is nearly impossible to obtain. Practitioners would be required to overcome administrative rules and regulations, plus incurring the high costs of such procedures. They must also take into account ethical considerations that make such interviews with the deceased patient's relatives difficult to obtain. Be this as it may, the French Ministry of Health is presently attempting to find a solution in order to alleviate the all too frequent problem of suicide in the population at large and to promote suicide prevention in France.

AB The purpose of health surveillance is to contribute to health planning, information and prevention. Surveillance involves repeated data collections based on epidemiological studies and follow-up of data collected from medical-administrative databases. This paper provides an overview of mental health surveillance in France and examines the relevance and limitations of the collected data. Method. The prevalence of major depressive episodes (MDE) in the general population was recently examined in seven studies. Among these studies, the Health Barometers involved two data collections at a five-year interval using the same method. Mortality and hospitalization data are important for suicide and suicide attempt (SA) surveillance. Health insurance databases provide key information about psychotropic drug use and serious psychiatric illnesses defined as long-term. Results. The prevalence of 12-month MDE remained stable at 7.8% between 2005 and 2010. Mortality data show a suicide rate of 16 per 100,000 inhabitants. Hospital data show that the rate of hospitalization for SAs is approximately ten times that of suicide. Data from emergency wards indicate that approximately 220,000 SAs are admitted to hospital emergency services every year. Currently, depressive disorders are the primary reason for new admissions under the ALD23. Discussion. A comparison of data from different sources is required to provide a basis for mental health surveillance in France and to help identify those populations that need to be targeted as a matter of priority by prevention measures.

AB Following the September 11th 2001 atrocity, Western Government policies focused more on 'defense,' which undermines Government's commitment to reducing suicide. Annual US and major Western countries suicides were compared with '9/11' deaths to highlight the extent of mortality associated with mental disorder, homicide and road deaths are reviewed for contrast. The 3,074 fatalities of 9/11 are set against the US three year annual average 29,691 suicides, 17,077 homicides and 47,775 road deaths, thus every two weeks more US citizens died violently than on 9/11. In the majority of countries, there were more suicides than 9/11 victims, with suicides exceeding the 9/11 atrocity 18 times in Russia, nine in Japan and the US and three times in France and Germany. Annual suicides compared with terrorist violence should inform policy.

AB This paper reports the characteristics of suicides which occurred during the existential and the non-existential wars in Israel. It provides a first approximation of whether the suicide patterns in each war are consistent with the findings of Morselli and Durkheim, and whether their theoretical interpretations can serve as a preliminary guideline to explaining the Israeli case, which is characterized by short periods of war, social integration during some of the non-existential wars, and a sharp rise in post-war male suicide rates following all of the existential wars. Implications for further studies on the subject in Israel and elsewhere are discussed.

AB We used data from the National Survey on Violence against Women in France carried out in 2000 on a representative sample of 6970 women to compare the social characteristics of women who had sex with women (WSW) and women who had sex only with men (WSM). The WSW were more likely to be of a high socio-economic level and living in large cities. They were more frequently unmarried, without children, and had a more diverse sexual life, generally beginning younger, with more partners, mainly men. They were also more likely to use tobacco, alcohol and drugs. WSW reported more physical violence in the recent past and more suicide attempts than WSM, despite a lack of difference in psychological distress and stress. These results, in a field little studied in France, are consistent with international findings attesting to the difficulties faced by women in situations involving autonomy and marginality.

AB Suicide is one of the most important causes of death in prison around the world. In France, suicide rate for prisoners is 18.5 suicides per 10,000 inmates: seven times more common than in the general population.
   Among the risk factors identified in the literature, those most strongly associated with suicide in prison are physical isolation in custody, psychiatric history and history of suicide attempts.
   The prevention of suicide in prison involves several measures including treatment of psychiatric disorders, improvement of living conditions in custody, social support of prisoners and use of specific tools and programs by prison supervisors.
   No program for prevention of suicidal recurrence has ever been implemented. We propose to adapt "VigilanS", a program already applied in the general population, to the prison population.

DT Article
DE Suicide; Suicide attempt; Mortality; Prevention
AB Introduction. - In terms of suicide prevention, population-based prevention devices often struggle to demonstrate an effect in terms of reducing suicidal acts of suicide, often focusing on the evolution of the number of suicide attempts, on time too short to statistically interpret changes in mortality. The consolidated figures for mortality in France are provided by the CepiDC with a delay of approximately three years. We therefore had to try to work with an approximation of the phenomenon, and we tested the proxy value of the enumeration of corpses, body examinations and medico-legal autopsies for suicide by the forensic doctors of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region in France. In parallel, we conducted a comprehensive mortality study for 2016 in the VigilanS cohort.
   Method. - By measuring the evolution of the number of body lifts for suicide by the Department of Forensic Medicine of the region, for the 3 years before VigilanS (2012-2014) compared to the 3 years since VigilanS (2015-2017). The deaths of patients of the VigilanS cohort were identified by calling the city halls of birth and domicile of all patients integrating the device in 2016. The cause of death was then characterized by contact of the attending physician.
   Results. - We observe an average decrease in suicide mortality of 9.9% (-12% for men, +0.3% for women). The exhaustive analysis of suicide mortality in the VigilanS cohort in 2016 found 19 deaths, of which 14 by suicide, or 0.4% of patients. This observed mortality rate in the VigilanS cohort in 2016 is significantly below the expected threshold in the literature (1 to 2% in the year following TS).
   Conclusion. - It seems possible to reach the 2020 target for a 10% decrease in suicidal behavior in industrialized countries by 2020. The VigilanS device could therefore be protective in terms of suicide mortality. (C) 2018

TI Behind the Statistics: The Ethnography of Suicide in Palestine
SO CULTURE MEDICINE AND PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE Suicide; Palestine; Ethnography; Statistics
AB As part of the first anthropological study on suicide in the modern Arab world, statistics gathered from the Ramallah region of the West Bank in Palestine painted an apparently remarkably similar picture to that found in Western countries such as the UK and France. More men than women completed suicide, more women than men attempted suicide. Men used more violent methods such as hanging and women softer methods such as medication overdose. Completed suicide was higher in the older age range, attempted suicide in the younger. However, ethnographic fieldwork and detailed examination of the case studies and suicide narratives gathered and analysed within the cultural, political and economic contexts illustrated more starkly the differences in suicidal practices between Palestinian West Bank society of the 1990s and other regions of the world. The central argument of the paper is that although statistics tell a very important story, ethnography uncovers a multitude of stories 'behind the statistics', and thus helps us to make sense of both cultural context and subjective experience.

TI Work difficulties and suicide: Comparative study of life trajectories

DT Article
DE Professionnal environment; Psychiatric disorder; Prevention;
   Retrospective survey; Risk factor; Suicide
ID RISK
AB Over 900,000 people die by suicide every year around the world. Suicide has been described as being a multidimensional act, resulting from a number of risk factors accumulating throughout the life course. Recently, in France, some authors have suggested that work environment is a major or a unique risk factor in the etiology of suicide death. This theoretical position is in contradiction with empirical and epidemiologic evidence.
   Objective. - On the base of data from life trajectories, we studied to which extent work difficulties may contribute to a burden of adversity, which contribute to suicidal vulnerability.
   Method. - Two groups of participants (n = 84) were compared. Half (n = 42) were suicide victims who were compared to (n = 42) living controls. The individuals from the suicide group were employed at the moment of death and the living controls were employed at the moment of the study. Characteristics of participants were compared in regards to life trajectories (love relationships, social interactions, professional difficulties), past suicide attempts and psychiatric diagnosis. Data were collected according to a psychological autopsy and life calendar methods.
   Results. Significantly more mental health disorders on axis I (DSM-IV), especially mood and substances disorders as well as disorders on axis II (especially Cluster C) were observed among deceased participants. Moreover, comorbid mental health disorders and past suicide attempts over the life course were significantly more prevalent among participants deceased by suicide. No significant differences are observed between groups concerning adversities in love relationships and social interactions. However, participants from the control group had significantly more adversities in professional domain over the life course and during the last 5 years.
   Conclusion. Work difficulties are not a robust or direct risk factor of suicide, but psychiatric disorders are. These results are in contradiction with opinions of a debate in France concerning a direct link between work and suicides and should foster new debate. Application should promote the development of suicide prevention programs in work environments by focusing on protection and promotion the psychological health of workers.

AB In a previous paper (Luaute, 2014), we have shown that a prevailing view in France advocates the existence of a direct link between the current conditions of work and work-related suicide. In addition to the choice of the whereabouts, specific accusations by those who commit suicide, tend sometimes to confirm the protesting signification of their action. Therefore, they can be regarded as modes of revenge and sacrifice closely patterned on far-eastern traditions of voluntary death. In each time, the lack of an individual psychopathological factor is subsumed. Having recourse to suicide is now viewed as a major mode of political expression which deserves to be considered as an insidious form of terrorism. At-work suicides as spectacular phenomena, as well as present days' acts of terrorism, are inconceivable without the role of mass media in our societies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI Suicidal poisonings with methadone in France: Results of a two year
   national survey by the Toxicovigilance Network
SO CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Methadone; Suicide attempts; Capsule form; Syrup; Toxicovigilance
AB Context. Methadone is used in France since March 1995, only for opioid maintenance treatment, in a syrup form. For the launching of a capsule form in April 2008, French health authorities requested a prospective survey of all cases involving exposure to methadone in either of the two available pharmaceutical forms. Objective. The aim was to document, in different circumstances and compare the safety of the new capsule form to the syrup. This report presents the findings of one arm of the study, devoted to methadone-related suicide attempts. Materials and method. From April 15, 2008 to April 15, 2010, all self-injurious methadone poisonings notified to or managed by the French Toxicovigilance Centers network were included. Analysis mainly focused on patients' age and gender, estimated quantity ingested, eventual concomitantly taken substances, distribution of symptoms, and site of treatment. Results. 135 methadone-related suicide attempts were recorded. Analysis showed identical epidemiologic and clinical patient characteristics for the two pharmaceutical forms. Ten deaths occurred. The only discrepancy was a higher incidence of suicide attempts in the capsule group. However, as the number of capsule-treated patients increased during the second year, this difference remained significant but tended to decrease. Discussion. Combining these results with Pharmacovigilance and Addictovigilance arms, health authorities estimated that the benefit/risk balance of this new pharmaceutical form remains positive. They revised their position on requirements for prescribing and dispensing of the capsule form, and made them slightly easier. Following this, this "suicide" arm of Toxicovigilance survey was suspended, whereas the second one, concerning accidental pediatric methadone-related poisonings, has been extended until April 2014. Conclusion. In France, suicide attempts were more likely to occur with the capsule formulation. The clinical severity of intoxication was similar between the capsule and liquid forms.

AB The relevance of care in bariatric surgery must be judged in terms of the resulting benefit/risk balance. Laparoscopic approach has been proved to reduce postoperative mortality.
   Postoperative mortality is less than 0.1% in France.
   Depending on procedures, long-term percentage of weight loss is estimated around 15-30%. Long-term mortality and cardiovascular events are reduced compared to control patients.
   The over-risk of suicide should be known.
   Long-term follow-up after bariatric surgery is poor in France.

AB 'Undetermined' (UnD) and accidental deaths (AccD) are explored as possible sources of 'under-reported-suicides' (URS) in 20 Western countries.
   WHO mortality rates per million of AccD, UnD and suicides analysed. UnD:suicides ratios of < 1:5 calculated as likely URS versus ratios > 1:10 unlikely URS and all correlated by sex and age.
   Male URS likely in 7 countries and in 11 for females. URS in AccD likely in 5 countries for both sexes only UnD and suicide rates the elderly (75+) significantly correlated.
   Strong indication of URS in the UK, Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany with likely URS in AccD in Greece, Portugal, Switzerland and USA. These findings have important implications, indicating that, with the exception of France and Japan, official reported suicide rates contain a degree of under-reporting, and especially for women yet it is essential to have accurate suicide data to ensure adequate service provision.

AB Objective The authors present an analysis of findings for the 65 years and over age group from the WHO/EURO Multicentre Study of Suicidal Behaviour (1989-93).
   Methods Multinational data on non-fatal suicidal behaviour is derived from 1518 subjects in 16 European centres. Local district data on suicide were available from IO of the collaborating centres.
   Results Stockholm (Sweden), Pontoise (France) and Oxford (UK) had the highest suicide attempts rates. In most centres, the majority of elderly who attempted suicide were widow(er)s, often living alone, who used predominantly voluntary drug ingestion. Non-fatal suicidal behaviour decreased with increasing age, whereas suicide rates rose. The ratio between fatal and non-fatal behaviours was 1:2, that for males/females almost 1:1. In the years considered, substantial stability in suicide and attempted suicide rates was observed. As their age increased, suicidal subjects displayed only a limited tendency to repeat self-destructive acts. Moreover, there was little correlation between attempted suicide and suicide rates, which carries different clinical implications for non-fatal suicidal behaviour in the elderly compared with younger subjects in the same WHO/EURO study.

AB In France, suicide is considered a major public health problem since the 1990s. During the same period, researchers began to explain that suicides largely due to work were considerably growing in France. Nevertheless, only a few empirical studies deal with the theme. The current study analysed possible links between clinical factors (depressive symptoms, feelings of hopelessness) and work factors, including work characteristics (i.e., decision latitude, demands, social support, efforts, rewards, over-commitment), relations (harassment), and work-related psychological factors (basic needs satisfaction at work, burnout). For the study, employees from different sectors completed a self-report questionnaire. Depressive symptoms were linked to low extrinsic rewards, over-commitment at work, harassment at work, and emotional exhaustion. Feelings of hopelessness were linked to efforts, low intrinsic rewards, over-commitment at work, low satisfaction of the need of competencies at work, and low personal accomplishment at work. The discussion considers these factors as indicators for mental health and suicide prevention in a work environment.

The population, recruited in France, Belgium, and Switzerland, was composed of 570 subjects'(225 females, 345 males, mean age = 27.3, SD = 8.5). The subjects' psychological dimensions were investigated by means of several self-report questionnaires including: BDI-13 (Beck), Sensation-Seeking Scale (Zuckerman), Toronto Alexithymia Scale (Taylor), Interpersonal Dependency Inventory (Hirschfeld), MMPI-2, and some additional scales. For most dimensions, repeat attempters, both past and recent, but more specifically the recent repeaters, had a more severe psychological profile compared to the other suicide attempters.

ID MORTALITY; DEATH
AB Background: National suicide data are an underestimation of the actual number of suicides but are often assumed to be reliable and useful for scientific research. The aim of this study is to contribute to the discussion of the reliability of suicide mortality data by comparing railway suicides from two data sources.
   Methods: Data for the railway suicides and the concurrent causes of death of fifteen European countries were collected from the European Detailed Mortality Database and the European Railway Agency (ERA). Suicide rates, odds ratios and confidence intervals were calculated.
   Results: The suicide data from the ERA were significantly higher than the national data for six out of fifteen countries. In three countries, the ERA registered significantly more railway suicides compared to the sum of the national suicides and undetermined deaths. In Italy and France, the ERA statistics recorded significantly more railway related fatalities than the national statistical offices. In total the ERA statistics registered 34% more suicides and 9% more railway fatalities compared with the national statistics.
   Limitations: The findings of this study concern railway suicides and they cannot be extrapolated to all types of suicides. Further, the national suicide statistics and the ERA data are not perfectly comparable, due to the different categorisations of the causes of death.
   Conclusions: Based on the data for railway suicides, it seems that the underestimation of suicide rates is significant for some countries, and that the degree of underestimation differs substantially among countries. Caution is needed when comparing national suicide rates. There is a need for standardisation of national death registration procedures at the European level. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB A previous study by Nock et al. (2010) suggested that people's implicit identification with "death" or "suicide" can accurately predict whether they will attempt suicide several months in advance. We report the first direct and independent replication of this promising finding. Participants were 165 patients seeking treatment at a psychiatric unit in France. At baseline, patients completed the Suicide-Implicit Association Test (S-IAT), a semistructured interview, and a self-report measure of suicide ideation. Six months later, we contacted participants by phone and examined their hospital medical records to determine whether they had made a new suicide attempt. Results showed that the S-IAT did not distinguish between patients who were admitted to the hospital following suicide attempts and those who were admitted for other reasons. As in the original study, however, the S-IAT predicted suicide attempts within the 6-month follow-up period beyond well-known predictors. The test correctly classified 85% of patients (95% confidence interval = [76.91, 91.53]), supporting its diagnostic value for identifying who will make a suicide attempt.

DE RISK-TAKING; SUICIDE; SUICIDE ATTEMPTED; ADOLESCENT
AB In France, suicide is the second cause of death among young people. Each year; 550 people under 25 years of age take their own lives, and at least 40 000 attempt suicide. One in three young people who attempt suicide relapse during the following year. A related concern is at-risk behavior; particular on the roads (vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death among young people). Death by suicide is three times more frequent among boys than girls, because of differences in the methods used (hanging or gunshot, in seven out of ten cases), whereas attempted suicide is three times more frequent among girls than boys and involves drug overdose in nine out of ten cases. Better screening of young people at risk is urgently required. The author proposes easily recognizable risk factors that he and Marie Choquet (Inserm) identified through a study conducted in schools. These factors are not always recognized by professionals who deal with adolescents. Regarding hospital management, the author advocates a well-defined assessment period to determine the reasons for the crisis; interposed between the initial evaluation and the choice of the most appropriate therapeutic option.

AB Prevention of suicide is a public health priority in France. Indicators of suicide mortality have been widely used to describe epidemiological situations or to evaluate public health actions. It is therefore essential to examine the quality of suicide mortality data. The purpose of this work was to identify potential biases affecting the quality of such data and their comparability between different countries as well as to determine how they can affect conclusions. Potential biases were identified by studying the characteristics of the death certificate system and analyzing the international literature on data quality. The impact of biases was assessed by analyzing the causes of "concurrent" death with suicide in the official statistics (trauma and poisoning caused in an undetermined way concerning intention and unknown causes). The proportion of suicides listed as "concurrent" causes of death, estimated from specific surveys was extrapolated to official data. This method was also used to correct the international data. Practices concerning death certificates for violent deaths vary considerably from one country to another: type of certifying physician, frequency of medicolegal investigations, frequency of autopsies, suicide definition criteria, confidentiality regulations, religious and culture context. These practical differences lead to variability in undetermined and unknown causes. The corrections made on the mortality data after taking into account for these potential biases showed that the rate of suicide determined from official data is considerably underestimated, but that sociodemographic and geographic factors of suicide change little after correction. Likewise, the order by country was similar after taking into consideration concurrent causes. A reliable evaluation of the rate of suicide for a given country is of course important. However, it is possible to characterize populations at risk and analyze the determinants of suicidal behavior without necessarily recording all suicides, as long as the declaration bias is stable. Statistical analysis of death by suicide in France shows that, despite under-reporting, the principal sociodemographic and geographic features and trends over time can be considered as valid. A series of recommendations is proposed however to improve data quality and homogeneity for death certificate reporting. Designing operational criteria for deciding when to declare suicide as the cause of death would be helpful to guide physicians who report deaths. Classical autopsies could be completed by "psychological autopsies" with friends and family of the deceased. The death certificate form could be improved to include items for complementary information favoring or not suicide.

DE Economics; Occupational health
AB Workplace suicide has become an urgent social concern internationally with rising numbers of employees choosing to kill themselves in the face of extreme pressures at work. Yet, research on this phenomenon is hampered by fragmentary statistical data and the sheer contentiousness of this issue. This paper presents the preliminary findings of a research project on workplace suicides in France, where there has been a suicide epidemic' across a wide range of companies. I draw on an analysis of suicide letters linked to 23 suicide cases across three French companies during the period 2005-2015. My methodological approach is informed by the work of suicide sociologist, Jack D Douglas, who emphasised the importance of narrative, testimony and voice to our understanding of the causes of suicide. Douglas argued that an analysis of the social meanings' of suicide should start with a consideration of the motivations attributed to self-killing by suicidal individuals themselves and those close to them. Why does work or conditions of work push some individuals to take their own lives? What can the suicide voices' articulated in recent testimonies tell us about the causes of workplace suicide? In this paper, I treat suicide letters as a unique mode of testimony that can reveal some of the profound effects of workplace transformations on subjective, intimate and lived experiences of work. By examining French suicide testimonies, my aim is to deepen our understanding of the nature and causes of suicide in today's globalised workplaces.

AB Previous research has shown for the most part positive correlations between intelligence and suicide prevalence on the national level. However, this study found proxies for regional intelligence in Australia (international average domain scores from the PISA 2000 study) to be significantly negatively correlated with the total, male, and female suicide rates of the different administrative divisions of Australia, and this finding was independent of regional wealth. A research synthesis of the current results and those from similar studies of other countries (positive correlations for Austria, Belarus, The British Isles, Denmark, and The Netherlands; inconclusive findings for France, Germany, and the USA) was conducted. This synthesis of research findings showed that positive ecological correlations of intelligence with suicide rate were more likely observed for nations with higher suicide rates and poorer general living conditions, whereas there was no relation with national IQ.

TI Suicide as Protest in the French Workplace
SO MODERN & CONTEMPORARY FRANCE
LA English
DT Article
AB France has experienced a sharp rise in work-related suicides in the 2000s with unprecedented numbers of workers choosing to kill themselves in the face of severe pressures at work. Drawing on testimonial material linked to recent suicide cases, this article examines the social meanings' of these suicides as defined by suicidal individuals themselves. Suicide and its causes have long been a central preoccupation of French theorists since Emile Durkheim's Le Suicide (1897). Recent suicides share a communicative, expressive and vindictive purpose and seem to contradict Durkheim's classic sociological definition of suicide. In a context of deteriorating working conditions and a collapse of collective forms of mobilisation, recent suicides may represent a new and extreme form of protest. Depuis les annees 2000, le suicide lie au travail connait une forte augmentation avec un nombre sans precedent de salaries choisissant de se donner la mort face aux extremes pressions subies au travail. S'appuyant sur des temoignages lies a des cas recents de suicide, cet article s'attachera a analyser la i signification sociale E de ces suicides, tels qu'ils sont definis par ces individus suicidaires eux-memes. Apres la publication de Le Suicide de Durkheim en 1897, le suicide et ses causes ont longtemps ete au cOEur des preoccupations de theoriciens francais. noter que les recents cas de suicide ont en commun d'etre un moyen de communication et d'expression et sont a caractere vindicatif; ce qui semble refuter la definition sociologique classique du suicide donnee par Durkheim. Dans un contexte de degradation des conditions de travail et de la disparition de formes collectives de mobilisation, les recents suicides pourraient symboliser une forme nouvelle et extreme de protestation.

AB According to de Catanzaro's ( 1981) evolutionary theory of human suicide, a threshold intelligence is necessary for suicidality. A corollary deducible from this assertion is that intelligence and suicide mortality should be positively related. The present study tested de Catanzaro's corollary within a country. Using district-level IQ data of the entire non-institutionalized Austrian male year-of-birth cohort of 1969 who survived up to compulsory military conscription, including IQ testing in 1987 (n = 55474), the subsequent ( 1987 - 2001) district-level cohort loss due to suicide mortality was investigated. Across 99 Austrian districts, the regional IQ was weakly but statistically significantly, positively related to the regional standardized suicide rate as well as to the regional percentage of mortality due to suicide in this very cohort, when these relations were controlled for likely confounders ( male divorce and unemployment rates and male net income), but not statistically reliable without these controls. It is argued that the most parsimonious interpretation of these aggregate-level findings remains that intelligence level and suicide mortality are positively related.

AB The risk of suicide behaviors in immigrant adolescents varies across countries and remains partly understood. We conducted a study in France to examine immigrant adolescents' likelihood of experiencing suicide ideation in the last 12 months (SI) and lifetime suicide attempts (SA) compared with their native counterparts, and the contribution of socioeconomic factors and school, behavior, and health-related difficulties. Questionnaires were completed by 1559 middle-school adolescents from north-eastern France including various risk factors, SI, SA, and their first occurrence over adolescent's life course (except SI). Data were analyzed using logistic regression models for SI and Cox regression models for SA (retaining only school, behavior, and health-related difficulties that started before SA). Immigrant adolescents had a two-time higher risk of SI and SA than their native counterparts. Using nested models, the excess SI risk was highly explained by socioeconomic factors (27%) and additional school, behavior, and health-related difficulties (24%) but remained significant. The excess SA risk was more highly explained by these issues (40% and 85%, respectively) and became non-significant. These findings demonstrate the risk patterns of SI and SA and the prominent confounding roles of socioeconomic factors and school, behavior, and health-related difficulties. They may be provided to policy makers, schools, carers, and various organizations interested in immigrant, adolescent, and suicide-behavior problems.

AB It has been suggested that Black people show lower suicidality than White people. The few conflicting studies estimating lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts in Caribbean populations were mainly carried out in the UK and the USA. Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts among the French Caribbean general population still living in the West Indies. As part of an international epidemiological multicenter study under the authority of the World Health Organization French Collaborating Centre, we interviewed 887 individuals selected from the general population in the Caribbean island of Martinique, using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Among the interviewed individuals, 4.4% (N=39) reported having attempted suicide. Younger age, lifetime diagnoses of major mood disorder, panic disorder and alcohol dependence were all associated with a lifetime history of suicide attempts. Lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts among the French Caribbean general population was almost half as much as that measured in continental France. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Background and objective.-Suicide is a public health problem worldwide. The objective of this study is to analyse the prevalence and risk factors of suicide related outcomes (ideation, plan and attempt) using data from the ESEMeD-France project.
   Subjects and method.-This is a face-to-face household survey carried out in a probability representative sample of the adult general population of France. A total of 6796 subjects were interviewed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) developed framework of the World Mental Health Survey Initiative. Based on evidence that reports of such potentially embarrassing behaviour are higher in self-administered than interviewer-administered surveys, these questions were printed in a self-administered booklet and referred to by letter.
   Results.-Lifetime prevalence of suicide ideation, plan and attempts were 12.4, 4.4 and 3.4% respectively. Risk of suicide-related outcomes was significantly higher among women and younger cohorts. Having a mental disorder was associated with an increased risk, especially in the case of psychiatric comorbidity. Mental disorders that are associated with an increase in suicidal attempts are anxiety disorders (except social phobia), major depressive episodes, oppositional defiant disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders. The suicidal risk notably increases in conjunction with multiple mental disorders. In this study, employment and marital status do not appear to be a risk factor for suicidal behaviour.
   Conclusions.-The prevalence of suicide-related outcomes is high when compared with other countries. Results identified groups with higher risk (women, young, subjects with a mental disorder and having a plan) in which suicide prevention could to be targeted. The results of this study suggest that to improve suicide prevention strategies it is necessary to perform an in-depth clinical evaluation of suicidal ideas and projects, and identify precisely psychiatric comorbidity to allow a more efficient treatment.

AB This study seeks to establish whether medico-legal practitioners differ in their autopsy conclusions within and across medico-legal institutions. Data include 459 violent deaths (homicides, suicides, and accidents) autopsy reports written by more than 20 death certifiers from four medico-legal institutions in two countries (France and the United States). Multinomial models show that compared with accidental deaths, weapon use and decedents' characteristics both influence a homicide verdict, but not a suicide one. In addition, French practitioners are more likely than Americans to reach a conclusion of homicide or suicide compared with accident, and homicides are more likely to be certified by male practitioners.

AB Background: In spite of the high prevalence of suicide behaviours and the magnitude of the resultant burden, little is known about why individuals reattempt. We aim to investigate the relationships between clinical risk factors and the repetition of suicidal attempts.
   Methods: 1349 suicide attempters were consecutively recruited in the Emergency Room (ER) of two academic hospitals in France and Spain. Patients were extensively assessed and demographic and clinical data obtained. Data mining was used to determine the minimal number of variables that blinded the rest in relation to the number of suicide attempts. Using this set, a probabilistic graph ranking relationships with the target variable was constructed.
   Results: The most common diagnoses among suicide attempters were affective disorders, followed by anxiety disorders. Risk of frequent suicide attempt was highest among middle-aged subjects, and diminished progressively with advancing age of onset at first attempt. Anxiety disorders significantly increased the risk of presenting frequent suicide attempts. Pathway analysis also indicated that frequent suicide attempts were linked to greater odds for alcohol and substance abuse disorders and more intensive treatment.
   Conclusions: Novel statistical methods found several clinical features that were associated with a history of frequent suicide attempts. The identified pathways may promote new hypothesis-driven studies of suicide attempts and preventive strategies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Suicides account for more than 30,000 deaths per year in the US alone. Suicide rates change over time, and the factors influencing them remain poorly understood. Economic factors, in particular unemployment, have been suggested as a major influence. However, the evidence for this has been inconsistent, which may be partly explained by shortcomings of the statistical methods used.
   Time series analytical techniques (unit root and co-integration tests) were applied to test the associations over time between economic factors, i.e. unemployment, real gross domestic product per capita (RGDP) and the consumer price index (CPI) and death rates by suicide as collected by national agencies in the UK (1901-2006), US (1900-1997), France (1970-2004) and Italy (1970-2001). Traditional correlation analyses were used when appropriate.
   Co-integration and correlation tests showed a long-run association between economic factors and suicide rates. Increase/decrease of unemployment predicted an increase/decrease of suicide rates over long historical periods and in different nations. RGDP and the CPI were also linked with suicide rates, but this was not consistently so and the direction of the association varied.
   Unemployment is a major factor influencing suicide rates over long periods of time and in different national contexts. It needs to be considered as a confounding factor in evaluations of suicide prevention strategies.

AB Suicide, a serious crime once subject to the death penalty during the period of New France, is now seen as a societal problem rather than as an individual misdeed. In this sense, suicide is a perfect example of the reversal of a social and legal response to a behaviour that had for centuries, however, been considered deviant. In order to understand the various social stakeholders' change of attitudes and reactions toward suicide and suicide victims for Quebec society as a whole, an empirical database addressing most cases of suicide over a long period of history must be examined. This is exactly what we plan to do in coming years in the course of our project "Du crime de lese-majeste a 'probleme de societe': revolution de la reaction sociale a l'egard du suicide an Quebec de 1763 a 2000", which will involve identifying and analyzing all cases of suicide contained in the Coroner's Archives held by Bibliotheque et Archives nationales du Quebec (BANQ) for the period 1763 to 2000. This research note is designed to outline our archival process and illustrate through a few typical cases of suicide the richness of our material, To do this, we have opted to focus on the suicide notes found in the thousands of files examined to date.

AB We examined the differences in the suicide. characteristics between areas directly and indirectly affected by war activities and in war and post-war periods according to the following variables: suicide rate, sex, age and method of suicide. Analysis was done on 5349 suicides committed in the period 1993-1998 (war and post-war years). The suicide rates in the Republic of Croatia oscillated in the pre-war, war and post-war periods (1985-2000) but without significant differences. In the areas directly affected by war, the suicide rate was significantly lower than in other areas during the study period 1993-1998 (chi-square = 10.3245; P = 0.0017). The number of suicides in both sexes declined in the areas directly affected by war-more in men than in women; the difference between sexes was statistically significant (chi-square = 3.6697; P = 0,055). Middle- and old-aged people were the population with high suicide risk in both areas (t = 1.76; P = 0.078). There were significant differences in the methods of suicides between war and non-war areas (chi-square = 108.8473; P = 0.001). Firearms or explosive devices were the methods used more significantly for suicides in the areas directly affected by war than in other areas, whereas hanging was more frequently used in the areas indirectly affected by war.

AB In France, one adolescent out of ten has already attempted suicide. In this population, suicide reattempts are frequent and significantly impact the vital, morbid and functional long-term prognosis. For about fifteen years, surveillance and brief contact intervention systems (SBCIS) have been used to complete the French suicide reattempt prevention arsenal for youth. The relevance of such strategy appears once the mental health service gap observed at this period of life is considered. In addition to prompting better coordination between the different professional stakeholders, the SBCIS help to alleviate the adolescent's help-seeking barriers, especially the ambivalence between conquest of autonomy and need for help. The first results from the French SBCIS dedicated to children and adolescents are encouraging. Although they have to deal with specific challenges, we argue that they relevantly complement and potentiate the already available prevention resources, thus optimizing the whole prevention system for suffering youth.

ID DELIBERATE SELF-HARM
AB Objectives - To investigate the impact of the reorganization of psychiatric core in the Accident and Emergency (A&E) unit on repeated suicide attempts.
   Method - The study includes suicide attempters admitted to the Rennes University Hospital (Brittany, France) A&E unit in 1994 (n=1003) and 2000 (n=1018). We compared the clinical data (age, gender marital Status, suicide history methods, and outcome at discharge from A&E) and psychiatric management of the two cohorts. The rote of repeated suicide attempts was measured according to the some criterion in 1994 and 2000 (re-admission to the A&E unit).
   Results - Both populations of suicide attempters were very similar from both a clinical and demographic point of view The repetition rote at 1 month was significantly higher (OR=4.16, p=0.0001) in 1994 than in 2000. The difference between the cohorts continued at three and six months, but become statistically insignificant at one year.
   Conclusion - By 2000, organization of psychiatric core in the A&E unit had been substantially strengthened. The presence of a complete psychiatric team (nurses, junior psychiatrist, and senior psychiatrist) in the A&E unit, 24 hours a day seven days a week, was associated with a lower rote of repeated suicide attempts.

ID PARADOX
AB Case studies of prison policy in France and Belgium contrast sharply. Following the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights ('ECHR') against France for the lack of healthcare for prisoners, the lack of suicide-prevention measures and generally poor conditions of detention, and the integration of ECHR case-law into French law by the 'Council of State' (France's highest administrative court), France has developed a policy for suicide prevention in custody, partially renovated its prisons and implemented major reform of its medical and psychiatric care of prisoners. The ECHR's judgments were influenced by complaints made by very active French human-rights pressure groups to the ECHR. The French situation is therefore characterised by interactions between the European and national regulatory bodies, in contrast to the situation in Belgium, where the Conseil d',tat has exerted only limited control over Belgian prisons, as it has, to date, not incorpated ECHR case-law into Belgian law [1]. In addition, the absence of effective domestic regulation of prisons in Belgium can be explained by the Belgian government's failure to ratify the United Nations' Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture ('OPCAT') and to establish an independent body to prevent torture. This means that the only effective regulation of Belgian prisons is by the United Nations and the Council of Europe, in particular the ECHR, the Committee of Ministers and the Committee for the Prevention of Torture ('CPT'), which have extended the scope of their supervision to cover suicide prevention, physical and mental healthcare, overcrowding and domestic legal remedies for prisoners. In response, Belgium has only occasionally complied with ECHR case-law, especially in the field of domestic legal remedies available to prisoners.

AB Suicide is the eighth cause of mortality in France and the leading cause in people aged between 25 and 34 years. The most common methods of suicide are hanging, self-poisoning with medicines and firearms. Postmortem computed tomography (CT) is a useful adjunct to autopsy to confirm suicide and exclude other causes of death. At autopsy, fractures of the hyoid bone or thyroid cartilage, or both, are found in more than 50% of suicidal hangings. Cervical vertebra fractures are rare and only seen in suicide victims jumping from a great height. Three-dimensional reconstructions from CT data are useful to visualize the ligature mark on the neck. In suicides by firearm, postmortem CT shows entry and exit wounds, parenchymal lesions along the bullet path, as well as projectiles in case of penetrating trauma. However, in the chest and abdomen it is more difficult to identify the path of the projectile. Postmortem CT also shows specific features of suicide by drowning or stabbing, but its use is limited in cases of self-poisoning. The use of postmortem CT is also limited by decomposition and change of body position. This article presents the imaging features seen on postmortem CT according to the method of suicide.

   mortality
ID MENTAL-HEALTH; QUEENSLAND; MORTALITY; ENGLAND; WALES; INDIA
AB Numerous studies have found agricultural workers, including farmers, at elevated risk of suicide, and socioeconomic conditions have been suggested as one of the important determinants of this mortality cause. The real agricultural income per worker in Europe increased steadily from 2005 to 2007 and then fell by 1.8% in 2008 and by 11.6% in 2009. This drop was particularly pronounced in France. Repeated cross-sectional studies were conducted to investigate suicide mortality rates among French farmers in 2007-2009. The study population included all French farmers enrolled yearly in the compulsory Agricultural Social Security and Health Insurance (CCMSA). Most of the mean of 500,164 subjects per year were men (68%). National cause-specific mortality rates were used to calculate standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for both genders and for each of the 3 years. During the 3-year study period, 2,769 men and 997 women died. Suicide accounted for 417 of the men's (15%) and 68 of the women's (6.8%) deaths. Hanging was the most frequent method of suicide for both. Compared with the general population, the increased rate of suicide deaths among male farmers was 28% in 2008 and 22% in 2009. This increased rate was particularly high among those aged 45-54 years (31%) and 55-64 years (47%) in 2008 (and in the 55-64-year-old group in 2009 (64%). Two specific types of farming activity were associated with increased suicide mortality rates in both 2008 and 2009: dairy cattle farming (SMR = 1.56 [95% CI: 1.09-2.15] and SMR=1.47 [95% CI: 1.01-2.04]) and beef cattle farming (SMR = 2.27 [95% CI: 1.59-3.10] and SMR = 1.57 [95% CI: 1.01-2.27]). These results may be useful for a better understanding of the situation from an epidemiological standpoint and for improving suicide prevention policies in this particular population.

It is most of the fine impossible to be sure of the cause of the death without an autopsy. In case of maltreated children, only the autopsy can confirm that the death is in relation ship with au shaking child syndrom.

The effects observed in these ecological (group-level) analyses were of small size, with correlation coefficients ranging from .05 to .25, thus mostly falling below the nominal statistical significance level.

AB Background The suicide rate is a macro indicator of the population's psychosocial wellbeing and an evaluation criterion of the effectiveness of suicide prevention strategies. A high level of injury deaths of undetermined intent (UD) is usually discussed in connection with the validity of suicide statistics. An effort is made to develop a criterion to characterise the quality of suicide statistics.
   Methods Standardised rates of suicides (X60-X84) and UD (Y10-Y34) by the International Classification of Disease version 10 as an average for the past five available years were taken from the WHO European mortality database. Rate ratios were computed by dividing rates of UD by suicide rates.
   Results There is considerable variation in suicide and UD rates among countries. The highest overall rates of UD were registered in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, and the lowest in Greece, Spain and Italy. The EU-15 average UD rate of 1.97 and the rate ratio of 0.194 UD to suicides were combined into a '2-20 benchmark', in which the primary indicator is 2.0 UD cases per 100 000 and the secondary indicator is the proportion of UD to suicides 0.20 (20%), which enables countries to be clustered according to the quality of suicide statistics. The following countries satisfied the benchmark: Greece, Norway, Spain, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Austria, Italy, Romania, Hungary, Ireland and Finland.
   Conclusion This study used the developed '2-20 benchmark' in Europe to assess suicide registration quality in a particular country, to compare the relative position of countries, and to set a target for those European countries that have not yet achieved the benchmark.

AB Birth cohort effects in suicide rates are well established, but to date there is no methodological approach or framework to test the temporal stability of these effects. We use the APC-Detrended (APCD) model to robustly estimate intensity of cohort effects identifying non-linear trends (or 'detrended' fluctuations) in suicide rates. The new APC-Hysteresis (APCH) model tests temporal stability of cohort effects. Analysing suicide rates in 25 WHO countries (periods 1970-74 to 2005-09; ages 20-24 to 70-79) with the APCD method, we find that country-specific birth cohort membership plays an important role in suicide rates. Among 25 countries, we detect 12 nations that show deep contrasts among cohort-specific suicide rates including Italy, Australia and the United States. The APCH method shows that cohort fluctuations are not stable across the life course but decline in Spain, France and Australia, whereas they remain stable in Italy, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. We discuss the Spanish case with elevated suicide mortality of cohorts born 1965-1975 which declines with age, and the opposite case of the United States, where the identified cohort effects of those born around 1960 increase smoothly, but statistically significant across the life course.

DE industrial accidents; work health and safety; suicide; psychological
   harassment / sexual harassment in the workplace
AB The work-related suicide is a new phenomenon and also an important warning sign in terms of work health and safety. In such cases, the employer's liability cannot be of a criminal nature, given the "moral harassment" or "manslaughter" offences, but consideration should be given to investigating a possible negligence on the part of the employer, which may have caused the suicidal act whose victim his/her employee was. Thus, the employer must be aware of the danger to which his/her employees are subjected and take appropriate preventive measures, i.e. such measures to protect the employees from the risks they face during work. Situations of psychological or sexual harassment in the workplace are likely to result in a state of depression, which may lead to a suicidal act. These are the main elements that led to the qualification of suicide as a work-related accident in many European countries, such as France. In Romania, however, current legislation excludes any intentional self-harming, self-mutilation or suicide from the notion of work-related accidents.
   The purpose of this paper is to analyse and outline the conditions where the suicide of an employee in the workplace or outside of it may be recognized as a industrial accident. Over time, the caselaw in many European states has evolved to include the suicide or the attempted suicide occurring in the workplace or outside of during the performance of a work contract to be work-related as well. We believe that it is enough for the suicide or the attempted suicide to be work-related in order to be considered an industrial accident. Evidently, suicides in the workplace that are not related to the professional situation cannot be treated as industrial accidents.

DT Article
ID ECONOMIC-CRISIS; FINANCIAL CRISIS; TIME TREND; RECESSION; HEALTH; RATES;

AB Background A scientific debate is currently taking place on whether the 2008 economic crisis caused an increase in suicide rates. Our main objective was to assess the impact of unemployment rate on suicide rate in Western European countries between 2000 and 2010. We then tried to estimate the excess number of suicides attributable to the increase of unemployment during the 2008-2010 economic crisis.
   Methods The yearly suicide rates were modelled using a quasi-Poisson model, controlling for sex, age, country and a linear time trend. For each country, the unemployment-suicide association was assessed, and the excess number of suicides attributable to the increase of unemployment was estimated. Sensitivity analyses were performed, notably in order to evaluate whether the unemployment-suicide association found was biased by a confounding context effect ('crisis effect').
   Results A significant 0.3% overall increase in suicide rate for a 10% increase in unemployment rate (95% CI 0.1% to 0.5%) was highlighted. This association was significant in three countries: 0.7% (95% CI 0.0% to 1.4%) in the Netherlands, 1.0% (95% CI 0.2% to 1.8%) in the UK and 1.9% (95% CI 0.8% to 2.9%) in France, with a significant excess number of suicides attributable to unemployment variations between 2008 and 2010 (respectively 57, 456 and 564). The association was modified inconsistently when adding a 'crisis effect' into the model.
   Conclusions Unemployment and suicide rates are globally statistically associated in the investigated countries. However, this association is weak, and its amplitude and sensitivity to the 'crisis effect' vary across countries. This inconsistency provides arguments against its causal interpretation.

ID MILITARY; PREVENTION; CONSCRIPTS; SOLDIERS; SMOKING; STRESS
AB Several states, of whom France, have been alarmed about suicide in the military. An observational longitudinal cohort study was conducted to check whether the suicide risk in the French army was higher than in the general population and to find out the more prone to self-harm destruction personnel categories. From 1997 to 2000 inclusive, 230 suicides occurred among 315,934 person. years; i.e., the overall annual crude suicide rate was 18.2 per 100,000 active-duty personnel. With the National data for 1999 as reference, army men had a lower suicide risk than men in the overall population of similar age categories ( standardised mortality ratio = 67). A Poisson regression model showed that the incidence rate in the Gendarmerie was twice as high as in the Land Forces ( incidence rate ratio = 2.15), that the incidence relative risk increased threefold over 4 years, and that the incidence rate ratio amongst under 25 and from 40 to 44-year-old personnel was almost twice as high as in the 25-29-year-old category. The main suicide methods were use of a. rearm (51%) and hanging (28%). Despite a global lower risk than in the general population, certain army categories, i.e., Gendarmerie personnel and young men, deserve specific surveillance and preventive measures.

AB Objectives. - The current study aims to identify the factors associated with the use of psychotherapy among adults with a history of suicide attempt.
   Methods. - A large cross-sectional survey (N = 22,138) was conducted in four regions of France to characterize mental health care needs in the general population. Data were collected between April and June 2005 by trained interviewers using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing system (CATI). Sociodemographics, past-year mental disorders, lifetime and 12-month history of suicide attempts, and use of psychotherapy were assessed.
   Results. - Overall, 7.1% of adults reported having undergone psychotherapy in the course of their life, and 2.0% in the previous 12 months. While 8.3% of adults with a lifetime suicide attempt (prior to the previous 12 months) underwent a psychotherapy in the previous 12 months, 27.5% of adults with a past-year suicide attempt underwent a psychotherapy in the previous 12 months. Psychotherapy was provided by psychiatrists (49.5%), psychologists (28.2%), and psychoanalysts (10.6%). While the frequency of psychotherapy sessions was greater among those with a prior attempt as compared to those with no prior attempt [Chi(2) (10) = 21.35, P = .019], there was no difference in therapy duration [Chi(2) (8) = 6.71, P = .568]. Compared to adults who did not report a prior attempt, those with a prior suicide attempt were 3,3 more likely to undergo psychotherapy with a psychologist [AOR = 3.31 (2.54-4.31)]. Among adults with a prior suicide attempt, increased odds of undergoing a psychotherapy in the course of their life was predicted by higher education [AOR = 2.81 (1.56-5.06)], living in the Paris region [AOR = 2.06 (1.32-3.23)], and being a woman [AOR = 1.50 (1.08-2.09)]. Increased odds of undergoing a psychotherapy in the previous 12 months was predicted by a major depressive disorder [AOR = 2.59 (1.57-4.27)], any anxiety disorder [AOR = 1.79 (1.07-2.97)], higher education [AOR = 3.60 (1.29-10.0)], living in a city of 20,000 to 100,000 inhabitants [AOR = 2.71 (1.13-6.50)] and more [AOR = 2.50 (1.12-5.57)] (outside of the Paris region), a 2000 to 3000 euros monthly income [AOR = 2.37 (1.15-4.85)].
   Discussion. - One third of adults with a lifetime suicide attempt and close to half of those with a past-year attempt have received some form of psychotherapy in the course of their life. In line with prior work, higher education and income level predicted past-year use of psychotherapy among adults with a prior suicide attempt. These findings highlight the association between major depressive disorder or anxiety disorders and increased odds of undergoing psychotherapy in the previous 12 months among adults with prior attempt. While pharmacological treatment, inpatient hospitalizations for mental health problems, visits with a general practitioner or specialized physician are free of charge in France, psychotherapy provided by psychologists or psychotherapists is currently not covered by the French Social Security health care system. As the treatment of mental disorders plays an important role in the reduction of suicide risk, supporting evidence-based psychotherapy through its reimbursement appears to be an important public health issue.

DE demographic statistics; mortality; bias; health status indicators;

AB Mortality rates are an important source of data for French public health observatories. These data are exhaustive, permanent, and available at various geographical levels. Nevertheless, the data are biased to some extent, namely due to the lack of a detailed description of the cause of death on the death certificate, and the causes of death are not systematically recorded when a forensic investigation has been carried out ("unknown causes"). This generates in particular an underestimation of suicide mortality in France. We studied these biases in south-eastern France for the five-year period 1995-1999, and the evolution of them between 1988-1992 and 1995-1999. In comparison with the national level statistics, deaths with an imprecise cause were more frequently recorded in south-eastern France (+30%) as was for those whose cause was unknown or non-declared (+100% in the most eastern part of the area). Thus, indicators of suicide mortality should be interpreted with caution, and compared and considered in relationship to the rate of deaths linked to an "unknown" cause. The article includes a discussion of the extent to which the transfer of data from institutes of forensic medicine to the French epidemiological centre of the medical causes of death (Inserm CepiDC), and physicians' practices play a role.

TI Suicide
SO PRESSE MEDICALE

DT Article
AB Brief history The definition of suicide differs depending on the era, author or theory. Society's attitude has varied throughout history. When psychiatry appeared in the nineteenth century it medicalized the problem. First with Esquirol in 1838, followed by Delmas in 1932. Whereas Durkheim, with his theory of anomia in 1897, defended the sociological position presented in the form of a law: the percentage of suicides increases in inverse proportion to the social integration of the individual and one should not forget Halbwachs (1930) in this debate. Re-medicalization was mainly due to Deshaies in 1947, who dismissed the excessiveness of these two trends, while remaining open to them. According to his theory, "suicidal equivalences" should also be taken into account, even if the individual's death wish is subconscious.
   Contribution of the psychoanalytical theory This contribution is considerable and has gone through several stages. Currently, psychoanalysts accept the influence of extrinsic factors in suicidal behavior. This is the case, for example, for the pre-morbid states or the initiating factors, the importance of which are no longer denied and which favor regression and destruction of the personality and resulting in suicidal behavior.
   Does a clinical profile exist ? Fifteen percent of depressive patients commit suicide. With regard to the act itself, it is far more dangerous and violent in the elderly than in young adults. The suicide rate of elderly people is 2-fold greater than that of the general population. Suicidal equivalents consist in letting oneself die, because of the loss in will to fight that characterizes the classical syndrome of this attitude,
   Epidemiological data In France there are around 12 000 suicidal deaths per year among 150 000 suicide attempts, i.e., I attempt every 4 minutes and 1 suicide every 40 minutes. This corresponds to a raw mortality rate of 20 out of 100 000 inhabitants. However, epidemiologists consider that these figures are underestimated by around 20%. Since 1983, they exceed the mortality rate caused by road accidents (8 000/year in France).
   Misinterpreted depression Most suicides result from depression that was not recognized and treated as such. Clinical intuition is essential. It is the risk of suicide that renders the diagnosis of depression urgent. Retrospective surveys show that 50% of individuals having attempted suicide had consulted a doctor the month preceding their act. it is therefore important to organize the prevention of such risks. When depressive patients do not express any suicidal tendency it is essential to raise the subject. in most cases, verbalization relieves the patients. However the eventual hospitalization of such patients should always be bourn in mind.

AB In France, the majority of known suicide attempts are handled by general emergency departments. Almost a quarter of these patients are re-hospitalized for the same reason less than four years after their first admission. Given that a history of previous attempts is one of the most predictive elements of a future suicide, this article attempts to understand why general emergency departments cannot better contain this risk. Based on the ethnographic observation of three services, this study highlights a series of factors both internal and external to emergency departments. In particular, it shows how services' priorities for intervention, the conditions of exchanges with patients, and emergency departments' categorization of the suicidal crisis contribute to a treatment that greatly differs from medical recommendations.

ID CARE; ILL
AB Our aim was to understand better how people judge the acceptability of physician-assisted suicide (PAS). We found that, for people in France of all ages and for elderly people with life-threatening illnesses, acceptability is an additive combination of the number of requests for PAS, the patient's age, the amount of physical suffering, and the degree of curability of the illness, not only when judging for hypothetical patients, but also for their spouses and for themselves. PAS can be highly acceptable to people even when the patient does not satisfy all the criteria of legislation about PAS.

DE crime; France; Paris; police; press; Jean-Baptiste Rousseau; suicide
AB As he explained in his suicide note, abbe Jean-Baptiste Rousseau could not marry and would not seduce the young woman he loved, so he shot himself on 18 May 1784. Witnesses deposed by the police claimed that he was not in his right mind and therefore not legally responsible for his actions, but the authors of contemporary reports about the case accepted his lucid account of his dilemma. Nouvellistes and journalists provided multiple versions of his note and multiple judgments of his motives, options, and actions. This analysis of the sources from 1784 and the following years shows how they reworked the story of Rousseau's life and death against the background of larger issues. Changes in jurisprudence during the last decades of the ancien regime culminated in the decriminalization of suicide and other religious, moral, and sexual crimes in 1791. Debates about the causes and meanings of self-destruction continued, but in the press rather than the courts.

AB The aim of this study was to determine whether an expert system based on automated processing of electronic health records (EHRs) could provide a more accurate estimate of the annual rate of emergency department (ED) visits for suicide attempts in France, as compared to the current national surveillance system based on manual coding by emergency practitioners. A feasibility study was conducted at Lyon University Hospital, using data for all ED patient visits in 2012. After automatic data extraction and pre-processing, including automatic coding of medical free-text through use of the Unified Medical Language System, seven different machine-learning methods were used to classify the reasons for ED visits into suicide attempts versus other reasons. The performance of these different methods was compared by using the F-measure. In a test sample of 444 patients admitted to the ED in 2012 (98 suicide attempts, 48 cases of suicidal ideation, and 292 controls with no recorded non-fatal suicidal behaviour), the F-measure for automatic detection of suicide attempts ranged from 70.4% to 95.3%. The random forest and naive Bayes methods performed best. This study demonstrates that machine-learning methods can improve the quality of epidemiological indicators as compared to current national surveillance of suicide attempts.

ID SHAREHOLDER VALUE; MANAGEMENT; PERSPECTIVES
AB The privatization of France Telecom (FT) in 1997 led to the implementation of a profit-oriented financialization strategy. An unforgiving work environment was developed, which has unsettled many employees. Between February 2008 and October 2011, 69 employees took their own life. Many left notes blaming management for having privileged the interests of shareholders over those of employees. Through interviews with employees and professional practitioners associated with FT, we reveal that employees strongly resented the company's use of financialization policies to maximize shareholder value. Pursuit of such policies led to the de-institutionalization of socially prescribed norms that were applied commonly in Continental European workplaces. Feelings of anomie, disgrace, futility and isolation ensued among employees. This case highlights an important effect of a modern corporation's adoption of financialization policies. It points to the need to improve workplace sensitivities and the ethical dispositions of companies and their managers.

AB Background: Suicidal behaviour and deliberate self-harm are common among adults. Research indicates that maintaining contact either via letter or postcard with at-risk adults following discharge from care services can reduce reattempt risk. Feasibility trials demonstrated that intervention through text message was also effective in preventing suicide repetition amongst suicide attempters. The aim of the current study is to investigate the effect of text message intervention versus traditional treatment on reducing the risk of suicide attempt repetition among adults after self-harm.
   Methods/design: The study will be a 2-year multicentric randomized controlled trial conducted by the Brest University Hospital, France. Participants will be adults discharged after self-harm, from emergency services or after a short hospitalization. Participants will be recruited over a 12-month period. The intervention is comprised of an SMS that will be sent at h48, D7, D15 and monthly. The text message enquires about the patients' well-being and includes information regarding individual sources of help and evidence-based self help strategies. Participants will be assessed at the baseline, month 6 and 13. As primary endpoint, we will assess the number of patients who reattempt suicide in each group at 6 months. As secondary endpoints, we will assess the number of patients who reattempt suicide at 13 month, the number of suicide attempts in the intervention and control groups at 6 and 13 month, the number of death by suicide in the intervention and control groups at month 6 and 13. In both groups, suicidal ideations, will be assessed at the baseline, month 6 and 13. Medical costs and satisfaction will be assessed at month 13.
   Discussion: This paper describes the design and deployment of a trial SIAM; an easily reproducible intervention that aims to reduce suicide risk in adults after self-harm. It utilizes several characteristics of interventions that have shown a significant reduction in the number of suicide reattempts. We propose to assess its efficacy in reducing suicide reattempt in the suicide attempter (SA) population.

AB Background Prison suicide rates, rate ratios, and associations with prison-related factors need clarification and updating. We examined prison suicide rates in countries where reliable information was available, associations with a range of prison-service and health-service related factors, how these rates compared with the general population, and changes over the past decade.
   Methods We collected data for prison suicides in 24 high-income countries in Europe, Australasia, and North America from their prison administrations for 2011-14 to calculate suicide rates and rate ratios compared with the general population. We used meta-regression to test associations with general population suicide rates, incarceration rates, and prison-related factors (overcrowding, ratio of prisoners to prison officers or health-care staff or education staff, daily spend, turnover, and imprisonment duration). We also examined temporal trends.
   Findings 3906 prison suicides occurred during 2011-14 in the 24 high-income countries we studied. Where there was breakdown by sex (n=2810), 2607 (93%) were in men and 203 (7%) were in women. Nordic countries had the highest prison suicide rates of more than 100 suicides per 100 000 prisoners apart from Denmark (where it was 91 per 100 000), followed by western Europe where prison suicide rates in France and Belgium were more than 100 per 100 000 prisoners. Australasian and North American countries had rates ranging from 23 to 67 suicides per 100 000 prisoners. Rate ratios, or rates compared with those in the general population of the same sex and similar age, were typically higher than 3 in men and 9 in women. Higher incarceration rates were associated with lower prison suicide rates (b = -0 . 504, p = 0 . 014), which was attenuated when adjusting for prison-level variables. There were no associations between rates of prison suicide and general population suicide, any other tested prison-related factors, or differing criteria for defining suicide deaths. Changes in prison suicide rates over the past decade vary widely between countries.
   Interpretation Many countries in northern and western Europe have prison suicide rates of more than 100 per 100 000 prisoners per year. Individual-level information about prisoner health is required to understand the substantial variations reported and changes over time. Copyright (C) The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID SELF-INJURY; ADOLESCENTS; OXFORD
AB Suicide attempts (SA) in children are often considered rare and poorly studied. The aim of this study was to explore the clinical characteristics of SA in children under 12 years of age. A retrospective assessment was conducted in 30 consecutive SAs reported in children under 12 years of age admitted to the emergency department at the Robert-Debre University Hospital (Paris, France) from 2007 to 2010 and the Regional University Hospital (Besancon, France) from 2000 to 2008. All suicide attempters were directly assessed at the somatic and psychiatric level. Patients were 8-11 years old (mean, 10.2 +/- 0.8). The sex ratio was 0.9 boys for 1 girl. The leading SA methods were poisoning by medication (53.3%), hanging or strangulation (23.3%), jumping from a height (16.7%), poisoning by chemicals (3.3%), and lesions inflicted by sharp objects (3.3%). In addition, SAs were characterized by high lethality (43.7%) contrasting with their low to moderate suicidal intentionality (43.8% and 56.2%, respectively). In conclusion, we reported that SA in children differs from those of adolescents by their greater lethality related to the methods used, but contrasting with the low intentionality mentioned by these patients.

AB Historical and anthropological data suggest that skeletons excavated from an 11th to 15th century mass grave in Bondy, France, may be those of victims of the Great Plague. Using high-throughput real-time PCR investigation of the dental pulp collected from 14 teeth from five such skeletons, we detected Bartonella quintana DNA in three individuals and Yersinia pestis DNA in two individuals. DNA from five other deadly pathogens was not found. Suicide PCR genotyping confirmed Y. pestis DNA belonging to the Orientalis biotype. One individual had co-infection. These data suggest a plague epidemic in a population already infected by the body louse-transmitted B. quintana or a body louse-driven transmission of the plague that drove a medieval epidemic in inland Europe.

TI Effect of telephone contact on further suicide attempts in patients
   discharged from an emergency department: randomised controlled study
SO BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL

ID CONTROLLED INTERVENTION; MENTAL-DISORDERS; CONTROLLED TRIAL; FOLLOW-UP;
   CARE; INPATIENT
AB Objective To determine the effects over one year of contacting patients by telephone one month or three months after being discharged from an emergency department for deliberate self poisoning compared with usual treatment.
   Design Multicentre, randomised controlled trial.
   Setting 13 emergency departments in the north of France.
   Participants 605 people discharged from an emergency department after attempted suicide by deliberate self poisoning.
   Intervention The intervention consisted of contacting patients by telephone at one month or three months after discharge from an emergency department for attempted suicide to evaluate die success of recommended treatment or to adjust treatment. Control patients received treatment as usual, in most cases referral back to their general practitioner.
   Main outcome measures The primary outcome measures were proportion of participants who reattempted suicide, number of deaths by suicide, and losses to follow-up at 13 months' follow-up. Secondary outcome measures were types and number of contacts with health care.
   Results On an intention to treat basis, the three groups did not differ significantly for further suicide attempts, deaths by suicide, or losses to follow-up: contact at one month (intervention 23% (34/147) v controls 30% (93/312), difference 7%,95% confidence interval - 2% to 15% three months (25% (36/146) v 30%, difference 5%, - 4% to 14%). Participants contacted at one month were less likely at follow-up to report having reattempted suicide (12% v 22% in control group, difference 10%, 2% to 18%).
   Conclusion Contacting people by telephone one month after being discharged from an emergency department for deliberate self poisoning may help reduce the number of reattempted suicides over one year.

TI Emergency suicide care in France:: The psychiatrist's liability as seen
   in case law
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID SCALE
AB In France, in general emergency departments, psychiatric consultations are on the increase and suicidal behavior represents a frequent reason for consultation. Psychiatrists treat patients whose behavior may be impulsive and irrational, and whose critical judgment is impaired. In emergency units, the reception and initial assessment of the patient determines his or her future pathway through the healthcare system. By its very nature, emergency medicine deals with inherently unstable situations, which may lead to the risk of medical malpractice. The aim of this article is to provide a summary of the initial management of suicidal patients by general emergency units and to comment on the medical malpractice that may expose the practitioner to risk of liability. An analysis of case history has shown that in suicide cases, malpractice due to inadequate supervision is the most frequent ruling. Resume en francais: En France, dans les services d'urgences generales, les consultations psychiatriques sont en constante augmentation et les conduites suicidaires sont un motif frequent de consultation. Les psychiatres traitent des patients dont le comportement peut etre impulsif et deraisonne, et dont le jugement critique est affaibli. L'aecueil et l'evaluation initiale du patient conditionnent son orientation secondaire dans le reseau de soins. L'instabilite de cette situation associee a la particularite de l'exercice medical en urgence exposent a la faute medicale. Le but de cet article est de realiser une synthese de la prise en charge initiale du patient suicidaire aux urgences generales et de commenter les fautes medicales qui exposent le praticien a la mise en jeu de sa responsabilite. Il a ete realise une analyse la jurisprudence qui montre que dams le domaine du suicide, la faute pour defaut de surveillance est la plus souvent sanctionnee. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

   PREDICTORS; SAMPLE; SCALE
AB Introduction. - Suicide is a major Public Health concern, and low self-esteem might represent a major risk factor. Our main objective was to assess the correlation between self-esteem and suicide intent. More specifically, we aimed to examine the relationship between the different dimensions of self-esteem (total, general, familial, professional and social) and suicide intent. We also sought the role of depression in the relationship of self-esteem to suicide intent.
   Method. - This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at a suicide prevention department at the CMME (Sainte -Anne Hospital, Paris, France). We included patients aged 15 and older and admitted for suicide attempt over a 3 -year period from January 2008 to December 2010. Self-esteem was assessed with the Coopersmith's Self -Esteem Inventory (SEI) scale that takes into account several domains of selfesteem. Subjects scoring over 5 points on the lie scale were excluded. Our primary endpoint was the correlation between self-esteem and suicide intent. Our secondary endpoint was the same correlation adjusted for depression severity (using the Hamilton scale). Suicide intent was estimated using Beck's Suicide Intentionality Scale (SIS). We examined the Pearson's correlation coefficients between self-esteem and suicide intent. These analyses were adjusted for the severity of depressive symptoms assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (17 items).
   Results. - Overall, 132 patients were included. Suicide intent was correlated with total self-esteem (r = -0.227, P= 0.009), social self-esteem (r=-0.331, P<0.001) and familial self-esteem (r=-0.260, P= 0.003). These results remained significant after adjusting for the level of depression for total score (r= -0.181, P= 0.038), and the social (r= -0.282, P= 0.001) and familial (r= -0.237,P= 0.006) dimensions.
   Conclusion. - Self-esteem (and especially social and familial dimensions) is likely to be associated with suicide intent, at least in part independently of the severity of depression, in a population of subjects hospitalized for suicide attempt. This correlation was strongest with social self-esteem. The main limitation of this monocentric study is the lack of representative sample. Nevertheless, this result paves the way for future strategies of suicide prevention, especially those dealing with poor self-esteem. (C) 2016 L'Encephale, Paris.

AB The ranking and frequency of the different causes of death vary according to social categories. The largest disparities in mortality are observed, at first for causes linked to alcohol consumption; then for diabetes, respiratory diseases, lung cancer, cerebrovascular diseases, stomach cancer, suicide, accidents, myocardial infarction, intestine and pancreas cancer For most of the causes of death, there is an increase in time trends in the level of the over-mortality of the group "manual workers-clerical" in comparison with the group "high level professional workers". European comparisons outlined that France and Finland have the more marked social differences in mortality. For France, this trend concerns all the causes of death apart from cardiovascular diseases and violent deaths. The role of excessive alcohol consumption is outlined as an explanation of this specific position of France.

AB Background: Suicide attempt among adolescents is a public health problem around the world. The risk of recurrence is high: about 30 % of adolescents. New ways to prevent suicide attempt recurrence being developed for adult suicide attempters include maintaining contact with them, and results are encouraging.
   Methods/Design: The MEDIACONNEX study will be a simple blinded, parallel-group, multicenter randomised controlled trial. It will compare usual care alone to a program based on usual care plus short message service (SMS) provided to adolescents who attempt suicide and who receive treatment in pediatric and adolescent psychiatry units at hospitals in eastern France. Adolescents will be recruited over an 18-month period. The intervention will be based on the SMS, involving personalized and evolving text messages, sent on days 7 to 14 and months 1, 2, 4 and 6 after the SA. The primary endpoint will be the recurrence of an SA, with an assessment during 12 months. Secondary endpoints will be the evolution of 1) social networks, 2) depression and 3) health-related quality of life, with an assessment at inclusion and at 6 months.
   Discussion: This paper describes the design of MEDIACONNEX, which will assess the effectiveness of an SMS program for adolescent suicide attempters on SA recurrence. This program will be easy to reproduce and inexpensive.

AB This study examined the prevalence and characteristics of attempted suicide among a representative sample of French Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals. In 2003, a face-to-face survey was conducted among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) selected in a random, stratified sample of French hospital departments. Among solicited individuals, 2,932 agreed to participate and were asked if they had ever AS. Among the respondents, 23% had AS. Female gender, younger age, native French citizenship, reporting household financial difficulties, having been HIV-contaminated through homosexual contact or through injection drug use and suffering from lipodystrophy-related symptoms were all independently associated with AS. HIV-discrimination and the lack of social support from family remained independently associated with AS. Our findings indicate a high level of AS among PLWHA and emphasize the multiple roles of factors associated with living with HIV, together with sociodemographic factors. The results enable the possibility for vulnerable groups to be targeted for specific future interventions in order to prevent attempted suicide.

AB The number of head wounds due to firearms remains low in France because these cases are primarily linked to suicide (or attempted suicide) and, to a lesser extent, to attacks or hunting accidents [1]. Characterized by the impact of a projectile, which in most cases is made of metal, at high levels of kinetic energy, such acts generally result in severe trans-cerebral lesions with significant levels of morbidity/mortality [2].
   Seldom are cases reported in the literature that give a detailed study of intracranial foreign bodies made of bone in such situations [3].
   Here we report on the case of two suicides resulting from a transcranial gunshot wounds caused by weapons and ammunition issued by the French police force. Each case helped distinguish a characteristic bone fragment, in the form of a "patch'', equivalent in size to the caliber of the bullet. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article investigates the prevalence of traumatization and mental distress in a sample of 1055 male European long-term prisoners as part of a wider study of the living conditions of prisoners serving sentences of at least five years in Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, England, Finland, France, Germany, Lithuania, Poland, Spain and Sweden. Data were collected in a written survey using the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) as well as questions on attempted suicide and auto-aggressive behaviour. Participants experienced a mean of three traumatic events, with 14 per cent developing a Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) subsequently. In each national sample, more than 50 per cent of the participants were in need of treatment because of psychological symptoms and nearly one-third had attempted suicide.

AB objective: The objective of the present study was to identify factors associated with suicidal behaviors among patients with eating disorders.
   Method: A large database including sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of 1,009 consecutive patients hospitalized for an eating disorder in Paris, France, was examined. Data gathered upon admission to hospital were analyzed to identify factors associated with a history of suicide attempt or current suicidal ideation, among the whole sample as well as among each subtype of eating disorder.
   Results: Among the whole sample, the factor most strongly associated with sui cide attempt or suicidal ideation was the diagnostic category, with the highest odds ratio for bulimia nervosa followed by anorexia nervosa of the binging/purging subtype. Among diagnostic subgroups, the strongest factors were drug use, alcohol use, and tobacco use.
   Conclusion: Suicide risk should be monitored carefully among patients with eating disorders, paying particular attention to combinations of risk factors. (C) 2007 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Objectives. - Training health professionals about suicidal crisis is one major line of suicide prevention worldwide. France has one of the highest suicide rates in Europe, and although crisis intervention training has been set up since 2001, there presently is no training assessment tool in the French language for health professionals trained in suicide prevention. In the four levels of Kirpatrick's education pyramid, training that takes place in France today solely assesses level one status, that is to say relative to the level of satisfaction of participants (self-report). This study proposes a validated short French version of the Suicide Intervention Response Inventory-2 (SIRI-2) of Neimeyer & Mc Innes. The SIRI-2 questionnaire assesses the ability of first line intervention in dealing with suicidal individuals.
   Methods. - The translation methodology was inspired from Vallerand's model of cross-cultural back translation. This method is regularly used for translating from the English language to a French version. In order to translate the English version, we used an extensive 7-step methodology implicating several bilingual translators, expert reviewers (psychologists and psychiatrists) and a scientific committee. Participants were 107 students from different French universities and study programs: psychology, medicine and nursing (17 were men; average age was 26.6). Fifteen of these participants answered the SIRI-2-VF on two occasions (separated by a 15-day interval) in order to estimate the temporal stability of the instrument. The scores of the students were compared to six French experts in suicide prevention and with the original expert group who worked on the development of SIRI-2 (n = 7). We used Student t Test for construct validity, Cronbach's Alpha for internal consistency and Pearson's correlation coefficient for temporal stability.
   Results. - Following a fidelity comparison of the results of the French experts with those of the American experts, ten items presenting the least good fidelity were suppressed in order to obtain a short version of the SIRI-2 containing 15 questions (SIRI-2-VF). Statistical analyses of the short version (15 questions, SIRI-2-VF) showed good validity (difference between experts and subjects is significant: t=31.5, P<0.001) and reliability (good internal consistency: alpha = 0.850 for positive statements and alpha=0.830 for negative statements, and a temporal stability: r = 0.827, bilateral test, P < 0.001).
   Conclusions. - This tool should improve the range of specific instruments in French suicidology adapted for French culture of suicide intervention. It is the first tool in France that reaches level 2a of Kirkpatrick's pyramid to assess clinical skills after training in suicidology. (C) 2017 L'Encephale, Paris.

AB Suicide represents, in France, the second cause of death in youth aged 15 to 24. Sixteen per cent of juvenile mortality is attributable to suicide. The annual incidence of suicide attempts in this age group is estimated at about 40 000 cases.
   Jumping from high represents 6% of deaths from suicide: girls resort to this method twice os often as boys.
   The severity of somatic consequences and the frequency of sequels following a jumping from a window can hold center stage for a long time, at the risk of trivializing the psychopathology underlying such a violent acting-out.
   These clinical situations particularly involve a multidisciplinary follow up including on early and active participation of psychiatric consultation-liaison teams.
   Jumping from a window can occur even apart from established mental disorders, such os psychotic or mood disorders.
   Our four case-reports draw attention to risk factors represented by: substance abuse (alcohol, cannabis, but also cocaine, ecstasy...), the notion of previous suicide attempts and various drive disorders having G self-harm value or displaying on underlying impulsiveness (eating disorders, scarifications, shoplifting, running away...), the precipitating role of 0 recent loss of a parent or on important removal from family environment, the potential influence, especially in this age group, of spectacular cases of suicide amplified by the Medias ("Werther effect"),
   Paradoxically, to belong to a well-off milieu can also contribute to the risk of such acting-out, when parents replace affection and availability by on cosy access to various consumer goods and c permissive education, thus opening the way to the encounter with different substances.

AB In recent years, the attention of French public opinion has been focused on the noxious effects of new ways of organizing work. Stress, "suffering", burnout, psychosocial risks and suicides are topics that have brought experts, the media and politicians into action. What do the social sciences have to say about this? Among the several reactions presented, the principal contrast arises between those who analyze the ills of work as "social constructions" and those who see them as the implications of a trend toward intensifying job-related activities.

TI Euthanasia and assisted suicide: Comparison of legal aspects in
   Switzerland and other countries
SO MEDICINE SCIENCE AND THE LAW
LA English
DT Article
AB The purpose of this paper is to present the legal aspects associated with assisted suicide in Switzerland and compare them with those in other countries. Like euthanasia, assisted suicide is a subject that induces much discussion in many countries. While the law is very liberal in some countries, such as Belgium and the Netherlands (where both euthanasia and assisted suicide take place), these practices are very controversial in other countries, such as France, where they remain taboo subjects.
   In the United States of America, the laws concerning assisted suicide can differ greatly from one state to another. For example, in Oregon, assisted suicide is allowed if applied by a medical doctor; in others, this act is illegal. In Canada, it is punishable according to the Criminal Code.
   In Switzerland euthanasia is punishable by law. However, the penal code does not condemn assisted suicide, whether carried out by a medical doctor or another person, provided it is not carried out through selfish motives. The application of these practices has become simplified in recent years and societies for the right to die with dignity based on this principle have come into being (Exit and Dignitas).
   In the French- and German-speaking parts of Switzerland the association Exit assists individuals living in Switzerland with serious progressive and incurable disease in their engagement to end their life. The association Dignitas, in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, also undertakes - in the same circumstances - to assist individuals coming from foreign countries. Dignitas welcomes several such individuals every year, especially from Germany, where a similar approach does not currently exist.

AB Objectives > In France, too few general practitioners (GP) follow the training about suicide prevention and risk. This study aimed at reviewing international publications regarding GP's training on suicide risk, in order to inform us about the training practices in the world and potentially discover new methodologies.
   Methods > We performed bibliographic databases searches on GPs training about suicide prevention and risk, for practicing GPs, excluding studies about particular population groups, following the PRISMA statement guidelines. Training duration, educational program, content, time of assessment, tools, and information about train the trainers or kirkpatrick's level were identified for each selected study.
   Results > This review revealed that there is no consensus on the training program or on the assessment tools in GP's training about suicide prevention and risk. Nevertheless, it reveals a similar framework including a theoretical part, with a fundamental knowledge content, and an interactive part.
   Conclusion > If reaching standardized training practices seems difficult to achieve, standardizing assessment tools might be a relevant purpose. Indeed, using the same tools would allow proper training comparison. Practically speaking, this review inspired us in the implementation of in situ training and convincing us to undertake a French translation of an assessment scale.

   POPULATION; EUROPE; TRENDS
AB Background. - Epidemiological surveillance of suicide attempts is essential for monitoring indicator trends in the evaluation of prevention actions. As part of this surveillance, analysis of data from hospitalization for suicide attempts is particularly useful.
   Methods. - For the first time, data from two national hospital discharge databases, the "Programme de medicalisation des systemes d'information en medecine, chirurgie, obstetrique'' (PMSI-MCO) and the "Recueil d'information medicalise en psychiatrie'' (RIM-P) have been analyzed jointly. All patients aged 10 or more hospitalized in 2012 in medicine, surgery or psychiatry departments in metropolitan France have were included.
   Results. - Through 2012, 89,072 patients (62% females and 38% males) totalized 134,051 hospital stays following a suicide attempt, with 93.4% (n = 83,196) in medicine or surgery wards and 32.1% (n = 28,594) in psychiatry wards (solely or transferred after a stay in medicine or surgery). However, among the patients transferred to psychiatry after hospitalization in medicine or surgery for suicide attempt, 82.4% had no suicide attempt code noted at their discharge from psychiatry. One or more psychiatric diagnoses were observed in 75% of the patients hospitalized for suicide attempt. The most common diagnoses in men and in women were mood disorders (46%), particularly depression (42%; 44% in women and 38% in men). Mental disorders related to alcohol use were noted in more than a quarter of the patients, more frequently in men (37%) than in women (21%). Some diagnoses were rarely noted in medicine or surgery, such as anxiety disorders and disorders of adult personality and behavior.
   Conclusion. - Improvement of the epidemiological surveillance of suicide attempts requires a systematic coding of hospitalizations in psychiatry as well as in medicine and surgery. Data from hospitalization in psychiatry yield a more precise identification of psychiatric comorbidities associated with suicide attempts. The frequent presence of mental problems associated with suicide attempts should encourage clinicians to search for these symptoms systematically as soon as possible after admission of the patient.

TI Drug suicide: a sex-equal cause of death in 16 European countries

AB Background: There is a lack of international research on suicide by drug overdose as a preventable suicide method. Sex-and age-specific rates of suicide by drug self-poisoning (ICD-10, X60-64) and the distribution of drug types used in 16 European countries were studied, and compared with other self-poisoning methods (X65-69) and intentional self-injury (X70-84).
   Methods: Data for 2000-04/05 were collected from national statistical offices. Age-adjusted suicide rates, and age and sex distributions, were calculated.
   Results: No pronounced sex differences in drug self-poisoning rates were found, either in the aggregate data (males 1.6 and females 1.5 per 100,000) or within individual countries. Among the 16 countries, the range (from some 0.3 in Portugal to 5.0 in Finland) was wide. 'Other and unspecified drugs' (X64) were recorded most frequently, with a range of 0.2-1.9, and accounted for more than 70% of deaths by drug overdose in France, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain. Psychotropic drugs (X61) ranked second. The X63 category ('other drugs acting on the autonomic nervous system') was least frequently used. Finland showed low X64 and high X61 figures, Scotland had high levels of X62 ('narcotics and hallucinogens, not elsewhere classified') for both sexes, while England exceeded other countries in category X60. Risk was highest among the middle-aged everywhere except in Switzerland, where the elderly were most at risk.
   Conclusions: Suicide by drug overdose is preventable. Intentional self-poisoning with drugs kills as many males as females. The considerable differences in patterns of self-poisoning found in the various European countries are relevant to national efforts to improve diagnostics of suicide and appropriate specific prevention. The fact that vast majority of drug-overdose suicides came under the category X64 refers to the need of more detailed ICD coding system for overdose suicides is needed to permit better design of suicide-prevention strategies at national level.

DE suicide; prevention; evaluation; prevention programs
AB Evaluation of suicide prevention programs, both on the local and national level, is a methodological challenge. In September 2000, France initiated a nation program for suicide prevention. But, as was noted in the Premutan report and more recently the FNORS report, very few of the hundreds of preventive measures taken annually are evaluated. In addition to this assessment challenge, new data, particularly concerning the different phases of the suicide process, are needed to design new programs, define their objectives with precision, and assure their implementation. For example, if the objective is to improve prevention in men aged 25-54 years who suffer from a state of depression, alcohol abuse, impulsive personality disorders, and life events implicating loss, the necessary information is currently unavailable or sparse. The lack of data and research in this domain can be grouped into several categories: lack of proper definition and quantification of the objectives; insufficient study of the mechanisms by which prevention measures are effective: lack of monitoring tools providing information on the rate of implementation of planned actions. These arguments demonstrate the need for collecting new information to develop a dynamic prevention program. Such data collection should be synchronized, conducted by a wide range of actors, and concern multiple actions. Without a coherent information system, it is doubtful the current impetus for the prevention of suicide can be sustained.

   SEIZURE
AB Background: Bupropion was the first alternative to nicotine replacement therapy in the pharmacological treatment for smoking cessation. Its safety profile has been monitored in France via spontaneous reporting.
   Objective: To describe all serious adverse reactions (SARs) reported in France since the marketing authorization for bupropion in September 2001, and to analyse risk factors for these SARs.
   Design: We collected all spontaneous reports of adverse reactions to bupropion received by all French Regional Pharmacovigilance Centres and by GlaxoSmithKline, the manufacturer of bupropion, during the first 3 years of marketing of this agent. We identified the characteristics of the population to whom bupropion was prescribed from the Thales database, which contains information obtained from a representative sample of general practitioners in France. We then compared the population with SARs with the population prescribed the drug (exposed population) to identify possible risk factors such as sex, age and daily dose for the most frequent SARs.
   Results: Bupropion was prescribed to 698 000 patients during the first 3 years of marketing in France. In these patients, 1682 cases of adverse reactions were reported; 28% of these involved SARs, mainly cutaneous or allergic reactions (31.2%), including angioedema and serum sickness-like reactions. Serious neurological reactions were frequent (22.5%), mostly comprising seizures; however, questioning revealed that almost half of these patients had a history of seizures or other risk factors. Of the serious neuropsychiatric adverse events reported (17.3%), suicide attempts/suicides were a cause for concern, although risk factors (history of depression, suicide attempts, etc.) were described for 66% of patients experiencing these events. Patients reporting angioedema and serum sickness-like reactions, and those involved in suicide attempts/suicides, were significantly younger than the exposed population. A dose-dependent effect was also apparent for angioedema and for seizures. Cardiovascular SARs, such as ischaemic heart disease (10.1%) or sudden death (2.3%), were very often associated with preexisting coronary artery disease induced by smoking. All these SARs occurred within a median of 12-14 days after drug initiation.
   Conclusion: To ensure safer use of bupropion, health professionals must respect the strict contraindications and warnings about use of this drug in patients with a history of seizures. Seizures, angioedema and serum sickness-like reactions werethe most frequently reported SARs to bupropion treatment in our study. Moreover, younger people appeared to be more at risk for cutaneous SARs generally, and younger women for angioedema in particular, perhaps because of weight-related differences in pharmacokinetics. A dose-dependent effect for angioedema and the results of skin tests were suggestive of a histamine liberation mechanism. Our analysis showed that taking more notice of the contraindications to use of bupropion could have prevented half the seizures reported to the database. The sex and age characteristics of patients with ischaemic heart disease and suicide attempts in the study population were similar to those of the French population as a whole. Whether bupropion is associated with an increase in these potential adverse effects of therapy can be determined only by epidemiological studies that take into account specific risk factors in the smoking population. Finally, the median time to onset of the SARs identified in this study suggests that prescribers should monitor patients exposed to bupropion more carefully during the first 2 weeks of treatment.

AB Background: Suicide rates in prison are high and their risk factors are incompletely understood. The objective of the present study is to measure the risk of suicide and its predictors in the only prison of multicultural French Guiana.
   Methods: All new prisoners arriving between September 2013 and December 2014 were included. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used and socio-demographic data was collected. In order to identify the predictors of suicide risk multivariate logistic regression was used.
   Results: Of the 707 prisoners included 13.2% had a suicidal risk, 14.0% of whom had a high risk, 15.1% a moderate risk and 41.9% a low risk. Predictive factors were depression (OR 7.44, 95% CI: 3.50-15.87), dysthymia (OR 4.22, 95% CI: 1.34-13.36), panic disorder (OR 3.47, 95% CI: 1.33-8.99), general anxiety disorder (GAD) (OR 2.19, 95% CI: 1.13-4.22), men having been abused during childhood (OR 21.01, 95%, CI: 3.26-135.48), having been sentenced for sexual assault (OR 7.12, 95% CI: 1.98-25.99) and smoking (OR 2.93, 95%, CI 1.30-6.63).
   Conclusion: The suicide risk was lower than in mainland France, possibly reflecting the differences in the social stigma attached to incarceration because of migrant populations and the importance and trivialization of drug trafficking among detainees. However, there were no differences between nationalities. The results reemphasize the importance of promptly identifying and treating psychiatric disorders, which were the main suicide risk factors.

DT Review
DE Suicide; Suicide attempt; Parasuicide; Intentions; Functions
ID DELIBERATE SELF-HARM; REASONS PEOPLE; MOTIVES; PARASUICIDE; MOTIVATION;
   OVERDOSES; BEHAVIOR; YOUNG
AB Introduction. - Fifteen years ago, Baechler presented his "strategic theory of suicide". Following a viewpoint initiated at the end of the 1950's by Stengel and Cook, he proposed the more accomplished theoretical development of suicidal functions. We propose a critical review of international empiric literature following this approach.
   Method. - We carried out a bibliographic research on PsychINFO (R) databank, crossing terms of suicide attempt, deliberate self-harm and parasuicide, to reasons, motivations, functions, intentions. Thirty-one articles were selected. They cover a period ranging from 1971 to 2008, and from Europe to the USA.
   Results. - Few studies have been conducted in France, but international literature has grown since 1970, and some questionnaires have been created: e.g. the Motives for Parasuicide Questionnaire (MPQ, Kerkhof et al., 1993 [28]) and the Reasons for Attempting Suicide Questionnaire (RASQ, Holden et al., 1998 [24]). The first intentions mentioned are internal perturbations type: to get relief, to escape, cannot endure situation or thoughts any longer, loss of control. They are often blended with interpersonal intentions: to make people understand what they felt,, to seek help, to make things easier for others, while more aggressive, punitive or manipulative functions are seldom reported. Women report more reasons than men, but do not differ in their pattern of intentions. Suicide attempters report varying desire to die across studies. Some inconsistent distinctions can be made from age and gender but few from subjects' suicidal history.
   Discussion. - One can wonder if subject's answers are really honest, particularly in regards to social desirability. Links between internal perturbations and suicidal intent, hopelessness, and depression are logically found, which aims to give evidence that, at least for this dimension, subjects give true answers, but which also point out the redundant aspect of some items of the suicidant functions scales (e.g. "to die"). Today, it turns out that this kind of research should be managed in France, by creating tools and questionnaires, validating existing ones and, internationally, by taking into account gender, age, and subjects' suicidal history to obtain more clear results.
   Conclusion. - So far, to our knowledge, this kind of review has never been conducted. Suicidal functions appear to be a rich and relevant approach to better understand suicide attempts, notably in a "suicidal crisis" perspective. In the future, some links with coping strategies and cathartic effect of the attempts could be made. We also point out that it could be relevant for psychotherapeutic care.

AB From 1970 to 2002, depression increased in France mainly due to the combined effects of the weakening of marital ties and changes in the social rules governing the interiority of the individual. An increase in the numbers of single people was the expression of this lower marital integration. The economic depression that followed the post-war boom, and social pressures to be a distinct and powerful self-occurred, simultaneously, altering the regulation of the subject. By using data on depression and suicide, and combining micro and macro approaches, it is possible to evaluate the effects of the growth of various categories of individuals on depression and to better understand the impact of tensions related to the economic crisis of the 1980s. Examination in terms of the shocks associated with the state of widowhood or unemployment leads to the hypothesis of a model of adaptation to stress, substituting a new normality for the old, rather than continuous progression.

AB A robust literature on ingroup versus outgroup conflict suggests that perceived discrimination may be an important factor in intergroup aggression. Yet, to date, no studies have tested the hypothesis that the perception of being the victim of anti-Muslim discrimination might be associated with support for anti-Western political violence. We undertook an analysis of two Pew Global Attitudes Surveys: (1) a 2006 data set surveying 1,627 adult Muslim residents of Great Britain, France, Germany, and Spain and (2) a 2007 data surveying 1,050 adult Muslim residents of the United States. Our analyses support the conclusions that younger age and perceived discrimination are both associated with support of suicide bombing in these Muslim diaspora populations. Study 1 found that a bad experience of discrimination increased the odds of justifying suicide bombing among European Muslims by a factor of 3.4. Study 2 found that experienced discrimination was associated with justification of suicide bombing among American Muslims. If further investigations confirm that perceived discrimination is a risk factor for support for political violence, initiatives to reduce discrimination would theoretically reduce the risk of terrorism. We discuss the challenge of breaking the vicious cycle of intergroup prejudice and radicalization.

AB Objective: The demand for organ transplantation exceeds organ donation in France and refusal to organ donation remains close to 30%. This study analysed risk factors associated with refusal of organ donation.
   Study design: Retrospective study.
   Patients: All potential organ donors registered by the French transplantation agency between 1996 and 1999 were included, excepted those with a contraindication to organ procurement or a logistic problem : 5,911 donors were included.
   Methods: Data analysed were those collected routinely on the French database. A logistic model was used to identify statistically significant factors and a stepwise procedure was performed to identify independent factors linked with refusal.
   Results: In univariate analysis, age > 60 years and age < 13 years, stroke, lack of suicide, localisation in an university hospital and in others regions than the Centre-East of France were associated with a higher refusal rate. Year of harvesting, low level of organ procurement activity were not associated with refusal. In multivariate analysis, factors independently associated with refusal were age > 60 years [Odds-Ratio (OR) =1.2)] or age < 13 years (OR=1.5), stroke (OR=1.2), meningitis and cranial tumour (OR=1.4), suicide (OR=0.5) and others French regions than Centre-East.
   Conclusion: The risk factors described should be taking into account when family's members are approached for donation. They represent the interactions between the history of the donors, harvesting organisation, and sociocultural factors. (C) 2001 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

AB Objectives: To estimate the incidence of suicide attempts during imprisonment in a French prison and to determine factors associated with them.
   Methods: All male inmates of a prison for prisoners awaiting trial or serving a short sentence (Bordeaux, France) were eligible for this cross-sectional study. They were face-to-face interviewed by an experienced psychologist (n = 369; mean age = 36 years). Socio-demographic data, imprisonment conditions, health status, healthcare utilization, mental health, impulsiveness, inmate-to-inmate violence (victim and perpetrator status) and suicidal behaviours were documented.
   Results: The incidence of suicidal attempts during imprisonment was 13.4 per 100 person-years. Having made at least one suicide attempt during imprisonment was associated with: being a victim of physical or sexual violence without perpetrating it (adjusted OR = 5.4; 95% CI [2.4-12]), suffering from depressive and anxious symptoms (adjusted OR = 3.3; 95% CI [1.5e7.7]), having children (adjusted OR = 3.0; 95% CI [1.2-7.7]) and having a poor perceived health status (OR = 2.5; 95% CI [1.1-5.4]). A history of suicide attempt before imprisonment was not associated with the risk of suicide attempts while imprisoned.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that violence plays a major role in the suicidal process in prison. The inclusion of inmate-to-inmate violence in the screening checklists of inmate suicide risk should be explored. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine.

AB Objectives. - Research indicates that suicide rates are high among members of law enforcement. Our objectives were: (1) to determine life events implicated in suicide mortality among French law enforcement; and (2) to describe the different life trajectories of police officers who deceased by suicide.
   Methods. - All suicides of police officers which occurred during 2008 (n=49) were explored using the psychological autopsy method. Key informants were: a supervisor, a colleague and a member of the family or a close friend. Each of them were interviewed by trained psychologists using standardized questionnaires exploring: sociodemographic characteristics, life events, social integration and support, health service use, mental health with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview short form (CIDI-SF), occupational stress with the Spielberger Inventory, impulsiveness with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale and aggressiveness with the Brown-Goodwin Lifetime Aggression Scale. Information was then summarized in a timetable life trajectory of all life areas. All cases were finally appraised by at least two experts in order to identify the determinants of the suicide and to determine psychiatric diagnoses. For each "period of time, a burdensomeness score was determined, from 6 (no adversity) to 1 (adversities in each sphere of life).
   Results. - Of the 49 cases of suicide, two were excluded and 39 were investigated and appraised (response rate: 39/47 = 83%). Eighty-two percent of the suicide cases were men and the mean age at death was 35 years. In more than half of the cases, police officers used their service weapon to commit suicide. All deceased police officers were suffering from mental health symptoms (primarily depression). Of them, two thirds had used healthcare for this distress. The main other cause of suicide was problems in the married life (70% of the cases). Four distinct types of life trajectories of adversities could be identified by a qualitative analysis.
   Discussion. - It is the first time such a study was performed in France, and results are concordant with those of the literature. This study showed that all deceased police officers were suffering from mental disorders and that there was not one single profile of life trajectory: screening and support of police officers in distress need to be prioritized. Moreover, results suggested that the availability of the service weapon during off-duty periods should be reconsidered. This study helped the Home ministry to elaborate and improve strategies to prevent suicide among police officers. (C) 2015 L'Encephale, Paris.

DE Conflict; nihilism; suicide; betrayal
AB Paul Nizan (1905-1940) is also known in France as the impossible communist', for his long-term allegiance to the Party and the abrupt cancellation of his membership, in the late 1930s, following the Nazi-Soviet pact. This paper discusses a number of his writings, focusing particularly on his best known novel, The Conspiracy, where a revolutionary cell plans illegal political action. Conflict, nihilism, suicide and betrayal are among the topics stemming from the novel, which will be examined from a criminological perspective. The analysis will primarily address cultural' aspects of crime and refer to notions such as thrill' and seductions of crime' among others. These notions, it will be argued, require some revision in the face of the imagined or actual criminality described in the novel.

AB Background: In a classical study, Durkheim noted a direct relation between suicide rates and wealth in the XIX century France. Since that time, several studies have verified this relationship. It is known that suicide rates are associated with income, although the direction of this association varies worldwide. Brazil presents a heterogeneous distribution of income and suicide across its territory; however, evaluation for an association between these variables has shown mixed results. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between suicide rates and income in Brazil, State of Sao Paulo (SP), and City of SP, considering geographical area and temporal trends.
   Methods: Data were extracted from the National and State official statistics departments. Three socioeconomic areas were considered according to income, from the wealthiest (area 1) to the poorest (area 3). We also considered three regions: country-wide (27 Brazilian States and 558 Brazilian micro-regions), state-wide (645 counties of SP State), and city-wide (96 districts of SP city). Relative risks (RR) were calculated among areas 1, 2, and 3 for all regions, in a cross-sectional approach. Then, we used Joinpoint analysis to explore the temporal trends of suicide rates and SaTScan to investigate geographical clusters of high/low suicide rates across the territory.
   Results: Suicide rates in Brazil, the State of SP, and the city of SP were 6.2, 6.6, and 5.4 per 100,000, respectively. Taking suicide rates of the poorest area (3) as reference, the RR for the wealthiest area was 1.64, 0.88, and 1.65 for Brazil, State of SP, and city of SP, respectively (p for trend <0.05 for all analyses). Spatial cluster of high suicide rates were identified at Brazilian southern (RR = 2.37), state of SP western (RR = 1.32), and city of SP central (RR = 1.65) regions. A direct association between income and suicide were found for Brazil (OR = 2.59) and the city of SP (OR = 1.07), and an inverse association for the state of SP (OR = 0.49).
   Conclusions: Temporospatial analyses revealed higher suicide rates in wealthier areas in Brazil and the city of SP and in poorer areas in the State of SP. We further discuss the role of socioeconomic characteristics for explaining these discrepancies and the importance of our findings in public health policies. Similar studies in other Brazilian States and developing countries are warranted.

AB When the duc de Choiseul-Praslin, a politician and prominent member of the French aristocracy, killed his wife and then poisoned himself in August 1847, the case shook the foundations of the July Monarchy. In the wake of the affair, conservatives used the murder/suicide to argue that love was a respect for hierarchy, while those on the left saw violence and anomie as stemming from inequality. However, both sides saw women's affections as crucial to public life and social cohesion. This article thus situates the Choiseul-Praslin affair within the politics of affection and family life in mid-nineteenth-century France.

AB This paper aims at increasing understanding of the relationship between depressive symptoms and alcohol, cigarette and cannabis use among adolescents, by asking whether such symptoms are normal or pathological. The data presented were abstracted from a national school survey (ages 14-19 years) conducted in France in 1999. In this survey, 23% of the adolescents presented strong depressive symptoms, but few of them reported suicide attempts or running away. For those who presented strong depressive symptoms but neither suicide attempt nor running away, the link between such symptoms and drug use was statistically non significant. At last, we questioned the relevance of interpreting adolescents' drug use as the consequence of psychological disorders.

   DEPRESSION
AB Background: There have been only a few reports illustrating the moderate effectiveness of suicide-preventive interventions in reducing suicidal behavior, and, in most of those studies, the target populations were primarily adults, whereas few focused on adolescents. Essentially, there have been no randomized controlled studies comparing the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and cultural adaptability of suicide-prevention strategies in schools. There is also a lack of information on whether suicide-preventive interventions can, in addition to preventing suicide, reduce risk behaviors and promote healthier ones as well as improve young people's mental health.
   The aim of the SEYLE project, which is funded by the European Union under the Seventh Framework Health Program, is to address these issues by collecting baseline and follow-up data on health and well-being among European adolescents and compiling an epidemiological database; testing, in a randomized controlled trial, three different suicide-preventive interventions; evaluating the outcome of each intervention in comparison with a control group from a multidisciplinary perspective; as well as recommending culturally adjusted models for promoting mental health and preventing suicidal behaviors.
   Methods and design: The study comprises 11,000 adolescents emitted from randomized schools in 11 European countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden serving as the scientific coordinating center. Each country performs three active interventions and one minimal intervention as a control group. The active interventions include gatekeeper training (QPR), awareness training on mental health promotion for adolescents, and screening for at-risk adolescents by health professionals. Structured questionnaires are utilized at baseline, 3- and 12-month follow-ups in order to assess changes.
   Discussion: Although it has been reported that suicide-preventive interventions can be effective in decreasing suicidal behavior, well-documented and randomized studies are lacking. The effects of such interventions in terms of combating unhealthy lifestyles in young people, which often characterize suicidal individuals, have never been reported. We know that unhealthy and risk-taking behaviors are detrimental to individuals' current and future health. It is, therefore, crucial to test well-designed, longitudinal mental health-promoting and suicide-preventive interventions by evaluating the implications of such activities for reducing unhealthy and risk behaviors while concurrently promoting healthy ones.

AB Background: A large proportion of persons died by suicide are employed at the time of death and work-related factors partly contribute to suicide risk. Our aim was to examine the association between multiple aspects of work organization and suicidal ideation in a study conducted in primary care.
   Methods: Data came from a study of 2027 working patients attending a GP representative of patients in the Nord Pas-de-Calais region in France (April-August 2014). Suicidality was assessed using the MINI (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview). Six emergent worked-related factors were explored (work intensity, emotional demands, autonomy, social relationships at work, conflict of values, insecurity of work). Several covariates were considered: patient's and GP's characteristics, and area-level data (material and social deprivation, psychiatrist and GPs' density, suicide attempts and suicide rates).
   Results: 8.0% of participants reported suicidal ideation in the preceding month (7.5% of men and 8.6% of women, p = .03). In multivariate analyses adjusted for covariates, suicidality was significantly associated with work intensity (OR = 1.65; 95%CI [1.18-2.31]) in men and with work-related emotional demands (OR = 1.35; 95%CI [1.01-1.80]) in women. Area-level data were not associated.
   Limitations: Our cross-sectional study cannot assess the direction of the relationships under study.
   Conclusion: Our results emphasise a central role for GPs in suicide prevention among workers and highlight the importance of work-related factors with regard to suicidality in primary care.

AB The prevalence of immolation by fire in France is uncertain. We carried out a retrospective epidemiological study on immolations between 2011 and 2016 at the burn treatment centre at the hopital Saint-Louis in Paris. We studied the prevalence and characteristics of patients entering hospital for this reason. Between 2011 and 2016, a total of 1098 patients were hospitalized in the centre, of which 50 were admitted for immolation, i.e. five percent of the hospitalized population. The average age at entry was 46 years, and they were mostly men (62%). All but one was a suicide attempt. The average total burn area was 34.5%, and the average length of stay in the centre was 53 days. The products used for the immolation were mostly white spirit, alcohol or gasoline. Nine (18%) out of the 50 patients died, burned at 62.5% on average. A psychiatric history was reported in 35 patients and 21 had previously attempted suicide; nine patients were chronic alcoholics and four were drug addicts. The most frequently reported reasons for the suicide attempt were sentimental breakdown, death of a relative or financial problem. The prevalence of immolation in our study is very low compared to that found in developing countries. The majority of our cohort is composed of patients with a history of psychiatric disorders. The history of attempted suicide is also a major risk factor for committing suicidal acts by immolation. Prevention measures should be implemented to reduce this risk. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Objective: This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of mental disorders in the population of Martinique, as part of the survey entitled 'Mental Health in the General Population - Images and Realities' (Sante Mentale en Population Generale - images et Realites). The survey was a multicentre epidemiological study in the general population, conducted in mainland France and French overseas islands between 1997 and 2006, under the authority of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Training and Research in Mental Health (Lille, France).
   Methods: The study took place in 2000. Participants aged 18 years or over were recruited in public places. using the quota sampling method, and interviewed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview.
   Results: A total of 900 participants (52.7% women) with a mean age of 43 years completed the survey. Lifetime prevalence of any mental disorder was 29%. Mood (15%) and anxiety disorders (17%) were the most frequent. The rate of suicide attempts was low (4.2% lifetime), while the frequency of suicidal thoughts was high (11% past month) and similar to the frequency in mainland France.
   Conclusion: Mental disorders, especially mood and anxiety disorders, were as frequent in Martinique as in mainland France. The lower rates of suicide attempts, in spite of high rates of suicidal thoughts, might deserve further investigation. Our results should strengthen the development of a system of diagnosis and care for these disorders, especially to prevent suicidal behaviours and reduce morbidity and mortality.

AB Self-inflicted burns are rare in France, but they lead to major, often life-threatening complications. The authors reviewed medical data for patients hospitalized in a burn center from January 2004 to December 2008. Thirty-eight cases of self-inflicted burns were compared with 220 accidental burns. Women were predominantly affected (57.9%, n = 22). A psychiatric history (71%, n = 27) was more frequent in this population. The mean age of the victims was 38 years. The leading method of suicide was flame (94%, n = 36) associated with gasoline used as an accelerant (77.7%, n = 28). Mean total burn surface area (41.5%) and mortality (36.9%) were higher in the self-inflicted burn population. By recognizing epidemiological characteristics and patients at risk, we can better classify lesions related to self-immolation. It is important for the forensic physician to consult survival details to correlate these data with the results of autopsy.

TI Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide: what about in Europe?
SO GAZZETTA MEDICA ITALIANA ARCHIVIO PER LE SCIENZE MEDICHE
LA English
DT Review
DE Euthanasia; Assisted suicide; Legal liability; Europe
ID OF-LIFE PRACTICES; CHILDREN; TRENDS
AB INTRODUCTION: End-of-life legislation, because of its bioethical, medico-legal, and judicial implications, is heatedly disputed in Europe and throughout the world, engendering a variety of legal end-of-life care options in different countries. We thought it could be interesting to compare the Italian law with current European legislation regulating end-of-life matters.
   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic search of the Medline, Cochrane Central, Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases was conducted using the search words: "euthanasia", "law", "Europe", and "assisted suicide". The search word "euthanasia" was entered singly or in combination with each of the other search terms.
   EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: To date, only three countries in Europe (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) have legalized euthanasia, and four countries (Switzerland, France, Austria, Germany) permit only assisted suicide. Acceptance by the general public of euthanasia and assisted suicide increased in 11 of 13 European countries between 1981 and 2008, in parallel with a decrease in religiosity (except for Italy and Holland) and an increase in secularization. There was also a trend toward a correlation between an increase of the value of self-determination in important life issues and an increase in acceptance of euthanasia.
   CONCLUSIONS: This review shows that end-of-life decisions constitute a challenge for political governance and bioethical deliberation in modern liberal democracies. It appears that in certain situations, euthanasia is perceived more as a means to reduce health care costs rather than an ethical question regarding self-determination.

AB Objectives: To discover what factors affect lay people's judgments of the acceptability of physician assisted suicide and euthanasia and how these factors interact.
   Design: Participants rated the acceptability of either physician assisted suicide or euthanasia for 72 patient vignettes with a five factor design - that is, all combinations of patient's age ( three levels); curability of illness ( two levels); degree of suffering ( two levels); patient's mental status ( two levels), and extent of patient's requests for the procedure ( three levels).
   Participants: Convenience sample of 66 young adults, 62 middle aged adults, and 66 older adults living in western France. Main measurements: In accordance with the functional theory of cognition of NH Anderson, main effects, and interactions among patient factors and participants' characteristics were investigated by means of both graphs and ANOVA.
   Results: Patient requests were the most potent determinant of acceptability. Euthanasia was generally less acceptable than physician assisted suicide, but this difference disappeared when requests were repetitive. As their own age increased, participants placed more weight on patient age as a criterion of acceptability.
   Conclusions: People's judgments concur with legislation to require a repetition of patients' requests for a life ending act. Younger people, who frequently are decision makers for elderly relatives, place less emphasis on patient's age itself than do older people.

TI SENTIMENTAL TERROR NARRATIVES GENDERING VIOLENCE, DIVIDING SYMPATHY
SO JOURNAL OF MIDDLE EAST WOMENS STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID MEDIA
AB Why do novels and studies originating in the United States and Europe sympathetically depict Middle Eastern women who commit or support forms of violence identified as terrorist? This article draws on scholarship on cosmopolitanism and the sentimental novel, as well as on novelistic and journalistic accounts of Palestinian female suicide bombers from the United States and Algeria/France: Barbara Victor's Army of Roses: Inside the World of Palestinian Suicide Bombers (Rodale, 2003) and Yasmina Khadra's The Attack (Doubleday, 2005). It argues that sentimental terror narratives use gendered, maternal imagery to produce a liberal stance on terrorism that combines sympathetic comprehension of the forces that foster violence with condemnation of the violence itself The article uses Syrian novelist Khaled Khalifa's Madih al-Karahiya (In Praise of Hatred, 2006) as an alternative literary depiction of gender and violence, aimed at a Syrian audience, that produces non-normative forms of sympathy to foster national reconciliation after civil conflict.

AB Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of suicidal ideation and behaviours in a large, representative sample of French youth and to evaluate age and sex correlates.
   Method: We surveyed a large (n = 1106) cohort of French adolescents and young adults, aged 15 to 26 years and diversified throughout France, using a mailed-in self-report questionnaire.
   Results: Lifetime prevalence rates for suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts were 47.2%, 14.8%, and 5.7%, respectively. Rates for female youth were higher than for male youth across the entire spectrum of suicide-related outcomes. Rates generally increased between the ages of 15 and 20 years and decreased after age 21.
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that suicidal thoughts and behaviours are widespread phenomena among adolescents and constitute a major public health issue.

   moral statistics
ID PLACEMENT; ALGORITHM
AB Andre-Michel Guerry's (1833) Essai sur la Statistique Morale de la France was one of the foundation studies of modern social science. Guerry assembled data on crimes, suicides, literacy and other "moral statistics," and used tables and maps to analyze a variety of social issues in perhaps the first comprehensive study relating such variables. Indeed, the Essai may be considered the book that launched modern empirical social science, for the questions raised and the methods Guerry developed to try to answer them.
   Guerry's data consist of a large number of variables recorded for each of the departments of France in the 1820-1830s and therefore involve both multivariate and geographical aspects. In addition to historical interest, these data provide the opportunity to ask how modern methods of statistics, graphics, thematic cartography and geovisualization can shed further light on the questions he raised. We present a variety of methods attempting to address Guerry's challenge for multivariate spatial statistics.

AB Background: Only a few studies have investigated the factors associated with suicidal behavior after antidepressant treatment onset in adults. We examined the specific predictors of de novo suicidal ideas or attempts among depressed patients in the community, including subjects potentially at risk of suicidal behaviors, who initiated a new antidepressant treatment.
   Methods: A large set of GPs and psychiatrists throughout France followed-up, for 6 weeks, 4357 outpatients for whom an antidepressant drug was prescribed. Dimensions related with antidepressant-induced suicidal events, such as depression, anxiety or hopelessness, were assessed longitudinally using univariate and multivariate approaches among subjects with treatment-emergent suicide ideation or attempts.
   Results: New suicidal ideas were observed in 9% of patients with no suicidal ideation at baseline (n=81), while suicidal attempts were reported for 1.7% of the sample during the 6-week observation period (n=75). The onset of suicidal ideas and attempts was associated with the initial features of the patients (baseline level of anxiety, past history of suicide attempts and alcohol misuse) and the non-improvement of depression. Worsening of depressive symptoms during the follow-up increased the onset of new suicidal ideas (OR=5.67, p<0.001) and attempts (OR=2.60, p=0.002), corresponding to 67.5% and 56.5% of attributable risk respectively.
   Conclusions: When the analyses are restricted to the occurrence of suicidal ideas or attempts, the link between antidepressants and suicide risk might be more adequately explained by a poor response to antidepressant treatment rather than by a direct trigger-effect. This naturalistic study is limited by the use of non-structured diagnoses and self-report outcomes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVEThe aim of this large retrospective cohort study was to estimate the supplementary morbidity and mortality risks conferred by the co-occurrence of schizophrenia among young people with type 1 diabetes.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSThis nationwide population-based study included individuals aged 15-35 years hospitalized in France for type 1 diabetes from 2009 to 2012 with or without schizophrenia. For assessment of the occurrence of rehospitalization for acute diabetes complications, suicide attempts, and hospital mortality, multivariate logistic regressions and survival analysis adjusted for age, sex, and Charlson comorbidity index scores were performed. The association between hospitalization for suicide attempts and acute diabetes complications was further explored in a survival analysis, with the exposure of acute diabetes complications as a time-dependent covariate.RESULTSAmong 45,655 individuals aged 15-35 years who were hospitalized for type 1 diabetes, 341 (0.75%) had a previous or contemporary hospitalization for schizophrenia. Within 3 years of follow-up, schizophrenia was associated with increased risks of rehospitalization for hypoglycemia (adjusted odds ratio 3.21 [95% CI 1.99-5.20]), hyperglycemia (7.01 [3.53-13.90]), ketoacidosis (2.01 [1.49-2.70]), and coma (3.17 [1.90-5.27]); hospitalization for suicide attempts (12.15 [8.49-17.38]); and hospital mortality (2.83 [1.50-5.36]). Hospitalization for a suicide attempt was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for acute diabetes complications independently from schizophrenia (hazard ratio 3.46 [95% CI 2.74-4.38]).CONCLUSIONSPatients suffering from the combination of type 1 diabetes and schizophrenia are at increased risk of hospitalization for acute diabetes complications as well as suicide and hospital mortality. These individuals may require specific care programs and close monitoring of mental, somatic, and social health.

AB The monthly pattern of suicides has remained a puzzle ever since it was discovered in the second half of the 19th century. In this paper we intend to "explain" not the pattern itself but rather its changes across countries and in the course of time.
   First, we show that the fairly common idea according to which this pattern is decaying in "modern" societies is not altogether true. For instance, around 2000, in well urbanized countries like South Korea or Spain this pattern was still as strong as it was in France (and other European countries) in the late 19th century.
   The method that we use in order to make some progress in our understanding is the time-honored Cartesian approach of breaking up the problem under consideration "into as many parts as might be necessary to solve it". More specifically, we try two separations of monthly suicides into simpler components: (i) according to suicide methods and (ii) according to age-groups. These separations rely on the introduction of what we call "elementary monthly profiles".
   The first separation points out the key-role of hanging and drowning. The second shows the crucial role of the 15-20 and 65+ age-groups.
   Then, we present a number of cases in which age-group decomposition provides adequate predictions. It turns out that the cases in which the predictions do not work are newly urbanized countries. The discrepancies may be due to a memory effect which induces a time-lag extending over one or two generations.
   Finally, in the light of the new results presented in the present paper, we re-examine the theory proposed by Emile Durkheim. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB AimAdolescents at risk for suicide often see their general practitioner solely for somatic or administrative reasons. A simple screening test given during a conversation would be of substantial help to send a signal and tackle the problem. We propose to update a screening test previously validated in France - the TSTS-Cafard - because of significant changes in the lives of adolescents with the growth of the cyber world since 2000.
   MethodsThe design and setting was a cross-sectional study involving 912 15-year-old adolescents in 90 French schools. They completed a questionnaire that included the TSTS-Cafard and risk factors extracted from the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children survey. To improve the test, we selected questions drawn from the recent literature. Answers were analysed according to suicidality'=at least one suicide attempt in life or suicidal ideation often over the past 12months.
   ResultsSuicidality rates were 9.6% for boys and 23.1% for girls. Although the TSTS-Cafard test was generally effective, one question was no longer discriminating. A new test, entitled BITS', included only four questions on bullying, insomnia, tobacco and stress, with three levels of response and scores ranging from 0 to 8. Improvement was achieved without loss of performance. Using a cut-off score of 3, we achieved 78% accuracy (area under the curve), 75% sensitivity and 70% specificity.
   ConclusionThe BITS test could allow the question of suicide risk to be addressed during a routine check-up in primary care but the results need to be validated with 13 to 18-year olds.

AB Suicidal acting out was frequent in the literary tradition of Romanticism, where the annihilation of the self was the expression of a passionate hatred of life, grounded in the frustration of the love ideal and the impossibility of enjoying the beloved. On the basis of a case study of The Sorrows of Young Werther, the author explores the existential possibilities of the Romantic hero who ends up killing himself as a result of his unrequited love. This solution was imitated by many readers of Goethe's novel in France.

ID ANXIETY DISORDERS; COMMUNITY; LIFETIME
AB Background France has high rates of psychotropic drug consumption and suicide in the elderly population, but it has not yet been possible to determine whether this is due to exceptionally high morbidity rates.
   Aims To describe the first longitudinal population study of psychiatric disorder undertaken in France, and to estimate current and lifetime prevalences and age of onset of psychiatric disorder.
   Method A study group of 1873 non-institutionalised persons aged 65 years and over was randomly recruited from the Montpellier district electoral rolls. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview was used to assess current and lifetime symptoms. Cases identified by the application of DSM-IV criteria were reexamined by a clinical panel.
   Results Forty-six per cent of the study population had experienced a mental disorder in their lifetime, and 3.7% had made a suicide attempt. Lifetime prevalence of major depression was 26.5% and 30% for anxiety disorders. Current prevalence rates were 14.2% for anxiety disorders, 10.7% for phobia, 3% for major depression and 1.7% for psychosis.
   Conclusions Results show very high rates of lifetime but not current major depression. Rates of current phobia and suicidal ideation in the very elderly are also high compared with other studies. The rates reported are likely to be underestimates.

AB Background: In a classical study, Durkheim mapped suicide rates, wealth, and low family density and realized that they clustered in northern France. Assessing others variables, such as religious society, he constructed a framework for the analysis of the suicide, which still allows international comparisons using the same basic methodology. The present study aims to identify possible significantly clusters of suicide in the city of Sao Paulo, and then, verify their statistical associations with socio-economic and cultural characteristics.
   Methods: A spatial scan statistical test was performed to analyze the geographical pattern of suicide deaths of residents in the city of Sao Paulo by Administrative District, from 1996 to 2005. Relative risks and high and/or low clusters were calculated accounting for gender and age as co-variates, were analyzed using spatial scan statistics to identify geographical patterns. Logistic regression was used to estimate associations with socioeconomic variables, considering, the spatial cluster of high suicide rates as the response variable. Drawing from Durkheim's original work, current World Health Organization (WHO) reports and recent reviews, the following independent variables were considered: marital status, income, education, religion, and migration.
   Results: The mean suicide rate was 4.1/100,000 inhabitant-years. Against this baseline, two clusters were identified: the first, of increased risk (RR = 1.66), comprising 18 districts in the central region; the second, of decreased risk (RR = 0.78), including 14 districts in the southern region. The downtown area toward the southwestern region of the city displayed the highest risk for suicide, and though the overall risk may be considered low, the rate climbs up to an intermediate level in this region. One logistic regression analysis contrasted the risk cluster (18 districts) against the other remaining 78 districts, testing the effects of socioeconomic-cultural variables. The following categories of proportion of persons within the clusters were identified as risk factors: singles (OR = 2.36), migrants (OR = 1.50), Catholics (OR = 1.37) and higher income (OR = 1.06). In a second logistic model, likewise conceived, the following categories of proportion of persons were identified as protective factors: married (OR = 0.49) and Evangelical (OR = 0.60).
   Conclusions: This risk/ protection profile is in accordance with the interpretation that, as a social phenomenon, suicide is related to social isolation. Thus, the classical framework put forward by Durkheim seems to still hold, even though its categorical expression requires re-interpretation.

AB Depression is a frequent disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 25% in women and 12% in men. General practitioners are responsible for the majority of antidepressant prescriptions in France.
   Antidepressant treatments decrease the suicide risk in adult patients with a depressive disorder or suicidal behavior.
   However, antidepressant treatment is not recommended in children or adolescents. Indeed, an increase risk of suicide has been reported in this population in previous studies, especially when antidepressant treatment is started. The treatment of adolescents with major depression or suicidal behaviors must be preferentially conducted by a specialized care team. A clinical evaluation must be done very carefully before the onset of antidepressant treatment.
   In some specific clinical contexts, antidepressant treatments may be used to decrease levels of impulsiveness and aggressiveness. However, the efficacy of antidepressant treatment on violent behaviors is still not clearly determined by scientific literature owing to lack of studies with a high level of evidence.
   In a few cases of patients, activation syndromes may appear at the beginning of antidepressant treatments, with akathisia, nervousness, anxiety, insomnia and agitation. These reactions may be risk factors for acting out.
   Alcohol, cocaine or benzodiazepines when concomitantly consumed with antidepressant treatment may increase the risk for acting out. Whenever benzodiazepines are needed in a patient with a high suicide risk, the dosage used must be enough to avoid desinhibition and to obtain anxiolytic and sedative effects.

AB Introduction: Positive psychological phenomena such as increased feelings of belonging linked to hosting the FIFA World Cup were observed in France 1998 and South Africa 2010. Approximately nine months after South Africa hosted the 2010 World Cup the sex ratio at birth increased significantly. Given the similarity of positive psychological phenomena between the two countries, this study sought to determine if the sex ratio at birth increased in France circa nine months after the 1998 World Cup.
   Methods: Anonymized publicly available live birth data from 1994 to 2004 inclusive was obtained from the Insee (Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes/Economiques - National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies). For statistical analysis, chi-squared tests were used.
   Results: The sex ratio at birth for March and April 1999 did not differ significantly from that of the rest of same period from 1996 to 2000 (p = 0.558), there was also no significant difference for February and March 1999.
   Conclusion: The sex ratio at birth did not increase in France after it hosted the 1998 World Cup. Possible reasons why the sex ratio at birth did not increase as it did in South Africa include a higher French prevalence of modern contraceptive use and a different kind/level of excitement for the World Cup in France since it has previously hosted large international sports tournaments. The influence of the World Cup on the sex ratio at birth depends on the context of a specific country. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Suicide attempt; Suicidal ideation; Mental health; Work; Employees
AB Purpose of the study. The purpose of this study is to quantify the influence of work on suicide attempts and, within the same environment, to highlight protective factors or work-induced decompensation factors that may lead to a suicide attempt.
   Method. The study relies on a descriptive cross-sectional monocentric survey based on individual interviews of employees who actually made a suicide attempt. These interviews were conducted while they were being kept under observation in the Short-Term Hospitalization Unit of Caen University Hospital. Each interview is based on a questionnaire comprising analogue scale-rated quantitative variables, along with qualitative data (general and job-related data, links between the professional and private spheres, data on the suicide attempt itself) and a reconstruction of the chronology of professional events that preceded the suicide attempt.
   Results. Based on a 70-patient survey, the results show a steady population under permanent work contracts, whose seniority within the company and length of service in their job are high. For these employees, both the importance of work in their mental balance and their own performance expectations are high. For 40% of the employees in this survey, Work is the main determining element leading to a suicide attempt and in half of these cases the work situation can be seen as the sole decisive factor leading to the attempt. Precursory suicidal ideations were found in 74% of cases and one triggering event caused 70% of patients to act, and this within 24 hours for over one third of them. Statistical comparison of the population for whom work is the main triggering element versus other employees does not highlight any significant difference as to age, gender, psychiatric background, a previous suicide attempt, the age of the first suicide attempt or the existence of a trigger event. In the work environment, expectations, self-esteem, intensity and responsibilities are no different. Significant differences appear in the way work is experienced personally, in the difficulties the employee is confronted with at work, in the hierarchical relationships within the organization and the time elapsed within 24 hours between the triggering event and the act. A qualitative analysis identifies professional factors that protect against suicidal attempts but also destabilizing factors. Studying career histories, when the work situation is the main factor leading to a suicide attempt, makes it possible to reconstruct the temporal dynamics of work-related events, thus bringing into relief a long history of work-related suffering interspersed with banal events.
   Conclusion. Thus, the survey shows how central work is as a protective or destabilizing element when dealing with mental and physical health. The "work" situational interview with its various components should be developed not only in the context of suicidal patients but also of any patient involved in a professional activity. Its aim is not only to let the interviewee verbalize his/her personal work-history involving possible difficulties and/or health promoting factors, but also to promote individual and collective suicide prevention awareness actions.

AB Suicidal behaviors are not uncommon, but rarely admitted in the families and in society at large. Violence is a public health and social problem of growing concern. Research on the relationship between violence and suicidal behaviors is scarce for the last decades, perhaps because suicide is no longer considered an offense. The present study is based on a sample of 21,314 valid interviews with 20 year old Swiss men, representing over 70 % of this cohort. The questionnaire contained over 900 variables, adressing issues such as previous history of parasuicide, self-reported violent acts and injuries, during childhood and adolescence, as well as over the last year before recruits training. The questionnaire also contains various items about mental health, familial and social conditions and situational factors. We used an ordinal scale for measuring violence and operationalisations of mental disturbances according to theoretical and empirical concepts such as conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder according to DSM IV, the dissocial syndrome according to Rauchfleisch's (1981) definition; 2,6 % of the recruits reported at least one suicide attempt during the last year, one third even multiple attempts. Life-time prevalence at age 20 was 3,9 %. Suicide attempters often showed signs of psychiatric disorders, especially for a dissocial (OR = 6,9) or an antisocial (OR = 5,8) syndrome. Other studies have shown that the rate of suicide in France and Switzerland is very high compared to other European countries. Our study confirms the existence of a real behavioural and existential problem among young Swiss men. Half of the suicide attempters had a history of physical violence against others and 20 % were themselves victims of violent acts during the previous year. Suicide attempters who were victims were also more violent than those who were not victimized. A suicide attempt during the previous year is a marker for violent behaviours (OR = 2,1) and victimisation (OR = 1,9) during this same year. We also found a positive link between multiple attempted suicides and the commission of serious violence. It is concluded that parasuicide among young men is related to other violent acts and should be considered as a positive marker of violent behavior in general and victimisation by crime. It seems that suicide is a transgression of social and cultural values because of the amount of aggression behind it, even if it is not a criminal offense. Suicide attempts of young men should receive more attention by professionals in the field of medicine, psychology and social work. Treatment of these men not only prevents an individual mental health problem but also contributes to crime prevention at the community level. Criminological theories could inspire further studies in suicidology, in order to improve the multidisciplinary knowledge of the phenomenology and etiology of parasuicide. In the same way, criminologists as policy makers should attach more attention to parasuicide given its many theoretical and practical connections with crime.

TI The "Endura" of The Cathars' Heresy: Medieval Concept of Ritual
   Euthanasia or Suicide?
SO JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Cathars; Endura; Euthanasia; Suicide; Rituals
AB The aim of the study is to explore the medieval concepts on the voluntary death of severely sick people, as they emerge through the endura (endurance) of the heresy of the Cathars in France (twelfth to fourteenth centuries). The endura was the prerequisite act of repentance that would allow the fallen soul to return to heaven. The endura was a necessary act of repentance, after the performance of a ceremonial purification of the soul (consolamentum), and consisted of the patients' voluntary abstention from vital food. The consolamentum and endura could be performed in the final stage of a disease with the consent of the patients or their relatives. The role of the Cathar physician was only to determine the severity of the disease and the forthcoming death of the patient. The physician was not allowed to take steps that would deprive the life of the patient, and the performance of the ritual endura was duty of the spiritual leaders of the community. The modern ethical approach to this subject is dictated by the medieval belief on the salvation of the soul and tries to answer the question of whether the endura could be seen as a medieval concept of a ritual euthanasia or fell within the theological sin of suicide.

AB Background: Alcohol use disorders are frequently associated with self-intoxication in attempted suicide. In France since 2008, the off-label use of baclofen for treatment of alcohol dependence has greatly increased, leading to temporary regulation of use of the drug. At the request of the national authorities, the French Poison Control Centers carried out a retrospective survey to give an overview of baclofen exposure in this population.
   Methods: A retrospective study was carried out from January 2008 to December 2013, focusing on baclofen exposures in alcohol-dependent patients managed by the nine national French Poison Control Centers.
   Results: 294 observations of baclofen exposures in alcohol-dependent patients were identified in our database. Of these, 220 were suicide attempts by self-poisoning and 74 were unintentional. The mean age of patients was 41.7 years, with a sex-ratio of 1.6. Patients attempting suicide with baclofen were younger than those with unintentional exposures, and 43.6% of them were women (vs 22.9%, p< 0.01). The mean supposed ingested dose was higher (480.7mg) in patients who attempted suicide (vs 192.5 mg, p< 0.0001). 21.8% of intentional exposures involved baclofen alone. Psychiatric comorbidity (50.4%) was more frequent in the group of self- poisoning (p< 0.001). 132 patients were coded as severely exposed (60.0%). Nine victims died, but the causal link between self-poisoning with baclofen and fatal outcome should be interpreted with particular caution.
   Conclusions: Baclofen self-poisoning by alcohol-dependent patients is a serious concern for the French health authorities. Our results are similar to those previously published, suggesting that most patients with baclofen overdose should be admitted to an intermediate or intensive care unit as the clinical course requires close monitoring. Because suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are more prevalent in people with substance use disorders than in the general population, and because of the lack of recommendations governing baclofen prescription in such a situation, its use needs to be better controlled.

ID MIGRATION; HEALTH
AB There have been marked disparities in mortality between metropolitan French departements for the past thirty years. They have lessened for women but remain high for men. As in the 1960s, the worst placed regions are the North, Alsace and Brittany. Mortality is lower in Paris, the south-western departements of Ile-de-France, and Rhone-Alpes and Midi-Pyrenees (mainly for men); the lowest female mortality is found in the north of Poitou-Charentes and in Pays de la Loire. Geographical variations in life expectancy at birth are closely linked to variations in mortality above age 30, especially at ages 60-79, but not systematically with variations in child mortality. At ages 30-60, cancers remain the prime explanation (particularly lung cancer for men), together with alcoholism and suicide, which also impact the higher age groups. Cancers still account for a large share of mortality inequalities at ages 60-80, along with cardiovascular diseases, for women especially. After age 80, these diseases account for 50% of mortality variation between departements for women and 40% for men.

AB Background: Research indicates that maintaining contact either via letter or postcard with at-risk adults following discharge from care services after a suicide attempt (SA) can reduce reattempt risk. Pilot studies have demonstrated that interventions using mobile health (mHealth) technologies are feasible in a suicide prevention setting.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to report three cases of patients recruited in the Suicide Intervention Assisted by Messages (SIAM) study to describe how a mobile intervention may influence follow-up.
   Methods: SIAM is a 2-year, multicenter randomized controlled trial conducted by the Brest University Hospital, France. Participants in the intervention group receive SIAM text messages 48 hours after discharge, then at day 8 and day 15, and months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The study includes participants aged 18 years or older, who have attended a participating hospital for an SA, and have been discharged from the emergency department (ED) or a psychiatric unit (PU) for a stay of less than 7 days. Eligible participants are randomized between the SIAM intervention messages and a control group. In this study, we present three cases from the ongoing SIAM study that demonstrate the capability of a mobile-based brief contact intervention for triggering patient-initiated contact with a crisis support team at various time points throughout the mobile-based follow-up period.
   Results: Out of the 244 patients recruited in the SIAM randomized controlled trial, three cases were selected to illustrate the impact of mHealth on suicide risk management. Participants initiated contact with the emergency crisis support service after receiving text messages up to 6 months following discharge from the hospital. Contact was initiated immediately following receipt of a text message or up to 6 days following a message.
   Conclusions: This text message-based brief contact intervention has demonstrated the potential to reconnect suicidal individuals with crisis support services while they are experiencing suicidal ideation as well as in a period after receiving messages. As follow-up phone calls over an extended period of time may not be feasible, this intervention has the potential to offer simple technological support for individuals following discharge from the ED.

AB Montelukast (Singulair) has been the subject of post-marketing warnings about psychiatric events occurring that had not been identified during clinical trials. The objective of this study was to take stock of the adverse events (AEs) related to montelukast reported in France. Cases of psychiatric disorders reported to regional pharmacovigilance centers (CRPV) and the literature data were analyzed. The 56 psychiatric AEs account for 20% of all AEs reported in the montelukast CRPV: essentially sleep disorders, behavioral disorders and depression. This risk is also found in pharmacovigilance databases in other countries, especially in the North American database, which recorded a significant number of cases of "suicidality", including suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicides. Analysis of clinical efficacy studies have failed to confirm these AEs. The potential severity of these events prompts physicians to seek the existence of psychiatric disorders before prescribing the drug and to carefully monitor the occurrence" of AEs during treatment.

AB Background The screening of digital footprint for clinical purposes relies on the capacity of wearable technologies to collect data and extract relevant information's for patient management. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques allow processing of real-time observational information and continuously learning from data to build understanding. We designed a system able to get clinical sense from digital footprints based on the smartphone's native sensors and advanced machine learning and signal processing techniques in order to identify suicide risk. Method/design The Smartcrisis study is a cross-national comparative study. The study goal is to determine the relationship between suicide risk and changes in sleep quality and disturbed appetite. Outpatients from the Hospital Fundacion Jimenez Diaz Psychiatry Department (Madrid, Spain) and the University Hospital of Nimes (France) will be proposed to participate to the study. Two smartphone applications and a wearable armband will be used to capture the data. In the intervention group, a smartphone application (MEmind) will allow for the ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data capture related with sleep, appetite and suicide ideations. Discussion Some concerns regarding data security might be raised. Our system complies with the highest level of security regarding patients' data. Several important ethical considerations related to EMA method must also be considered. EMA methods entails a non-negligible time commitment on behalf of the participants. EMA rely on daily, or sometimes more frequent, Smartphone notifications. Furthermore, recording participants' daily experiences in a continuous manner is an integral part of EMA. This approach may be significantly more than asking a participant to complete a retrospective questionnaire but also more accurate in terms of symptoms monitoring. Overall, we believe that Smartcrises could participate to a paradigm shift from the traditional identification of risks factors to personalized prevention strategies tailored to characteristics for each patient.

AB Background: Psychiatric disorders are relatively common among HIV-infected patients. However, there are few studies about their potential risk factors. This analysis aimed to measure the incidence of severe psychiatric events (PE) among patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) of the French APROCO-COPILOTE (ANRS CO8) cohort, and to identify the medical and socio-behavioural correlates of their first episode of depression, suicide or suicide attempt (D/S/SA).
   Methods: APROCO-COPILOTE is a cohort of patients started on a protease inhibitor regimen between 1997 and 1999, with prospective medical standardized records and self-administered questionnaires collecting socio-demographic and socio-behavioural data. This analysis included all 11-year follow-up visits for 1,095 patients having completed baseline self-administered questionnaires. A proportional hazard Cox model was used to identify the correlates of a first D/S/SA event.
   Results: The overall prevalence of severe PE remained low: 50 patients experienced 67 events (incidence rate [95% CI] = 1.04 [0.82, 1.32] per 100 person-years). Depression (n= 16), suicides (n= 5) and suicide attempts (n= 14) were the most frequently diagnosed PE (0.54 [0.39, 0.76] per 100 person-years) among 25 patients. Multivariate results showed that unemployment, unstable housing, detectable viral load and smoking more than 20 cigarettes/day were independently associated with D/S/SA.
   Conclusions: Although the incidence of severe PE remained relatively low among the patients of APROCO-COPILOTE cohort, this study's results underline a clinically important problem in HIV-infected patients receiving cART. Furthermore, our findings not only emphasize the importance of comprehensive care, especially for socially vulnerable patients, but may also help future studies designed to assess the effectiveness of interventions in reducing the risk of PE during cART.

DE Depression; Recurrence; Suicide risk; Evaluation; Therapeutic strategies
ID IDEATION; PREDICTORS; EPISODES; DISORDER; TRIAL
AB Recurrent depression represents a major target of suicide prevention, due to its high prevalence and its strong association to Suicidal Behaviour (SB). In France, every year, nearly 11,000 persons dye from completed suicide and 200,000 attempt suicide. It has been recently shown that the adjusted population attributable fraction of the time spent depressed for suicide attempts was 78%. Thus, suicidal risk in recurrent depression being related to severity, partial response to treatment, chronicity and recurrences, the expectancies of treatment should be elevated. The assessment of the suicidal risk should involve psychiatric comorbidities that facilitate the act, particularly alcohol misuse, and also the lack of social support. The current conceptualisation of SB allows considering them as psychiatric entities per se. Consequently, the evaluation will be focused on the specific suicidal vulnerability: personal and family history of SB, hopelessness and impulsive aggression, and childhood maltreatment. The existence of this vulnerability would help to detect very high-risk patients, in order to deliver the necessary protections. Current advances provided by the use of neuroscientific tools open the way to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of SB. Based on this multifocal evaluation, the clinician would identify potential therapeutic targets. Indeed, the priority is first to treat adequately recurrent depression, as it is clear that too many patients do not receive such a treatment. Next steps would be related to the efforts allowing obtaining complete remission. Comorbid disorders would need specific care. This is the case for the suicidal comorbidity that may justify implementing specific treatments such as lithium or focused psychotherapies. Finally, innovative care management need to be developed, as they are likely to be helpful to provide continuously assistance to people who are suffering in order to avoid a suicidal act.

AB Completed suicide (CS) is a leading cause of death worldwide and its rates are available for most developed countries. On the other hand, attempted suicide (AS) is a risk factor for CS but there are limited data on its rates in various countries. In constructing a ratio for AS/CS rates, most would agree that for CS, the denominator should be the annual suicide rate ( per 100 000). As for the ratio's numerator (AS) per 100 000, there are three possible calculations: (1) annual prevalence from population surveys, (2) annual prevalence from national clinical registers or (3) lifetime prevalence from population surveys. We think that the first possibility would probably be the best choice but, unfortunately, surveys providing the annual prevalence of AS are lacking for most countries. Annual prevalence from national registers is also lacking for most countries and is contaminated by under-reporting. Therefore, in this editorial, we are left with only the last option, a ratio for lifetime prevalence of AS (per 100 000) divided by annual rate of CS (per 100 000). This ratio for AS/CS rates appears to differ substantially across countries worldwide but presents no big regional differences other than two remarkable exceptions, one per continent. In Europe, Spain and France had greater ratios (174.4 and 152.5, respectively) than Italy (64.1). In Asia/Pacific, New Zealand has a higher ratio (345.9) compared with China (75.8) and Japan (76.9). The ratio for AS/CS rates could be a good index for implementing evidence-informed decision-making regarding suicidal behaviour (SB) among health service managers, and for helping them in the allocation of health resources for the prevention of SB.

AB The authors investigated associations between social integration and all-cause and cause-specific mortality among French employees of Electricity of France-Gas of France. A total of 12,347 men aged 40-50 years in 1989 and 4,352 women aged 35-50 years in 1989 comprised the sample. In age-adjusted survival analyses for all causes of death, men who were least socially integrated were 4.42 times as likely to die during follow-up (1993-1999) as those with the highest level of integration (p < 0.0001). After adjustment for age, occupation, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, self-reported health, depressive symptoms, and region of France, relative risks for men ranging from the least socially integrated to the most socially integrated were 2.70 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17, 6.23), 1.95 (95% CI: 1.25, 3.04), and 1.37 (95% CI: 0.92, 2.04) in comparison with the most integrated men. In multivariate cause-specific analyses, isolated men had elevated risks of dying from cancer (relative risk = 3.60) and from accidents and suicide (relative risk = 3.54). Among women, in multivariate analyses, the relative risk was 3.64 (95% CI: 0.72, 18.58). The small number of deaths among women (n = 29) limited statistical power and prohibited cause-specific analyses. These results suggest that in this employed cohort of middle-aged men and women, social integration is an important predictor of mortality.

AB Because the 17 500 employees working in nuclear power plants at Electricite de France, the national power company, may be exposed to a wide variety of industrial hazards, the health insurance department of the company has set up an epidemiological surveillance programme for them. This report describes its first stage, an analysis of their health problems. This descriptive, cross-sectional and exhaustive study examined sick-leave, mortality and cancer incidence to assess the health of the employees working from 1993 through 1998. The analysis compared the employees in nuclear power plants, considered 'exposed', with the rest of the personnel of Electricite de France-Gaz de France, the 'non-exposed' (125 000 persons). Relative risks for these variables were estimated, after stratification for age, sex and work grade. Globally, the employees in the nuclear sector appeared to have fewer health problems than the other company employees. This was true regardless of age and especially for men, operating employees and supervisory employees. Nonetheless, three points must be noted: non-work accidents generated a non-significant excess of absenteeism and mortality among these employees, especially among management and supervisory personnel; suicides affected supervisors in particular; and an excess of primary malignant brain tumours affected both mortality [relative risk (RR)=1.96, n.s.] and incidence, especially among operating employees (RR=2.87, 95% confidence interval =1.00-8.43). No excess of malignant blood disease was observed. This study, performed for surveillance purposes, points to brain tumours as a problem that raises important aetioiogical questions. Research is now necessary to provide answers. Surveillance of nuclear plant employees at Electricite de France should be continued and expanded to include the study of specific occupational exposures.

TI Medical certificates and the new firearm regulation in France
SO PRESSE MEDICALE
LA French
DT Article
ID SUICIDE; RISK; LAWS
AB France has adopted a new firearms regulation. Firearms are now classified into four categories (A, B, C, and D).
   The administrative procedure for acquisition and possession of firearms of categories B and C requires medical advice.
   The medical certificate must be dated less than a month, and detail a state of health compatible with the acquisition and possession of a firearm.
   There are no guidelines mentioning the conditions that can lead to incompatibility. Compatibility does not apply to the handling and use of the firearm.
   If the applicant is undergoing or has undergone treatment in a psychiatric institution, he must also produce a medical certificate issued by a psychiatrist.
   The hunting license application requires a medical certificate mentioning a state of physical and mental health compatible with the possession of a firearm. Its validity is acquired for life.
   The practice of shooting sports or skeet requires an annual medical certificate of non-cons in reference to the rules of sports federations.

AB Background: Suicide attempts (SA) are more frequent in bipolar disorder (BD) than in most other mental disorders. Prevention strategies would benefit from identifying the risk factors of SA recurrence in BD. Substance use disorders (SUD) (including tobacco-related) are strongly associated with both BD and SA, however, their specific role for the recurrence of SA in BD remains inadequately investigated. Thus, we tested if tobacco smoking - with or without other SUDs - was independently associated with recurrent SA in BD.
   Methods: 916 patients from France and Norway with ascertained diagnoses of BD and reliable data about SA and SUD were classified as having no, single, or recurrent (>= 2) SA. Five SUD groups were built according to the presence/absence/combination of tobacco, alcohol (AUD) and cannabis use disorders. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify the correlates of SA recurrence.
   Results: 338 (37%) individuals reported at least one SA, half of whom (173, 51%) reported recurrence. SUD comorbidity was: tobacco smoking only, 397 (43%), tobacco smoking with at least another SUD, 179 (20%). Regression analysis showed that tobacco smoking, both alone and comorbid with AUD, depressive polarity of BD onset and female gender were independently associated with recurrent SA.
   Limitations: Lack of data regarding the relative courses of SA and SUD and cross-national differences in main variables.
   Conclusion: Tobacco smoking with- or without additional SUD can be important risk factors of SA recurrence in BD, which is likely to inform both research and prevention strategies.

AB Colchicine overdose is uncommon but potentially life threatening because of the high toxicity of the drug. Poisoning by colchicine may occur following ingestion of medication used in acute attacks of gout and inflammatory diseases. We describe two cases involving suicide by the ingestion of medications marketed in France. In case 1, only heart blood was taken after body external examination. In case 2 an autopsy was performed and heart blood, urine, gastric contents and bile were taken for toxicological analysis. Colchicine was assayed in biological specimens by an HPLC-DAD method, after extraction by dichloromethane at pH 8, adding prazepam as internal standard (IS). Analyses were performed on a Symetry((R)) C-8 column. Mobile phase was a gradient of acetonitrile/pH 3.8 phosphate buffer. Colchicine is eluted at 13.1 min and the method is linear for blood, urine and bile over the range 4-1000 ng/mL. LOQ is 4 ng/mL. The concentrations of colchicine detected are: case 1: heart blood 13 ng/mL; case 2: heart blood 66 ng/mL, urine 500 ng/mL, gastric content 12 ng/mL, bile 5632 ng/mL. Our findings are in the range of lethal concentrations previously described, but there is no correlation with the amount of ingested drug. Even after massive overdose, it could be impossible to detect colchicine in blood, and as there is a widespread enterohepatic recirculation before excretion in bile and feces, bile is the target sample to analyse. We conclude in both cases that the cause of death was suicide with colchicine. It appears very important to perform an autopsy in order to obtain bile, urine, heart blood and femoral blood.

TI Injury mortality in the European Union 1984-1993 - An overview
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE epidemiology; injury; mortality; trends
AB Background: Approximately 190,000 European Union (EU) citizens die annually as a result of an injury. In response, the European Commission identified accidents and injuries as a priority area for action in the field of public health in 1993. In 1984, the World Health Organization (WHO) Health for All targets were set in Europe to reduce unintentional injuries by 25% and reverse the rising trends in suicide by the year 2000. The aim of this study was to examine the trends in mortality due to externally caused physical injuries between 1984 and 1993 in the 15 countries which are currently members of the EU. Methods: Injury mortality data for all countries were obtained from the WHO and national government agencies. Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated for both unintentional and intentional injuries and examined over time. Results: Downward trends in age-standardized injury mortality due to unintentional injuries were identified in most countries. Marked variations were observed between countries, with low rates in the UK, The Netherlands and Sweden and high rates in Finland, Portugal and France. Age-standardized suicide rates decreased in most countries over the study period, with marked variations between countries. In general, countries in northern Europe experienced higher suicide rates than countries in southern Europe. Mortality rates due to homicide and other violent causes were low and relatively stable over the study period. Conclusions: Most countries appear to be on track to meet the WHO targets for unintentional injury mortality and suicide mortality. However, disparities between countries remain, for reasons that are unclear. While mortality data were valuable in describing the epidemiology of fatal injury in Europe, agreement on standardized practices of data collection, coding and analysis would improve the comparability of data between countries.

AB Objectives. - This study investigates the psychosocial outcome of adolescents admitted to the Nancy University Children's Hospital between the 1st January 1996 and 31st December 1996 following a suicide attempt, and the influence that the initial characteristics (personal, familial and social) of these patients can have on their long-term outcome. Defining prognostic factors for a long-term negative outcome in young suicide-attempters will enable us to focus our therapeutic approach on long-term prevention, as opposed to simple crisis management.
   Methods. - Longitudinal study conducted in 2006 on the basis of self-questionnaires distributed to former patients and their parents. The self-questionnaires consisted of 39 questions: 22 questions requiring yes/no answers and 12 open questions, 11 of which required a quantitative or objective answer (for example, level of education, number of cigarettes consumed, etc.), and one of which required a subjective answer (concerning perceived improvements in care received), and five satisfaction scales graded from 1 to 10 for the different parameters considered, on which responders were asked to make a cross. The questions were grouped into three main categories: family life, professional status and education, and finally physical and mental health. Patients were also asked to answer a second self-questionnaire, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale (CES-D), which provides an objective assessment of psychological well-being. Composed of 20 items (16 presented in negative form and four in positive form), this test measures the frequency of symptoms experienced in the past week. Symptom frequency is graded from 0 to 3; possible scores therefore range from 0 to 60. In France for adults, the depression threshold is considered to be 17 in men and 23 in women. The data collected from the different self-questionnaires was then cross-matched with the personal, familial and social characteristics recorded in the former patients' medical and social case notes, taken at the time of their suicide attempt in 1996.
   Results. - It was possible to trace 67.2% of the former patients and 67.4% of these answered the questionnaires, i.e. 45.3% of the initial population. The psychosocial outcome of the former patients in our study was quite encouraging, with over three quarters of former suicide-attempters stating they were happy in their personal lives, and more than half of the 65.5% actually working considering themselves to be satisfied or very satisfied with their professional lives. In addition, 66.7% of responders did not report any particular psychiatric problem. However, one patient completed suicide in the course of 1996. 17.2% of the former patients responding to the questionnaire reported a chronic psychiatric condition, sometimes accompanied by repeated suicide attempts, and 13.8% situated themselves somewhere in between. Learning difficulties and falling behind at school were evidenced as risk factors for recurrence, and personal psychiatric antecedents were evidenced as factors for poor psychosocial outcome. However, other factors, such as personal suicide attempt antecedents, were not evidenced as risk factors for poor psychosocial outcome.
   Conclusion. - The psychosocial outcome of the former patients in our study was quite encouraging. Suicide-attempters who relapsed, those who had had more school difficulties, and those who experienced a less favourable ten-year psychosocial outcome, had more personal psychiatric antecedents.

AB Medieval Black Death is believed to have killed up to one-third of the Western European population during the 14th century. It was identified as plague at this time, but recently the causative organism was debated because no definitive evidence has been obtained to confirm the role of Yersinia pestis as the agent of plague. We obtained the teeth of a child and two adults from a 14th century grave in France, disrupted them to obtain the pulp, and applied the new "suicide PCR" protocol in which the primers are used only once. There were no positive controls: Neither Yersinia nor Yersinia DNA were introduced in the laboratory. A negative result is followed by a new test using other primers; a positive result is followed by sequencing. The second and third primer pair used, coding for a part of the pla gene, generated amplicons whose sequence confirmed that it was Y. pestis in 1 tooth from the child and 19/19 teeth from the adults. Negative controls were negative. Attempts to detect the putative alternative etiologic agents Bacillus anthracis and Rickettsia prowazekii failed. Suicide PCR avoids any risk of contamination as it uses a single-shot primer-its specificity is absolute. We believe that we can end the controversy: Medieval Black Death was plague.

AB Background: Data from large nationally representative samples are needed to provide the empirical foundation to inform health policies for the prevention of suicide risk and risk behaviors in men and women.
   Methods: Data were extracted from the 2010 Health Barometer, a large telephone survey on a representative sample of the general population aged 15-85 years living in France (n=27,653), carried out by the National Institute for Health Promotion and Health Education. Data were collected between October 2009 and July 2010. A computer-assisted telephone interview (CATO system was used.
   Results: Overall, 3.9% of respondents aged 15 to 85 reported past year suicidal ideation, and 0.5% reported a suicide attempt in that time period. Increased rates of risky sexual behavior are associated with ideation and attempt in both men and women, after controlling for sociodemographic variables. Homosexuality or bisexuality are associated with suicidal ideation for both men and women, but not with attempts. Substance misuse, physical and sexual assaults are strongly associated with suicidal symptoms for both men and women. Early first experiences with sex, tobacco, and alcohol are associated with suicidal symptoms though somewhat differentially for men and women.
   Limitations: Cross-sectional survey.
   Conclusion: The findings underscore associations between suicidal thoughts and behaviors and risk behaviors such as unprotected sex and substance use in men and women throughout the lifespan. These associations highlight the need for preventive strategies such as screening for risk behaviors in order to identify men and women particularly at risk for suicidal behavior., (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Archaeologists often discuss the First People of the Western Hemisphere (the Americas) and their descendants, as Immigrants from Asia or Solutreans from France. In this paper, I discuss how archaeologists as handmaidens of the late modern state control the past in the present. This control keeps Indigenous people of the Western Hemisphere as recent migrants on a global history time scale. Arguing against recent initial migration time frames to the Western Hemisphere, I discuss the Indigenous Palaeolithic of the Americas; and what an acknowledgement of the ancient past may bring to contemporary Indigenous communities.

AB We investigated ethnic/religious mortality differentials in Bulgaria during the 1990s. The analyses employed a unique longitudinal data-set covering the entire population of Bulgaria from the census of 1992 until 1998. The mortality of Roma is very high compared to all other ethnic/religious groups. The excess applies to nearly every cause of death examined and is not entirely explained by the adverse location of Roma on social and economic variables. For young men, Muslim mortality is substantially lower than that of non-Muslims when socio-economic differences are controlled. An analysis of causes of death suggests that lower consumption of alcohol may contribute to this 'Muslim paradox'. For older Turkish women, a significant mortality disadvantage remains after controls are imposed. Suicide mortality is lower for Muslims than for Christian groups of the same ethnicity. Consistent with deteriorating economic conditions over the study period, mortality was rising, particularly for women.

TI Assessment of targeted clinical audit in suicide attempt

DE Practice improvement; Clinical audit; Suicide attempt
ID BORDERLINE PERSONALITY-DISORDER; RISK-ASSESSMENT SCALE; IDEATION SCALE;

AB Background. Suicide attempt is a serious condition that is frequent in France. Picardie ranks fifth in France for suicide (418 deaths in 2005 for 1 890 000 inhabitants). Suicide attempt is one of the priorities of the regional public health program. The National Agency for Accreditation and Evaluation in Health (Anaes) has designed targeted clinical audits (TCA) on various conditions to promote this method as the basic tool for quality improvement.
   Aim. We investigated the contribution of TCA for improving the quality of care of suicide attempt within a regional framework in Picardie.
   Methods. TCA were conducted in 12 state hospitals (eight Surgical Medicine and Obstetrics, three specialized in psychiatry, one local) between 2004 and 2006. The standards from the Anaes had 16 criteria in three fields: care on admission (n = 10); assessment of family and social environment (n = 2); management for after hospital care (n = 4). A project manager and a MD certified in health care quality supported the medical (MD certified in acute care and in psychiatry) and nursing staff of the emergency wards. All the wards analyzed 30 patients' files for the first cycle, set up and implemented improvement actions and then performed the second cycle of data collection.
   Results. All wards fully satisfied the protocol with 30 patients' files per cycle and two cycles. In all wards the teams consisted of physicians (both certified for emergency or psychiatry) and others care providers (nurses, psychologists, social workers, secretary). For the first cycle, three criteria (patient assessment, somatic examination and coordination) met the 100% target for more than half of the wards while three criteria (sociofamily and environmental evaluation, management for after hospital care, monitoring of follow-up) did not conform by more than 50% in more than half of the wards. All wards implemented changes after the first cycle with a total of 29 interventions, each one specifically devoted to improving a particular criterion. Intervention included better coordination and communication, protocol design and reminders, and information tools. The second cycle showed modest and mixed changes. After the interventions only one criteria reached the 100% target in one ward; the degree of conformity decreased in nine cases (with a mean of -23%) and increased in 16 cases (+19%). Globally, three criteria improved by less than 10% while three slightly decreased.
   Discussion. G. Shaw introduced clinical audits in 1989 to boost a poorly performing system within the "clinical governance" framework, a condition quite different from the French healthcare system in 2005. Therefore, the validation of clinical audit in a different context appeared necessary. Anaes has not yet published the evaluation of this method in a peer reviewed journal. Observed changes are modest and mixed. Moreover, the true impact on care delivery appears limited and one cannot rule out that the observed improvements are in fact related to an improvement in traceability or due to Hawthorne's effect. Quality improvement methods must be evaluated and validated by scientific methods such as for new treatments with clinical research. Conclusion. The feasibility of the method was excellent, due to the methodological and technical support, however the method did not significantly improve the quality of care. (C) L'Encephale, Paris, 2010.

AB Current methodologies employed in collecting data for suicide research present several limitations. In this article, we describe a novel method and tool to prospectively study suicidal behavior and its related risk and protective factors in different countries. This tool is a web-based database, which will initially be developed and piloted by suicide research groups from Austria, Brazil, Chile, France, Italy, Mexico, Spain, Sweden, and the US. The database will develop and integrate research tools key to collaboration, permit exploration of ethical considerations, and provide a universal interface in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, and German that will make it possible to incorporate new groups from different countries to the network. The common database resulting of this cross-national effort will allow researchers to share and compare data across countries in a large sample of patients. Using anonymous electronic records of patients, we will: 1) determine the impact of risk and protective factors (viz. aggression and religious affiliation) in different socio-cultural environments; 2) develop a clinical model of suicidal behavior that integrates the multiple dimensions implicated; 3) try differentiating the effects of biological, environmental, and cultural factors on suicidal behavior, and 4) offer the global psychiatric research community a tool that will standardize assessment across nations, allowing for better generalization.

AB The views of French, Portuguese, and Spanish people on end-of-life decisions were compared. Two hundred seventy-seven adults from Barcelona, Oporto, and Toulouse judged the acceptability of life-ending procedures in 42 scenarios composed of all combinations of 3 factors: the patient's age (30 or 80 years), the patient's life expectancy (days, weeks, or months), and the type of procedure (suicide, suicide assisted by the physician, euthanasia by the physician at the request of a suffering patient, euthanasia of a comatose patient at the family's request, euthanasia of a comatose patient as stipulated in the patient's advance directives, euthanasia of a comatose patient without advance directions and without a request from the family, or euthanasia of a suffering patient without a request from the patient). In all 3 countries, the type of procedure had the major effect. The 4 procedures implemented by the patient or at the patient's request were, on average, considered acceptable. The 2 procedures not implemented at the patient's request were considered unacceptable. Euthanasia of a comatose patient at the request of the family was judged mildly acceptable. The attitudes of the people in Toulouse, Oporto, and Barcelona concerning the acceptability of ending a patient's life have now largely converged, although Spanish participants were statistically significantly more accepting than French and Portuguese participants.

TI Gender differences in premature mortality and avoidable deaths
SO REVUE D EPIDEMIOLOGIE ET DE SANTE PUBLIQUE
LA French
DT Article
DE sex-ratio; premature mortality; causes of death
ID CARE; SEX; MEN
AB Objective: This paper aims to describe and to analyse disparities between men and women for "premature" mortality rates (deaths before 65 year-old). The study is particularly focused on "avoidable" causes of death. These types of deaths are greatly related to risk behaviours such as alcohol abuse, tobacco abuse or dangerous driving. Taking account of these indicators ("premature" and "avoidable" mortality) enables to study health status dicrepancies by gender and to characterize specific public health issues in France including high rates of "premature" mortality and risk behaviours.
   Methods: The analysis is based on exhaustive mortality data from 1980 to 1999 supplied by the Centre for epidemiology of medical causes of death (CepiDc-INSERM). Specific causes of death closely related to risk behaviours are classified as "avoidable": lung and upper airways cancers, cirrhosis, alcoholic psychosis, traffic accidents, aids and suicide. The contribution of these categories in the global male overmortality was assessed according to different demographic and geographic characteristics.
   Results: Within "premature" mortality, males experience greater burden of "avoidable" mortality (sex-ratio: 4 versus 2). The gender differences are mainly due to injuries and suicides in the younger age groups and to tobacco and alcohol-related cancers (lung and upper airways) in the 45-64 years age group. The recent decline in "premature" mortality sex-ratio is explained by an increase of these two cancers for females. Among european countries, the French male overmortality is especially marked and mainly attributable to "avoidable" causes of death.
   Conclusion: "Avoidable" and "premature" mortality provide useful tools for the follow-up of health status in France particularly because of high risk behaviours and prevention inadequacy. Reducing gender discrepancies will depend mainly on public health policies in terms of primary prevention.

AB The term 'euthanasia' is not clearly defined. Euthanasia is evoked in many aspects of terminal care: interruption of curative treatment at the end of life, palliative care or the act of deliberately provoking death through compassion. A law on 'patients' rights and the end of life', promulgated in France on 22 April 2005, led to changes in the French Code of Public Health. In this work, we have first outlined the key provisions of this law and the changes it has brought, then we have compared current legislation on the subject throughout Europe, where a rapid overview of current practice in terminal patient care revealed four different types of legislation: the first authorizes euthanasia (in the sense of provoking death, if this choice is medically justified), the second legalizes 'assisted suicide', the third, which is sometimes referred to as 'passive euthanasia', consists of the non-administration of life-sustaining treatment and, finally, the fourth prohibits euthanasia in any form whatsoever. In the last section, we have attempted to clarify the as yet indistinct notion of 'euthanasia' in order to determine whether the conception of terminal care in the Law of 22 April 2005 was consistent with that put forward by the philosopher Francis Bacon, who claimed that, 'The physician's role is to relieve pain, not only when such relief can lead to healing, but also when it can proffer a calm and trouble-free death, thus putting an end to the suffering and the agony of death' (modern adaptation of the original quote).

AB At a time when increasing importance is given to providing satisfaction to the users of health services, it is surprising that this concept has hardly ever been examined in the field of suicide. Although suicide (prevention and management) is an important part of public health, there seems to be little interest in finding out patients' opinions about the healthcare services which are offered to them. Back in 1976, some authors found a link between the risk of suicide and a low level of satisfaction of healthcare. To date, only two studies looking at management of suicidal patients have included an assessment of patient satisfaction (a strong link between dissatisfaction and suicidal risk was found). During the SYSCALL study, which measured the impact of systematic recontacting by telephone on recurrence of suicide, in the weeks following a suicide attempt, we aimed to find out if this procedure and its methods were well-accepted by the patients. When the patients were first recontacted, 13 months after the suicide attempt, and included in our study, we assessed by means of a questionnaire, their experience of being faced with this intervention, and its impact on their future. Of the 605 patients included, 312 were put into the control group, 147 were recontacted at the end of the first month, and 146 at the end of the third month. The rate of repeat suicide attempts in the year following the initial attempt, was significantly lower in the group that was recontacted after one month, than in the control group [12% against 22%; P = 0.03]. It would therefore seem that systematic recontacting by telephone one month after attempted suicide may have contributed in reducing the risk of an early repeat suicide attempt. Of the 482 patients whom we managed to contact by 13 months, 254 had filled out the questionnaire about their subjective experience, in writing or by telephone, this making a response rate of 52.7%. Amongst the patients who replied, female patients are over-represented with more of them being recontacted than males, but no difference was found in the psychiatric symptomatology observed when they were assessed and included in the study. On the other hand, we found a higher incidence of mood disorders and suicidal risk in those who were examined at the final assessment at 13 months. A large majority (78.9%) of the patients who were recontacted, considered recontacting as beneficial, 40.4% considered that it had influenced their lives, and 29.4% thought that recontacting had contributed to avoiding them making a further suicide attempt. Out of the patients recontacted, 94.5% had appreciated the person that had recontacted them, and only 8.3% had been disturbed at being recontacted by a different doctor than the one whom they had met in the Emergency department. A majority of them (54.1%) considered that telephoning was the most appropriate method for recontacting, but of those who were not convinced of being recontacted by telephone, 89.5% of them thought that consultation was the best alternative. Finally, around a third of patients would have preferred being recontacted earlier. On closer examination of the 10 recontacted patients who were dissatisfied by being recontacted, we did not find any elements to characterize them, except for a previous history of more suicide attempts in their family.
   Finally, a majority of the dissatisfied patients would have preferred being notified in advance of the time of recontacting, and half of them thought that recontacting was too late, but they were not disturbed by being contacted by a diffeent doctor. Telephone recontacting and its methods were surprisingly well-accepted by the patients, even though it is intrusive in nature and unusual in France. We think that despite the inevitable bias that is linked to it, the opinion of patients should be sought and developed in the management of patients who have attempted suicide and in the treatment of the suicidal crisis in general. Even though patients' satisfaction rates may improve the quality of treatment, we should bear in mind that listening to, noting down and examining patients' opinions and words, is in itself a useful factor for patients in their quest for improving their health.

AB To screen and clinically interview European adolescents reporting current suicidality (suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) and investigate attendance at the clinical interview.
   The Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) Project was carried out in 11 European countries. A baseline questionnaire was completed in school by 12,395 adolescents (mean age 14.9; SD 0.9). Those who screened positive for suicidality (attempting suicide and/or serious suicidal ideation or plans) in the past 2 weeks were invited to a clinical interview with a mental health professional.
   Of the 12,395 adolescents, 4.2 % (n = 516) screened positive for current suicidality. The prevalence ranged from 1.1 % in Hungary to 7.7 % in Israel (p < 0.001). 37.6 % (n = 194) of those who screened positive subsequently attended the clinical interview. Female students were more likely to attend for interview (42.0 % versus 30.6 %, p = 0.010). The attendance rate varied considerably across countries, from 5.7 % in Italy to 96.7 % in France (p < 0.001). Improved attendance was associated with using school as the only interview setting (Mean attendance rate, MAR = 88 vs. 31 %, p = 0.006) and arranging the interview within 1 week of contacting the student (MAR = 64 vs. 23 %, p = 0.013). The greater the travel time to interview, the lower the attendance rate (Pearson's r = -0.64, p = 0.034). Independent of the variation by country, at the individual level, adolescents with more depressive symptoms and a recent suicide attempt more often attended for interview.
   A high rate of current suicidality was found amongst European adolescents. However, the majority of these displayed limited help-seeking behaviour. Future studies should investigate ways of making screening programmes and other interventions more acceptable and accessible to young people, especially young males.

AB Background Previous studies of bipolar disorders indicate that childhood abuse and substance abuse are associated with the disorder. Whether both influence the clinical picture, or if one is mediating the association of the other, has not previously been investigated.
   Method A total of 587 patients with bipolar disorders were recruited from Norway and France. A history of childhood abuse was obtained using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Diagnosis and clinical variables, including substance abuse, were based on structured clinical interviews (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders or French version of the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies).
   Results Cannabis abuse was significantly associated with childhood abuse, specifically emotional and sexual abuse ((2)=8.63, p=0.003 and (2)=7.55, p=0.006, respectively). Cannabis abuse was significantly associated with earlier onset of the illness (z=-4.17, p<0.001), lifetime history of at least one suicide attempt ((2)=11.16, p=0.001) and a trend for rapid cycling ((2)=3.45, p=0.06). Alcohol dependence was associated with suicide attempt ((2)=10.28, p=0.001), but not with age at onset or rapid cycling. After correcting for possible confounders and multiple testing, a trend was observed for an interaction between cannabis abuse and childhood abuse and suicide attempt (logistic regression: r(2)=0.06, p=0.039). Significant additive effects were also observed between cannabis abuse and childhood abuse on earlier age at onset (p<0.001), increased rapid cycling and suicide attempt (logistic regression: r(2)=0.03-0.04, p<0.001). No mediation effects were observed; childhood abuse and cannabis abuse were independently associated with the disorder.
   Conclusions Our study is the first to demonstrate significant additive effects, but no mediation effects, between childhood abuse and cannabis abuse on increased clinical expressions of bipolar disorders.

SO JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS

DT Article
DE health; inequality; mortality; homicide; suicide
ID INCOME INEQUALITY; POPULATION HEALTH; ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; DETERMINANT;
   TRENDS
AB We investigate whether changes in economic inequality affect mortality in rich countries. To answer this question we use a new source of data on income inequality: tax data on the share of pretax income going to the richest 10% of the population in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US between 1903 and 2003. Although this measure is not a good proxy for inequality within the bottom half of the income distribution, it is a good proxy for changes in the top half of the distribution and for the Gini coefficient. In the absence of country and year fixed effects, the income share of the top decile is negatively related to life expectancy and positively related to infant mortality. However, in our preferred fixed-effects specification these relationships are weak, statistically insignificant, and likely to change their sign. Nor do our data suggest that changes in the income share of the richest 10% affect homicide or suicide rates. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   SPOTTED-FEVER; TRENCH FEVER; DISEASES
AB Background: The new field of paleomicrobiology allows past outbreaks to be identified by testing dental pulp of human remains with PCR.
   Methods: We identified a mass grave in Douai, France dating from the early XVIII(th) century. This city was besieged during the European war of Spanish succession. We tested dental pulp from 1192 teeth (including 40 from Douai) by quantitative PCR (qPCR) for R. prowazekii and B. quintana. We also used ultra-sensitive suicide PCR to detect R. prowazekii and genotyped positive samples.
   Results and Discussion: In the Douai remains, we identified one case of B. quintana infection (by qPCR) and R. prowazekii (by suicide PCR) in 6/21 individuals (29%). The R. prowazekii was genotype B, a genotype previously found in a Spanish isolate obtained in the first part of the XX(th) century.
   Conclusion: Louse-borne outbreaks were raging during the XVIII(th) century; our results support the hypothesis that typhus was imported into Europe by Spanish soldiers from America.

AB Objectives: To clarify how lay people and health professionals judge the acceptability of ending the life of a terminally ill patient.
   Design: Participants judged this acceptability in a set of 16 scenarios that combined four factors: the identity of the actor ( patient or physician), the patient's statement or not of a desire to have his life ended, the nature of the action as relatively active ( injecting a toxin) or passive ( disconnecting life support), and the type of suffering ( intractable physical pain, complete dependence, or severe psychiatric illness).
   Participants: 115 lay people and 72 health professionals ( 22 nurse's aides, 44 nurses, six physicians) in Toulouse, France. Main measurements: Mean acceptability ratings for each scenario for each group.
   Results: Life ending interventions are more acceptable to lay people than to the health professionals. For both, acceptability is highest for intractable physical suffering; is higher when patients end their own lives than when physicians do so; and, when physicians are the actors, is higher when patients have expressed a desire to die ( voluntary euthanasia) than when they have not ( involuntary euthanasia). In contrast, when patients perform the action, acceptability for the lay people and nurse's aides does not depend on whether the patient has expressed a desire to die, while for the nurses and physicians unassisted suicide is more acceptable than physician assisted suicide.
   Conclusions: Lay participants judge the acceptability of life ending actions in largely the same way as do healthcare professionals.

AB Background. Many studies have shown associations between a history of childhood trauma and more severe or complex clinical features of bipolar disorders (BD), including suicide attempts and earlier illness onset. However, the psychopathological mechanisms underlying these associations are still unknown. Here, we investigated whether affective lability mediates the relationship between childhood trauma and the severe clinical features of BD.
   Method. A total of 342 participants with BD were recruited from France and Norway. Diagnosis and clinical characteristics were assessed using the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS) or the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders (SCID-I). Affective lability was measured using the short form of the Affective Lability Scale (ALS-SF). A history of childhood trauma was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Mediation analyses were performed using the SPSS PROCESS macro.
   Results. Using the mediation model and covariation for the lifetime number of major mood episodes, affective lability was found to statistically mediate the relationship between childhood trauma experiences and several clinical variables, including suicide attempts, mixed episodes and anxiety disorders. No significant mediation effects were found for rapid cycling or age at onset.
   Conclusions. Our data suggest that affective lability may represent a psychological dimension that mediates the association between childhood traumatic experiences and the risk of a more severe or complex clinical expression of BD.

ID VERBAL AUTOPSIES; MORTALITY
AB The study compares the cause of death profile in a rural area of South Africa (Agincourt), with that in a rural area of West Africa (Niakhar), and in a developed country with the same life expectancy (France, 1951) in order to determine causes with high and low mortality and priorities for future health interventions. In the two African sites, causes of death were assessed by verbal autopsies, whereas they were derived from regular cause of death registration in France. Age-standardized death rates were used to compare cause-specific mortality in the three studies, Life expectancy in Agincourt was estimated at 66 years, similar to that of France in 1951, and much higher than that of Niakhar. Causes of death with outstandingly high mortality in Agincourt were violent deaths (homicide and suicide), accidents (road traffic accidents and household accidents), certain infectious diseases (HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, diarrhea and dysentery), certain chronic diseases (cancer of genital organs, liver cirrhosis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, maternal mortality, epilepsy, acute rheumatic fever, and pneumoconiosis) and malnutrition of young children (kwashiorkor). Causes of death with lower mortality than expected were primarily respiratory diseases (pneumonia, bronchitis, influenza, lung cancer), other cancers, vaccine preventable diseases (measles, whooping cough, tetanus), and marasmus. Verbal autopsies could be used in a rural area of a developing country without formal cause of death registration to identify the most salient health problems of the population, and could he compared with a formal cause of death registration system of a developed country.

AB Background. - Attempted suicide is a major risk factor of further re-attempts and death. Self-harm behaviors are related to multiple causes explaining why it is ineffective to have a single and simple strategy to offer after the clinical assessment in reducing morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, treatment adherence is known to be especially poor in a context where social connection seems compromised and a source of pain. Effective interventions can be divided into two categories: intensive intervention programs (care at home, supported by a series of brief psychotherapy interventions) and case management programs that rely on a "stay in contact" dimension. These programs, initiated by Jerome Motto and its short letters may consist of: (1) sending letters or postcards after discharge of the ER; (2) giving a crisis card that offers a crisis telephone line and a crisis unit for hospitalization if needed, and; (3) placing a phone call at some time distance after the discharge. The aim is to enhance a "connectedness feeling" with the patient. These different strategies have proven to be even more effective in some specific subgroups, highlighting the heterogeneity of this population. Each modality of contact was well accepted and generated a positive involvement of the patients.
   Method. - It led to the idea of combining these different strategies in an algorithm built on the specificity of identified subgroups. A randomized controlled trial, named ALGOS was carried out in France to test this algorithm in 2011. The algorithm consisted of: (1) delivering a crisis card for first attempters; (2) giving a phone call for re-attempters to re-assess their situation between the 10th and 21st day after their discharge, and to propose a new intervention if needed, and; (3) in case of an unsuccessful call or a refusal of proposed care, sending personalized postcards for 6 months. All of this was supported with shared information to the general practitioner of the patient. This study was further adapted to routine care in 2015 in the northern departments of France, Nord and Pas-de-Calais (4.3 million people), taking the name of VigilanS. The inclusion consists of sending a form for every patient assessed after a suicide attempt in the two departments to the medical staff of VigilanS in order to provide information about the patient and the context of his suicide attempt. The algorithm has been modified in giving the crisis card to all the patients whether it is a first attempt or not. An information letter, explaining the aim of the monitoring is also given to the patient, and to his general practitioner. The calling staff is composed of 4 nurses and 4 psychologists, all trained in suicidal crisis management. They use a phone platform located in the Emergency Medical Assistance Service (SAMU) of the Nord department on a halftime basis and manage the incoming calls from the patients as well as the outgoing calls towards the patients, their relatives and their medical contacts. A set of 4 postcards (1 per month) can be sent if needed in case of an inconclusive or a failed phone call.
   Conclusion. - Built on a monitoring philosophy, VigilanS has further developed a real crisis case management dimension requiring enough time to insure an effective medical supervision and strong networking abilities. A specific time is also needed to take care of all the technical aspects of the organization. This program expertise, designed by Northern departments to prevent suicide, can be shared with other French or even foreign territories. (C) 2018

AB Job insecurity, unemployment, and job strain can predict psychological distress and suicide risk. Young people, who are particularly at risk of suicide, may be especially vulnerable to the deterioration of labor market conditions as a result of the current economic crisis in Europe. We aimed to examine the effects of work and employment characteristics on suicidal ideation in a contemporary sample of young adults.
   Using data from a sample of French young adults surveyed in 2011 (TEMPO study, N = 1,214, 18-37 years old) and their parents who took part in a longitudinal cohort study, we used multiple logistic regression to examine the relationship between job insecurity, lifetime and recent unemployment and suicidal ideation in the past 12 months. Our analyses were adjusted for factors associated with suicidal risk including age, sex, educational attainment, living with a partner, insufficient social support, alcohol abuse, depression and parental history of depression.
   Five percent of the sample reported suicidal ideation in the preceding 12 months. Controlling for all covariates, the likelihood of suicidal ideation was associated with job insecurity (OR 2.24, 95 % CI 1.08-4.63), lifetime unemployment (OR 2.25, 95 % CI 1.17-4.29), and recent unemployment (OR 2.10, 95 % CI 1.04-4.25). After stratifying by educational attainment, the association between suicidal ideation and job insecurity was particularly notable for participants with low educational attainment (OR 9.28, 95 % CI 1.19-72.33).
   Young adults who have unstable and unfavorable employment characteristics are disproportionately likely to be suicidal, which should be monitored, particularly in times of economic downturn.

AB Over the course of the 20th century the sex differential in life expectancy at birth in the industrialized countries has widened considerably in favour of women. Starting in the early 1970s, the beginning of a reversal in the long-term pattern of this differential has been noted in some high-income countries. This study documents a sustained pattern of narrowing of this measure into the later part of the 1990s for six of the populations that comprise the G7 countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, England and Wales (as representative of the United Kingdom) and USA. For Japan, a persistence of widening sex differences in survival is noted. The sex differences in life expectancy are decomposed over roughly three decades (early 1970s to late 1990s) from the point of view of four major cause-of-death categories: circulatory diseases, cancers, accidents/violence/suicide, and,other' (residual) causes. In the six countries where the sex gap has narrowed, this has resulted primarily from reduced sex differences in circulatory disease mortality, and secondarily from reduced differences in male and female death rates due to accidents, violence and suicide combined. In some of the countries sex differentials in cancer mortality have been converging lately, and this has also contributed to a narrowing of the difference in life expectancy. In Japan, males have been less successful in reducing their survival disadvantage in relation to Japanese women with regard to circulatory disease and cancer; and in the case of accidents/violence/suicide, male death rates increased during the 1990s. These trends explain the divergent pattern of the sex difference in life expectation in Japan as compared with the other G7 nations.

AB Purpose Randomized-controlled trials and claims databases suggest that antiepileptic drug (AED) use may increase the risk of suicide attempts (SA). The present case-control study explores the impact of underlying indications on this potential association.
   Methods Physicians collected the medical history; prior 12-month drug use was obtained from standardized telephone interviews with patients. The association between AED use and SA was explored using multivariate conditional logistic regression. The analyses were replicated after stratification on depression and neurological disorders (epilepsy, migraine, and chronic neuropathic pain).
   Results Between 2008 and 2012, 506 adults with an incident SA were recruited in suicide treatment centers from across France and socio-demographically matched to 2829 controls from primary care settings. The association between AED use and odds of SA was not significant overall (odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9-2.4). No association was observed for patients with neurological disorders (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.5-2.4) as opposed to patients with depression (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0-2.5), but unmeasured confounding was suspected.
   Conclusions Our results suggest that the association observed between AED use and increased odds of non-fatal SA in patients with either a lifetime history of depression or no neurological disorder may be explained by the presence of an underlying psychiatric disorder. Accounting for underlying indications is crucial in drug safety studies, as these can cause a reported association (or lack thereof) to be misleading. This may require the prospective collection of medical data at a patient level. Copyright (C) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Background. - Isotretinoin, indicated in France in the treatment of severe acne (e.g. nodular acne, acne conglobata or acne likely to result in permanent scarring) resistant to adequate cure by standard systemic antibiotic therapy and topical treatments, has on occasion been suspected of being associated with suicide. A study involving collective reflection on this issue is presented herein.
   Methods. - The Psychodermatology Group of the French Dermatology Society, made up of dermatologists, psychiatrists, paediatric psychiatrists, psychoanalysts and clinical psychologists, met several times and views were exchanged by e-mail. The first two authors drafted the present article, which was then re-read, modified and approved by the members of the Psychodermatology Group, in particular by the co-authors. The article was then modified at the request of the proofreaders of the Annales de Dermatologie and re-read once more by members of the Psychodermatotogy Group.
   Results. - Psychological disturbances, including depression and other suicidal tendencies, are extremely common during adolescence and are clearly increased by acne, particularly where it is severe. Isotretinoin does not appear to increase this risk.
   Conclusion. - Routine screening should be performed for psychological disturbance in adolescents, particularly among those presenting acne. Prescription of isotretinoin is not contraindicated in subjects presenting depression. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Advanced molecular methods are being applied to the analysis of microbial infections in centuries-old human populations. As evidenced through work using modem animal models of infection, and if extracted under proper conditions, dental pulp can be a good source for well-preserved microbial DNA deposited inside teeth during historical bacteremias. The use of frozen and fixed tissues, bones and teeth as sampling substrates is also discussed. The methods described in this paper, including "suicide PCR", were used to analyze samples from the remains of human victims of a historical plague outbreak in France. Isolates from this historical outbreak were assigned to specific biotypes of Yersinia pestis based upon an analysis of intergenic spacer DNA.

AB Background. - In 2010, over 220 000 people attempted suicide in France, in other words up to one suicide attempt every 85 s. Numerous risk factors are involved, including iatrogenic factors. Data from previous retrospective studies indicate, on average, 5.7 % of people treated with corticosteroids develop severe steroid-induced psychiatric disorders. Steroid-induced suicidal behavior is not explicitly specified in these studies, except for one recent descriptive study. Its prevalence remains unclear and is probably underestimated.
   Case report. - We report the case of a 50-year-old woman treated by intravenous methylprednisolone for a relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis relapse. Two weeks following a five-day intravenous treatment, she attempted suicide by prescription drug overdose at home. In the two months leading up to this event, she described symptoms of major depressive disorder which were left untreated. In retrospect, high doses of corticosteroids seem to have played a significant role in the occurrence of transient acute suicidal behavior. The patient improved significantly under antidepressant treatment and was discharged after three weeks of hospitalization.
   Discussion. - This clinical case points out that corticosteroids are likely to precipitate suicidal behavior in a patient with a premorbid undiagnosed depressive disorder. Early detection of psychiatric disorders before starting corticotherapy seems to be essential. However, management strategies are not explicit enough in the literature to be recommended. Treatment discontinuation should not be done systematically, but tapering should be considered in combination with an antidepressant drug. A recent longitudinal study by Fardet et al. on oral corticotherapy suggests a positive correlation between steroids treatment and suicidal behavior. These results may support our clinical observation. In addition, the neurobiologic correlates may give credit to the underlying pathophysiology proposed as a potential explanation to the patient's sudden suicidal behavior after corticotherapy. Physicians and patients must be aware of possible risks of increased suicidality when undergoing corticosteroid treatment in order to prevent fatal outcomes for the patient.

AB Background. - Intolerable pain is often reported in suicide notes. Moreover, the frequency of life events preceding a suicidal act is high, especially interpersonal difficulties. Such adversity is the source of psychological or social pain.
   Methods. - We propose a narrative review to discuss the role of pain in the suicidal process while having a focus on social ties.
   Results. - Using Ecological Momentary Assessment in suicide attempters it has been shown that being alone increased suicidal ideation while being with close others significantly reduced this risk. At a neuroanatomical level, suicidal vulnerability is associated with dysfunctional insula activation during social exclusion, a region involved in social and physical pain processing. Social pain elicited by social exclusion or devaluation shares common neurobiological patterns with physical pain. It is also an exemplar of psychological pain. Despite the complexity of its definition, higher psychological pain levels are associated with suicidal ideation and acts. Finally, intense physical pain or chronic pain are strong risk factors of suicidal ideation and act. Interestingly, suicide notes often report the existence of an intolerable pain. Presence of psychological pain and difficulties in communication predict the lethality and seriousness of suicide attempts. Moreover, presence of psychological pain is associated with more impulsive choices in suicidal patients, suggesting that a suicidal act is a means to escape intolerable suffering despite negative long-term consequences (i.e. death). Analgesics are usually used to get relief from pain but are also frequently involved in suicidal overdoses. It has been shown that opioid analgesics are associated with an increased risk of suicide. Higher consumption of opioid analgesics has been shown in suicidal patients in comparison to patients with history of depression but no suicidal act and healthy controls whereas non-suicidal patients were those reporting higher presence of pain in comparison to healthy controls. It may suggest that opioids are being used by suicidal patients to get relief from psychological/social pain rather than from physical pain. Involvement of opioidergic system in suicidal process opens new therapeutic strategies. Recently, the time-limited, short-term use of very low dosages of sublingual buprenorphine (vs. placebo) was associated with decreased suicidal ideation and mental pain in severely suicidal patients without substance abuse. In a randomized controlled trial comparing a 7-week acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) versus relaxation group, as adjunct to treatment as usual for adult outpatients suffering from a current suicidal behavior disorder, ACT has shown its effectiveness in reducing suicidal ideation and psychological pain. Evidence indicates that maintaining contact either via letter, postcard or telephone with at-risk adults following discharge from care services after a suicide attempt can reduce reattempt risk. Based on these results, a preventive program of recontact for suicide attempters, VIGILANS, has been developed in France in usual care.
   Conclusion. - The approach of the suicidal issue by the angle of pain and social disconnection offers new advances to improve clinical assessment, to identify new biological pathways involved in suicidal risk, and to propose innovative therapeutic and preventive actions.

AB Background: The aim of this study was to compare inequalities in mortality (all causes and by cause) by occupational group and educational level between men and women living in France in the 1990s.
   Methods: Data were analysed from a permanent demographic sample currently including about one million people. The French Institute of Statistics (INSEE) follows the subjects and collects demographic, social and occupational information from the census schedules and vital status forms. Causes of death were obtained from the national file of the French Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM). A relative index of inequality (RII) was calculated to quantify inequalities as a function of educational level and occupational group. Overall all-cause mortality, mortality due to cancer, mortality due to cardiovascular disease and mortality due to external causes (accident, suicide, violence) were considered.
   Results: Overall, social inequalities were found to be wider among men than among women, for all-cause mortality, cancer mortality and external-cause mortality. However, this trend was not observed for cardiovascular mortality, for which the social inequalities were greater for women than for men, particularly for mortality due to ischaemic cardiac diseases.
   Conclusions: This study provides evidence for persistent social inequalities in mortality in France, in both men and women. These findings highlight the need for greater attention to social determinants of health. The reduction of cardiovascular disease mortality in low educational level groups should be treated as a major public health priority.

TI Jean Gabin: Doomed worker-hero of a doomed France (Cinema)
SO INTERNATIONAL LABOR AND WORKING-CLASS HISTORY
LA English
DT Article
AB The characters portrayed by Jean Gabin, a true star of 1930s films, are from the working class but lack the usual attributes; they are more part of the popular classes but without political identities. They are vividly urban, masculine, and individualistically French. Their antisocial tendencies and their helplessness in the face of outside forces beyond their control leading to violent escapes into oblivion made them seem heroic. Their often dual existence as criminal/legionnaire and worker played on the frissons long associated in France with the combination 'working classes, dangerous classes'. These attributes made the Gabin characters more than members of the working or popular classes and gave them a classless appeal as 'everyman', with much the same universal appeal as Charlie Chaplin had for his audience. The collective psychological profile of the Gabin-everyman includes: alienation, depression, entrapment, helplessness, and escapes into nostalgia ending in violence and self-destruction. In his nine films from 1935 to 1939, there are eight murders and seven suicides! The atmosphere of Gabin's environment is one of doomed destiny, a fate created by forces beyond his control. The fate of Gabin's characters is in part inspired by an existing climate of hopelessness in French society and at the same time amplifies and reinforces it. The crisis in French society at which this study is directed had its denouement in the collapse of France in June 1940, resulting from immediate temporal and long-range structural problems. By 1939 France had become a stalemated society. Gabin's imagined presence at the side of his popular audience in its experience of these difficult times suggests a bonding between audience and star whereby the performance of the latter and the daily struggles of the former become one (the kind of convergence all film makers strive for but very rarely achieve.)

ID HUMAN-RIGHTS; PUNISHMENT; SOCIETY
AB A new punitive approach in the French prison sector has emerged as a result of the European Court of Human Rights and the French administrative courts exerting pressure on prison governors in response to the complaints made by prisoners' families, the demands of human rights groups and the requirements of human rights protection bodies. By publicizing cases of suicide and using strategic litigation based on the right to life, human rights groups and barristers have put the prison administration under pressure. The resultant risk management policy and death-avoidance approach are not linked to the decline of the welfare state, as claimed by new penology scholars, but rather to a shared risk management thinking between the prison administration and human rights groups.

DE Death certificates; Cause of death; Forensic medicine; Autopsy; Suicide
AB Background. - The purpose of this study is to assess variability in death certificates' transmission related to suspicious deaths.
   Methods. - The medical part of death certificates of suspicious deaths (violent or sudden deaths, unknown or ill-defined causes of death) were examined. We studied the frequency of suspicious deaths, in France, for deaths aged under 65, from 2000 to 2013, searching for temporal (2000-2013) and spatial correlations between unknown causes of death and other suspicious causes, and report of anautopsy. These results were compared with external data.
   Results. - Standardized proportion of deaths by unknown cause more than doubled during the study period (from 3.4 to 7.5%). The spatial correlation was strongly negative between standardized proportions of unknown causes of death and violent deaths (ICC = -0.80). Report of autopsy varied with cause of suspicious death and estimated zone of the forensic institute. The distribution was consistently distributed with external data, except for homicides.
   Conclusion. - Information transmission to CepiDc-Inserm needs to be improved in case of suspicious death, in particularly from forensic institutes. This study emphasizes the urgent need for a complementary form to the death certificate. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction > The psychological consequences of G disaster are usually analyzed in terms of their immediate impact, but since September 11, 2001, several studies hove examined its effects on suicidal behavior. The aim of our survey was to analyze the associations between psychiatric disorders in a population and the heat wave that hit France in August 2003, during which 14 000 more people died than in comparable periods.
   Methods > We studied a population of patients seeking emergency psychiatric core at a general hospital in Paris. We compared the number of patients and their reasons for consultation between June and October in 2002 and in 2003. We focused on suicidal behavior depressive disorders, anxiety and stress disorder analyzing 1632 cases for these two periods.
   Results > Suicidal behavior Was significantly less prevalent during the heat wove than in 2002: only 12.3% of the patients were diagnosed with suicidal behavior in 2003 compared with 25% in 2002. At the same time, the percentage of patients admitted to the psychiatric deportment was substantially higher in 2003 than in 2002: 32. 1 % in 2003 compared with 15.4% in 2002.
   Discussion > These results show that the social cohesion induced by disasters con produce social support that con be important in suicidal behavior. Reinforcing it may be crucial to reinforce for suicide prevention.

AB Background. - The aim of this study was to describe potential associations between suicidal behaviors and psychoactive substance uses among adolescents.
   Methods. - A cross-sectional, national survey representative of adolescents aged 17, living in continental France, was conducted in 2014. A total of 22,023 adolescents answered an anonymous, self-administered questionnaire about their health and their use of psychoactive substances. Suicidal risk was assessed by means of a 4-level indicator [1. No depression, as stipulated by the Adolescent Depression Rating Scale (ADRS); 2. Depression, no suicidal ideation, no suicidal attempts; 3. Depression with suicidal ideation; 4. Depression with suicidal attempts]. Multivariate logistic regressions were conducted to identify the factors significantly related to frequent substance uses.
   Results. - Three percent of adolescents (1.8% of boys vs. 3.7% of girls) were labeled as suffering from severe depression, 10% stated they had suicidal thoughts during the last year and 3% attempted to commit suicide at least once in their lifetime. The results support the view of a gradient between suicidal risk severity and regular use of tobacco and cannabis. The association with regular alcohol use appears somewhat weaker.
   Conclusion. - Suicidal behaviors and regular substance uses are significantly related but also mediated by adolescents' mental health. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI Factors Affecting the Agreement Between Emergency Psychiatrists and
   General Practitioners Regarding Involuntary Psychiatric Hospitalizations
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

DT Article
ID DECISIONS; ADMISSION; COERCION
AB Important discrepancies exist between physicians in deciding when to perform involuntary hospitalization measures (IHMs). The factors underlying these differences are poorly known. We conducted a two-year single-center retrospective study in France on patients who were referred to the emergency department (ED) with an IHM certificate written by a private-practice General Practitioner (GP). For each consultation, the official IHM motive was categorized into four groups: Suicide; Psychosis, Mania, or Melancholia (PMM); Agitation; and Other. The alcohol status of the patient was also noted. The factors underlying the ED psychiatrists' confirmation of the use of IHMs were determined using a logistic regression model. One hundred eighty-nine cases were found (165 patients; 44.2 +/- 16 years, 41.3% women). The ED psychiatrists confirmed the use of IHMs in 123 instances (65.1% agreement rate). Multivariate analyses found that IHM disagreement was significantly associated with patient alcohol status and the reason for referral. Specifically, there was an increased risk of IHM disagreement when the patient had an alcohol-positive status (OR = 15.80; 95% CI [6.45-38.67]; p < 0.0001) and when the motive for IHM was "agitation" compared with "suicide" (OR = 11.44; 95% CI[ 3.38-38.78]; p < 0.0001). These findings reflect significant disparities between GPs and ED psychiatrists regarding the decision to proceed to an IHM.

AB The French Mental Health Law of 5 July 2011 stipulates that psychiatric patients can be hospitalized in five different ways. Three types of admission for involuntary treatment are defined under "admission at the request of a third party". The first is "psychiatric care at the request of a third party", followed by two "exceptional" admission measures in the case of an emergency ("emergency psychiatric care at the request of a third party") and imminent danger ("psychiatric care in the case of imminent danger"). The aim of this retrospective study was to determine whether the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients involuntarily admitted to psychiatric care in a French regional teaching hospital differed according to the administrative measure enabling this type of placement. We reviewed a sample of admission medical certificates issued between 1 July 2014 and 30 June 30, 2015 at the Tours University Hospital (France) for psychiatric care without consent. We recorded the following patient characteristics. Collected data included the type of care measure, age, gender, and the presence or absence of various clinical syndromes, such as suicidal thoughts and behavioral, depressive, manic or psychotic disorders. Multivariable analysis showed that a psychotic syndrome was a risk factor for hospitalization under "exceptional" measures and a behavioral syndrome for hospitalization under "psychiatric care at the request of a third party". Several clinical profiles emerged, but suicidal thoughts did not appear to be associated with the type of measures taken. In our sample, the choice of measure applied does not appear to rely on the only clinical observation at admission, contrary to what was planned in the Law.

AB Using data from a large national representative survey on sexual behavior in France (Contexte de la Sexualit, en France), this study analyzed the relationship between a multidimensional measure of sexual orientation and psychoactive substance use and depression. The survey was conducted in 2006 by telephone with a random sample of the continental French speaking population between the ages of 18 and 69 years. The sample used for this analysis consisted of the 4,400 men and 5,472 women who were sexually active. A sexual orientation measure was constructed by combining information on three dimensions of sexual orientation: attraction, sexual behavior, and self-definition. Five mutually exclusive groups were defined for men and women: those with only heterosexual behavior were divided in two groups whether or not they declared any same-sex attraction; those with any same-sex partners were divided into three categories derived from their self-definition (heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual). The consumption of alcohol and cannabis, which was higher in the non-exclusively heterosexual groups, was more closely associated with homosexual self-identification for women than for men. Self-defined bisexuals (both male and female) followed by gay men and lesbians had the highest risk of chronic or recent depression. Self-defined heterosexuals who had same-sex partners or attraction had levels of risk between exclusive heterosexuals and self-identified homosexuals and bisexuals. The use of a multidimensional measure of sexual orientation demonstrated variation in substance use and mental health between non-heterosexual subgroups defined in terms of behavior, attraction, and identity.

AB An estimated 800 000 suicide deaths occur worldwide. The global suicide rate is 11.4 per 100 000 population; 15.0/100 000 for males and 8.0/100 000 for females. Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year olds. In a collaborative effort to reduce the high rates of suicide and mental health problems among youth across Europe, the European Union 7(th) Framework funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. SEYLE is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to promote mental health and healthy lifestyles, while preventing psychopathology and suicidal behaviours among adolescents. The epidemiological data on 11,110 pupils in the age group 14-16 years, with a mean age of 14.8 years (SD +/- 0.8), who were recruited from 168 schools across 10 European Union countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden as the coordinating centre showed the following prevalences: alcohol use (13.4%), smoking (30.9%), physical inactivity (32.8%), pathological Internet use (4.4%) and sleeping on average 7.7 hours per night. In terms of reproductive health, the prevalence of sexual debut was 18.8% for the total sample. Pupils aged >= 16 years had a higher prevalence (38%) of sexual debut compared to those aged <= 15 years (13.2%). Males had a higher prevalence (21.3%) than females (16.9%). Three clusters of adolescents were identified: 57.8% with low frequency of all risk-behaviours; 13.2% with high frequency of all risk behaviours; and 29% so-called `invisible' risk group, which did not show any striking externalised risk behaviours, but scored positive for high use of Internet/TV/videogames, sedentary behaviour and reduced sleep. When comparing pupils in the `invisible' risk group with those in the high-risk group, similar prevalence rates of anxiety (8% vs. 9.2%), subthreshold depression (33.2% vs. 34%), depression (13.4% vs. 14.7%) and suicidal thoughts (42.2% vs. 44%) were observed. Pupils meeting the criteria of depression and subthreshold depression were 10.5% and 32%, respectively. Prevalence rates for anxiety and subthreshold anxiety was 5.8% and 29.2%, respectively. Lifetime prevalence of deliberate self-injurious behaviours (D-SIB) was 27.6%, with higher rates reported for occasional D-SIB (19.7%) compared to repetitive D-SIB (7.8%). Suicidal ideation was present in approximately one third of the sample (32.3%). More than four percent (4.2%) of the sample reported attempting suicide during their lifetime, with a significantly higher prevalence among girls (5.1% vs. 3.0%, p<0.05). In comparing the effectiveness of the three active SEYLE interventions, based on three specific preventive strategies directed towards teachers and school staff, professionals and pupils in comparison to a control group, the intervention empowering pupils, called the Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) showed significant results in preventing new cases of suicide attempts, severe suicidal ideation with plans and depression. More than a 50% reduction of incident cases of suicide attempts (OR: 0.45 [0.24 - 0.85]; p=0.014), and of incident cases of severe suicidal ideation and plans (OR: 0.50 [0.27 - 0.92]; p=0.025), as well as a significant reduction by 30% of incident cases with moderate to severe depression (OR: 0.71 [0.52- 0.97]; p=0.031) was observed.

TI Psychiatric Disorders and Montelukast in Children: A Disproportionality
   Analysis of the VigiBase®
SO DRUG SAFETY
LA English
DT Article
ID CLINICAL-TRIALS; FOLLOW-UP; ASTHMA; SUICIDE; RISK
AB Introduction In 2008, the US FDA issued an alert about an increased risk of psychiatric events associated with montelukast. Recent national pharmacovigilance analyses in Sweden, France and Spain detected a potential increase in reporting risk of the association.
   Aim Our objective was to analyse spontaneous reports of psychiatric events in children and adolescents worldwide treated with montelukast.
   Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) recorded up to 1 January 2015 in the World Health Organization (WHO) database (VigiBase (R)), in which montelukast was associated with 'psychiatric disorders'. We used the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) approach for signal generation.
   Results A total of 14,670 ICSRs for montelukast were recorded, of which 2630 corresponded to psychiatric disorders in people aged <18 years. The main symptoms reported for infants (aged<2 years) were sleep disorders, for children (aged 2-11 years) the main symptoms were depression/anxiety, and for adolescents (aged 12-17 years) they were suicidal behaviour and depression/anxiety. Suicidal behaviour was over-represented in all age groups with information component (IC) values that reached 5.01 in children and 3.85 in adolescents. Unexpectedly, completed suicides were reported more frequently for children (IC: 3.15; IC025: 1.98) than for adolescents (IC: 3.11; IC025: 2.61) or the total population (IC 1.95; IC025: 1.73).
   Conclusions Neuropsychiatric disorders as side effects of montelukast were more frequently reported for children than for adults. Infants and children seem to be more prone to sleep disturbances, whereas adolescents present symptoms of depression/anxiety and psychotic reactions more often. Suicidal behaviour and completed suicide appear to be more frequently reported than previously thought in practice. Risk management plans and epidemiological studies are needed to quantify the risk. Practitioners should be aware of the risk of neuropsychiatric events associated with montelukast use, and should advise the patient and report new cases.

AB Context. - Management of the end of life is a major social issue which was addressed in France by law, on April 22nd 2005. Nevertheless, a debate has emerged within French society about the legalization of euthanasia and/or assisted suicide (E/AS). This issue raises questions for doctors and most especially for anesthetists and intensive care physicians.
   Objective. - To highlight, dispassionately and without dogmatism, key points taken from the published literature and the experience of countries which have legislated for E/AS.
   Results. - The current French law addresses most of the end of life issues an intensive care physician might encounter. It is credited for imposing palliative care when therapies have become senseless and are withdrawn. However, this requirement for palliative care is generally applied too late in the course of a fatal illness. There is a great need for more education and stronger incentives for early action in this area. On the rare occasions when E/AS is requested, either by the patient or their loved-ones, it often results from a failure to consider that treatments have become senseless and conflict with patient's best interest. The implementation of E/AS cannot be reduced to a simple affirmation of the Principle of autonomy. Such procedures present genuine difficulties and the risk of drift.
   Conclusion. - We deliver a message of prudence and caution. Should we address painful end of life and moral suffering issues, by suppressing the subject, i.e. ending the patient's life, when comprehensive palliative care has not first been fully granted to all patients in need of it ?

AB Introduction: When evaluating gender differences in mental disorders and suicidality, specifically between European countries, studies are sparse and frequently hindered by methodological issues, such as the limited items evaluated and inconsistent sampling designs.
   Methods: In ten European countries participating in the World Mental Health Survey Initiative, lifetime internalizing and externalizing disorders and suicidality were assessed among 37,289 respondents. Disorders were classified using DMS-IV criteria. Odds ratios (OR) for gender differences were calculated using logistic regression, while trends across age groups were tested via gender x age interaction.
   Results: Within countries, prevalence of any lifetime internalizing disorder ranged from 10.8% to 44.5% among women and 5.9% to 26.5% among men, with women having consistently higher odds than men (OR range: 1.52-2.73). Prevalence of any lifetime externalizing disorders ranged from 02% to 6.6% among vvomen and 2.2% to 22.4% among men, with women having consistently lower odds than men (OR range: 0.05-0.35). Any lifetime suicide attempt was found in 0.8-5.4% of women and 0.3-2.4% of men, showing inconsistent relative gender differences across countries (OR range: 0.77-4.72). Significant effects in gender OR across age groups were not observed for any internalizing disorder or suicide attempt, yet vvere present for any externalizing disorder in France (p=0.01), the Netherlands (p=0.05), and Spain (p = 0.02).
   Limitations: Mental disorders were assessed with the CIDI 3.0 and not psychiatric evaluations. Suicidality does not fully represent more important clinical events, such as suicide mortality.
   Conclusions: Consistent across European countries, internalizing disorders are more Common among women and externalizing disorders among men, whereas gender differences in suicidality varied. (C)2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO CRITICAL QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB This essay reads Michel Houellebecq's 2015 novel Soumission within the context of the current political crisis in France, which is read as a crisis of Western (neo) liberalism, by tracing a critique of sexual-economic liberalism as 'regime of desire' that has run throughout the last two decades of Houellebecq's oeuvre. It argues that Soumission represents a culmination of Houellebecq's project, as it moves beyond critique of contemporary liberalism into a speculative account of how we might live beyond the historical malaise liberalism has bequeathed us: the metaphysical principle of 'submission'. However, the essay points out, Houellebecq's own account is vitiated by its own structural misogyny, something it shares with the sexual-economic liberalism it excoriates. The essay finishes by suggesting that it is only by seeing this structural misogyny that we might recuperate a notion of 'submission' that moves beyond subject-object exploitation.

AB Do institutions of citizenship shape public opinion among Muslims in the West? Pitched debates about the future of multiculturalism give strong theoretical reason to think that institutions would cause cross-national variation in minority opinion. Institutions set rules for national integration and communal recognition and send signals regarding social views of diversity. Testing these theorised links, however, requires two steps. First, careful conceptualisation of citizenship, both in individual and communal dimensions, categorises states' citizenship regimes. Second, unique cross-national polling of Muslim minorities in France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States permits analysis of the relationship between institutions and minority political attitudes. Findings demonstrate strong institutional effects on attitudes. However, these effects vary depending on the question asked. Institutions impact on cross-national variation in opinion regarding national identification and women's place in society. There is no evidence of institutional roots of support for suicide terrorism.

AB Respect for guidelines and recommendations is the rule for prescribing psychotropic drugs in prison.
   The prevalence of psychiatric disorders and suicide in prison is higher than in general population.
   In France, 50 % of prisoners are treated with a psychotropic medication.
   Insomnia is a common complaint. It should not be trivialized and clinical psychiatric examination should be complete particularly in search of an underlying depressive syndrome. The lifestyle and dietary rules should not be neglected despite the difficulties associated with living conditions in prison and expectations of immediate results from both patients and sometimes the prison administration or justice. Given the prevalence of addictions in the prison population, vigilance is required in preventing withdrawal, especially at the beginning of incarceration.
   Indications for initiation and the prescription of opioid substitution treatment ore the some as free environment. Individualization of delivery and confidentiality must be applied.

TI Accounting for taste American collectors and twelfth-century French
   sculpture
SO JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF COLLECTIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB A taste for the Middle Ages had existed in the United States since at least the mid-nineteenth century, when architectural revivalism contributed to its popularity. Yet art collectors - with a few notable exceptions showed little interest in the authentic works of the period. In the early decades of the twentieth century, however, significant sculptures of the twelfth century entered American private and public collections. A seemingly sudden enthusiasm for large-scale sculpture drew progressively more works to the market. Several examples demonstrate well the new lengths to which American collector would go. Particular attention is given here to sculptures originating from Parthenay in southwestern France, whose entrance to the market brought claims of forgery, theft, suicide, and even murder. It seems that Parthenay's sculptures, like others purchased by other collectors and museums, appealed to a romanticized conception of the High Middle Ages that took its cue from an imagined noble, aristocratic type.

DT Article
DE Philanthropy; Religious giving; Secular giving; Volunteering;
   Christianity; Islam; Hinduism; The Netherlands
AB Using survey data from the Netherlands, we find that Muslims have relatively high levels of religious philanthropic behavior and relatively low levels of secular philanthropic behavior, whereas Hindus have relatively low levels of religious philanthropic behavior and higher levels of secular philanthropic behavior. Results indicate that the community explanation and the conviction explanation of the relationship between religion and philanthropic behavior are both valid to some extent when it comes to differences in philanthropic behavior between Christians, Muslims, and Hindus. In addition, we find a relationship between group orientation in worship rituals on the relation between religion and philanthropic behavior. The more group-oriented the worship rituals, the stronger the relation between religion and philanthropic behavior. The results suggest that Durkheim's theory (La Suicide: Etude de Sociologie. Presses Universitaires de France, Paris, 1897) may only be valid in a Christian context.

AB Pesticides are ubiquitous neurotoxicants, and several lines of evidence suggest that exposure may be associated with depression. Epidemiologic evidence has focused largely on organophosphate exposures, while research on other pesticides is limited. We collected detailed pesticide use history from farmers recruited in 19982000 in France. Among 567 farmers aged 3778 years, 83 (14.6) self-reported treatment or hospitalization for depression. On the basis of the reported age at the first such instance, we used adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios and 95 confidence intervals for depression (first treatment or hospitalization) by exposure to different pesticides. The hazard ratio for depression among those who used herbicides was 1.93 (95 confidence interval (CI): 0.95, 3.91); there was no association with insecticides or fungicides. Compared with nonusers, those who used herbicides for 19 years and 19 years (median for all herbicide users, 19 years) had hazard ratios of 1.51 (95 CI: 0.62, 3.67) and 2.31 (95 CI: 1.05, 5.10), respectively. Similar results were found for total hours of use. Results were stronger when adjusted for insecticides and fungicides. There is widespread use of herbicides by the general public, although likely at lower levels than in agriculture. Thus, determining whether similar associations are seen at lower levels of exposure should be explored.

AB This study explored the extent to which the psychological distress of women is related to their motherhood status. A representative sample of 6970 women, aged 20-59, living in France, was interviewed. This analysis was restricted to the 2799 women aged between 25 and 39, 307 of whom had had a baby in the last year. Several indicators of psychological distress were used, including the 12-item General Health Questionnaire, psychotropic drug use and suicide attempts. Women with babies under the age of 12 months presented no more psychological problems than the other women. The proportion of respondents with scores above 5 for the GHQ was 8.7% for mothers with young babies, 11.4% for mothers of an older child and 12.0% for childless women. Adjusting for age, education, employment and couple status, no differences were observed between the three groups of women, except for a lower level of psychotropic drug use among the mothers of young babies. Overall, regardless of maternal status, a high proportion of women showed symptoms of anxiety and depression. Thus, research and clinical efforts should focus on risk factors for psychological distress in women and on preventive measures beyond the post-partum period.

AB The August 2003 heat wave in France resulted in many thousands of excess deaths particularly of elderly people. Individual and environmental risk factors for death among the community-dwelling elderly were identified. We conducted a case-control survey and defined cases as people aged 65 years and older who lived at home and died from August 8 through August 13 from causes other than accident, suicide, or surgical complications. Controls were matched with cases for age, sex, and residential area. Interviewers used questionnaires to collect data. Satellite pictures provided profiles of the heat island characteristics around the homes. Lack of mobility was a major risk factor along with some pre-existing medical conditions. Housing characteristics associated with death were lack of thermal insulation and sleeping on the top floor, right under the roof. The temperature around the building was a major risk factor. Behaviour such as dressing lightly and use of cooling techniques and devices were protective factors. These findings suggest people with pre-existing medical conditions were likely to be vulnerable during heat waves and need information on how to adjust daily routines to heat waves. In the long term, building insulation and urban planning must be adapted to provide protection from possible heat waves.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
ID BUSINESS-CYCLE; UNITED-STATES; UNEMPLOYMENT; SUICIDE
AB Thinking in France on relations between crime rate trend and evolution of socio-economic context over time is underdeveloped. Recent studies in the United Kingdom suggest that the business cycle influences fluctuations in both property offenses and violent crime. Whereas pre-1970 research in the United States only rarely pointed up a direct link between crime rate and unemployment, post-1970 American studies are dominated by demonstrations of a direct correlation between the two. In this article, analysis of trends in unemployment, prices and wages, marriage among men, and schooling leads to an interpretation of delinquency and crime over the long term in which it is affirmed that an increase in opportunity, such as that attested to by increased consumer prices and wages over time, has a more pronounced role in the strong growth period of the cycle and influences property offenses more than violent crime, and that unemployment among young people without educational degrees is a factor working in favor of both theft and violent crime. This phenomenon was partially masked in periods where it was common to remain in the school system, such as early in the last decade of the twentieth century in France. Lastly, the fact that starting in the early 1980s fewer young people settled in couples and, more generally, the tension in relations between the sexes may also have worked to favor delinquency.

AB Rationale Several case-reports suggest that the use of quinolones may increase the risk of psychiatric adverse reactions such as suicidal behaviors.
   Objectives The aim of this study is to investigate whether there is a safety signal for quinolone-related suicidal behaviors in a global adverse drug reactions database.
   Methods All antibiotic-related adverse reactions were extracted from VigiBase, the World Health Organization (WHO) global Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) database. Disproportionality analyses were performed to investigate the association between reports of suicidal behavior and exposure to quinolones, in comparison with other antibiotics.
   Results From December 1970 through January 2015, we identified 992,097 antibiotic-related adverse reactions. Among them, 608 were quinolone-related suicidal behaviors including 97 cases of completed suicides. There was increased reporting of suicidal behavior (adjusted reporting odds ratios [ROR] 2.78, 95 % CI 2.51-3.08) with quinolones as compared to other antibiotics. Candidate mechanisms for quinolone-induced suicidal behaviors include GABA(A) antagonism, activation of NMDA receptors, decreased serotonin levels, oxidative stress, and altered microRNA expressions.
   Conclusions We found a strong safety signal suggesting an increased risk of suicidal behaviors associated with quinolone use. Plausible psychopharmacological mechanisms could underlie this association. Further investigations are urgent to confirm and better understand these findings.

AB Multiple substances (alcohol, tobacco, cannabis and other illicit drugs (OID)) have been frequently used in early adolescents maybe due to school, violence and mental-health difficulties. We investigated the associations between substance-use patterns and related difficulties among 1559 middle-school adolescents from north-eastern France (mean age 13.5 +/- 1.3). They completed a questionnaire including socioeconomic features, school, violence and mental-health difficulties (school grade repetition, sustained physical/verbal violence, sexual abuse, perpetrated violence, poor social support, depressive symptoms and suicide attempt; cumulated number noted SVMDscore) and the time of their first occurrence during the life course. Data were analyzed using logistic and negative binomial regression models. Alcohol, tobacco, cannabis and OID use affected 35.2, 11.2, 5.6 and 2.8% of the subjects respectively. The risk of using tobacco only, alcohol and tobacco, alcohol plus tobacco and cannabis, or all alcohol, tobacco, cannabis and OID strongly increased with the SVMDscore (socioeconomic features-adjusted odds ratio reaching 85). The risk began in early years in middle schools and then steadily increased, more markedly for elevated SVMDscore. Exposure to several SVMDs may be a transmission vector towards the substance use, starting mostly with alcohol/tobacco, and then shifting to cannabis/OID. These findings help to understand substance-use risk patterns and identify at-risk adolescents.

AB Background Despite prevention programs, a rising incidence of sexually transmitted infections is currently reported in France.
   Aims Research factors associated with risky sexual behaviors (RSBs) among the French population.
   Methods Subjects aged 15-54 years from the French national survey 'Barome` tre sante '2010' were included (n = 16 598). RSB was defined as having multiple partners or failure to use condom at first intercourse with a new partner over past 12 months. Factors associated were identified using one logistic regression by gender.
   Results The overall RSB prevalence was 9.5%, being higher among men (P<0.001). Factors associated with RSB for both genders were young age (OR = 1.5), single status (men: OR = 7.1; women: OR = 6.4), homosexual relations (men: OR = 2.0; women: OR = 3.2), low incomes (men: OR = 1.5; women: OR = 1.4), use of cannabis (men: OR = 1.4; women: OR = 3.0). Men-specific factors were history of STI (OR = 2.5) and alcohol drunkenness (OR = 2.2), and women-specific factors history of suicide attempt (OR = 1.6) and history of sexual assault (OR = 1.6).
   Conclusions Confirming most of known determinants of RSB, this study also identified some specific risky patterns for whom preventive actions can be developed: multiusers of psychoactive substances, people living with low incomes, women having sex with women or presenting history of psychological vulnerability (suicide attempts, sexually harassed).

AB Suicide attempt (SA) is common in early adolescence and the risk may differ between boys and girls in nonintact families partly because of socioeconomic, school, and health-related difficulties. This study explored the gender and family disparities and the role of these covariates. Questionnaires were completed by 1,559 middle-school adolescents from north-eastern France including sex, age, socioeconomic factors (family structure, nationality, parents' education, father's occupation, family income, and social support), grade repetition, depressive symptoms, sustained violence, sexual abuse, unhealthy behaviors (tobacco/alcohol/cannabis/hard drug use), SA, and their first occurrence over adolescent's life course. Data were analyzed using Cox regression models. SA affected 12.5% of girls and 7.2% of boys (P < 0.001). The girls living with parents divorced/separated, in reconstructed families, and with single parents had a 3-fold higher SA risk than those living in intact families. Over 63% of the risk was explained by socioeconomic, school, and health-related difficulties. No family disparities were observed among boys. Girls had a 1.74-time higher SA risk than boys, and 45% of the risk was explained by socioeconomic, school, and mental difficulties and violence. SA prevention should be performed in early adolescence and consider gender and family differences and the role of socioeconomic, school, and health-related difficulties.

TI Burnout syndrome in orthopaedic and trauma surgery residents in France:
   A nationwide survey
SO ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article

   Inventory
ID QUALITY-OF-LIFE; PROFESSIONAL BURNOUT
AB Background: Burnout syndrome is one of the manifestations of distress in healthcare workers and is characterised by emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalisation (DP), and a sense of low personal accomplishment (PA). The surgical residency is a period of intense training that imposes major challenges on future surgeons, who may therefore be at high risk for burnout syndrome. Nevertheless, no data on burnout syndrome in orthopaedic and trauma surgery (OTS) residents in France is available. Therefore we performed a prospective survey to: (1) evaluate the prevalence of burnout syndrome among OTS residents in France, (2) and to look for factors associated with a higher or lower risk of burnout syndrome in the survey respondents.
   Hypothesis: Burnout syndrome is at least as prevalent among OTS residents in France as among residents in other medical and surgical specialities.
   Material and methods: A nationwide prospective survey was conducted in France between February and April 2017 via a digital questionnaire sent by email. Burnout syndrome was evaluated using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and symptoms of depression using the General Health Questionnaire ( GHQ12). Demographic data and information on relationships with partners and working modalities were collected.
   Results: Of 480 OTS residents, 107 (22%) completed the questionnaire. Mean age was 27 years and 65% (n = 70) were male. High EE was reported by 26% (n = 28), high DP by 63% (n = 68), and low PA by 33% (n = 36) of respondents. The scores on two or all three of the MBI sub-scales were abnormal, indicating severe burnout syndrome, in 40% (n = 43) of respondents. The GHQ-12 scores indicated symptoms of depression in 40% (n = 43) of respondents. Furthermore, 61% (n= 66) of respondents stated that they would not recommend OTS or any other area of medicine to their children as a career and 10% (n=11) reported suicidal ideation during the past year. The statistical analysis identified three risk factors for burnout syndrome: medical errors (odds ratio [OR], 8.8; 95% confidence interval [95%CI], 1.7-58.7; p = 0.0121), symptoms of depression (OR, 19.3; 95%CI, 2.9-196.0; p = 0.0048), and living single (OR, 4.7; 95%CI, 1.4-18.9; p = 0.0173).
   Discussion: Despite the 22% response rate, this study provides useful information on the prevalence of burnout syndrome among OTS residents in France, with severe burnout in 40% and suicidal ideation in 10%. These prevalences may be overestimations, however, as residents who felt under stress may have been more likely to respond to the survey. In published studies, burnout syndrome was associated with higher risks of medical error and suicidal behaviour. These data emphasise the importance of detecting and managing burnout syndrome in healthcare staff. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Context. The debate on the decriminalization of active assistance in dying is still a topical issue in many countries where it is regarded as homicide. Despite the prohibition, some physicians say they have used drugs to intentionally end a patient's life.
   Objectives. To provide some empirical grounding for the ongoing debate.
   Methods. Using data from the End-of-Life in France survey (a representative sample of 15,000 deaths that occurred in December 2009, questionnaires completed anonymously by the physicians who had certified the deaths), we selected all the cases where the physician had used one or more drugs to intentionally end a patient's life and compared the decisions and decision-making process with the conditions imposed by the French law for decisions to withhold or withdraw life-supporting treatments and by the Belgian law on euthanasia.
   Results. Of the 36 cases analyzed, four situations seemed to be deliberate acts after explicit requests from the patients, and only two seemed to fulfill the eligibility and due care conditions of the Belgian euthanasia law. Decisions made without any discussion with patients were quite common, and we observed inadequate labeling, frequent signs of ambivalence (artificial feeding and hydration not withdrawn, types of drug used), and little interprofessional consultation. Where the patient had requested euthanasia, the emotional burden on the physician was heavy.
   Conclusion. These findings underscore the pressing need for a clarification of the concepts involved among health professionals, patients, and society at large, and better training and support for physicians.

AB Objective To elaborate and describe a large prospective agricultural cohort including males and females in France with various agricultural activities and to study causes of death.
   Methods To date, few large prospective cohorts have been conducted among agricultural population. AGRIculture and CANcer cohort is a large prospective cohort of subjects in agriculture studying cancer among active and retired males and females, farm owners and workers, living in eleven areas of France with a population-based cancer registry.
   Results Enrollment was conducted from 2005 to 2007 with a postal questionnaire. In January 2008, 180,060 individuals (54 % males, 54 % farm owners, 50 % retired) were enrolled. Mortality was studied until December 2009 (605,956 person-years with standardized mortality ratio (SMR) by comparison with the general population of the areas. Over this period, 11,450 deaths 6,741 in men and 4,709 in women were observed, including 3,405 cancer-related deaths. SMRs were significantly reduced for global mortality (SMR = 0.68, 95 % CI 0.67-0.70 in males and SMR = 0.71, 95 % CI 0.69-0.73 in females) and for death by cancer (SMR = 0.67, 95 % CI 0.65, 0.70 in males and SMR = 0.76, 95 % C: 0.71, 0.80 in females). These results were mainly explained by less frequent smoking-related causes of death (lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases). Nonsignificant excesses of death were observed only for rheumatoid arthritis and arthrosis, suicides (in females), death for event of undetermined intent (in males) and breast cancer in male agricultural workers.
   Conclusions These first results are the first ones obtained in France based on a large prospective agricultural cohort showing that farmers would be in healthier condition than the general population.

AB Purpose: To understand how lay people and health professionals in France judge the acceptability of hospitalizing a psychiatric patient against his will.
   Methods: 123 lay people, 20 nurses, 5 psychologists, and 6 physicians judged the acceptability of involuntary hospitalization in each of 36 scenarios consisting of all combination of 4 factors: patient's adherence to treatment (agrees to take his medications or not); risk of suicide (none, immediate, multiple past attempts); risk of harming others (none, immediate, history of violence against others); attitude of patient's family (favorable to involuntary hospitalization or not). The judgment data were subjected to cluster analysis and subsequently to analysis of variance.
   Results: 4 clusters were identified and labeled according to the factors that affected judgments: Never Favorable (7 participants, with mean acceptability judgment of 1.30 on a scale of 0-10); Threat to Others (35. with mean judgment of 8.68 when risk high. 2.94 when risk low). Threat to Others or Self and Adherence (88, with mean judgment of 6.89), and Always Favorable (24, with mean judgment of 8.41).
   Conclusions: 95% of participants agreed that involuntary hospitalization is acceptable under certain conditions, especially - in accordance with French law - when the patient presents a risk to others. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts are highly prevalent comorbidities of end-stage-renal-disease (ESRD). There are no studies in Lebanon on the prevalence of these symptoms in Lebanese end-stage-renal-disease patients. Moreover, the association between ESRD on one hand, and anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation on the other has never been established in Lebanon. Groups of patients at a high-risk of development of these symptoms are not determined. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score and M.I.N.I (module C) were used to measure the prevalence of anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation in 51 patients from the dialysis center of Hotel-Dieu de France Hospital in Lebanon. In our sample, 45 % of included patients suffered from symptoms of anxiety and 50 % presented symptoms of depression.The prevalence of suicidal ideation as detected by the M.I.N.I. is at 37 %. No patients presented with a high risk of suicide. There was a statistically significant correlation between the existence of organic comorbidities and the presence of symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation. As for anxiety, the association was marginally significant. The results obtained by our study are consistent with those found in studies performed in other societies. The profile of depression- and suicidal ideation-prone patients has been determined. It consists of patients with at least one medical comorbidity to the ESRD. This, in turn, should lead to increased awareness and better treatment of these psychiatric ailments, considering their impact on morbidity and mortality in ESRD.

AB We assume that actors of the professionalization process of palliative care make a special effort to demarcate it from euthanasia, and that such an effort has a significant impact on beliefs and attitudes toward euthanasia among the whole medical profession. We investigated concurrently attitudes toward palliative care, conceptions of euthanasia and opinion toward its legalization among a sample of 883 French general practitioners, oncologists and neurologists. We found four contrasted profiles of attitudes toward palliative care, which were closely correlated with being in touch with palliative care providers. Attitudes toward palliative care were closely correlated with beliefs about which medical practices should be labelled euthanasia, and these beliefs were in turn strongly associated with opinions toward euthanasia legalization. Our results suggest that the relationship between palliative care and euthanasia mixes semantic and strategic aspects, beyond cognitive and conative ones. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A rapid diagnostic dipstick test (RDT) that detects Yersinia pestis F1 antigen has been recently applied on 18 putative plague victims exhumed from four archaeological burial sites in southeastern France dating back to the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. The Y pestis antigen F1 was detected in 12 ancient samples out of 18 (67%). Negative controls confirmed their negativity (100%). Our results emphasize that the detection threshold of the RDT for plague (0.5 ng/ml) is sufficient for a first retrospective diagnosis of Y. pestis infection in ancient remains, and confirm the high specificity and sensitivity of the assay. Double-blind analyses performed by using two different techniques (RDT and 'suicide PCR') led us to the identification of the Y. pestis Fl antigen and the Y. pestis pla and gplD genes. These data provide clear evidence of the presence of Y. pestis in the examined specimens.

DT Article
DE Textbook; Moral Values; Moral Education; Social Control; France; XIX-XX
   Centuries
AB This paper examines all the textbooks available in the CEDHRE archives (234 textbooks) on moral values for primary, junior and secondary schools from the 1880s until these textbooks were abandoned in 1964. It shows that the moral values recommended in school textbooks remained generally constant although subject to some noteworthy modifications. At all teaching levels moral prescriptions and prohibitions corresponded generally to the Christian cardinal sins. Regarding bodily restraints, systematically presented as prohibited are: greed, sloth, lust and wrath. But other elements play a role in the prescriptive system: temperance, the need to work, and the prohibition of suicide and mutilation. The fight against what are described as social evils is also evident: sobriety and temperance. Furthermore, hygiene, cleanliness, and physical activities form part of this coherent system of bodily restraints leading metaphorically to 'making angels'. Changes gradually occurred with the passing from externally prescribed morality to a freely accepted morality - perhaps ultimately from morality to ethics.

   COSTS
AB Background. Depressive disorders represent a major public health concern, regarding their high frequency and their important cost. Depression impair the quality of life more than any other disease, sometimes leading to suicidal ideas or behavior. Indeed, 50% of patients with severe major depression commit suicide. Numerous studies showed that depressive disorders are frequently not recognised, and regularly untreated. In France, where at least 3 millions of inhabitants are concerned, 38% of depressed patients are not using any health system. When they are asking for care, the majority of depressed patients visit their general practitioner (51%), whereas less than 10% visit a psychiatrist. Even when the diagnostic is correct, the treatment prescribed is not systematically relevant. The treatment is, for example, frequently proposed for a too short period, and sometimes the prescribed product does not have proven antidepressive efficacy. Furthermore, as incorrect informations are frequently given to patients, and as there is a general biased judgement about psychotropic drugs in the general population, the compliance is usually poor for antidepressive treatment Therefore, only a small minority of depressed patients benefits from an adequate care. Public health information methodological asperts. To improve this situation, delivering simple and clear-cut recommendations cannot be considered as sufficiently effective, and public health interventions are required. Different programs improving the recognition of depressive disorders have already been tested in some countries with encouraging results. These programs are based on information campaigns given to the public, and the training of general practitioners about the management of depressive disorders. The << Defeat Depression >> campaign in Great-Britain and the << National Depression Screening Day >> in the United-States of America may represent informative examples. Restricting these programs to general practitioners only is frequently criticized, as this may reduce efficacy. A multilevel approach is crucial for the success of action programmes against depression, because synergistic effects can be expected. In Germany, the << Nurnberger Bundnis gegen Depression >> project was based on four levels, and effectively reduced the suicide rate. These levels of action included << cooperation with GPs >>, such as training sessions based on video, and presence of a phone hotline, << public relations activities >> << training sessions for multipliers >>, such as priests, social workers and media, and << special offers for high risk groups and self-help activities >>. In France, such a program is clearly required.

AB The incidence of opportunistic infectious diseases and the mortality rate associated to the HIV infection have greatly decreased with the wide use of the Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART). However, the "Mortalite 2000" study conducted in France on the causes of deaths in the HIV infected population has revealed that 47 % of deaths were still due to an opportunistic infection, whereas 50 % of them are not associated with the HIV infection (the four main causes being cancer, chronic hepatitis C, cardiovascular diseases and suicide). The longer life expectancy of patients treated with HAART has lead to an increased frequency of complications due to chronic viral B and C hepatitis. The higher prevalence of hepatitis viral infections in the HIV-infected patients implies to methodically screen this population for HCV and HBV markers, and consequently modify the clinical and therapeutic management of co-infected patients.

AB In France, a circular published on 30th July 1992 defined emergency in psychiatry as "a situation which requires an immediate response. There is an emergency as soon as someone asks himself or herself if this is the case, whether that be the patient, their entourage or the doctor; it requires a rapid and adequate response from the team charged with the patient's care in order to alleviate the acute nature of psychological suffering". The places where emergencies are dealt with have become indispensable crossroads in the treatment of certain mental pathological states and/or certain relational situations. In this interview with Bluenn Quillerou, an emergency psychiatrist in Paris, she evokes what psychiatric emergencies are from a clinical and organisational point of view, her argument formed by her professional experience. Versatility in knowledge and practices, good healthcare knowledge, speed and validity in evaluation and decision-making: all are indispensable skills for this exercise.

AB In the context of our investigation, we found information on 432 (76%) of the 569 Jewish dermatologists in Germany. There is evidence that 57 (10%) of the Jewish dermatologists were murdered in concentration camps, 61 (10.7%) died a natural death, 13 (2%) committed suicide, and 25 (4%) survived the Third Reich in Germany. After 1933, 276 (49%) Jewish dermatologists were able to leave Germany; the United States of America was the main destination and 107 (or 41%) emigrated there. A total of 34 (13%) Jewish dermatologists emigrated from Germany to Palestine and 16 to Latin America. Regarding emigration to other European countries, 20 of the Jewish dermatologists from Germany went to Great Britain (including Walter Freudenthal, 1893-1952, and Ernst Sklarz, 1894-1975), and 24 emigrated to other European countries, such as France (Rudolf Mayer, 1895-1962), Sweden (Carl Lennhoff, 1883-1963), and the Netherlands (Otto Schlein, 1895-1944).

AB Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is recommended for the treatment of first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients. It can be offered in acute state or during the remission of the episode. Up to date, effects of CBT have been examined in several controlled and randomized trials in FEP. Combined with antipsychotic medications, results have demonstrated that CBT decreases positive psychotic symptoms, enhances quality of live, self-esteem and insight, and diminishes the intensity of comorbide symptoms, such as trauma or suicide behavior. CBT might be particularly efficient in individuals wishing to reintegrate premorbide functioning and those with low duration of untreated psychosis. Despite these encouraging results, psychosis orientated CBT are underused in France. The validation of group CBT specifically designed for FEP should enhance the range of patients receiving this treatment. Moreover, early CBT interventions for people at ultra high-risk for psychosis and assertive community treatments should be developed. (C) L'Encephale, Paris, 2013.

AB Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo (1903-1937) is widely considered to be the first major writer of la francophonie and as Madagascar's national poet. His untimely death has been interpreted as an act of rebellion against French colonial rule. However, little attention has been given to his outspoken attachment to the ideas of Charles Maurras and the far right Action Francaise. This article explores Rabearivelo's politics, his ambivalent relationship with colonial rule and the complexity of the identity politics expressed in his work. Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo (1903-1937) est largement considere comme le premier grand ecrivain de la francophonie et comme le poete national de Madagascar. Son suicide a ete interprete comme un acte de revolte contre la domination coloniale de la France. Cependant, on a consacre peu d'attention a son attachement ouvert aux idees de Charles Maurras et de son organisation d'extreme droite, Action Francaise. Cet article explore la vision politique de Rabearivelo, ses rapports ambigus avec le pouvoir colonial, et la complexite de la politique identitaire exprimee dans son OEuvre.

AB Introduction To analyse the causes of death among HIV-infected adults in France in the year 2000.
   Methods Based on data from a national survey, our study describes and analyses the causes and characteristics of patients with immunological and virological response (CD4>200/mm(3), ARN-HIV<500 copies/mL), who died during antiretroviral treatment.
   Results Among a total of 964 deaths registered, data on 864 cases were available for analysis. One hundred forty-nine patients (17%) were immunovirological responders. The underlying causes of death were non AIDS-defining malignancies for 36 (24%), mainly due to lung cancer (16 cases), hepatocarcinoma (7) and ano-rectal carcinoma (3), AIDS for 22 (15%), mainly due to Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (10 cases) and uterine cancer (3), cardiovascular diseases for 22 (15%), post hepatitis C hepatic failure for 16 (11%), suicide for 16 (11%), and bacterial infections for 14 (9%). When comparing characteristics of death in the 149 responders versus the 715 other patients, the responders were significantly more frequently: coinfected by HCV+ (45 vs. 33%), injected drug addicts (40 vs. 27%), alcoholics (38 vs. 28%), and dyslipidemics (19 vs. 11%). In 2000, around 20% of registered deaths of HIV patients in France had occurred among good immunovirological responders.
   Conclusion To further reduce mortality among such efficiently treated patients, attention must be focused on treatable conditions such as hepatitis C, dyslipidemia and on the prevention of malignancies such as lung cancer and cervical or ano-rectal carcinoma.

AB In France more than 140 000 children live in foster homes under the responsibility of the French Child Protection Agency. These children have lived in environments that cannot be good for their development and have been separated from their families which have to have consequences on their mental development. A literature review in France and abroad was made to identify the profiles of these children, their risk factors, and the mental disorders they can present. French child protection is handled by smaller territories, called Departements of which there are more than 90 and count around 1 000 000 people each. The number of foster children differ byDepartement, as do the placement types and meaning of the placement. More than half of these children have suffered maltreatment prior to placement. Comparing them to children of the same age, they present more internalizing and externalizing disorders, more addiction problems and suicidal behaviors. Protection factors have nonetheless been identified, such as early age of placement and placement stability. The main inhibitors of good health care are the absence of a common regulatory framework, source of organization difficulties, and the lack of collaboration between health and social services.
   French cohort studies using validated tools are necessary to precise and confirm these results. They could then lead to national recommendations for mental health screening and care organization, as well as validation of protocols for specific therapies for foster children.

TI French hospital nurses' opinion about euthanasia and physician-assisted
   suicide: a national phone survey
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS

DT Article

AB Background: Hospital nurses are frequently the first care givers to receive a patient's request for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (PAS). In France, there is no consensus over which medical practices should be considered euthanasia, and this lack of consensus blurred the debate about euthanasia and PAS legalisation. This study aimed to investigate French hospital nurses' opinions towards both legalisations, including personal conceptions of euthanasia and working conditions and organisation.
   Methods: A phone survey conducted among a random national sample of 1502 French hospital nurses. We studied factors associated with opinions towards euthanasia and PAS, including contextual factors related to hospital units with random-effects logistic models.
   Results: Overall, 48% of nurses supported legalisation of euthanasia and 29%, of PAS. Religiosity, training in pallative care/pain management and feeling competent in end-of-life care were negatively correlated with support for legalisation of both euthanasia and PAS, while nurses working at night were more prone to support legalisation of both. The support for legalisation of euthanasia and PAS was also weaker in pain treatment/palliative care and intensive care units, and it was stronger in units not benefiting from interventions of charity/religious workers and in units with more nurses.
   Conclusions: Many French hospital nurses uphold the legalisation of euthanasia and PAS, but these nurses may be the least likely to perform what proponents of legalisation call "good" euthanasia. Improving professional knowledge of palliative care could improve the management of end-of-life situations and help to clarify the debate over euthanasia.

AB This prospective multi-center observational survey describes causes of death and their trends from 2000 to 2010 among treated HIV-infected patients with immunovirologic success (PIVS) in France. In 90 clinical sites providing HIV care and treatment, representing a cohort of 82,000 patients in 2010, the underlying causes of death and characteristics of deceased patients were prospectively recorded in 2000, 2005, and 2010 by using a standardized form. We provide data on PIVS, define as patients with a CD4+ T cell value above 500/mm3 and a plasma HIV-1 RNA below 50 copies/ml at their last periodic checkup before death, compare them with immunovirologic uncontrolled patients, and describe trends in these data from 2000 onward. The main underlying causes of death of the 120 PIVS recorded in 2010 were: a non-AIDS/nonviral hepatitis-related malignancy (19%), suicide (12.5%), cardiovascular disease (11.5%), and liver disease (11%). Only three PIVS died of an AIDS-related event. Socioeconomic difficulty was identified in 41% of PIVS in 2010. This percentage had constantly grown since 2000 (p < .001). Median age at death also increased (40, 46, and 52 years in 2000, 2005, and 2010, respectively; p < .001). The distribution of the main causes of death of PIVS was statistically different from that of uncontrolled patients (p < .001). Although immunovirologic control is fundamental, a parallel multidisciplinary approach to care is essential to accurately detect and treat comorbidities, particularly cancer, psychiatric disorders, and cardiovascular disease. Psychosocial aspects must be considered.

AB Mental disorders are a frequent cause of morbidity and sickness absence in working populations; however, the status of psychiatric sickness absence as a predictor of mortality is not established. The authors tested the hypothesis that psychiatric sickness absence predicts mortality from leading medical causes. Data were derived from the French GAZEL cohort study (n = 19,962). Physician-certified sickness absence records were extracted from administrative files (1990-1992) and were linked to mortality data from France's national registry of mortality (1993-2008, mean follow-up: 15.5 years). Analyses were conducted by using Cox regression models. Compared with workers with no sickness absence, those absent due to psychiatric disorder were at increased risk of cause-specific mortality (hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for age, gender, occupational grade, other sickness absence-suicide: 6.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.07, 11.75; cardiovascular disease: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.10, 3.08; and smoking-related cancer: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.07, 2.53). After full adjustment, the excess risk of suicide remained significant (HR = 5.13, 95% CI: 2.60, 10.13) but failed to reach statistical significance for fatal cardiovascular disease (HR = 1.59, 95% CI: 0.95, 2.66) and smoking-related cancer (HR = 1.31, 95% CI: 0.85, 2.03). Psychiatric sickness absence records could help identify individuals at risk of premature mortality and serve to monitor workers' health.

ID PSYCHIATRY
AB Before 2001, psychiatric care on the island of Mayotte was ensured by missionaries from the Reunion Island. A mental health system has since been gradually installed, although the culture in Mayotte, mixing practicing Muslim women and traditional animists, still leaves a broad place for traditional heaters. This paper presents a retrospective study of 1212 psychiatric case reports, aimed at indexing the various psychopathologies according to the CIM 10, on the island of Mayotte between 1998 and 2004. The files, before and after the opening of the mental health centre, were compared with those of the psychiatric diagnoses of the Comorians.
   The results show an evolution in the chronic pathologies treated in the Comorians: delirious disorders, and the organic, major, mental disorders in the first psychiatric files have given way to depressive episodes and somatoform disorders. Nevertheless, an underlying prevalence of depression and addiction persist. It is interesting to note the reduced number of suicide attempts, far lower than in western countries: one suicide attempt per annum for 375 inhabitants in metropolitan France, whereas, in this study, one suicide attempt in Mayotte was reported for 2504 inhabitants.
   The cultural characteristics are also taken into account in the discussion of these results. Thus, if there are more demonstrations with somatic expression in the Comorians, related to a stronger implication of the body in situations of psychological faintness: 1.75% of hysterical conversion in the Comorians versus 0.99% in Mayotte, this does not mean a more histrionic personality in this population: 1.8% of Comorians, against 1.98% in Mayotte.
   The results of this study consolidate the impressions felt by the experts and show the effects of the mental health policy on the island. Thus, the assumption of responsibility of chronic psychotics made it possible to improve their quality of life, and to decrease the number of medical evacuations that decreased from 17 to three, between 2001 and 2004. However, this study also underlined the possible axes of development in this field, namely the assumption of responsibility of psychiatric emergencies with a crisis centre, and the development of a specialized pedopsychiatric assumption of responsibility. Indeed, in the first six months of 2004, 35% of the patients were 0-20year-old. (C) L'Encephale, Paris, 2008.

TI Importance of medicolegal data for national cause of death statistics
SO PRESSE MEDICALE
LA French
DT Article
AB OBJECTIVE: The validity of French cause of death statistics largely depends on the transmission of the medical information reported on the dedicated part of the death certificate. Data referring to death causes are collected and analyzed at the information Department on the cause of death (INSERM SC8). In major urban areas with one or more forensic institutions, it has been observed that the proportion of death certificates indicating ino particular cause of death is higher than the national average. We therefore examined deaths occurring in 1996 in the Lyons region.
   METHODS: This retrospective study involved 5,208 deaths recorded in Lyons France in 1996. Complementary information on these deaths was obtained from INSERM SC8 and Lyons Medicolegal Institute.
   RESULTS: It was observed that a large portion of violent deaths occurring in this city in 1996 (more than 30%) were not recorded appropriately in the national statistics due to a lack of communication after autopsy
   CONCLUSION: Considering the importance of epidemiology and suicide prevention in the national public health strategy, improved information transmission must be developed in the near future.

AB Can we die from shame? In what way is shame a feminist issue? How have contemporary artists explored the theme? Prompted by a news item that reported the death of a leading Korean actress, which was attributed to the shame of a role she had played in a recent movie, The Scarlet Letter, this article explores shame initially through a re-reading of Sigmund Freud's challenging theory of exuality (1905) in which he plots out the ways in which shame and disgrace come into being and specifically inflect the social management of women's adult sexuality. It then offers three case studies of ways in which contemporary artists from South Africa, Zanzibar/UK and Israel/France have explored aspects of historically created shame (apartheid and truth/reconciliation, enslavement, genocide and the Holocaust) through a variety of forms of art practice, not to submit their subjects to re-shaming, but to challenge the world to be ashamed of what has been done to diminish the humanity of those who are othered for gender, ethnicity, religion.

AB Numerous papers have documented a positive association between height and good physical health and also with good economic outcomes such as earnings. A smaller number have argued for an association with well-being. In this paper, the SHARE survey of over 50 year olds in Europe is used to analyse whether individuals' height is associated with higher or lower levels of life-satisfaction using ordered probit estimation. In simple models there is a positive, concave relationship between height and life satisfaction. However it is shown that the results are quite sensitive to the inclusion of controls reflecting demographics and, in particular, human capital and health status. Where effects do exist, it is predominantly at low to medium levels of height. That is there is a penalty, in well-being terms, to being short but not necessarily a benefit to being tall. There is also evidence of heterogeneity across countries with the effects being best determined in France.

AB Teenage suicide is a major public health issue in Western societies, especially in France. An instrument to measure suicidal thoughts in French adolescents and thus identify the teenagers at risk is urgently required. The aim of this study was to validate a French version of the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (SIQ) for use with teenagers. Respondents (n=956, age range 14-18.0) completed the SIQ and other convergent measures (self-esteem, psychic morbidity, anxiety, and personality) for three validation steps (general and clinical samples). A confirmatory factor analysis was performed on the SIQ The study supported a 30-item one-factor model, similar to the original questionnaire, with moderate model fit indices (chi(2)/ddl=3.21; RMSEA=0.05; CFI=0.87; GFI=0.92). Significant correlations (-0.22 to 0.74) were found with convergent measures among general (n=871) and psychiatric samples (n=38). A high internal consistency was found with a reliability coefficient of 0.91. The results confirm the psychometric qualities of the questionnaire for French adolescents.

DT Article
AB In his article "The Metaphor of Assimilation in Rabearivelo's Poetry" Yasser Khamees Ragab Aman discusses the impact of the metaphor and the policy of assimilation in the poetry of Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo, who swings between a desired image of a superior France based on a mythically archetypal symbol of a patron and a reality which, as a matter of course, distorts the image of a good-natured colonizer. Aman traces the influence of French Symbolists such as Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Mallarme, and Laforgue on Rabearivelo's poems and discusses to what extent these influences help make an assimile of the poet. In Aman's interpretation Rabearivelo identifies with the French symbolists since his work shows many of their characteristics and shows how the poet tries to adapt this model to transfer his own heritage through French. In his personal life, the poet's conflict between a desire for assimilation and desperate attempts at self-expression culminates in his suicide. In Aman's view, Rabearivelo is smothered by the metaphor of the benevolent patron which he believes in.

SO FORUM FOR MODERN LANGUAGE STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE Renoir; Jean; novel; film; First World War; love; war
AB Jean Renoir is celebrated as one of France's most important film directors. It is less well known that he wrote four novels: Les cahiers du capitaine Georges: souvenirs d'amour et de guerre, 1894-1945 (1966), Le coeur a l'aise (1978), Le crime de l'Anglais (1979) and Genevieve (1979), which he completed in the final days of his life. Although these novels could fruitfully be read in conjunction with his films, they also merit serious study in their own right. This article focuses on the themes of love and war, especially in Les cahiers du capitaine Georges and Genevieve. Love and war appear as opposing principles, one giving cause for faith in humanity, the other shattering it again. In Genevieve, the suicide of a disabled girl betrayed in love shortly before the First World War implicitly condemns a society that does not deserve to survive. Renoir's novels challenge prevalent critical views of his post-war work and might provoke a re-assessment of his achievement as a filmmaker and writer.

AB Emergency management of deliberate self-poisoning (DSP) by drug overdose is common in emergency medicine. There is a paucity of data about the prehospital care of these patients. The principal aim was to describe the intensity of care received by patients with DSP who were managed by prehospital emergency medical service (EMS) physicians. A 48-h cross-sectional study was conducted in 319 EMS and emergency units in France. Patient and poisoning characteristics and treatments administered were recorded. Complications of poisoning, hospitalization, intensive care unit admission and death were recorded until day 30. The primary endpoint was the probability of receiving prehospital intensive care, including fluid resuscitation, vasopressor therapy, invasive ventilation, or antidotal treatments, depending whether prehospital treatment was carried out by an EMS physician or not. Data from 703 patients (median age was 43 [30-52] years, 288 (40%) men) were analyzed. One hundred and fifteen (16%) patients were attended by an EMS physician. Patients attended by EMS physicians were more likely to receive intensive treatment in the prehospital setting [odds ratio (OR) 7.4, 95% confidence interval 4.3-12.9]. These patients had more severe poisoning as suggested mainly by a lower Glasgow Coma Score (13 [8-15] vs. 15 [15-15]; p < 0.001) and a higher rate of admission to an intensive care unit [29 (25%) vs. 15 (2%), p < 0.001]. Patients with DSP attended by prehospital EMS physicians frequently received intensive care. The level of care seemed appropriate for the severity of the poisoning.

AB Although numerous authors have associated metal music with social problems such as suicide, self-destruction and Satanism, few studies have been undertaken to examine the mental health of fans of heavy metal music. This study attempts to determine if there is a link between mental health and the enjoyment of this type of music in France. The researchers surveyed 333 fans of metal music. Their mental health was evaluated by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a widely used instrument that measures anxiety and depression. The scores of the sample of metal music fans were then compared to the scores that reveal possible, probable, or severe mental disorders. Qualifying variables included age, gender, status, education, motivation and participation in metal music culture. The results indicated that fans of metal music are mainly young adults (median age = 22.67, SD = 5.29) and tend to be male (87.85 percent). As a whole, metal music fans have levels of anxiety and depression that are similar to and lower than levels in the general population. Specifically, < 5 percent of metal music fans surveyed showed pathological symptoms. Subjects that scored higher levels of anxiety and depression were those that had literary and/or arts backgrounds rather than scientific backgrounds, that wrote metal music lyrics, that consumed alcohol and that engaged in the body modification practice of scarification. This study suggests that opponents of metal music should re-examine the basis for their criticism. More scholarly research is needed to better understand the effects of metal music on fans and on society.

AB AimsAcute drug overdose, especially with paracetamol, may cause acute liver failure leading to registration for transplantation (ALFT). Population statistics and between-country differences for ALFT related to overdose have been poorly described. The aim of the present study was to evaluate overdose ALFT in the multi-country Study of Acute Liver Transplantation (SALT).
   MethodsAll adult overdose-related ALFT, with or without suicidal intent, in France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and the UK between 2005 and 2007 were identified from liver transplant registries and hospital records. These were compared with whole-country and per capita use of paracetamol.
   ResultsSix hundred cases of ALFT were identified in 52 of 57 eligible transplant centres, of which 114 involved overdose (72 intentional, 10 non-intentional, 32 uncertain). Overdose represented 20% of all-cause ALFT: Ireland 52%, UK 28%, France 18%, the Netherlands 8%, and Italy 1%. Overdose ALFT were mostly females (61%), mean age 33.610.9years. A total of 111 (97%) of the overdoses involved paracetamol. Event rates ranged from one ALFT for 20.7 tons of paracetamol in Ireland, to one for 1074 tons in Italy and one case in 60 million inhabitants over 3years in Italy to one case in 286000 inhabitants per year in Ireland. Per-country event rates for non-overdose ALFT exposed to paracetamol were between 2.5 and 4.0 per million treatment-years sold.
   ConclusionsParacetamol overdose was found to represent one-sixth of all-cause ALFT. There was a 50-fold difference in Europe in the rates of paracetamol overdose ALFT, and a 200-fold difference per million inhabitants.

AB Objectives: Anxiolytics are the most frequently prescribed psychotropic drugs in France. General practitioners (GPs) tend to prescribe anxiolytics and other benzodiazepines to patients with major depressive disorders (MDD). However, the extent to and reasons for which they prescribe these medications together are not well documented. This article assesses how often and why GPs coprescribe an anxiolytic when starting patients on antidepressant (AD) treatment, and which patient- and GP-related factors are associated with this coprescription.
   Methods: We used a survey of 131 GPs practising in southeastern France and of patients seen consecutively during June to October 2004 to whom they prescribed an AD. Data were collected from GPs (consultation-questionnaires focusing on their prescription, diagnosis, and symptom detection) and patients (self-administered questionnaires, including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, and social and demographic characteristics). Factors associated with anxiolytic coprescription were analyzed with a multilevel logistic regression.
   Results: GPs completed 438 consultation-questionnaires for patients; 258 patients (58.9%) returned their questionnaires. Sixty percent of the patients received anxiolytics with ADs. Anxiolytics were prescribed more frequently by male GPs who reported feeling ill at ease treating MDD, or detected suicidal ideation or anxiety in their patients, and finally to patients with stable jobs.
   Conclusions: Although some practice guidelines and authors acknowledge that there might be some justification for coprescribing anxiolytics with ADs at the beginning of MDD treatment in specific situations, the high percentage of coprescriptions for anxiolytics observed in our study suggests that training and knowledge of GPs about MDD treatment are not optimal.

AB Background: This study aimed at assessing the changes in mental disorders in the French working population between 2006 and 2010, using Rationally representative prospective data and a structured diagnostic interview for major depressive episode (MDE) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and also at exploring the differential changes in mental disorders according to age, origin, occupation, public/private sector, self-employed/employee status and work contract.
   Methods: The data came from the prospective national representative Sante et ltineraire Professionnel (SIP) survey, including a sample of 5600 French workers interviewed in 2006 and 2010. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used to measure MDE and GAD. Analyses were performed using weighted generalized estimation equations, and were stratified by gender.
   Results: No changes in MDE and GAD were observed for both genders among the working population. No differential changes were observed, except one the prevalence of GAD increased among women working in the public sector while there was no change among women in the private sector.
   Limitations: Two data collections over a 4-year period may not capture the effects of the crisis on mental disorders properly.
   Conclusion: No changes in mental disorders between 2006 and 2010 were found but the increase in the prevalence of anxiety among women in the public sector may be of particular interest for prevention policies. High levels of social protection in France might contribute to explain these non-significant results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The mortality of people suffering from psychiatric illnesses is far higher than that of the general population, all categories of diagnosis combined; mortality statistics can be used as an index of quality of care. The aim of this study was to assess the all-cause mortality in psychiatric patients covering all diagnostic groups.
   The living or deceased status of 4,417 patients of majority age hospitalised in a public mental health establishment between 2004 and 2007 were requested from French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies on 1st January 2011. The cause of death of those people who had died was obtained from French National Institute for Health and Medical Research and comparative standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were established from the population in a region of northern France of the same age in 2006.
   The study population was made up of 54 % men and 46 % women, median age 41 and 45 years old, respectively. Four hundred and seventy-three people died during the period studied. The SMR were 421 for men (95 % CI 378-470) and 330 for women (95 % CI 281-388). The highest SMRs were found in patients aged 35-54, with a 20-time higher mortality risk than the general population of the same age.
   Our study confirms the considerably higher mortality in psychiatric patients than in general population, particularly in mean age and mostly due to an unnatural cause.

AB Because of the inconvenience and longer time required to punch out the tablets, strip packaging may reduce the number of tablets that can be readily swallowed by adults with self-poisonings. In fact, hospital-based studies of paracetamol poisoning in the U.K. and Hong Kong have shown that blister packs were associated with fewer tablets being ingested and large overdoses were mostly from loose preparations. In Australia, following the change in packaging for carbamazepine from bottles of tablets to blister packs, a marked decrease in the reported number of tablets ingested by patients was seen.
   Reducing the maximum number of tablets that can be available in individual preparations or prescriptions may also reduce the likelihood of severe poisonings. In France, but not in the UK, the content of each pack of paracetamol has been legally limited to 8 g. This was thought to be one reason why severe liver damage and deaths after paracetamol poisonings are less common in France than in the UK. Medicated oils containing methyl salicylate pose the threat of rapid-onset, severe salicylate poisoning if swallowed. To reduce the amount of methyl salicylate that can be readily swallowed, the methyl salicylate content and the size of the bottle and its opening should be restricted.
   In adults with Dettol poisoning, serious complications such as pulmonary aspiration are more likely if a large amount is ingested. Similarly, the risk may be reduced by restricting the size of bottle and its opening.

AB Mortality data, by the unambiguity of their definition and understanding by all stakeholders, and completeness of registration, are a cornerstone of public health statistics in France and in most industrialized countries. This article describes the data production process, and the main types of possible analyses. Data production is composed of different stages: death certification by a medical doctor on paper or electronic (using a web application) format, data transmission to Inserm, capture and coding of information. The encoding of the information follows the WHO recommendations of the International Classification of Diseases ([ICD], 10th revision used since 2000). It is carried out using an automatic coding software, called Iris, developed in an international consortium. The coding aims, first, at assigning an ICD code to all nosologic entities encountered on the certificate, and then at selecting the underlying cause of death. The latter is the main information used for statistical analyses. Three main types of analysis emerge in the literature: the exploitation of data on the death certificate only, ecological analyses (studies of associations between variables measured across groups) and analysis from data individually linked to other databases. Many public health issues can be addressed with these various analyses. Several developments in the production process are being implemented: the deployment of electronic certification, increased automation of the death certificate information processing and durable and complete record linkage with health insurance and hospitalisation data. They could soon be deeply expanding the scope of possible uses of causes of death data. (C) 2016 Societe Nationale Francaise de Medecine Interne (SNFMI). Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Health-related problems and risky behaviours (substance use) are frequent in adolescents, may alter their physical and mental capabilities, and may thus generate school absenteeism, low academic performance, and school dropout ideation. This study assessed their associations and the contribution of socioeconomic factors among 1559 middle-school adolescents (mean age 13.5 + 1.3) from north-eastern France. They completed a questionnaire including socioeconomic characteristics, health-related problems (poor physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and living environment) assessed with the World Health Organization's quality of life measure (score < 25th percentile), risky behaviours, school absences during the present school year, last-trimester academic performance, and school dropout ideation. Data were analysed using logistic regression models. School absenteeism was frequent (12.6% of subjects for 8-14 days, and 6.0% for >= 15 days); 8.2% of subjects had low academic performance (average school-mark < 10/20) and 3.9% school dropout ideation. All school difficulties were strongly associated with all health-related problems (gender-age-school-level-adjusted odds ratios gasOR between 1.5 and 4.2), and with risky behaviours (gasOR between 1.4 and 14). Socioeconomic factors differently contributed to these associations (contribution reaching 77%). Policy makers, schools, physicians and parents should be more aware of the problems and help adolescents to reduce health-related problems and risky behaviours and to increase resilience.

AB Buprenorphine at high dosage became available in France in 1996, as a substitution treatment for heroin addicts. Since this date, numerous deaths were attributed to this drug. This paper reports two original series of 39 and 78 fatalities involving buprenorphine observed at the Institute of Legal Medicine of Strasbourg and at 13 other French forensic centers, respectively. The files were recorded from January 1996-May 2000. The first 20 fatalities that were previously published were excluded from this epidemiological study. From these 117 subjects, 96 were male (82%). Buprenorphine and its primary metabolite norbuprenophine were assayed in post-mortem blood by HPLC/MS (n = 11 labs) or by GC/MS (n = 3 labs). Blood levels for buprenorphine ranged from 0.5 to 51.0 ng/ml (mean 10.2 ng/ml) and 0.1 to 76 ng/ml (mean 12.6 ng/ml) in Strasbourg and the other centers, respectively. Blood levels for norbuprenorphine ranged from 0.2 to 47.1 ng/ml (mean 8.2 ng/ml) and <0.1 to 65 ng/ml (mean 10.6 ng/ml) in Strasbourg and the other centers, respectively. The mean values appear to be within the therapeutic range. Buprenorphine was identified in 24 of the 26 hair samples assayed in Strasbourg, at concentrations ranging from 10 to 1080 pg/mg. Intravenous injection of crushed tablets, a concomitant intake of psychotropics (especially benzodiazepines and neuroleptics) and the high dosage of the buprenorphine formulation available in France appear as the major risk factors for such fatalities. In addition, two suicide-related deaths were also observed, with blood buprenorphine, concentrations at 144 and 3276 ng/ml. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Lifetime prevalence of child and adolescent bipolar 1 disorder (BD1) is nearly 0.1 %. Even though it is not a frequent disorder in young people, there is an increased interest for this disorder at this age, because of the poor outcome, the severe functional impairments and the major risk of suicide. Diagnosis is complex in view of the more frequent comorbidities, the variability with an age-dependant clinical presentation, and the overlap in symptom presentation with other psychiatric disorders (e.g. disruptive disorders in prepubertal the child and schizophrenia in the adolescent). The presentation in adolescents is very similar to that in adults and in prepubertal children chronic persistent irritability and rapid mood oscillation are often at the foreground. For a while, such presentations were considered as BD-not otherwise specified (BD-NOS), which can explain the outburst of the prevalence of bipolar disorder in children in the US. Longitudinal studies that look for the outcome of such emotional dysregulations have not revealed an affiliation with bipolar disorder spectrum, but with depressive disorders in adulthood. The diagnosis of Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder was proposed in the DSM-5 to identify these children and to prevent confusion with bipolar disorder. The goals of the pharmacological and psychosocial treatments are to control or ameliorate the symptoms, to avoid new episodes or recurrences, to improve psychosocial functioning and well-being, and to prevent suicide. In the US, lithium and four atypical antipsychotics have been approved by the FDA for 10 to 13-year-olds (risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole and quetiapine). In France, only lithium salts (after the age of 16) and aripiprazole (after the age of 13) are recommended. Psychosocial treatments, such as a familial or individual approach are developing.

AB Objectives Patients with advanced disease sometimes express a wish to hasten death (WTHD). In 2012, we published a systematic review and meta-ethnography of qualitative studies examining the experience and meaning of this phenomenon. Since then, new studies eligible for inclusion have been reported, including in Europe, a region not previously featured, and specifically in countries with different legal frameworks for euthanasia and assisted suicide. The aim of the present study was to update our previous review by including new research and to conduct a new analysis of available data on this topic.
   Setting Eligible studies originated from Australia, Canada, China, Germany, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Thailand and USA.
   Participants Studies of patients with life-threatening conditions that had expressed the WTHD.
   Design The search strategy combined subject terms with free-text searching of PubMed MEDLINE, Web of Science, CINAHL and PsycInfo. The qualitative synthesis followed the methodology described by Noblit and Hare, using the 'adding to and revising the original' model for updating a meta-ethnography, proposed by France et al. Quality assessment was done using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist.
   Results 14 studies involving 255 participants with life-threatening illnesses were identified. Five themes emerged from the analysis: suffering (overarching theme), reasons for and meanings and functions of the WTHD and the experience of a timeline towards dying and death. In the context of advanced disease, the WTHD emerges as a reaction to physical, psychological, social and existential suffering, all of which impacts on the patient's sense of self, of dignity and meaning in life.
   Conclusions The WTHD can hold different meanings for each individual-serving functions other than to communicate a genuine wish to die. Understanding the reasons for, and meanings and functions of, the WTHD is crucial for drawing up and implementing care plans to meet the needs of individual patients.

AB Background: Precise knowledge of the epidemiology of suicidality provides necessary information for designing prevention programs. The aims of the present study were to investigate the prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideas and attempts in the general population of Europe.
   Methods: The European Study on the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders (ESEMED) is a cross-sectional household survey carried out in a probability representative sample of non-institutionalised adults (aged 18 years or older) of six European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain). The Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0) was administered to 21,425 individuals.
   Results: Lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation was 7.8% and of suicidal attempts 1.3%. Being women, younger and divorced or widowed were associated with a higher prevalence of suicide ideation and attempts. Psychiatric diagnoses were strongly related to suicidality. Among them, major depressive episode (Rate ratio 2.9 for lifetime ideas and 4.8 for lifetime attempts), dysthymia (RR 2.0 and 1.6), GAD (RR 1.8 and 2.3 for lifetime), PTSD (RR 1.9 and 2.0) and alcohol dependence (RR 1.7 and 2.5) were the most important. Population attributable risks for lifetime suicidal attempt was 28% for major depression.
   Limitations: Information about suicidal ideas and attempts was self reported, psychiatric diagnoses were made using fully structured lay interviews rather than clinician-administered interviews.
   Conclusions: In spite of meaningful country variation in prevalence, risk factors for suicidality are consistent in the European countries. Population prevention programmes should focus on early diagnosis and treatment of major depression and alcohol abuse and in those individuals with recent appearance of suicidal ideas.

AB Objective: Beyond genetic risk variants, the pathophysiology of bipolar disorders is likely to be partly determined by environmental susceptibility factors. Our study is one of the first to investigate, in a large sample of well-characterized bipolar patients, associations between clinical presentations and childhood trauma subtypes, including neglect and abuse items.
   Method: 587 patients with D.SM-W defined bipolar disorder were recruited from France and Norway between 1996-2008 and 2007-2012, respectively. History of childhood trauma was obtained using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Clinical variables were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (Norwegian sample) or the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (French sample).
   Results: Earlier age at onset of bipolar illness, suicide attempts, rapid cycling, and an increased number of depressive episodes each had significant associations.001) with at least 1 subtype of childhood trauma (emotional abuse, sexual abuse, and emotional neglect). Multivariate analyses investigating trauma variables together showed that both emotional and sexual abuse were independent predictors of lower age at onset (P=.002 for each) and history of suicide attempts (OR= 1.60 [95% Cl, 1.07 to 2.39], P=.023; OR= 1.80 [95% Cl, 1.14 to 2.86], P=.012, respectively), while sexual abuse was the strongest predictor of rapid cycling (OR= 2.04 [95% Cl, 1.21 to 3.42], P=.007). Females reported overall higher childhood trauma frequency and greater associations to clinical expressions than males (P values <.05).
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate consistent associations between childhood trauma and more severe clinical characteristics in bipolar disorder. Further, they show the importance of including emotional abuse as well as the more frequently investigated sexual abuse when targeting clinical characteristics of bipolar disorder.

DE moral harassment at work; health and safety at work; French Supreme
   Court; discrimination
AB France is well-known for its solid and fierce social system, particularly in terms of employment. However, despite the French legislator's efforts to create a legislative protection shield for the French employees, moral harassment at work developed itself as a silent, ever-growing and - at a certain extent - tolerated phenomenon which led to a significant number of suicides.
   This paper aims to present the proper, complex and thorough legislative protection granted under the French legislation against various types of acts of moral harassment at work. In particular, this paper shall analyse the most important cases of moral harassment at work that French employees have had to deal with during the last years and that had been submitted for ruling with the French Supreme Court. This paper shall also outline the main conclusions that may be drawn from the diverse and intense activity of the French courts of law in the field of moral harassment at work and the impact of such guidelines in framing the scope of the legislative definition of moral harassment at work.

AB In recent years, the European euthanasia debate has become more intense, and the practice was legalized in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. We aimed to determine the current degree of public acceptance of euthanasia across Europe and investigate what factors explain differences.
   Data were derived from the 2008 wave of the European Values Survey (EVS), conducted in 47 European countries (N = 67,786, response rate = 69 %). Acceptance of euthanasia was rated on a 1-10 scale.
   Relatively high acceptance was found in a small cluster of Western European countries, including the three countries that have legalized euthanasia and Denmark, France, Sweden and Spain. In a large part of Europe public acceptance was relatively low to moderate. Comparison with the results of the previous EVS wave (1999) suggests a tendency towards a polarization in Europe, with most of Western Europe becoming more permissive and most of Eastern Europe becoming less permissive.
   There is roughly a West-East division in euthanasia acceptance among the European public, making a pan-European policy approach to the issue difficult.

AB Aims: Though the introduction of office-based buprenorphine has greatly contributed to stern the HIV epidemic since 1995, concerns have been raised about the intravenous use of buprenorphine even in patients on substitution treatment. The aim of this study was to identify which factors are predictive of buprenorphine injection in patients receiving office-based buprenorphine.
   Design and setting: Subazur is a survey consisting of two longitudinal assessments of 111 stabilized patients receiving office-based buprenorphine in southeastern France.
   Measurements: Patients were interviewed by phone at enrolment and 6 months later about social characteristics, addictive behaviors, treatment experiences, overdoses and suicide ideation or attempt. A logistic regression based on generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to identify factors associated with buprenorphine injection at any interview.
   Findings: Among the 111 patients (32% women, mean age 38 years), 36 reported buprenorphine injection after having started treatment initiation in 40 interviews. After adjustment for time since first injection, individuals perceiving their prescribed dosage as inadequate (OR = 2.6 95% CI[1.2-5.7]) and those reporting a history of suicide ideation or attempt (OR=2.7 95% CI[1.1-7.0]) had approximately a three-fold higher risk of injecting buprenorphine.
   Conclusions: Providing adequate care for both drug dependence and psychiatric comorbidities in primary care is a major issue. Like heroin use during methadone treatment, buprenorphine injection should be regarded more as a response to inadequate care than simply as a "misuse". A re-assessment of the treatment efficacy through a possible dosage increase or a switch to methadone could potentially reduce diversion and assure sustained adherence to OST.

DE Tariq Ramadan; Yusuf al-Qaradawi; Paul Berman; Ian Buruma; Salafism;
   Muslims; Europe
AB Tariq Ramadan calls himself a bridge builder between Muslims and European culture, but contradictions in his theology prevent him from fulfilling this role. He is an Islamic intellectual who espouses democracy and pluralism, yet he believes that shari'a law is universal. He exhorts his European followers to refrain from anti-Semitic violence, yet he cites as an authority Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, who is an apologist for Palestinian suicide bombers. He calls for Muslims to be full participants in Western civic societies, yet he calls on Muslims to "resist" the neo-liberal economic order that forms the basis of Western society. Ramadan has made alliances with left wing politicians and academics in France, Britain, the Netherlands, and the United States, but he has a pattern of disappointing and frustrating his leftist allies. In the wake of terrorist attacks in Britain and the Netherlands, the British and Dutch governments called upon Ramadan to support peaceable brands of Islam in these traumatized countries. These efforts failed because Ramadan's most important constituency has always been "the Muslim street," and this makes it difficult for him to embrace liberal principles.

ID SUBJECTIVITY; STRATEGY; JUSTICE; STRESS
AB What realities do questionnaires and surveys, designed to measure stress and suffering at work, bring to light? What realities do they conceal? In this research, we consider self-assessment scales and questionnaires as techniques of visibility that contribute to the construction of knowledge on the suffering subject' at work. We conducted a qualitative analysis of the questionnaire and survey report conducted by the consulting firm Technologia for France Telecom Orange, after a spate of suicides in 2008-2009. The results show that: (1) the questionnaire used to measure suffering at work views the subject as someone reflective yet rather passive, and their suffering as resulting from an unbalanced relationship with the work environment, (2) the report further restricts this understanding of suffering to the administrative position of the individual, (3) as a consequence, the political, strategic, ideological dimensions and the economic power struggles affecting work are silenced. Relying on Foucault's approach to knowledge (savoir), we interpret this narrow concept of the subject and their surroundings as resulting from an assemblage between scientific discourses and visibility techniques; a compromise that conceals debates on the strategic orientation of the firm.

AB E. C. Seguin was one of the early, influential 19th-century neurologists who participated in the development of neurology as a specialty in the United States. Born in France, but raised from early childhood in the United States, Seguin published widely, developed a high-profile New York City practice, and was named Clinical Professor of Diseases of the Mind and Nervous System at the College of Physicians and Surgeons (New York) in 1874. Typical of the era, he studied neurologic disorders, but also several conditions that today would be considered in the realm of psychiatry. One of his seminal papers was titled "The treatment of mild cases of melancholia at home" (1876). Contrary to the widespread practice of isolating patients in either rest homes or asylums, Seguin introduced and formalized treatment of depression within the household. Against this academic backdrop, Seguin returned home on October 31, 1882, to discover that his own wife, afflicted with long-standing depression and treated at home, had committed suicide after murdering their 3 children. The grim dichotomy between the confidently written paper and the reality of the treatment failure is a neurologic lesson in humility regarding diseases and their unpredictable outcomes.

AB This study investigated addictive substance use by French medical students. A cross-sectional survey was distributed to 255 participants randomly selected from 1,021 second- to sixth-year medical students. Questionnaires were self-administered and included questions on sociodemographic characteristics, mental health, and alcohol (The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT test]), tobacco (Fagerstrom test), and illegal substance consumption (Cannabis Abuse Screening Test [CAST test]). The AUDIT scores indicated that 11% of the study participants were at risk for addiction and 21% were high-risk users. Tobacco dependence was strong or very strong for 12% of the participants. The CAST score showed that 5% of cannabis users needed health care services. Cannabis users were also more likely than non-users to fail their medical school examinations (89% vs. 39%, p < .01). One quarter of medical student participants (n = 41) had used other illegal drugs, and 10% of study participants had considered committing suicide during the previous 12 months. Psychoactive substance consumption by French medical students requires preventive measures, screening, and health care services.

AB This chapter reports on the symposium, "Translational neuroscience may inform treatment development for posttraumatic stress disorder" (Chair Leo Sher, M.D., Co-Chair - Alexander Neumeister, M.D.) that was held on June 28, 2009 during the 9th World Congress of Biological Psychiatry (June 28-July 2, 2009, Palace of Congresses (Le Palais des Congres de Paris), Paris, France). Compelling animal and human data indicate that stress compromises neurotrophic functions producing neural atrophy and reducing neuroplasticity resulting in dysfunction in brain circuitry associated with PTSD. This problem has been identified as the most important priority for studies of the neurobiology of PTSD. This symposium was the first translational interdisciplinary attack on this problem, from molecular neuroscience to treatment and targets major gaps in our understanding of the neurobiology, neural circuitry, phenomenology, and treatment of PTSD. Four research works were presented at the symposium: "Early postnatal stress: Impact on neural circuits and relevance to psychophysiology" by Machiko Matsumoto (Japan), "Long term alterations in brain and neurobiology in PTSD" by Eric Vermetten (Netherlands), "Mechanisms of resilience: Lessons from PET imaging" by Alexander Neumeister (USA) and "Neurobiology of suicidal behavior in PTSD and implications for suicide prevention" by Leo Sher (USA).

AB Corrosive chemical substance ingestions are a major problem, especially in developing countries, but also in developed countries such as the United States, France, and Belgium. Ingestions may be deliberate as suicide attempts (mostly in adolescents and adults) or accidental (mostly in children). The results can be devastating in terms of individual suffering and disability, but also in terms of resource utilization and costs. In developing countries, outcomes may be worse because of limited medical/surgical resources. Common sequelae include gastrointestinal (GI) tract (esophagus, stomach, pylorus, and duodenum) stricture formation, GI tract perforation, and hemorrhage. Systemic effects may also occur, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), multi-organ system failure, and sepsis. Various interventions in the acute phase to reduce the severity of injury have been attempted, but there are no large controlled clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy. Dilation therapy in various forms is commonly used for the treatment of strictures and a variety of surgical procedures including esophagectomy and delayed replacement may be required in severe corrosive injury cases.

ID BIPOLAR DISORDER; PROFILE
AB Lithium salts are the recommended first-line treatment (gold standard) in national and international treatment guidelines for acute and maintenance treatment of affective disorders, such as bipolar disorders. Lithium has also been shown to have a unique protective effect against suicide in patients suffering from affective disorders. Despite the well-known acute and long-term adverse effects lithium therapy can be safely administered if patients are properly educated and carefully monitored. A recent study from France now shows that patients with severely impaired renal function who had been treated with lithium salts for more than 10 years could have an increased risk for kidney tumors (benign and malignant). This resulted in an adjustment concerning information within the package leaflet by European authorities. The authors of this article reflect the currently available data in order to better understand and handle this new finding and to warn about uncritical reactions including withdrawal of lithium in successfully treated patients. This article provides clinical recommendations to provide further insight relating to the risk of kidney cancer in long-term lithium therapy.

AB OBJECTIVE: Each year, approximately 165,000 poisonings are managed in the emergency departments (ED) in France. We performed a descriptive analysis of self-poisoned patients admitted to a university hospital ED in the Paris metropolitan area (France) aimed at investigating their outcome and the risk factors for transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU).
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients' records and performed multi-variate logistic regression analysis to identify risk factors for ICU admission.
   RESULTS: During 4 years, 882 self-poisoned patients (median age, 38 years [IQR, 26-47]; sex-ratio, 1M/3F) were admitted to the ED, representing 0.7% of all referred patients. Poisonings mainly resulted from multidrug exposures (53%), including benzodiazepines (78%), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (17%), acetaminophen (13%), antipsychotics (9.5%), imidazopyridines (9.5%), antihypertensive drugs (3%), and polycyclic antidepressants (1.3%). Ethanol was involved in 20% of the exposures. Patients were briefly (< 24h) monitored in the ED (55%), transferred to the psychiatric department (30%), medical ward (2%) or ICU (6%), and took an irregular discharge (7%). Among the patients transferred to the ICU, 25% were mechanically ventilated and only one died. Risk factors for ICU admission included antihypertensive (Odds ratio (OR), 40.6; 95%-confidence interval (CI), 7.5-221.9) or antipsychotic drug ingestion (OR, 5.3; CI, 2.0-14.4), male gender (OR, 3.3; CI, 1.30-8.8), and consciousness impairment (OR, 2.1; CI, 1.8-2.5 per point lost in Glasgow coma score).
   CONCLUSIONS: Deliberate drug exposure represents a frequent cause of ED admission. Psychotropic drugs are most commonly involved. Transfer to the ICU is rare and predicted by male gender, drug class, and coma depth.

AB Purpose: To determine the prevalence of some major mental disorders among adolescents living in a residential group home and the distribution of these disorders by gender.
   Method: The participants included 183 adolescents (13-17 years old) living in residential group homes of the Child Welfare System in the county of Bouches-du-Rhone (South of France). A structured psychiatric Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children was used to assess the existence of Anxiety Disorder (AD), Major Depression (MD), Conduct Disorder (CD), Eating Disorder (ED), Enuresia (En), Psychosis Screen (PS) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) among the study participants over the six-month period before the assessment was taken. The existence of Suicide Attempts (SA) during the lifetime of each child was also assessed.
   Results: Of the youths qualified, 48.6% as having at least one psychiatric disorder during the last six months (AD: 28.4%; CD: 15.3%; MD: 14.8%; PS: 18.6%; ADHD: 3.8%), and SA have been reported in 23% of them. Females were more affected than boys (p<0.001) with 64.9% having at least one disorder compared to 36.8% of boys; AD: 49.3% vs. 13.2%; and MD: 27.3% vs. 5.6%.
   Conclusion: Adolescents living in residential group homes of the Child Welfare System in France have notably high rates of mental disorder (about three times more than those of the general population of the same age), similar to the patterns found in adolescents in North America and Europe. These data are the first of their kind in France and will guide necessary changes to the child welfare system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
ID GENERAL-POPULATION; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; PREVALENCE
AB Aims: Previous studies have shown that the recommended minimum 6-month period for antidepressant treatment is actually observed for only a minority of patients. The objectives of this study were to characterise patients with newly prescribed antidepressant treatment in France and identify factors possibly associated with insufficient duration of treatment or the occurrence of certain events such as sick leave, hospitalisations and suicide attempts.
   Methods: Data were extracted from the French health insurance database (SNIIRAM) and the national hospitalisation database (PMSI) for patients covered by the main French health insurance scheme representing 75% of the French population. Patients were included if they had a newly prescribed antidepressant in 2011, but no prior psychiatric diagnosis identified in the databases and no significant psychiatric medication (such as antipsychotic or mood stabiliser) in 2009-2010.
   Results: A total of 998 710 patients (2% of the overall population), with a mean age of 50 years and 66% of females, initiated an antidepressant in 2011, which was prescribed by a general practitioner in 89% of cases. Five generic names, including three selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, accounted for 75% of first prescriptions. Only one reimbursement was observed for 40% of patients. Treatment duration was less than 6 months for more than 80% of patients, more frequently for low income earners, and varied according to age, gender and region. The median time lag between first visit and antidepressant initiation was 27 days. Hospitalisation related to a psychiatric disease over the following 12 months was observed for 3% of patients.
   Conclusion: Duration of treatment and follow-up were both insufficient for the majority of French patients initiating antidepressant treatment in 2011, which may reflect poor quality of care for people with mood or anxiety disorders, possibly because of overdiagnosis and inappropriate drug treatment, or poor adherence and side effects, or poor follow-up.

AB Prison inmates are exposed to a variety of major risk factors (psychiatric disorders, suicide attempts, illicit drug use). From 1986 to 1996, the USA prison population more than doubled while in France, it increased from 35655 in 1980 to 51623 in 1995. In spite of these findings, very little information concerning the inmates population is available. At the present time, there is a desire to adopt a policy based on the prevention of recidivism, on adequate release planning and referrals to community-based services. The aim of the RAPPEL project was to build an information system for assessing the social and health status of prison inmates. The pilot project was set up at the prison of Loos and allowed the collection and analysis of nearly 15000 records. The aim of this paper is to present the extension of the project consisting in developing a regional net-work grouping 11 jails. Information locally available will serve as the basis for the information system of regional jails. Data mining techniques will provide solutions for the extraction of new information. Three data mining tools were experimented : association rules, classification trees and clustering. Further extension consists in a distributed approach allowing direct access to the information system by WEB tools.

TI End-of-life medical decisions in France: a death certificate follow-up
   survey 5 years after the 2005 act of parliament on patients' rights and
   end of life
SO BMC PALLIATIVE CARE

DT Article

   ATTITUDES; TRENDS
AB Background: The "Patients' Rights and End of Life Care" Act came into force in France in 2005. It allows withholding/withdrawal of life-support treatment, and intensified use of medications that may hasten death through a double effect, as long as hastening death is not the purpose of the decision. It also specifies the requirements of the decision-making process. This study assesses the situation by examining the frequency of end-of-life decisions by patients' and physicians' characteristics, and describes the decision-making processes.
   Methods: We conducted a nationwide retrospective study of a random sample of adult patients who died in December 2009. Questionnaires were mailed to the physicians who certified/attended these deaths. Cases were weighted to adjust for response rate bias. Bivariate analyses and logistic regressions were performed for each decision.
   Results: Of all deaths, 16.9% were sudden deaths with no information about end of life, 12.2% followed a decision to do everything possible to prolong life, and 47.7% followed at least one medical decision that may certainly or probably hasten death: withholding (14.6%) or withdrawal (4.2%) of treatments, intensified use of opioids and/or benzodiazepines (28.1%), use of medications to deliberately hasten death (i.e. not legally authorized) (0.8%), at the patient's request (0.2%) or not (0.6%). All other variables held constant, cause of death, patient's age, doctor's age and specialty, and place of death, influenced the frequencies of decisions. When a decision was made, 20% of the persons concerned were considered to be competent. The decision was discussed with the patient if competent in 40% (everything done) to 86% (intensification of alleviation of symptoms) of cases. Legal requirements regarding decision-making for incompetent patients were frequently not complied with.
   Conclusions: This study shows that end-of-life medical decisions are common in France. Most are in compliance with the 2005 law (similar to some other European countries). Nonetheless, the study revealed cases where not all legal obligations were met or where the decision was totally illegal. There is still a lot to be done through medical education and population awareness-raising to ensure that the decision-making process is compatible with current legislation, the physician's duty of care and the patient's rights.

SO CONTEMPORARY FRENCH AND FRANCOPHONE STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE Marguerite Yourcenar; Yukio Mishima; East-West Relations; France; Japan
AB Marguerite Yourcenar may well be best known for her prize-winning novels that accent the trope of homosexuality, but there is another, equally engaging aspect to her work that highlights her originality: her deeply syncretic cultural perspective. Regarding her strong interest in Japanese culture, she was intrigued by the polemical and ostentatious Japanese writer, Yukio Mishima, and her 1980 text, Mishima ou la vision du vide, stands as an important milestone in the longstanding dialogue of East-West cultural relations. Mishima fascinated Yourcenar, above and beyond his interest in homosexual themes, and she identified in him a uniquely powerful exemplar of rebellion. After forming his own militia, barricading himself in the Tokyo headquarters of Japan's Self-Defense Forces, holding the commandant hostage, and committing suicide publicly on a balcony of the building through the ritual act of seppuku, Mishima became for Yourcenar a figure of almost hagiographic dimensions. Describing him dramatically as "le martyr [ horizontal ellipsis ] du Japon heroique," Yourcenar presents Mishima as a figure whose art serves as inspiration both for Eastern and Western writers, while she explores his violent ideology, portraying his work as a compelling and paradoxical example of the potential of aesthetics to alter directly human culture.

AB Few data are currently available on the prevalence and associated characteristics of anxiety disorders in psychiatric out-patients in France, in particular in the private health-care. However, this represents one of the principal systems of care for patients suffering from anxiety disorders, with a possible direct access and several types of treatments available (pharmacotherapy but also different kinds of psychotherapy). The aim of our study was to describe the prevalence of anxiety disorders in a large sample of patients consulting in the private sector, and in addition to study the comorbidity, these verity of the disorders, their consequences on quality of life and health care consumption. The studied patients were included and assessed by 501 psychiatrists from all the country, at the time of a first visit. Inclusions were to be made in a consecutive way, but with the exclusion of psychotic disorders and dementia. A sample of 1 955 patients was obtained, and all subjects had a standardized diagnostic assessment with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and with various dimensional scales of symptomatology severity, quality of life, and health care consumption. On the whole, at least one current anxiety disorder was found in 64.3 % of the patients, while 55 % had a depressive disorder. Individually, the prevalence rates are 29.4 % for generalized anxiety disorder, 25.9 % for agoraphobia, 19.2 % for panic disorder, 15.3 % for social phobia, 11.4 for obsessive-compulsive disorder, and 5.4 % for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A history of suicide attempts was found in 12-20 % of patients, and an elevated suicide risk was found for example in 25 % of PTSD patients. The scores of the symptomatic scales, adaptation and quality of life measure show a very significant anxious symptomatology, with serious functional consequences. Approximately 75 % of patients had another medical consultation during the three previous months, and 9 % have been hospitalized. An interruption of work was found in 25 % of the patients during the last three months, in average for 35 days. Concerning drug consumption before the visit by anxiety disorders patients, the preponderance of anxiolytic use is notable (85 to 98 % according to categories of anxiety disorders) when compared to that of antidepressants (20 to 40 %). Moreover, 38.4 % of the whole sample took an anxiolytic once a day for at least three months and about 40 l of them had dependence symptoms. In conclusion, this study showed the quantitative importance of anxiety disorders among psychiatric out-patients in the private practice sector in France, all the categories of anxiety being represented, and the high level of severity and burden of these disorders. Compared to some data published before, the prevalence rates of these anxiety disorders seem to be increasing.

LA English
DT Article
AB In 2008, the Molex company announced the closure of its French site at Villemur-sur-Tarn. The 283 workers then began a long struggle to save their jobs but failed to prevent their redundancy. This article analyses the ways in which gender influences men's and women's capacity to resist when faced with the brutality of redundancy and the loss of social bonds that follows job loss. Studying gendered configurations within the factory, the context of the strike, and workers' families, it puts forward a rereading of the work of Jahoda, Lazarsfeld, and Zeisel on the unemployed of Marienthal and of the work of Durkheim on suicide that is inflected by the theoretical advances developed by gender studies, notably concerning the conception of 'work' as a vector of social integration. Considering domestic tasks and political commitment as forms of labour, it argues for a triangulated analysis of work, political mobilisation and the family, three spheres that generate the social bond, in a way which moves us beyond the classic division between public and private and allows us to track in finer detail the effects of the crisis on a social group, the workers, too often considered as homogenous (and male).

AB Objective. - To explore general practitioners' (GPs) knowledge of the symptoms and epidemiology of schizophrenia, and the GPs' characteristics associated with level of knowledge.
   Method. - Survey questionnaires exploring practice in patients with early psychosis were mailed to all GPs in South-Western France (N = 3829). GPs were asked to fill out questions anonymously on the symptoms and epidemiology of schizophrenia.
   Results. - The response rate was 23.6%. GPs had a fair theoretical knowledge of schizophrenia symptoms, but underestimated the prevalence and the risk of suicide. Recent attendance at a continuing medical education (CME) course on schizophrenia was the main predictor of level of knowledge on epidemiological figures, although its impact was relatively modest. Regarding risk factors, the implication of genetic factors was considered as null or modest by more than half of the GPs, while a large proportion of them stated that mother-baby interactional disturbances were frequently implicated in the aetiology of the disorder.
   Conclusion. - GPs' level of knowledge on the public health impact and risk factors for schizophrenia needs to be improved in order to promote the delivery of accurate and destigmatising information to primary care patients. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

DE transplantation; specimen handling; tissue and organ harvesting
AB The growing gap between organ requirements and their availability from brain-stem-dead donors has led to a re-examination of the use of non-heart-beating donors (NHBD). Many non French centers are now using such donors to expand their organ pool. In France, the relevant law was modified in 2005 in order to authorize kidney and liver donation by NHBD donors. Accordingly, the Biomedicine Agency has established a program of formal viability assessment. The protocol recommends that this practice be restricted to kidney transplantation first, before being extended to liver transplantation in a second phase. NHBD donors are defined using the Maastricht classification. Currently, the French program includes groups I, II and IV but excludes group III. Donors are patients in intractable cardiac arrest, despite intensive resuscitation, after accidents, suicide, anoxia or stroke. Organ retrieval obeys the usual legal rules : in particular, a national donation refusal registry is consulted and the relatives' formal consent is required. The results of NHBD transplantation in Europe, the USA and Japan are comparable to those obtained with brain-stem-dead donor organs. The French transplantation working group recommends that this experience be extended in order to reduce the organ shortage and the number of patients on the waiting list.

AB Aim. - Characterised by its population density, cultural and ethnic diversity, familial fragmentation and high levels of HIV/AIDS, crime and homelessness, Paris poses specific problems with regard to mental healthcare.
   Methods. - Epidemiological studies show high rates of generalised anxiety and drug and alcohol abuse and dependence, greater use of psychoactive medication and, at the same time, apprehension about looking after mentally ill family members at home.
   Results. - Although the Greater Paris area has a much higher density of GPs and specialists than the national mean, there are considerable variations within the region itself, with the central area having up to four times as many GPs or psychiatrists as the outer suburbs. On the other hand, although the number of mental health medical acts and the number of people receiving mental health care have been rising dramatically over the last 15 years, Paris has considerably less adult psychiatry beds and day care places per head of population than the rest of France.
   Discussion. - Current planning targets include a more equitable distribution of mental health care service provision for the rapidly evolving urban population, early prevention of psycho-affective disorders, suicide and drug and alcohol misuse and the creation of low threshold services for adolescents in difficulty.

AB BACKGROUND: Digestive surgery training is notoriously difficult and medical students choose this path less and less often leading to a veritable demographic crisis for this specialty in France. The aim of this study was to evaluate the working conditions to measure the prevalence of burnout syndrome (BOS) and to identify potential risk factors to implement preventive measures and appropriate support.
   METHODS: This was a multicenter, cross-sectional study. An anonymous questionnaire was sent by e-mail to 500 French digestive surgeons in training (residents and fellows).
   RESULTS: The response rate was 65.6%. The mean working week was 75.7 hours (+/- 12) and the mean number of night shifts was 5.3 (+/- 1.6)/month. Sixty-seven percent of respondents had trouble sleeping and 12% reported suicidal thoughts. High-emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment low scores were observed respectively in 24.7%, 44.6%, and 47%, corresponding to a high score of BOS in 52%.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a high rate of BOS in French digestive surgeons in training and a worrying rate of suicide ideation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE history of psychoanalysis; Italo Svevo; literature; Marie Bonaparte
AB Marie Bonaparte (1882-1962) played a critical role in the development of psychoanalysis in France. Her clinical activity is not well known yet she was one of the first female French psychoanalysts. The journalist-writers Alice and Valerio Jahier were Bonaparte's first two patients. She conducted this dual analysis with Rudolph Loewenstein (1898-1976). Alice and Valerio exchanged analysts on several occasions. During his analysis, Valerio began corresponding with Italo Svevo (1861-1928), the author of La Coscienza di Zeno, who imparted his doubts on the therapeutic merits of psychoanalysis. Valerio described his difficult analysis in his letters to Svevo. Bonaparte consulted Freud on the subject, but was not able to prevent Valerio's suicide in 1939. The Princess of Greece encouraged Alice in her vocation as a writer and enabled her to benefit from her connections in literary circles. On the margins of this unpublished story of the two analyses, which is based on archived documents recently made available, we discover the importance of the links which were formed - around Marie Bonaparte - between psychoanalysis and literature. In addition to Italo Svevo, we come across the acerbic writer, Maurice Sachs, as well as the famous novelist, Stefan Zweig.

AB Among the 2 726 cases of human pesticide poisoning collected at the Poison Centre of Lille from January 1998 to May 2001, 39 cases were related to the ingestion of aldicarb. Analysis of the circumstances found a suicide attempts in 33 cases and an accidental ingestion in 6 cases. The sex-ratio was 31 men for 8 women, mean age was of 36,6 years (15 months - 77 years). Thirty one poisoning were symptomatic with muscarinic signs (20 cases), digestive ( 15 cases), neurological ( 8 cases), nicotinic signs (6 cases). Treatment was based on digestive evacuation (14 cases), administration of activated charcoal (14 cases), atropine (7 cases), pralidoxime (1 case), preservative vital functions by intubation and ventilation (7 cases). Sedation was necessary in 4 cases. Hospitalization was necessary in 34 cases. The Poison Severity Score was estimated at 0 (any gravity) in 5 cases, 1 (weak) in 12 cases, 2 (moderate) in 7 cases, 3 (severe) in 8 cases and 4 (lethal) in 2 cases. In one of deaths, aldicarb was determined by HPLC-DAD in blood (6,04 mug / ml), urines (1,88 mug / ml) and gastric contents (3,98 mug / ml). These concentrations are the most important ever described in the litterature. Aldicarb is the most toxic carbamate insecticide for human.

TI Continuous sedation until death. A French way for the end-of-life care?
SO PRESSE MEDICALE
LA French
DT Article
ID PALLIATIVE SEDATION; CANCER-PATIENTS; INTERVIEW
AB Continuous sedation until death (CSUD) is a practice which has developed recently in several countries, appearing more acceptable than euthanasia and medically assisted suicide, since more close to a "natural death''. The French parliament has just adopted a law which stipulates CSUD on request of the patient in a definite number of circumstances, especially in incurable diseases near to the terminal stage with suffering refractory to treatments. Thus France has adopted a unique international position for the end-of-life care. However several ethical problems raised by CSUD, which corresponds to a psycho-social death preceding the biological one, have been raised in the literature. The legitimacy of CSUD, especially if sedation is deep and not proportional to the degree of suffering, or if it is performed in case of a purely existential distress, is a matter of discussion. The primacy allocated to autonomy is questionable for the more vulnerable patients, who deserve mainly a social solidarity. The double-effect principle is replaced actually in CSUD by a co-intention both to relieve suffering and meanwhile eventually to hasten death, especially when stopping nutrition and hydration. CSUD is thus located in a grey zone between palliative care and euthanasia.

AB We explored the representations that individuals associate with schizophrenia in the French context, as well as the relationships between their own representations and the representations they attribute to other French people. Data were collected from individuals in the general population (N = 98) and those with schizophrenia (N = 59). Using a verbal association technique, participants produced words spontaneously based on the inductor word "schizophrenia". The instruction invited them to respond on their own behalf, but also "as the French would in general". Prototypical and similarity analyses were carried out. Results indicated that the representations of participants from the general population were associated with a vocabulary relative to schizophrenia as an illness and with stigmatizing stereotypes, such as madness, dangerousness and split personality when they expressed themselves on their own behalf, as well as psychopathy and confinement when they imagined how French people express themselves regarding schizophrenia. Participants with schizophrenia who had a clear view of the general population's stereotypes mostly referred to negative experiences and emotions such as loneliness, suffering and fear. These findings underline the value of considering the representations associated with schizophrenia in designing awareness campaigns, but also in clinical care for people with schizophrenia.

AB ObjectivesTo investigate the prevalence and associated psychosocial factors of occasional and repetitive direct self-injurious behavior (D-SIB), such as self-cutting, -burning, -biting, -hitting, and skin damage by other methods, in representative adolescent samples from 11 European countries.
   MethodsCross-sectional assessment of adolescents was performed within the European Union funded project, Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE), which was conducted in 11 European countries. The representative sample comprised 12,068 adolescents (F/M: 6,717/5,351; mean age: 14.90.89) recruited from randomly selected schools. Frequency of D-SIB was assessed by a modified 6-item questionnaire based on previously used versions of the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory (DSHI). In addition, a broad range of demographic, social, and psychological factors was assessed.
   ResultsOverall lifetime prevalence of D-SIB was 27.6%; 19.7% reported occasional D-SIB and 7.8% repetitive D-SIB. Lifetime prevalence ranged from 17.1% to 38.6% across countries. Estonia, France, Germany, and Israel had the highest lifetime rates of D-SIB, while students from Hungary, Ireland, and Italy reported low rates. Suicidality as well as anxiety and depressive symptoms had the highest odds ratios for both occasional and repetitive D-SIB. There was a strong association of D-SIB with both psychopathology and risk-behaviors, including family related neglect and peer-related rejection/victimization. Associations between psychosocial variables and D-SIB were strongly influenced by both gender and country. Only a minor proportion of the adolescents who reported D-SIB ever received medical treatment.
   ConclusionThese results suggest high lifetime prevalence of D-SIB in European adolescents. Prevalence as well as psychosocial correlates seems to be significantly influenced by both gender and country. These results support the need for a multidimensional approach to better understand the development of SIB and facilitate culturally adapted prevention/intervention.

AB The terrorist attacks (fusillades and suicide attacks) in Paris on 13 November 2015 have had a major psychic impact on all individuals directly or secondarily exposed to them. Medico-psychological unit (CUMP) of the Paris Ile-de-France region's immediate care services were immediately mobilized and rapidly strengthened by all regional medico -psychological units (CUMP) throughout the country. Psychological assistance has been provided in several key points of Paris and specifically in the 11th district City Hall of Paris where Lyon's Medico-psychological unit was located. These specific immediate psychological assistances, referred to as a "defusing process" by the medico -psychological unit (CUMP), are mostly devoted to provide the victims with an entry point to a psychological healthcare relationship and give them a first sense of soothing and relief even though they do not prevent further psychological care follow up for the victims. Nonetheless, the potential therapeutic effect of this "defusing process" has not yet been sufficiently established nor demonstrated by any scientific study. A phoning survey was carried out one -month post -terrorist attacks and interviewed the 129 victims who benefited from the "defusing process" conducted by Lyon's medico -psychological unit (CUMP) in order to collect data and assess its effects. These people, whether directly exposed, bereaved relatives or witnesses, whose average age is 35, are mostly living in the Ile-de-France region. Most of them present a high score on the IES-R scale, whether they were directly exposed, bereaved relatives or witnesses. Almost all of them (96.5%) experienced at least one medical care contact within this one -month post -trauma period with psychotropic medication for 37% of them. Regarding the defusing conducted by Lyon's medico -psychological unit (CUMP) in the 11th district City Hall of Paris, it appears that 93% of the victims who were looked after indicated that they were satisfied and 87.4% of them stated that they were soothed afterwards.

AB Background: The question whether euthanasia should be legalised has led to substantial public debate in France. The objective of this study in a sample of French physicians was to establish the potential determinants of a favourable opinion about euthanasia in general and when faced with a specific situation as embodied in the Humbert affair.
   Methods: The study was a cross-sectional survey investigating two different samples of medical doctors: (1) those specialised in palliative care and affiliated to the French Society for Patient Accompaniment and Palliative Care; (2) medical interns (medical doctors in training course) in a French medical university (Marseille). A questionnaire was sent (email) to each voluntary participant including sociodemographics, professional status, mention of believing in God, and opinion about euthanasia (the question was designed to assess the general opinion about euthanasia and the opinion about a specific case, the Vincent Humbert' case (a man who was rendered quadriplegic, blind, and mute after an accident and has requested euthanasia).
   Results: A total of 413 physicians participated in the research (participation rate: 48.5 %). Less than half of the population were favourable to euthanasia in general and almost two-thirds of the population were favourable to Vincent Humbert's request for euthanasia. Based on the multivariate analysis, individuals believing in God and being a medical intern were significant independent factors linked to having a favourable opinion about euthanasia in general and about the Vincent Humbert's request.
   Discussion: There is still no study in France on the development of opinion about euthanasia and its impact. The issue goes beyond the strictly professional sphere and involves broader socio-political stakes. These stakes do not necessarily take into account medical practices and experiences or the desires of end-of-life patients. The professional upheaval that the future French legal framework will doubtlessly trigger will require further research.
   Conclusion: The professional upheaval that the future French legal framework will doubtlessly trigger will require further research.

TI Child poisonings with methadone in France: A 6-year prospective national
   survey since the availability of capsules in 2008
SO CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Child poisoning; Methadone; Poison centers
ID INGESTION
AB Background. Methadone for opiate substitution was available only in syrup formulation prior to 2008. In 2007, the French Health Authorities made solid forms available. A national survey was performed in order to evaluate the modification of child poisonings induced by such a new pharmaceutical formulation. Methods. A prospective study was set up (April 15, 2008 to April 15, 2014) with the analysis of cases of unintentional ingestion of methadone by patients under 18 years old and managed by the 10 French poison control centers at the national level. As soon as a new pediatric exposure was recorded in the informatics data bank of the Poison Centers, a telephone survey was performed by the Marseilles' Poison Center to obtain the evolution and all the necessary details. Results. 87 cases of child poisonings with the 2 forms were reviewed (syrup, 56 patients; capsules, 31 patients). Comparison shows that patients were similar for both formulations (no significant difference concerning age [median 2 years], sex ratio [M/F 0.85], previous history, and ingested quantities of methadone). There was a similar severity profile with both formulations proving that methadone can lead to lethal child intoxications (1 death with capsules and 4 with syrup). The relative risk of pediatric accidents is also the same with 2 formulations, leading the health authorities, in collaboration with laboratories, to design and distribute flyers. The aim was to inform patients who are also parents about the high danger risk of their treatment for children, whatever the formulation of methadone present in the house. Discussion. The results of this survey were similar to those of another national study by the French Poison Centers concerning adult suicide attempts with methadone. Both prospective studies led to the conclusion that methadone must be considered as a dangerous molecule for patients and their families. The recent availability of a solid formulation in France did not change the profile of poisonings with this opiate substitute treatment.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA French

ID BUSINESS-CYCLE; UNITED-STATES; UNEMPLOYMENT; SUICIDE
AB Reflection on the relations between temporal evolution of criminality and the evolution of the socioeconomic situation is rather rough at the present time in France. In the United Kingdom. recent studies suggest that the economic cycle influences at the same time fluctuations in crimes on property, and fluctuations in crimes on people, In the USA, if before 1970 it is rarely said that there is a direct link between the criminality rate and unemployment, there is however a direct correlation which dominates in studies after 1970. The analysis of temporal evolution in unemployment, prices and salaries, in the male marriage rate and schooling put forward an interpretation of long-term delinquency and crime. The idea becomes apparent that the increase in opportunities, indicated by en evolution in consumption prices and in salaries, plays a more marked role during a period of sharp growth and has a stronger influence on predation than on violence, that the unemployment of unqualified young people is a factor which favours both delinquency for appropriation and violence. This phenomenon is masked partially in the periods where keeping young people in the school system was in full action, during the last decade of the 20th century, Finally. a reduction in the number of couples setting up. and more generally the tension in relations between sexes. could also have encouraged delinquency from the beginning of the 1980s.

   ATTITUDES
AB Euthanasia is legal only in the Netherlands and Belgium, but it is on occasion performed by physicians elsewhere. We recruited in France two convenience samples of 221 lay people and of 189 professionals (36 physicians, 92 nurses, 48 nurse's aides, and 13 psychologists) and asked them how acceptable it would be for a patient's physician to perform euthanasia in each of 72 scenarios. The scenarios were all combinations of three levels of the patient's life expectancy (3 days, 10 days, or 1 month), four levels of the patient's request for euthanasia (no request, unable to formulate a request because in a coma, some form of request, repeated formal requests), three of the family's attitude (do not uselessly prolong care, no opinion, try to keep the patient alive to the very end), and two of the patient's willingness to undergo organ donation (willing or not willing). We found that most lay people and health care professionals structure the factors in the patient scenarios in the same way: they assign most importance to the extent of requests for euthanasia by the patient and least importance (the lay people) or none (the health professionals) to the patient's willingness to donate organs. They also integrate the information from the different factors in the same way: the factors of patient request, patient life expectancy, and (for the lay people) organ donation are combined additively, and the family's attitude toward prolonging care interacts with patient request (playing a larger role when the patient can make no request). Thus we demonstrate a common cognitive foundation for future discussions, at the levels of both clinical care and public policy, of the conditions under which physician-performed euthanasia might be acceptable.

AB Worsening of suicidal ideation during the first weeks of antidepressant treatment is a poorly understood phenomenon that prompted regulatory bodies to issue specific warnings. To better understand the causes of this phenomenon, this study compared the risk of suicidal ideation worsening in patients taking different types of antidepressant medications. To this aim, 4017 depressed adult outpatients were followed by general practitioners and psychiatrists throughout France for 6 weeks after prescription of an antidepressant treatment. The main study outcomes were to monitor changes (worsening or improvement) in suicidal ideation between baseline (treatment onset) and the study end (week 6) and to determine the remission rates according to the treatment type. Depression severity was assessed with the patient-administered Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and suicidal ideation with the 9-item Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Hopelessness Scale. Use of tianeptine, a mu-opioid receptor agonist was significantly associated with a lower risk of suicidal ideation worsening compared with other antidepressants in the first 6 weeks of treatment. Conversely, remission rates were not significantly affected by the treatment type. Our results highlight a potential interest of opioid agonists to reduce the risk of worsening of suicidal ideation at antidepressant initiation.

AB Aim To study the views on the acceptability of terminal sedation (TS) of laypeople and health professionals in France.
   Method In November 2013-June 2015, 223 laypeople and 53 health professionals (21 physicians and 32) judged the acceptability of TS in 48 realistic scenarios composed of all combinations of four factors: (a) the patients' life expectancy, (b) their request for sedation, (c) the decision-making process and (d) the type of sedation. In all scenarios, the patients were women with a terminal illness suffering from intractable pain and receiving the best possible care. The ratings were subjected to cluster analysis and analyses of variance.
   Results Five qualitatively different positions were found that were termed TS acceptable if decision taken collectively (15%), TS acceptable if patient explicitly requested it (19%), TS acceptable if patient did not explicitly oppose it (47%), 24-hour sedation not acceptable (6%) and TS always acceptable (13%). The percentage of older participants in the always acceptable' cluster was higher than the percentage of younger participants.
   Conclusions Laypeople and health professionals do not appear to be systematically opposed to TS. The most important factors in increasing its acceptability were the patients' request for sedation and the collective character of the decision-making process.

AB Introduction: Occupational risk factors are sociological entities that describe professions and social groups. They are likely to vary with the chronological evolution of the society they are characterizing.
   Materials and methods: Our study is aimed to ascertain specificities of the contemporary medical population by considering an exhaustive assessment of the published literature up to date. Information offer in this field is scarce and publication on this subject is rare.
   Results: Several institutions are aimed at questioning and promoting physician's health in France. The medical population may benefit from usually available health services of diffrent medical specialities including psychiatry and also from specifically care practices which are dedicated to it. National organizations like "National Academy of Medicine", "The French National General Medical Council " ,and the " National Health Watch Institute " are providing a framework based on ethical recommendation issued on epidemiological data overseeing
   Conclusions: Unlike other groups of population who's suffering is mostly self-harming in the case of the medical doctors additional aspects obscure the issue since social consequences are implied. It has been proved(1) that the attainment of care performed by healthy physicians is better both for treatment as for prevention. These aspects show uncertainties on the patient's security subject as well as on malpractice and suitable ways to offer health care to our colleagues.

AB In high-income countries, causes of death in people living with HIV (PLHIV) have changed. Three French national surveys from 2000 to 2010 showed a decrease in AIDS-related and an increase in non-AIDS-related deaths. Deaths notified in PLHIV followed between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2015 in 1 of 13 participating hospitals northeast of Paris area were described. Risk factors for death were assessed, using a multivariable logistic regression model. Of 14,403 individuals, 295 died. Median age at death was 52 years (interquartile range = 47-60) and 77% were men. Sixty-seven individuals (23%) died from non-AIDS-defining nonviral hepatitis-related (NaNH) malignancy, 40 (14%) from AIDS, 34 (12%) from cardiovascular disease (CVD), 33 (11%) from non-AIDS infection, 21 (7%) from liver disease, and 12 (4%) from suicide. Men and women born in sub-Saharan Africa had a lower adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of dying than men having sex with men (MSM) born in France (0.70, 95% confidence interval = 0.45-1.09; and 0.45, 0.28-0.73, respectively). Risk factors for death were older age (aOR = 2.26, 1.36-3.77 for 40-49 years and 2.91, 1.75-4.84 for >50 years vs. 18-39 years), male intravenous drug users (IVDU) transmission (2.24, 1.42-3.54 vs. MSM born in France), AIDS (2.75, 2.10-3.59), antiretroviral therapy initiation in earlier periods, time since HIV diagnosis <1 year, low CD4 cell count nadir, hepatitis B virus and/or hepatitis C virus coinfection (1.69, 1.23-2.30), and psychiatric disorders (1.73, 1.27-2.38). Our study confirms the increasing frequency of non-AIDS-related deaths, mainly NaNH malignancies and CVD, in PLHIV, justifying overall and in some specific populations (psychiatric and IVDU) prevention and screening.

TI The problematics of depression
SO PRESSE MEDICALE
LA English
DT Article
AB Doubt, one of the fundamental symptoms of depression Patients frequently believe they're incurable. They are persuaded that nothing can be done for them. Most of the time, when they are told, they do not accept that they are going through a crisis, a critical period in life. The ever repeated question is: "What's the use?" Which shows to what extent the person is depressed and disillusioned. For them there is nothing that can be of any use.
   A frequent problem The yearly prevalence of phases of major depression in the general population in France is of around 10% and throughout life of more than 10% in men and 20% in women. In France the estimation is that more than one out of 7 inhabitants is depressed.
   The role of the general practitioner The physician must help those who surround the depressed patient, but it is often necessary that the practitioner refer to a consulting specialist who will specify what type of depression the patient is suffering from, eventually make an assessment (using specific scales) of the intensity of the episode, and indicate which type of antidepressor is best adapted, the side effects that should be monitored, the associations to be avoided, and any control biological assays to be foreseen.
   The role of the specialist In parallel, the specialist will schedule a psychotherapy, either maintenance or more structured (in such a way that the patients, if they wish, can work on the mechanisms that provoked the depression and hence protect themselves against any eventual relapse).
   The interest of co-therapies It can be interesting that the general practitioners and specialists collaborate in the necessity for hospitalisation or not (with patient's consent or not), monitoring of a suicide risk, or the need to change treatment. The sharing of the tasks is always very positive for the patients. The patients, as those who surround them, are reassured by the fact that the family doctor and a specialist are collaborating in order to optimise treatment as rapidly as possible. The organisation of such co-therapies requires that the general practitioner also have good knowledge of the various types of psychotherapy available for the patient. (C) 2004, Masson, Paris.

AB Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) has been evaluated in the United States and in a few other coun- tries. MMT has been developed in France since 1995, and over 5 000 patients receive this treatment. However no French study has yet been published on the efficacy of MMT as assessed by a validated scale. Retention in treatment for one year has been considered as a threshold to define maintenance of treatment benefits after discharge from a methadone program; determination of retention predictors is important. Over a three year period, we evaluated patients at admission and during treatment using the Addiction Severity Index (ASI), and urine drug screening was performed weekly; 95 patients (66 males and 29 females) were evaluated at intake. Their mean age was 30.2 +/- 5.5, and they had used opioids for a mean of 10.6 +/- 5.7 years. Their ASI severity scores for drugs, were over 5, showing a clear need for treatment. Female patients differed from males only in the employment-finances ASI score; 43 patients completed at least one year of treatment, after which their drug and legal composite scores significantly improved. No significant changes in their consumption of cocaine, alcohol, benzodiazepines or cannabis were found, but they smoked fewer cigarettes at 12 months. Demographics, ASI severity scores, and history of suicide attempts did not differentiate one-year completers from dropouts (n = 16). However, dropouts had used more buprenorphine and less methadone in the 30 days preceding their admission, and they received a lower dose of methadone during treatment. Our population is comparable to other French MMT populations; they enter treatment after a long history of opioid dependence. The improvement found on the ASI composite scores is also similar to the improvement described in other international studies. Dropouts in our study seem to be more treatment-resistant patients, in the sense that they had used more buprenorphine before intake and were not stabilized with it; and they may have had a more negative attitude towards methadone.

AB Objectives: Involvement in violence is common and may result from a number of deleterious socioeconomic, family, school, behavioral and mental difficulties, and sustained violence in early adolescence. The roles of these factors remain partially addressed because few of them have been investigated with often unknown chronologies. Preventing these issues is crucial to promote health and school achievement. This study assessed their impacts on involvement in violence among boys and girls. Design: Cross-sectional study with lifetime history reconstruction of life events. Methods: The sample included 1,559 middle-school adolescents from north-eastern France (778 boys and 781 girls, mean age 13.5, SD 1.3), who completed a self-administered questionnaire including gender, birth date, father's occupation, parents' education, nationality, income, social supports, and lifetime history reconstruction of parents' separation/divorce/death, alcohol/tobacco/cannabis/hard drugs uses, repeating a school-year, sustained physical/verbal violence, sexual abuse, depressive symptoms (Kandel scale), suicide attempts, and involvement in violence. Involvement in violence was measured with an 11-item scale on fights in group or not, verbal violence, racial actions, taking something of others/shop, set fire, using weapon, damaging public/private property, in school, in school neighborhood, at home, and elsewhere (Cronbach's alpha 0.82, score>90th percentile). Social support was measured using a 9-item scale concerning relationships with people round about (Cronbach's alpha 0.56, score>90th percentile). Data were analyzed using Cox models including all factors to compute adjusted hazard ratios (aHR). Findings: Involvement in violence affected 10.3% of adolescents (14.3% in boys, 6.4% in girls, p<0.001). Among boys, involvement in violence was influenced by being inactive (unemployed/retired) offspring (aHR 2.63, 95%CI 1.48-4.69), alcohol use (1.76, 1.11-2.79), tobacco use (2.71, 1.56-4.69), hard drugs use (3.46, 1.73-6.91), suicide attempt (2.05, 1.05-3.97), sustained physical/verbal violence (1.63, 1.02-2.62), and poor social support (2.64, 1.67-4.16 for score 1-2 and 2.80, 1.64-4.78 for score 3+, vs. score 0). Among girls, involvement in violence was influenced by being inactive offspring (2.39, 95%CI 1.09-5.27), tobacco use (3.57, 1.46-8.72), cannabis use (4.45, 1.36-14.55), depressive symptoms (8.88, 3.01-26.20), and poor social support (9.38, 2.80-31.43 for score 1-2 and 14.23, 4.11-49.23 for score 3+, vs. score 0). Boys had a much higher risk than girls (crude hazard ratio 3.57, 95%CI 2.56-5.00) which did not change when adjusting for all factors studied. Conclusions: Living difficulties highly and similarly enough impacted on involvement in violence among boys and girls in early adolescence. Our findings call for measures preventing and monitoring these difficulties in this crucial life period.

AB Aim Our aim was to identify prescribed drugs associated with violent behaviours using the French PharmacoVigilance Database (FPVD).
   Methods All reports of adverse drug reactions (ADR) recorded in the FPVD between 1January 1985 and 31July 2008 and including the terms aggressiveness or violence were selected. We compared proportion of exposure to different drugs between cases (reports with violence) and noncases (other reports in the database).
   Results Among 537 cases, 56 were included (48 men, mean age 46 years). Misuse was observed in ten cases (18%). In 25 cases (44.6%), a previous psychiatric history was documented. Main drugs involved were nervous system (63.6%) followed by respiratory (7.8%), alimentary tract and metabolism (7.8%), dermatological (5.2%) and anti-infective (5.2%) agents. Case/noncase analysis found an association with dopaminergic agonists (pergolide, pramipexole, bromocriptine, piribedil), benzodiazepines (alprazolam, bromazepam) and serotoninergic antidepressants (taken as a whole), but not antipsychotics or antiepileptics. Association was also found with varenicline, isotretinoin, interferon alpha-2b, rimonabant, benfluorex, topiramate and antiviral drugs (ribavirin, efavirenz).
   Conclusion Dopaminergic agonists, benzodiazepines and serotoninergic antidepressants are the main pharmacological classes able to induce aggressive behaviour. This study also emphasises the putative role of other drugs less known to be involved in such ADR.

AB Parricide is rare and represents 3% of all homicides in France, and 4% of resolved homicides in North America. Consequently, related international literature is sparse, especially concerning the evolution of offenders, and most studies concern small samples or anecdotal cases. We wished to identify the main characteristics of parricidal subjects and their victims, and to assess the socioclinical evolution of the offenders after the assault. To this end, we first studied the sociodemographic, clinical and forensic characteristics of all parricidal patients admitted to France's Henri Colin secure unit between 1996 and 2010 (40 patients). We also assessed the evolution of the 36 patients who had left the secure unit, using questionnaires sent to the psychiatric hospitals where the patients were transferred. We found most offenders to be men (97.5%), with a mean age of 28 years, who were mostly single, unemployed, living with the victim prior to the assault (77.5%), and with a history of psychiatric disorder (72.5%). The population of offenders also displayed an overrepresentation of schizophrenia (87.5%), significant toxic exposure and criminal or violent history. Some patients had attempted suicide before or right after the offense. The assault was mostly committed in the parent's house with an edged weapon, and was characterized by brutality and lack of premeditation. Precipitating factors included substance use and cessation of psychotropic medication. Matricide was more frequent than patricide. At the time of this study, half of the parricidal patients were working or attending therapeutic activities, and most were actively keeping in contact with their family, living as compliant outpatients with no signs of violent behavior. The results of our study on 40 parricidal patients are consistent with data in the literature. With regard to sample evolution, family and community reintegration was relatively effective considering the seriousness of the offense. Several biases in our study disallow the generalization of these findings, and further studies are needed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of the study is to assess the quality of life among male prisoners using the French version of the Nottingham Health Profile, then to investigate the influence of incarceration on emotional reaction. Before the obligatory medical examination at reception into prison, self-administration by prisoners of the French version of the Nottingham Health Profile. Two prisons in Toulouse (south-western France) are concerned: 199 men are included. The score of each dimension on the French version of the Nottingham Health Profile questionnaire and the responses to questions on socio-demographic and penal characteristics and results of medical survey have been studied. The response rate and rate of completion for each dimension are excellent (100%). Considerable evidence is found for the reliability of the Nottingham Health Profile (Cronbach alpha > 0.72 for all dimensions except energy 0.64 and physical mobility 0.64) and for construct validity in terms of distinguishing between groups with expected health differences. Three variables concerning aspects of life in prison are correlated with variation of the emotional reaction dimension. The Nottingham Health Profile can be used in prison populations. It is easy to use, acceptable to inmates, and fulfils stringent criteria of reliability and validity. It allows recognition of the factors correlated with variation of emotional reaction classically connected with suicidal behaviour in prison.

AB Introduction. -With growing prescription and availability, benzodiazepine usage in France is on the increase among the general population. Although its anxiolytic action has long been proven, many side effects can be observed.
   Typology and prevalence. - Paradoxical reactions of aggressiveness under benzodiazepines have been discussed in the scientific literature since the 1960s. This term was introduced to describe reactions of agitation and disinhibition occurring during anxiolytic or hypnotic treatment. Physical aggression, rape, impulsive decision-making and violence have been reported, as well as autoaggressiveness and suicide. General population studies indicate a prevalence of these reactions of less than 1%, and meta-analysis has shown that use of benzodiazepines generates aggressiveness more frequently than it reduces it. It has also been shown that tong-term memory (anterograde amnesia) can be impaired following the ingestion of a benzodiazepine.
   Risk factors. - Benzodiazepine-linked disinhibition, auto and heteroaggressiveness, anxiety and criminal acts have been associated with various vulnerability factors. Although the risk of these paradoxical reactions depends on the number of such factors present in a single patient, the effects of the type and dose of benzodiazepine on the frequency and the intensity of paradoxical symptoms are not clear. In terms of personality, several studies have demonstrated the role of low-stress control (specifically high-trait anxiety) on aggressiveness under benzodiazepines. Other authors underline the role of borderline personality disorder as a major risk factor predicting paradoxical reactions. Results of a study on borderline patients show a prevalence of benzodiazepine-linked disinhibition of 58%. On a neuropharmacological level, the influence of the GABA system on the serotonin control and the impact of alcohol seem to be established. Benzodiazepines, specifically when associated with alcohol, seem to facilitate GABAergic transmission, which can be at the origin of the disinhibited behaviours that have been reported.
   Discussion. - In 2000, France was the first country in terms of benzodiazepine use 17.4% of the adult population had been prescribed an anxiolytic. Implications for medicolegal and clinical practice are discussed. (C) L'Encephate, Paris, 2008.

AB Suicide in prison is in increase for several years and participates in a major problem of public health The number of suicide in prison arises mainly during first moment of incarceration in particular under fifteen days Eighty percent of the subjects who attempt to commit suicide or commit suicide express such ideas months before So the expression of suicidal ideations is a risk factor of suicide and their detection is crucial This study has investigated suicidal risks in prisoners with the assessment of the rate of suicidal ideation as well as their link with risk factors such as depressive disorders individual factors or life s event s life etc Participants were recruited from all-male adults who just arrived in prison since one week in prison of Hauts-de-Seine Nanterre France One hundred prisoners able to read and fill in the scales in autonomy way were evaluated from March to June 2007 using a structured interview Beck Depression inventory (BDI) Scale of suicidal ideation by Beck (SSI) and a short version of Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) The SSI assesses precisely the presence of suicidal ideations and suicidal risk as well as its severity and the score gives some information on the seventy of the suicidal risk The BDI assesses the presence of depressive symptoms as well as the severity of depression according to a classification Light medium or severe depression Eleven out of 100 prisoners have suicidal ideations in SSI They are not connected significantly to the incarceration (chi(2) = 3 52 P= 0 05) The scores go from 3 to 27 (the maximum score for this scale is 36) and the medium score is 8 81 four people have scores around the medium score four people have a score smaller than 5 three people have a score higher than 9 The group of prisoners who have suicidal ideations (n = 11) was compared with the group of prisoners without suicidal ideations (n = 89) Suicidal ideations are in link with the severity of depression in BDI (chi(2) = 12 53 P < 0 001) but not with its presence only Prisoners who have suicidal ideations have a medium score of depression higher than prisoners who have not suicidal ideations (16 45 against 601 the maximum score for this scale is 39) Ninety-one percent of prisoners who have suicidal ideations suffer from medium or severe depression against 35% of prisoners without suicidal ideations Nevertheless the difference is not significant if we compare the two groups with all types of depression-light medium or severe (chi(2) = 274 P < 0 05) Moreover anxious and psychotics symptoms in particular hallucinations in MINI are linked significantly with suicidal ideation (anxiety)(2 = 22 62 P = 0 00001 psychosis chi(2) = 6 639 P = 001 hallucinations chi(2) = 12 8 P = 0 001) Significant risk factors for suicidal ideation in prisoners are life s event such as personal suicidal attempt (chi(2) = 25 58 P < 0 000001) and substance use history (chi(2) = 776 P < 0 01) and the lack of family support (chi(2) = 8 7 P < 0 01) It is not the case for suicidal attempt in family (chi(2) = 1 663 P < 0 05) and a recent death (chi(2) = 1 24 P < 0 015) Prisoners who are more than 35 years old are married have children and are in prison for murder(s) or rape(s) have significantly more suicidal ideations Some prisoners who have not suicidal ideation in the SSI have a suicidal risk in the MINI So we can think these ideas are under-expressed in the SSI because prisoners can feel uncomfortable to express such
   deas Moreover there is more than the half of prisoners who present some signs of depression in BDI for less than one third of prisoners in MINI Depression can be over-expressed in BDI what explain it is the severity of depression which is in link with suicidal ideations and no only its presence because a lot of prisoners (with or without suicidal ideations) seem to have a depression with the assessment of BDI The results must be used with care because the population of the study is quite small in particular for prisoners who have suicidal ideations Furthermore it is very heterogeneous and judging origins of the link between suicidal ideations and risk factors is very difficult In conclusion these results cannot be generalised to the whole prison they are specifics to this place of research Symptoms of depression anxiety and psychosis as well as personal history of suicidal attempt substance use and a lack of family support are risk factors for suicidal ideations in prisoners The precocious detection of suicidal ideation and risk factors would prevent from suicide and reduce the risks (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS All rights reserved

AB Due to early detection of mental ill-health being an important suicide preventive strategy, the multi-centre EU funded Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) study compared three school-based mental health promotion programs to a control group. In France, 1007 students with a mean age of 15.2 years were recruited from 20 randomly assigned schools. This paper explores the French results of the SEYLE's two-stage screening program (ProfScreen) and of the cross-program suicidal emergency procedure. Two-hundred-thirty-five ProfScreen students were screened using 13 psychopathological and risk behaviour scales. Students considered at risk because of a positive finding on one or more scales were offered a clinical interview and, if necessary, referred for treatment. A procedure for suicidal students (emergency cases) was set up to detect emergencies in the whole cohort (n = 1007). Emergency cases were offered the same clinical interview as the ProfScreen students. The interviewers documented their reasons for referrals in a short report. 16,2% of the ProfScreen students (38/235) were referred to treatment and 2,7% of the emergency cases (27/1007) were also referred to treatment due to high suicidal risk. Frequent symptoms in those students referred for evaluation were depression, alcohol misuse, non-suicidal self-injuries (NSSI), and suicidal behaviours. According to the multivariate regression analysis of ProfScreen, the results show that the best predictors for treatment referral were NSSI (OR 2.85), alcohol misuse (OR 2.80), and depressive symptoms (OR 1.13). Analysis of the proportion for each scale of students referred to treatment showed that poor social relationships (60%), anxiety (50%), and suicidal behaviours (50%) generated the highest rate of referrals. Qualitative analysis of clinician's motivations to refer a student to mental health services revealed that depressive symptoms (51%), anxiety (38%), suicidal behaviours (40%), and negative life events (35%) were the main reasons for referrals. Thus, not only the classical psychopathological symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal behaviours, but also negative life events and poor social relationships (especially isolation) motivate referrals for treatment.

AB Introduction: Despite numerous explanatory hypotheses, few studies have involved a large national clinical sample examining risk factors in the occurrence of rapid cycling during the course of bipolar illness.
   Methods: From 1,090 manic bipolar I disorder inpatients included in a multicenter national study in France, 958 could be classified as rapid or non-rapid cyclers and assessed for demographic, illness course, clinical, psychometric, temperament, comorbidity, and treatment characteristics.
   Results: Rapid cycling bipolar disorder occurred in 9% (n=86) of the study group. Compared to nonrapid cyclers (n=872), patients with rapid cycling experienced the onset of their illness at a younger age, a higher number of prior episodes, more depression during the first episode, and more suicide attempts. At study entry, they also experienced manic episodes with more depressive and anxious symptoms, but less psychotic features. The following independent variables were associated. with rapid cycling: longer duration of illness, antidepressant treatment, episodes with no free intervals, cyclothymic temperament, lower scores on the Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms and presence of thyroid disorder. Retrospective study limited to bipolar I disorder inpatients; several factors previously associated with rapid cycling were not assessed.
   Conclusion: Our findings may confirm previous descriptions, according to which rapid-cycling develops later in the course of illness following a sensitization process triggered by antidepressant use or thyroid dysfunction, in patients with a depression-mania-free interval course, and cyclothymic temperament.

AB Introduction. Few data exist to estimate the burden of manic episodes on healthcare systems or the therapeutic strategies used. This study was undertaken to identify treatment strategies chosen, and to assess the "real-world" direct medical cost of treating manic episodes necessitating hospitalisation. Method. Case record data were reviewed during the three months following hospitalisation for a manic episode in France. Healthcare resource utilisation was assessed, direct costs calculated, and treatment strategies analysed. A total of 137 patients files (51.8% female; mean age: 35 years) were reviewed and data on 185 hospitalisations collected. Results. The mean duration of hospitalisation was 47 days over the study period. The most common treatment strategy during hospitalisation was the combination of a mood stabiliser with a neuroleptic drug (64% of patients at day 30). Anticonvulsants including valproate (39%) and carbamazepine (20%) were more common than lithium (42%). Treatment received during hospitalisation was generally continued after discharge, with a trend away from neuroleptics and towards mood stabilisers. The mean direct costs incurred over the three-month study period was Euro 22 297, with 98.6% of those costs due to hospitalisation. Conclusion. These results confirm that the costs of treating a manic episode are high, and overwhelmingly due to the cost of hospitalisation. (C) 2002 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

AB Ten million people are currently incarcerated around the world. In prison, psychiatric disorders are 4 to 10 times more frequent than in the general population. Beyond the many ethical and societal issues raised by these observations, specific structures have been developed in France (SMPR, UHSA). Within these structures, psychiatric practice and clinical assessment must be based on the same recommendations as outside the prison. However, it appears that several specific clinical features are encountered. These features emerge first from a 'selection bias", resulting in the presence of patients with a predominance of "positive" symptoms (particularly for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia), that has been associated with an increased risk of forensic act. The other specific clinical features of incarcerated patients come from the particular characteristics of the prison environment which is a concentrate of stressors. Nonspecific symptoms (anxiety, insomnia, suicidal thoughts, etc.), and specific symptoms related to the characteristics of the prison (detention conditions, links with the prison administration, etc.) will be highlighted. Two examples will be developed: self-harm and delusions of persecution. It appears essential for health professionals who evaluate incarcerated patients or working in prisons, to know the specificities and constraints of life in prison, to incorporate these aspects in a rigorous clinical evaluation.

AB The prevalence of schizophrenic disorders in the general population is 1%, that is, in France, approximately 400 00 people, given the age group concerned.
   The sex ratio is one. The first episode occurs between the ages of 15 and 25 years in men, a little later in women. 90% of patients treated for schizophrenia are aged from 15 to 55 years.
   The short-term course is marked by a relapse rote after the first episode estimated at 20-40%. The long-term evolution is marked by substantial excess mortality a suicide rote of 10-20% and an overall decrease of approximately 10 years in life expectancy.
   Only 10% of patients will hove an outcome including full autonomy The socioeconomic impact is therefore considerable, with a mean cost of management estimated at 15000 Euros per year
   Genetic factors affect vulnerability or predisposition to schizophrenia. Accordingly a first-degree relative of a schizophrenic patient has a risk 5 to 10 times higher of developing the disease than does a person with no affected relatives. This risk is not one of simple Mendelian transmission but rather vulnerability which implies the intervention of several genes.
   Some environmental factors hove also been identified, including exposure to influenza virus during the gestational period (between the 4th and 7th month of pregnancy). This finding reinforces the hypothesis of a neurodevelopmental origin of schizophrenia.
   Finally, among other associated factors, regular cannabis use appears to quadruple the risk of disease.

AB Using data from the nationally representative Consultants des Centres d'Examens de Sante (CONSTANCES) study in France (2012-2014; n = 67,057), we assessed the relationship between intergenerational socioeconomic mobility and adult depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale scores of = 16 in men or = 20 in women) and antidepressant use. Socioeconomic position was ascertained by occupational grade (childhood: maternal and paternal measures prior to age 15 years combined; adulthood: participant's own). We used logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, parental history of psychiatric disorders and suicide, health behaviors, and chronic health problems. Compared with the reference group (persistently high socioeconomic circumstances), participants in other groups had elevated levels of depression (for upward mobility, multivariate odds ratios (OR) = 1.21; intermediate socioeconomic position, 1.28; downward mobility, 1.66; persistently low socioeconomic position, 1.82). Downward mobility and persistently low socioeconomic position were also associated with elevated odds of antidepressant use (for downward mobility, multivariate OR = 1.24; for persistently low socioeconomic position, 1.36). In supplementary analyses, the association of socioeconomic mobility with depression was stronger in women than in men and among younger participants (aged 18-29 years) than among older participants. Factors that contribute to depression risk and socioeconomic inequalities in this area appeared to be at play already in childhood; this should be acknowledged by clinicians and policymakers.

TI Health of adolescents restricted under court order: Self-esteem,

SO ARCHIVES DE PEDIATRIE
LA French
DT Article
ID STYLE
AB Objective. To describe certain aspects of the physical and mental health of adolescents with restricted or deprived liberty as ordered by the court within the Youth Judicial Protection Service (YJP), and their ability to project themselves into the future.
   Methods. Survey by on-line self-administered questionnaires.
   Population. Among the adolescents, 373 were randomly selected with restricted or deprived liberty, in the Lorraine region (eastern France).
   Statistical analysis. The data were managed and analyzed using the Modalisae (R) 7.0 (Kynos, Paris, France) survey processing software. Depending on the type of variable, comparisons were made using the chi-square test or analysis of variance. The significance threshold used was P < 0.05.
   Main results. The response rate was 47%. The respondents included 820% boys and 18% girls, with a mean age of 16.4 +/- 1.5 years. More than nine out of ten stated that they were satisfied with their health. Among the girls, 16.7% stated that they had already had thoughts of suicide (boys, 3.8%; P < 0.05). Of the total population, 24% said that during the last 12 months, they had needed to see a doctor (or healthcare professional), but they had had to give up the consultation at least once (too far, too expensive, etc.). Their average overall Rosenberg self-esteem score was 32.4 +/- 6.4, roughly the same as their peers in the general population (girls, 28.2; boys, 33.2; P < 0.05). They said that they had projects for the future and nearly eight out of ten stated that they were confident in their own ability to succeed in their life, especially those who felt supported by their parents.
   Discussion. To our knowledge, these facts had never been explored among adolescents with restricted or deprived liberty. This study shows results that do not match the usual representation of these adolescents by healthcare or education professionals. The quality of the work during the educational support given by the YJP Service could help explain these results.
   Conclusion. These findings need to-be explored further by additional studies, which could also aim to measure the impact on physical and mental health of the educational support given by Youth Judicial Protection Service. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB In 1978 Italy implemented Law Number 180, the reform law that blocked all new admissions to public mental hospitals. After 40 years without mental hospitals, we aim at understanding the consequences of the Italian reform in terms of mental health care facility and staff availability. We compared the organization of the Italian mental health system with that of countries belonging to the Group of 7 (G7) major advanced economies. Italy has nearly 8 psychiatrists, 20 nurses, 2 social workers and less than 3 psychologists per 100,000 population, while for example in France there were 22 psychiatrists, in Japan 102 nurses, in the United States 18 social workers, and in Canada and France more than 45 psychologists per 100,000 population. In terms of inpatient facilities, no beds in mental hospitals were available in Italy, while in the other G7 countries mental hospital beds ranged from 8 in the United Kingdom to 204 in Japan per 100 000 population. In Italy there were fewer beds for acute care in general hospitals but more beds in community residential facilities than in the other G7 countries. Service use data showed variability in the provision of mental health care throughout the country. Soon after the implementation of the Italian reform the absolute number of compulsory admissions progressively declined, from more than 20,000 in 1978 to less than 9000 in 2015. Alongside the progressive decline of psychiatric beds imposed by Law 180, the age-adjusted suicide rate remained stable, ranging from 7.1/100,000 population in 1978 to 6.3/100,000 population in 2012. The population of psychiatric patients placed in Italian forensic psychiatric hospitals progressively declined. During the last 40 years without mental hospitals, Italy has seen a progressive consolidation of a community-based system of mental health care. We highlighted, however, reasons for concern, including a decreasing staffing level, a potential use of community residential facilities as long-stay residential services, a still too high variability in service provision across the country, and lack of national data on physical restraints. At a national level, the resources allocated to mental health care are lower in Italy than in other high-income countries.

LA French
DT Article
DE clinical audit; evaluation of clinical practice; patient management in
   hospital; quality improvement; suicidal adolescents
AB We describe the implementation and results of a clinical audit of the management of suicidal adolescents in hospital that was carried out as part of the French national suicide prevention programme. The ANAES definition of a clinical audit is: << an assessment method using defined criteria that compares care practices with accepted standards and measures the quality of these practices and the results of care with a view to improving them >>. Standards for the audit were derived from the clinical practice guidelines published by ANAES (French National Agency for Accreditation and E valuation in Health) in November 1998. They comprised 15 criteria covering ressources available and procedures implemented: patient management in hospital (9 criteria), contacts made with the patient's environment outside hospital (2 criteria) and preparation for discharge from hospital (4 criteria). Participation in the audit was voluntary. Overall, 76 hospitals from the 10 regions of France with a suicide prevention programme took part in the audit and made 1554 observations. The number of observations per hospital ranged from 1 to 42. Compliance with the criteria was > 80 % for 5 criteria, 50-80 % for 3 criteria, and < 50 % for 7 criteria. A total of 26 hospitals proposed a structured improvement plan, ie, scheduled, ordered and ranked measures with a definition of responsibilities and follow-up. Of these 26 hospitals, 15 had implemented the three ANAES recommendations (setting up a working group for the project, using a grid to analyse results, drafting a structured report) whereas only 5 of the 50 hospitals that did not come up with an improvement plan had done so. An operational outcome thus seems related to compliance with the audit method. Three years after the audit was set up, 17 hospitals took part in a second round. Improvements were noted for 12 criteria, mainly for those giving poor results in the first round. However, these improvements concerned few hospitals (eg just 4 hospitals for the criterion with the worst result in the first round). A worsening of compliance was noted for 3 criteria. In conclusion, hospitals were found to comply with guidelines relating to the management of suicidal adolescents in hospital. However, compliance with guidelines relating to making contact with the patient's environment outside hospital and preparing for discharge was less good. Although the hospitals taking part in the audit endorsed our method, our experience showed that, to be effective, clinical audits need methodological support and a well-defined time schedule.

   Huntington's disease; Neurological disease; Psychiatric disorders
ID SUICIDE; REPEAT; RISK; GENE
AB Objective. - Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative genetic, autosomal dominant disease. George Huntington describes this trouble in 1872. In 1993, scientist founded mutation on IT15 gene on 4th chromosome. Prevalence in France is 1/10 000 without sex predominance or race. The main symptoms are: choreic movements, axial impairment, psychiatric disorders and the presence of cognitive impairment. The diagnostic is clinic, genetic and radiologic. Despite the absence of curative treatment, symptomatic care supports deficit symptoms of the pathology, thus improves the quality of life of patients. In the context of a comprehensive and optimal therapy, health professionals provide recommendations for guidelines like Huntington's disease national reference center in August 2015. We will define diagnostic and clinical aspects of Huntington's disease, and then we will focus our analysis on the psychiatric aspect.
   Material and method. - First, we will illustrate management provided by our teams. Patient A had positive diagnostic of Huntington's disease and personal psychiatric antecedent of depression. She was hospitalized in neurological unit for a panic attack in August 2015. They give tetrabenazine and to prevent depressive effect we prescribed antidepressant first (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor), then antipsychotic (risperidone, then haloperidol) and benzodiazepine. Patient B had Huntington's disease in family and personal diagnostic of Huntington's disease and personal psychiatric antecedent of depression. She was admitted in psychiatric unit for psychotic symptom. She received antipsychotic (risperidone) and antidepressant (venlafaxine) with benzodiazepine. Both of them had clinical improvement. Patient A, went to reeducation care, patient B went home with nurse. When we analyzed literature on the psychiatric therapeutic in Huntington's disease with review, we found that apathy is the most psychiatric symptom in Huntington's disease (50-80% Inserm). Benzodiazepine had good result for anxiety. We must search and treat psychiatric disorder like depression and mood disorder. Irritability and anxiety are symptoms of mood disorder and can be treated with antidepressive and mood stabilizer. Suicide is an emergency because of the mortality rate. The guideline is the same of suicide in psychiatric emergency. Antipsychotics are not avoided and used for choreic and psychotic symptoms (delirium, hallucination...) but second generation antipsychotics are generally preferable because of the lesser presence of adverse event.
   Results. - The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) for moods sign are the most frequently used therapy reference. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and mood stabilizer have similar results to those obtained in mood disorders without neurodegenerative pathology. Antipsychotic like risperidone or olanzapine are good requirements. Guidelines of Huntington's disease national reference center and literature give these therapeutic choices. With our two patients, we can see clinical improvement and the main objective was return home. Literature explain important role of psychotherapy, social, diet and hygiene habits. We must have global care like other psychiatric patient and more because of neurological reach.
   Conclusion. - The implementation of classical specific therapeutic in psychiatry improves these symptoms and optimizes the quality of life for our patients. A comprehensive and multidisciplinary support involving medical and paramedical rehabilitation is a necessity to take into account. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Multi-morbidity such as cumulating mental health, behavioral, and school difficulties (consumptions of alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and hard drugs, obesity, depressive symptoms, suicide attempts, involvement in violence, and low school performance) is common in early adolescence and can be favored by a number of socioeconomic factors (gender, age, nationality, family structure, parents' education, father' occupation, and income). This study assessed the concurrent roles of various socioeconomic factors in multi-morbidity defined as cumulated number of difficulties (CD) which has been partially documented.
   Methods: Adolescents from middle schools in north-eastern France (N = 1,559) completed a questionnaire measuring socioeconomic characteristics and mental health, behavioral, and school difficulties. Data were analyzed using logistic regression models.
   Results: Alcohol use affected 35.2% of subjects, tobacco use 11.2%, cannabis use 5.6%, hard drugs use 2.8%, obesity 10.6%, depressive symptoms 13.3%, suicide attempts 9.9%, involvement in violence 10.3%, and low school performance 8.2%. Insufficient income and non-intact families impacted most mental health, behavioral, and school difficulties with adjusted odds ratios (ORa) between 1.51 and 3.72. Being immigrant impacted illicit drugs use and low school performance (ORa 2.31-4.14); low parents' education depressive symptoms (1.42) and school performance (3.32); and manual-worker/inactive offspring low school performance (2.56-3.05). Multi-morbidity was very common: CD0 44.1%, CD1 30.8%, CD2-3 18.4%, and CD >= 4 6.7%. Insufficient income, divorced/separated parents, reconstructed families, and single parents played impressive roles with strong ORa gradients (reaching 4.86) from CD1 to CD >= 4. Being European immigrant, low parents' education, and low fathers' occupations had significant gender-age-adjusted odds ratios for CD2-3 and CD >= 4, but these became non-significant when adjusted for all socioeconomic factors. Older adolescents had higher risks for multi-morbidity which did not change when adjusting for all socioeconomic factors.
   Conclusions: Multi-morbidity including a wide range of mental health, behavioral, and school difficulties was common in early adolescence. Insufficient income and non-intact families played impressive roles. Being immigrant, low parents' education, and low fathers' occupations also played strong roles but these were explained by insufficient income and non-intact families. Prevention against multi-morbidity should be designed to help adolescents to solve their difficulties, especially among adolescents with socioeconomic difficulties.

AB Jean Raymond Pacho was born in Nice, France, on January 23, 1794. After his initial experiences travelling in Egypt he immediately showed an innate passion for architecture started working on painting important Islamic monuments that he had visited. Between 1827 and 1829 two volumes of work were published in Paris; the second of which contains illustrations accompanying the text of the first volume. Immediately after the publication he ended his life by committing suicide in Paris at the age of only thirty-five. Among the monuments of the medieval Libyan territory described and drawn by Pacho the Fatimid palace of Ajdabiya also known as Kasr Ladjedabiah or the castle of Ajdabiya figured prominantely.
   The Palace, typical rectangular layout, was built so as to accommodate the Fatimid Caliph and his court. It was equipped with round towers at each corner and with rectangular ones in the centre. On one of the shorter sides the only monumental entrance portico - very similar to that of the contemporary palaces of North Africa like Raqqada (9 th century), Al-Qa'im in Mahdia (10 th century), Ziri in Ashir (11 th century) and the entrance of the Great Mosque of Mahdia (912) - was located.
   In summary, the palace of Ajdabiya is as one of the first Fatimid constructions built between 934 and 946 by Amer al-Qa'im bi-Allah al-Mahdi, For this reason, Pacho's designs take on a far more important role of that of just simple architectural significance.

   CONSUMPTION; ABUSE; INTOXICATION; PAPAVERINE
AB Opium is a substance extracted from Papaver somniferum L that is chronically abused specially in the traditional production regions. Reports on opium poisoning has largely disappeared from the occidental literature on drug problems but recent scientific articles show cases of death related to opium in industrialized countries. This fact led us to consider the interest of knowing the state of the art of acute opium intoxication in modern times. This work shows a compilation of these uncommon cases occurred in different settings and circumstances. Data were obtained by a computer assisted search of the literature using the key words "opium poisoning", "poppy", "poppy seeds", and "papaver somniferum" in PubMed, accompanied by a hand search of the reference lists of all articles for any relevant studies not included in the database. In addition, Google Scholar, government reports, and cases adequately documented on websites were reviewed.
   Type 1 cases, Accidental opium intoxications when it is used as a recreational drug: Reported cases came mainly from industrialized countries. They were mostly male with a range age of 17-64 years. Many had antecedents of alcoholism or drug abuse and opium tea was used as a substitute of heroin. Rachacha has caused poisonings in France and has been detected in a stash in Spain. Toxicological analysis was documented in forensic cases. The danger of this renewed interest in opium is exemplified in that many of the poisoning cases resulted in fatalities. Type 2 cases, Accidental opium intoxications in children or adults when it used as folk remedy: Pediatric intoxication after the use of opium as folk remedy are mainly published in traditional opium-producing areas with a long history of use or ethnic communities in England or USA. Addiction to opium was common among relatives. Type 3 cases, Opium intoxications with poppy seeds consumed as food: Due to excessive consumption of opium seeds as food, sporadic cases of mild toxicity had been reported and morphine contents were documented. Type 4 cases: Accidental opium intoxications when using the abdominal or pelvic cavity for concealing the drug: Accidental opium body packer intoxications are seen in patients who traveled from illegal opium areas of production. Type 5 cases: Suicides by opium: Opium was a prevalent agent among cases of suicides in Iran but data are scarce. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study is to examine the changing patterns of child homicide in the USA and the other 9 major Western countries between 1974 and 1999. On the basis of standardized WHO mortality data, 5-year mean rates of Baby (< 1 year), Infant (1 - 4), Child (5 - 14), and General Population Rates for Homicide (GPRH) were analyzed for 1974 - 78 and 1995 - 99 for the USA and major Western countries. The analysis provided ratios of change for children's homicide between 1974 and 1999 and ratio of ratios between "adult'" and children's homicide. Over the period USA male Baby homicide rose by 78% and Females 44% with a combined rise in All Children [ 0 - 14] homicides of 45%, within the context of a declining adult GPRH. In the 1970s, 3 major Western countries had either higher or similar children's homicide rates to the USA, but by the late 1990s none did. Moreover, between 1974 and 1999, the USA had the biggest rise in Baby (< 1) and All Children's deaths, and only France had substantial increases, whereas Baby homicide rates fell significantly in 6 other countries. The findings indicate a worrying deterioration in U. S. child homicides. Possible links with child abuse and explanations for the results are briefly discussed. Urgent case-specific research is required to determine the cause/s for and how to reverse the worsening child homicide situation in the USA.

ID 2 REGIONS; POPULATION; SUICIDE; ALCOHOL; ROOM
AB Objective: The authors assessed the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among a population of patients examined in the emergency service of a French general hospital. They compared patients with and without psychiatric disorders. They also compared patients where the primary motive of emergency was psychiatric to those whose psychiatric disorders were secondarily diagnosed by a systematic assessment.
   Method: Five hundred consecutive patients admitted to the emergency service of Bichat Claude Bernard Hospital (Paris, France) were interviewed with standardized questionnaires. Demographic details were collected along with information on current and past contacts with emergencies and psychiatric services. Psychiatric disorders were identified using a structured psychiatric interview, the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Domestic violence was identified with a specific checklist validated for this purpose.
   Results: Prevalence of psychiatric disorders was 38% (189 patients). Forty (8%) patients were primary psychiatric cases referred to the emergency department for psychiatric reasons, while 149 (30%) were secondary psychiatric cases, as revealed by a systematic assessment of their mental state, Psychiatric patients, primary or secondary, were more often homeless (13.6% vs. 1.95%). They had been more often referred to the emergency department after an aggressive (7.4% vs. 3.5%) or violent behavior (5.8% vs. 0.9%) and less often after an accident (8.4% vs. 14.3%). Psychiatric patients were more often examined after an episode of domestic violence (21.7% vs. 6.8%). Psychiatric diagnoses, according to the DSM-IV criteria, were depression (80 cases), generalized anxiety disorder (34 cases) acute alcohol intoxication (21 cases), alcohol dependence (20 cases), schizophrenia (16 cases), posttraumatic stress disorder (14 cases), drug abuse (4 cases), agoraphobia (4 cases), alcohol abuse (3 cases), anorexia nervosa (3 cases), mania (2 cases) and obsessive compulsive disorder (2 cases). The proportion of psychiatric diagnoses was equivalent in primary and secondary psychiatric cases except for schizophrenia (more often a primary demand for psychiatric help) and acute alcohol intoxication (more often revealed by a systematic assessment of the mental state).
   Conclusion: Thirty-eight percent of the patients examined in a French emergency service presented with psychiatric disorders. The majority of the patients (78%) were not referred to the emergency service for psychiatric reasons. Patients seen in an emergency service should thus be identified as a population at risk for psychiatric reasons. Patients seen in an emergency service should thus be identified as a population at risk for psychiatric disorders whatever their reason for utilizing this service. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Background: It is crucial for clinicians and researchers to understand the factors associated with the disclosure of suicidal ideation. Describing the characteristics of those who do not disclose their suicidal ideation or who disclose their ideation only to close others, to health professionals or to both may help researchers and clinicians in their preventive efforts to treat persons at risk for suicidal behavior.
   Methods: The sample was drawn from a large cross-sectional survey (n=22,138) on mental health in France. The analyses were based on the 4,156 persons (17.1%) who endorsed lifetime suicidal ideation with or without a history of suicide attempt and who indicated whether and to whom they disclosed their ideation. Socio-demographics, current mental disorders, and social connectedness were assessed.
   Results: Half of those with suicidal ideation had not shared their ideation with anyone, 6.3% did so with health professionals only, 20% with friends or family only, and 20% with both healthcare professionals and close others. Male gender, older age, lower education level and poor social connectedness were associated with greater odds of non-disclosure. Adjusting for socio-demographics and social connectedness, suicidal behavior and mental disorders were overall associated an increased likelihood of sharing suicidal ideation with health professionals.
   Limitations: Cross-sectional survey assessing lifetime suicidal ideation and disclosure.
   Conclusions: The findings provide important insight into the individual and social factors to take into account in suicidal ideation disclosure. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To evaluate longitudinal care needs and health service access among mother-infant pairs after adolescent pregnancy. Methods: In a case-control study, data were analyzed from primiparous adolescent and adult mother-infant pairs who delivered at Reunion Island University Hospital, France, between January 2004 and December 2006, and were followed-up from maternity discharge until December 2011. Infant outcomes were hospitalization during the first 2 years of life, hospital access for "non-medical" reasons, and neuropsychiatric care. Maternal outcomes were number of pregnancies and childbirths, rapid repeat pregnancy (RRP) rate, pregnancy morbidities, and use of health services. Results: Data from 476 cases and 476 controls were analyzed. Adolescent and control offspring did not differ in the measured outcomes. Adolescent and control mothers had, respectively, 2.4 +/- 1.3 and 1.9 +/- 1.1 pregnancies; 1.9 +/- 0.8 and 1.6 +/- 0.7 childbirths; and RRP rates of 7.6% and 2.7% (all P < 0.001). Adolescents had less pregnancy-related pathologies at the index pregnancy and more frequently had natural deliveries (P < 0.05). Younger mothers exhibited higher rates (19.7% versus 6.9%, P = 0.001) of care for psychosocial reasons (suicide attempt, acute alcohol or drug intoxication, road accident, psychiatric problems, physical abuse). Conclusion: Concerns arise from the long-term psychosocial risk among adolescent mothers. (C) 2013 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Aim. - Several studies have identified a high prevalence of sleep disorders and insomnia in the French population; however these studies especially focused on sleep did not give enough details on the sociodemographic and occupational characteristics of subjects with sleep disorders. The aim of this study was to characterize adults complaining of sleep disorders in a vast population-based health demographics study (Barometre Sante, Institut national pour l'education a la sante [INPES]).
   Method. - Fourteen thousand seven hundred and thirty-four adults aged from 18 to 65 years old were interviewed by telephone and "subjects with severe sleep disorders in the last 8 days" were isolated and compared with the others regarding sociodemographic and occupational aspects and with regard to psychiatric disorders. The sleep items were extracted from the Duke and WHOQOL (brief form) questionnaires. Depressive disorders were recognized based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) Short-Form (CIDI-SF) and the ISD 10.
   Results. - Among the subjects, 12.5% were concerned. Women, young or subjects after 45, low income, employees and unemployed categories had significantly more sleep disorders. Sleep disorders in the last 8 days were also significantly linked to previous depressive episodes, anxiety disorders and history of suicide.
   Conclusion. - Assessing sleep disorders in the last 8 days seems to be a good method to identify severely affected subjects in general population surveys. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Szmul Zygielbojm was a politician and a member of the Bund and its Central Committee as well as a councilman of Warsaw and Lodz. In 1940, he left occupied Poland and spent the rest of the war in exile - first in France and then in the United States of America. In 1942, he arrived in Great Britain, where he served as a representative of his party in the National Council of the Polish government in exile. For over a year he had devoted his energies to attempts to inform the world about the mass extermination of Jews. In May 1943, he committed suicide in protest against inaction of the free world in the face of the Shoah.
   In January 1940, as he departed Warsaw, Szmul Zygielbojm left behind his family: wife Mania, son Artur and a daughter from his first marriage, Rywka. Between 1940 and 1941, a separated family maintained correspondence. The presented letters (the letters presented above) were sent from Poland by Zygielbojm's wife and two children. Unfortunately, there exists only one letter from Zygielbojm to his wife, the rest are missing. This emotional correspondence shows the drama of the family, but also allows one to have a look at Zygielbojm's private life, thus complementing the politician's biography. The Zygielbojms' wartime correspondence is also an example of how letters can be an important source in the Holocaust research.

AB Euthanasia is a controversial issue in today's society. In countries where euthanasia is legal, it is mainly associated with people with cancer. We retrospectively studied the frequency and basis of patients' requests for active euthanasia in the oncology setting. Methods. Recurrent requests for euthanasia made by the patients of Leon-Berard cancer center (Lyon, France) between 2001 and 2003 were recorded by questioning the physicians and nurse supervisors in charge or by collecting information from the minutes of multidisciplinary palliative care meetings. We also collected information on the general health status of the patients, their motives and their evolution over time, as well as responses from caregivers. Results. We identified 16 requests for euthanasia. These involved 8 men, 7 women and I child (median age, 56 years), corresponding to 1% of the total deaths recorded during the period. In 2 cases, the request had come from the family only. The most frequent motives were psychological distress (38%), desire for self-autonomy (31%) and pain (31%). Half of the patients, particularly those striving for autonomy, persisted with their request until death, whereas 2 of 3 requests motivated by physical or psychological distress were not maintained. Sedation was administered to 3 patients in response to recurrent requests. Conclusion. Requests for euthanasia in cancer patients are rare but may occur. Sometimes suffering is not relieved by palliative care and the request is maintained. Dealing with these patients puts caregivers in a difficult situation.

AB Background: A management tool, called the Experience Feedback Committee, has been applied for patient safety and successfully used in medical departments. The purpose of this study was to analyse the functioning of an Experience Feedback Committee in a psychiatric department and to explore its contribution to the particular issues of patient safety in mental health.
   Methods: We conducted a descriptive study based on all the written documents produced by the Experience Feedback Committee between March 2010 and January 2013. The study was conducted in Grenoble University Hospital in France. We analysed all reported incidents, reports of meetings and event analysis reports. Adverse events were classified according to the Conceptual Framework for the International Classification for Patient Safety.
   Results: A total of 30 meetings were attended by 22 professionals including seven physicians and 12 paramedical practitioners. We identified 475 incidents reported to the Experience Feedback Committee. Most of them (92 %) had no medical consequence for the patient. Eleven incidents were investigated with an analysis method inspired by civil aviation security systems. Twenty-one corrective actions were set up, including eight responses to the specific problems of a mental health unit, such as training to respond to situations of violence or management of suicide attempts.
   Conclusions: The Experience Feedback Committee makes it possible to involve mental healthcare professionals directly in safety management. This tool seems appropriate to manage specific patient safety issues in mental health.

ID VEGETATIVE STATE
AB For the last 20 years or so, conflicts on life-support have become the object of widespread media coverage. By focusing public opinion on the alleged physicians' unreasonable obstinacy, these publicized cases impact social debates on life-support. By these, they justify claims for the legalization of assisted suicide, specifically the practice of termination of life by lethal injection. Via a conducted survey of the various caretakers and families involved in this type of situation, we propose an analysis based on the different forms of unreasonable obstinacy. The reasonable or unreasonable nature of treatments can often be perceived differently by physicians, caretakers and families. At least 6 unreasonable obstinacy cases can be brought to light. Publicized cases always involve a conflict between the physicians in charge and the families who view the situation as unreasonable. Nonetheless, evidence shows that in these situations, the roles are often reversed, and the families are the ones demanding the use of unreasonable care. A typical example of this is a recent case that became the object of legal proceedings in France. As it turns out, the publicized filter does not reflect the true reality of cases involving unreasonable care. Specific procedures could aid in notifying the existence of such situations. The role of health care professionals (excluding physicians) appears to play an essential part in preventing these situations from happening.

AB Background: The multicenter national Mortalite 2005 survey aimed at describing the distribution of causes of death among HIV-infected adults in France in 2005 and its changes as compared with 2000.
   Methods: Physicians involved in the management of HIV infection notified deaths and documented the causes using a standardized questionnaire similar to the previous survey performed in 2000.
   Results: Overall, 1042 deaths were notified in 2005 (vs 964 in 2000): with median age, 46 years (vs 41 years); men, 76%; and median last CD4 cell count, 161/mm(3) (vs 94). The proportion of underlying causes of death due to AIDS decreased (36% in 2005 vs 47% in 2000), and the proportion of cancer not related to AIDS or hepatitis (17% vs 11%), liver related disease (15% vs 13%: hepatitis C, 11%, and hepatitis B, 2%), cardiovascular disease (8% vs 7%), or suicide (5% vs 4%) increased. Among the 375 AIDS-related deaths, the most frequent event was non-Hodgkin lymphoma (28%). Among cancers not related to AIDS or hepatitis, the most frequent localizations were lung (31%) and digestive tract (14%). Among the 154 liver-related deaths, 24% were due to hepatocarcinoma.
   Conclusions: The heterogeneity of causes of death among HIV-infected adults was confirmed and intensified in 2005, with 3 causes following AIDS: cancers and liver-related and cardiovascular diseases.

AB Objective: We compared official maternal mortality statistics with those from a special study covering all pregnancy-associated deaths in two European countries (Finland and France) and in two US states (Massachusetts and North Carolina) in 1999-2000 to characterize pregnancy-related deaths that are not included in official statistics.
   Study design: We linked the official ICD-10-based maternal mortality data for 84 deaths with study data on 404 pregnancy-associated deaths. Results: Of the pregnancy-associated deaths, 151 were pregnancy-related. We found 69 pregnancy-related deaths that had not been included as maternal deaths. and two deaths coded as maternal deaths that did not meet our definition for a pregnancy-related death. In total, 58 of these 69 deaths were from medical causes and I I were from external causes or injuries (10 postpartum depression-related suicides and one accidental drug poisoning). The unreported deaths due to medical causes included 27 direct, 15 indirect, and two direct/indirect pregnancy-related deaths and 14 possibly pregnancy-related deaths. The most common causes of the unreported deaths due to medical causes were intracerebral hemorrhage (7 deaths), peripartum cardiomyopathy (4), pulmonary embolism (4) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (4). Conclusions: The collection of data on pregnancy-related and pregnancy-associated deaths is useful for countries with low maternal mortality figures. The use of various data-collection methods may substantially increase the quality of maternal mortality statistics. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE NEUROSCIENCES; EDUCATION; CHILD REARING; PARENTING; HEALTH EDUCATION;
   ADOLESCENT BEHAVIOR; CHILD PSYCHOLOGY; PSYCHOLOGY, EDUCATIONAL; SCHOOLS
AB In the ongoing effort to improve public health in France, schools have become a priority in recent years, after it emerged that France is the EU country where behavior-related mortality is highest (accidents, risk-taking, suicide, alcohol, smoking, lack of exercise). These harmful behaviors begin during adolescence but are conditioned by mental construction during early childhood. The current situation of health education in schools is worrying, for two reasons. First, there is no coherent doctrine. The concepts on which it is based have greatly evolved since 1975 (especially with the introduction of the Ottawa Charter for health promotion in 1986). We have simply accumulated different approaches rather than redefining our goals and adapting the available means accordingly. Second, the impact of health programs is not sufficiently evaluated. Circulars and guidelines have been written, studies have been conducted, but we have learned next to nothing from our failures and successes. In 2010, at a time when teacher training is being reconsidered - and thus also the school curriculum - it is crucial to clarify our objectives and to seek how to adapt to the current situation "on the ground". A series of French and international studies, including the OECD report (2009), are highly critical of the situation in France and show that further efforts are needed. While France devotes substantial resources to adolescent programs, those set aside for early childhood are totally inadequate. Yet sociological research, and advances in neuroscience, show that while physical and mental development is a continuous process from the womb to adulthood, the early years of life are critical. Intellectual stimulation during infancy used to be a role assumed by the family. Unfortunately, in contemporary France, many parents are unaware of their necessary contribution to their children's education, or are simply confused. Furthermore, France has become a heteroge-neous country. The insecurity and marginalization of certain families can undermine the parents' mental health and thus that of their children. Differences in culture and lifestyle introduce specific health problems and make it difficult to develop a comprehensive strategy A considerable effort is needed. We must educate and inform parents, starting from pregnancy, for example through obligatory antenatal courses to teach expectant mothers, and possibly their partners, that they must provide intellectual stimulation for their children, starting in the first weeks of life. The OECD report shows that French parents are among those who spend the least time with their children. There are multiple reasons for this alarming situation, which must be analyzed and remedied, notably by strengthening the partnership between parents and the directors of kindergartens and nurseries. Resistance must be overcome and the necessary structures created. The place of health during early childhood has considerably evolved. It used to be considered that, for small children, the main issue was physical health (vision, hearing, mobility, etc.). Today the accent is increasingly placed on their psychosocial well-being. Nursery and kindergarten staff and teachers are best-placed to identify children with psychological problems, such as those who find it difficult to establish relationships with other children and to find playmates. Interventions are all the more effective the earlier they begin.
   Psychosomatic evaluation of children thus identified, by a pediatrician and child psychiatrist (or psychologist), must include an assesment of living conditions and individual needs. International comparisons show that French young people are among those most pessimistic about their future, those most likely to feel they are not integrated into society, and those who feel they have little way of influencing their future, thinking it depends above all on other people; they feel that society is frozen, leaving them little opportunity for advancement. It is tempting to think that these attitudes are shaped by informy and early childhood experiences. The school curriculum must be appropriate for age, with the main objective of giving small children confidence in themselves and in their capacity to improve their own well-being. It must focus on the simplest functions and activities, such as sleep, diet, and physical education (among the countries included in the OECD survey, France is the country where physical education and sport are the least developed). Education must help young people to acquire social skills, to become aware of their emotions and those of other people, with all their differences. Role-play exercises in schools may be one way of developing this awareness. Teaching experience must be taken into account, through voluntary participation by schools and teachers (as successfully implemented in the "Hands-on" (Main a la Pate ") program); these studies must be backed up by the necessary means, and their results must be monitored and analyzed. Teacher education has a key role to play, in two respects: 0 initial training in universities should include a Masters module in health education, whose contents should be harmonized; and ii) continuous training, which has a major impact and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Education. These two training courses must be coherent with each other, and the available resources must be compatible with the objectives. It should be recalled, as we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, that the goals of health education, and of education in general, should apply to all. This implies a need to bring both flexibility and rigor to teaching methods and the school curriculum. It will require a partnership between parents and teachers, mother-child health structures, and pediatricians. Rational division of responsibilities for infants and young children between the State, local authorities, health facilities, medicosocial structures, and health professionals, including school physicians and nurses, should be able to provide the coordination necessary to deal with the more difficult situations.

AB Background: General practitioners (GPs) play a key role in identifying and managing patients with suicidal tendencies. Few studies, however, examine both GP and patient characteristics and GP practices associated with suicide assessment. This article aims to evaluate 1) GPs' success in early identification of suicidal ideation (SI) in patients starting antidepressant or anxiolytic treatment, and 2) patient- and GP-related factors associated with this success.
   Methods: Survey of 144 GPs practising in southeastern France and of consecutive adults consulting them during June-October 2004 and prescribed antidepressant or anxiolytic treatment. Data were collected from GPs (consultation-questionnaires focusing on their prescription, diagnosis and detection of SI) and patients (self-administered questionnaires including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale and social and demographic characteristics). We used multilevel logistic regression to analyse factors associated with SI detection.
   Results: GPs completed consultation-questionnaires for 713 patients, 405 of whom completed self-administered questionnaires. Eighty-nine patients (22%) reported SI; in 43 cases (48%) SI bad not been detected by the GP. GPs detected SI more frequently when they had completed continuing medical education about depression, when patients had higher depressive symptom scores, and when consultations were relatively long.
   Limitations: Study limited to patients receiving initial prescriptions for antidepressants or anxiolytics.
   Conclusions: The percentage of undetected SI in this study population was high. Additional training of GPs increases the chances of detecting SI. Medical training and continuing medical education should include better instruction about SI risk factors and diagnosis, including non-major depressions, and stress that screening requires sufficient consultation time.

   period
SO ACTES DE LA RECHERCHE EN SCIENCES SOCIALES
LA French
DT Article
AB It is just after the First World War, with the repair of facially injured veterans, that a reparative surgery taking the aesthetic aspect into account begins to arise. During the period between the two Wars it develops in several specialized areas of the medical field (in constructive surgery, orthopaedics, ENT) while techniques are being perfected (lifting, rhinoplasty, mammoplasty...) that will make it possible for a "pure" plastic surgery to emerge at the very time a market against aging is developing. If, in its beginnings, plastic surgery must face the competition of endocrinal rejuvenation therapies (monkey testical and thyroid transplants on man), the discredit falling upon these latter practices in the late 1920's makes way for the former to dominate the market. The number of surgeons doing "pure" plastic surgery operations grows notably up to the eve of the Second World War, but those devoting themselves entirely to these remain few. Because their practice is not held in great esteem by the majority of surgeons who criticize its futility, those who promote "pure" plastic surgery must strive to justify it in insisting on the social and psychological benefits their patients get from such operations. It is thus that Doctor Raymond Passot will be seen to justify the correction of "blemishes" in the name of suicide prevention and especially in that of the treatment of neuroses. At the same time Suzanne Noel as well as enrolling plastic surgery in the feminist struggle, will asign it a social role as a factor facilitating integration and staying power in certain sectors of professional activity.

AB Methods In the French nationwide Mortalite 2000 and 2005 surveys, physicians reported causes of deaths in HIV-infected adults in 2000 and 2005, using a standardized questionnaire. We used multivariate logistic regression models to study the association between gender and AIDS-defining causes of death, adjusting for other characteristics.
   Results Of the 1013 HIV-infected adults who died in 2005, 247 (24%) were women. Half of women were infected through heterosexual contacts, compared with 25% men. In 2005, the proportion of AIDS-defining causes of death was higher in women than in men (43 vs 34%; P = 0.01), whereas it had been the same in 2000 (47% in women and men). In 2005, women died less frequently than men from respiratory malignancies (lung, ear/nose/throat) and cardiovascular disease (9% of all causes of death in women compared with 16% in men; P = 0.004), and suicides or accidents (4 vs 9%; P = 0.02). Socio-economic precariousness, younger age, less alcohol and tobacco consumption and lack of prior ART explained the higher proportion of deaths from AIDS in women compared with men.
   Conclusions The higher proportion of AIDS-related deaths in women is probably explained by two factors: (i) some HIV-infected women, especially migrants in poor socio-economic conditions, may not have access to optimal care; and (ii) a lower prevalence of risk factors for respiratory, cardiovascular and violent deaths means that the risk of dying from non-AIDS causes may be lower in women.

ID CANCER
AB In France, city size has very little bearing on the mortality rate as a function of age and life expectancy and it is in large cities that these indicators are the most favorable. No increase in maternal or infant mortality rates or deaths due to cancers has been observed in large cities. The lower mortality rate linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in large urban areas contradicts the fears concerning the impact of air pollution. Deaths linked to lifestyle are less frequent in big cities, which could be due to social structures (socio-professional level: the proportion of white-collar workers and professionals is higher in bigger cities than in the suburbs or small cities). However, although the overall mortality rate is lower, it should be emphasized that there is in large cities a greater incidence of sexually transmitted diseases, AIDS and certain infectious diseases (because of social diversity and the fact that certain individuals seeking anonymity and marginality are drawn to large cities), In terms of mental health, the breakdown of family structures, instability, unemployment, the lack of parental authority and failing schools render adolescents vulnerable and hinder their social integration. When the proportion of adolescents at risk is high in a neighborhood, individual problems are amplified and social problems result. In order to restore mental and social health to these neighborhoods, ambitious strategies are necessary which take into account family and social factors as well as environmental ones. At the present time, when physical health is constantly improving, the most pressing problems are those related to lifestyle and mental health which depend for a large part on social factors.

AB This is a single center retrospective review of abdominal or abdomino-thoracic penetrating wounds treated between 2004 and 2013 in the gastrointestinal and emergency unit of the university hospital of Grenoble, France. This study did not include patients who sustained blunt trauma or non-traumatic wounds, as well as patients with penetrating head and neck injury, limb injury, ano-perineal injury, or isolated thoracic injury above the fifth costal interspace. In addition, we also included cases that were reviewed in emergency department morbidity and mortality conferences during the same period. Mortality was 5.9% (11/186 patients). Mean age was 36 years (range: 13-87). Seventy-eight percent (145 patients) suffered stab wounds. Most patients were hemodynamically stable or stabilized upon arrival at the hospital (163 patients: 87.6%). Six resuscitative thoracotomies were performed, five for gunshot wounds, one for a stab wound. When abdominal exploration was necessary, laparotomy was chosen most often (78/186: 41.9%), while laparoscopy was performed in 46 cases (24.7%), with conversion to laparotomy in nine cases. Abdominal penetration was found in 103 cases (55.4%) and thoracic penetration in 44 patients (23.7%). Twenty-nine patients (15.6%) had both thoracic and abdominal penetration (with 16 diaphragmatic wounds). Suicide attempts were recorded in 43 patients (23.1%), 31 (72.1%) with peritoneal penetration. Two patients (1.1%) required operation for delayed peritonitis, one who had had a laparotomy qualified as "negative'', and another who had undergone surgical exploration of his wound under general anesthesia. In conclusion, management of clear-cut or suspected penetrating injury represents a medico-surgical challenge and requires effective management protocols. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI Burn out among French general practitioners
SO PRESSE MEDICALE

ID STRESS; WORK; SATISFACTION; MEDICINE; DOCTORS; HEALTH
AB Objective Assess the extent of burn out among the general practitioners of the Loire region (France).
   Methods A questionnaire in 3 parts was sent to 480 general practitioners: the first concerned the socio-demographical variables such as the age of the practitioners, their marital status, time when the installed their practice, type of practice and quantification of their professional activity; the second corresponded to the French version of the Maslach Burn out Inventory (MBI) and the third part foresaw the eventual consequences of burn out, such as the wish for retraining, use of psychotropics or suicidal thoughts.
   Results 306 practitioners replied (response rate 64%). Mean scores on the three dimensions of burn out (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, low personal accomplishment) were similar to those of other studies using the same instrument. Five per cent of the practitioners had high scores of burn out on the 3 subscales, but professional accomplishment remained high for a majority of physicians. More than 1 practitioner out of 2 had thought of retraining, 5.5% declared excessive drinking, 30% had taken psychotropics, and 13% have envisaged suicide. Emotional exhaustion was statistically associated with female sex, heavy workload, wish to retrain, drinking, psychotropics and suicidal ideation. The causes of burn out expressed by the practitioners were organizational and administrative (high workload, administrative demands, conflicts with social welfare organizations) but also relational (demands considered as excessive from their patients and families).
   Discussion Burn out among general practitioners is a reality. The quality of life of practitioners suffering from burn out appears significantly impaired, and published literature indicates that it may lead to deleterious consequences on the care provided to their patients.

AB The objective of this study was to estimate the relative impact of hospitalization for depressive syndrome (DS) on all causes of hospitalization and characterize individuals more likely to experience hospitalization for DS in the French cohort study, Manif 2000, of patients HIV infected through injection drug use. We selected all patients followed-up to the 24-month visit (C24) who missed no more than one visit. Using medical records, dates and causes of hospitalizations, were collected retrospectively. A Poisson regression model based on generalized estimating equations was used to identify factors associated with hospitalization for DS. During the study period, 223 hospitalizations were recorded for 120 of the 335 selected patients. DS was the second reason for hospitalization after infections, accounting for 14.3% of the total number of hospitalizations. DS was reported in 32 hospitalizations and involved 24 patients, five of them being hospitalized more than once for the same cause. Factors independently associated with hospitalization for DS were history of multiple incarceration (RR=2.1, 95% CI: 1.0-4.7), polydrug use (RR=2.6, 95% CI: 1.1-5.9) and lack of stable relationship (RR=4.2, 95% CI: 1.6-11.1). In the HAART era, DS represents an important cause of hospitalization of HIV-infected injecting drug users, mainly concerning patients presenting no stable relationship and signs of social instability. Scheduled psychiatric consultations for these patients would permit us to identify those for whom major depression might lead to hospitalization and provide them with timely and appropriate care.

AB Antidepressants have been the object of an international controversy for about thirty years. Some patients are inclined to develop suicidal ideation (SI) at antidepressant onset; this phenomenon is known as Treatment Emergent Suicidal Ideation (TESI), and it has conducted regulatory bodies to prompt warnings on antidepressants. Since, few studies have explored the pharmacogenomics of TESI. Given the growing body of evidence connecting the opioidergic system with suicidal behavior (particularly mu opioid receptor (MOR)), we decided to examine the relationship between two genetic polymorphisms (SNPs) in the opioidergic system and TESI in a sample of 3566 adult depressed outpatients. General practitioners and psychiatrists throughout France followed participants for 6 weeks after an initial prescription of tianeptine, an antidepressant treatment with mu agonism. Suicidal ideation was assessed with the item 10 of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (item dedicated to SI) at baseline, and after 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 6 weeks. We analysed rs1799971 from the OPRM1 gene and rs105660 from the OPRK1 gene. Within the sample, 112 patients reported TESI while 384 did not. We found a significant association between AA genotype of rs1799971 and TESI even after adjustment for potential cofounders (OR = 1.93, 95%Cl = [1.07; 3.49]; p-value = 0.03). On the other hand there were no significant association between rs1799971 and rs105560 with worsening of suicidal ideation or lifetime suicide attempts. Nevertheless, our results suggest a possible involvement of opioidergic system in TESI.

DE Meaning of work; self-fulfilment; humanization of work
AB "Does work have a meaning? Basis for a positive work culture". From the anthropological point of view work is the expression and fulfilment of the absolute spirit in the finite sense and is, by its essence, cooperation. This obliges us to reverse the question: "does work have a meaning?", to: "does work have a meaning for workers? Does it allow self-fulfilment?" Work has a meaning if the worker's psychophysical integrity is safeguarded, if by working the individual achieves self-fulfilment as a person, if it has a sense of community. Man as an "actor" achieves self-fulfilment through technical and professional competence, thereby overcoming organizational and social conflicts. Today reducing human and social relations to an economic transaction will lead to the destruction of the meaning of life and work. The study of suicide cases in France Telecom shows that a human being inserted in the working environment wants most of all to obtain recognition. He or she will accept praise or even punishment if this is done with transparency, because the person will acknowledge in such decisions a recognition of his/herself. Many enterprises and consequently many personnel managers do not, in their essence, perceive of any meaning of work, but consider only the instrumental element. The workforce cannot be considered as a commodity, work is embodied in human beings. So either people aim at self-fulfilment or fall into anomie and depression, even to the point of the destructive impulse of elimination. The re-humanization of work and the treatment of enterprises (which are "ill" because they no longer possess any meaning of work) is the challenge that awaits us.

   EXCHANGES; BEHAVIOR; COSTS; ESSAY
AB The charter of a corporation is the "constitution" agreed to by all its members. The charter, however, is not a "suicide pact," it can be amended according to the charter amendment rules in corporate law when circumstances change. These charter amendment rules vary significantly across jurisdictions. In Delaware, shareholders can amend the charter with a simple majority vote of shares. The amendment must be initiated by the board of directors and decisions to amend the charter are made usually by a supermajority vote of shares. Board approval is not necessary in the United Kingdom, Germany, or France. Within a given jurisdiction, the rules governing the amendment of different provisions are also very different. This Article makes the first attempt to employ the constitutional economic theory developed by Buchanan and Tullock to explain different charter amendment rules. It identifies a fundamental tradeoff between the needs of adaptation and commitment. If charter amendment rules are too procedurally burdensome, they may harm the adaptation of corporate charters. If they do not impose meaningful regulation on charter amendment, minority shareholders cannot be sure that corporate insiders or controlling shareholders would not amend the charter in the midstream to harm shareholders' interests. Different states may choose different charter amendment rules to achieve a balance between adaptation and commitment. The choice between different charter amendment rules made by different states can be explained by several factors, including institutional investors and judicial capacity. This theory sheds new light on a series of issues in the corporate law literature, including the explanation for mandatory rules and appraisal rights in corporate law, the debate of increasing shareholder power in the United States, and why law, rather than contract, is important in corporate governance.

AB Purpose: Women are disproportionately likely to suffer from depression. This is especially true for those who experience socioeconomic hardship, such as homelessness. In France, among homeless mothers many are migrant. However, it is not clear whether risk factors associated with depression are specific for this group or the same as in the general population. Our objective was to describe socio-demographic, relational, living and housing conditions and health factors associated with depression among homeless mothers.
   Methods: The ENFAMS survey, conducted via face-to-face bilingual interviews with a representative sample of homeless families in the Paris region (January-May 2013, n = 733 mothers). Mothers reported their socio-demographic characteristics, housing conditions including residential mobility, as well as physical and mental health. Depression was ascertained using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Factors associated with mother's depression were studied in weighted Poisson regression models with robust error variance.
   Results: The prevalence of depression among participating mothers was 28.8%. In multivariate analyses, depression was associated with fluency in French (PR = 1.88 95% CI 1.40; 2.51), suicide risk (PR = 2.26, 95% CI 1.82; 2.82), post-traumatic stress disorder (PR = 1.97, 95% CI 1.50; 2.60), and unmet health needs (PR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.09; 2.57).
   Conclusions: Homeless mothers have high levels of depression and associated psychiatric comorbidities. Associated risk factors appear to be both specific for this group and shared with mothers in the general population. Improvements in the monitoring of mental health difficulties as well as access to appropriate medical care in this vulnerable population may help improve health and social outcomes.

AB BackgroundTransferrin is the major plasma transport protein for iron. We aimed to investigate the characteristics of transferrin variant by carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) test using capillary zone electrophoresis.
   MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed the CDT tests of 2449 patients from March 2009 to May 2017 at a tertiary hospital in Korea. CDT was quantified using a Capillarys 2 system (Sebia, Lisses, France) by capillary zone electrophoresis. The characteristics of variant transferrin patterns using electropherogram of CDT tests were analyzed.
   ResultsSeventy-seven (3.1%) patients were classified as variant transferrin. Mean age of these patients was 51.8years, and the male-to-female ratio was 3.5:1. The most common variants were the BC variants (n=37), followed by the CD variants (n=27), unclear patterns (n=7), BD variants (n=3), CC variants (n=2), misclassification (n=1). In the variant Tf group, the most common disease was alcoholic liver cirrhosis (n=22, 28.6%), followed by the toxic effects of substances (n=17, 22.1%), and mental and behavioral disorders attributable to alcohol (n=11, 14.3%). Nonvariant group showed a predominance of the toxic substance effects (n=880, 37.1%), a personal history of suicide attempts (n=634, 26.7%), and mental and behavioral disorders due to alcohol (n=336, 14.2%).
   ConclusionWe analyzed the basic characteristics of variant transferrin by CDT tests using capillary zone electrophoresis. The prevalence of variant transferrin was 3.1% of the study subjects. Male patients, alcohol abusers, and liver cirrhosis patients predominated in the variant transferrin population. Further prospective studies are warranted to elucidate variant transferrin in clinical practice.

AB In this article, we discuss whether the Leonetti-Claeys Device regarding sedation instituted by the French February 2, 2016 law (LCD) comes under palliative sedation or terminal sedation, and where do the latest guidelines stand regarding this matter. It turns that the LCD doesn't seek to lower, in a fitted and proportionate way, the perception of refractory symptoms, in the respect of the end of life relational issues which would match palliative sedation. It rather consists in mastering the conditions of dying by the standardized application of a procedure of psychological and relational disconnection, and constitutes subsequently a classic example of terminal sedation. Behind this change of paradigm, a dual reduction can be feared: one of dignity to the dying conditions' control, and one of the relationship to a "right to". Conversely, the guidelines published by the French society for support and palliative care (Societe francaise d'accompagnement et de soins palliatifs [SFAP])) and the French health agency (Haute Autorite de sante [HAS]) did their best to put the LCD into a palliative aim. They distinguish now between proportionate sedation and disproportionate sedation. But question is to know whether the register itself of this efforts, highly protocolized, won't however strengthen the inner technical logic of the LCD. In addition, the HAS's comparative table between LCD and euthanasia is erroneous. At last, the LCD leads to a care that is more intensive than palliative. Such is the paradox of a technical response to the relational concerns of the end-of-life suffering. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Over the past century, the dominant model for addressing mental illness has been the treatment of individuals, largely by individual therapists who assume the availability of individual psychological resources. That form of therapy is a scarce commodity in capitalist societies, and social models of healing have been largely marginalized and forgotten. From the point of view of an indigenous psychology of religion, this essay (1) reports on local cultural and community models of healing that honor the common good, draw on local, communal narratives, and involve a given community in the process of healing. However, because it is not simply community in itself that is therapeutic, the authors argue (2) that healing cultures have communities that are guided by their moral vision and are committed to justice, moral integrity, and the sharing of resources. They draw on intergenerational studies that detail the effects in Inuit communities where a moral vision and a sense of community was present but then was eroded. Therapists whose interventions draw on the moral resources of the community may facilitate healing, as demonstrated by the use of allocentric imaging in more communal traditions. Finally, it is not simply communities with moral ideals that are therapeutic but (3) indigenous communities whose structures and whose role models embody their ethic that is critical for healing. The authors examine ecological communities in China committed to Confucian values and protection of the earth. The L'Arche communities begun in France by Jean Vanier and Alcoholics Anonymous groups around the world serve as examples of embodied moral communities.

AB Objectives. - This paper intended to offer a broad literature review on global Jihad terrorism. In the wake of recent terrorist attacks that stroke Paris twice in 2015, and the numerous defused plots this year, the authors sought to determine if there is a way to get a better understanding of the radicalization process. How individuals could become radicalized to the point of engaging into violent actions and suicide missions and is there any underlying psychopathology? The authors focused on two types of terrorists: lone wolves and those acting as part of a group. We will explain that psychopathology could not be linked with the "group" type. We will discuss some aspects of the psychological mechanisms involved into the group dynamics that bond individuals towards this (self-) destructive goal, but also how law enforcement officers should be prepared to counter-interrogation techniques spread amongst members of organized cells. Finally, we will see how a deradicalization process might take place.
   Methods. - The authors relied on a broad literature review in order to address the issues mentioned above. Mainly for two reasons, the first one being that most of suicide mission leaves no author to interview or to assess; second, access to highly sensitive cases of terrorism is not possible unless being involved within the judicial process such as psychological or psychiatric assessments of survivors or members of a dismantled cell, but data then could not be used for publication, these are the reasons why the authors used open source data and international articles and books dealing with the topic of global Jihad.
   Results. As noticed by Hoffman, the term terrorism comes from the French "(Regime de) Terreur" and implies a political goal, the Oxford English Dictionary defines it as "A policy intended to strike with terror those against whom it is adopted; employment of methods of intimidation; the fact of terrorizing or condition of being terrorized". From the mid-1990s during which France was already hit by terrorism, through the 9/11 to the recent attacks of November, the aspect of the "global Jihad" evolved and the attacks that took place in Paris and also worldwide in 2015, claimed by Daech bring some points to be taken into consideration when dealing with this type of terrorism. First, the will to die and to gain martyrdom, which is not considered as a suicide, is central for an understanding of this morbid process. Most of the terrorists seem to be looking for a greater-than-themselves cause that they could embrace, and the ideology offered by Daech correspond to an "epic" vision of the world. This view serves as an encompassing model in which the reality is perceived through a "us versus them" prism that possesses a paranoid tone. Second, some strategic considerations, which will not be developed here, why France has been more specifically targeted? The development of "homegrown" terrorists, as Sageman noted it in 2006 and the rise of ISIL (Daech) from 2010 and the instauration of a Caliphat as a base and training ground offered to the new recruits had created a fertile soil for jihad motivated attacks. Through this extensive literature review the authors found that, contrary to the "lone wolf' figure in which psychopathology and psychiatric symptoms could often easily be found, members of organized terrorist cells are not "insane", they are very much dedicated to a cause but are not suffering from any psychosis or bipolar disorders. Exploring the ideas developed by Sageman, Moghaddam amongst others, the authors underline the slow process for developing and sharing radical beliefs but also that taking part to violent actions could be faster than imagined by a layman and is regularly a matter of networking through friendship and kinship. Thus, group psychology is of peculiar importance to understand the mechanisms at stake. It appears that radicalization is grounded on a vacuum of existential significance and by an ascending process, through the sharing of an ideology prone to violent actions, leads individuals to engage in terrorist goals for a collective one, greater than them. The authors then focused on some interrogatory techniques developed by foreign law enforcement agencies. And finally, what could be done to reverse this radicalization process, basically reintegrating a sense of individualistic needs and addressing the radical beliefs with a religious teaching. It should be noted that this last part is at the very beginning of its experimentation in Europe and that it might not be used for every individual involved in terrorism (e.g., it could be proven efficient with people that has been radicalized, but not efficient with individual on the brink of violent terrorist actions). The central need to counter radicalization is a social one, a project of society shared by everyone, as it seems clear that the sense of alienation and exclusion from the working environment and positive social perspectives is a strong leverage, but not the only one, used by jihadist recruiters.

AB Objectives. - The objectives were to assess the characteristics of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) and to evaluate the prescribing practices.
   Methods. - MONTRA is a quantitative survey conducted between December 2010 and February 2011. Data were extracted by the psychiatrists from the medical files of BD patients seen on four consecutive days of consulting.
   Results. - Four hundred and thirty-nine psychiatrists included 2529 patients (inpatients, n=319; outpatients from mental clinics, n=1090; outpatients consulting in private practice, n=1020). In the total patient population (mean age: 47 years; women, 58%), BD was distributed as follows: BD type I, 56%; BD type II, 40%; other types of BD, 4%; rapid cyclers, 10%. The prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities was high (anxiety disorders, 48%; abuse and dependence on toxic substances, 17 and 10% respectively), 36% of the patients had a history of suicide attempt and the risk of suicide, when assessed, was 6%. In about half the patients (48%), the polarity of the initial bipolar episode was of the depressive type (versus 39% for the manic/hypomanic type). Outpatients were globally independent and did not require assistance in the management of their disease or its treatment whereas the social and professional lives of inpatients were negatively affected by their condition. Based on the psychiatrist's declarations, 39 to 50% of the outpatients were symptom-free, 36 to 40% were in the intercurrent phase with residual symptoms, 11 to 17% presented either a manic or depressive acute BP episode, and 3 to 4% were in a mixed state; among inpatients, 52% presented an acute episode either manic or depressive, 38% were in the intercurrent phase and 9% were in a mixed state. In the symptomatic patients from the total population (61%), the most prevalent symptoms were depressive and corresponded to acute symptoms (patients with a depressive episode, 14%) or residual symptoms (patients in the intercurrent phase, 27%). The predominant depressive polarity was observed in both hospitalized and outpatients. The pharmacological treatment of BD included polytherapy in 73% of the patients. In the manic episodes (n=126), the patients were treated with a Mood Stabilizer (MS, 56%) or an atypical antipsychotic (AAP, 52%) in association. In the depressive episodes (n=342), the patients received an antidepressant drug associated with a MS or an AAP (70%). In symptom-free or symptomatic intercurrent periods (n=1943), the patients were treated with a MS (49-58%) or an AAP (37-49%), in association.
   Conclusion. - BD patients evaluated in our survey were in majority diagnosed with BD type I, associated with considerable comorbidity. In the symptomatic patients, the most prevalent symptoms, either acute or residual, were of the depressive type. In the majority of the patients, whatever the clinical status, polytherapy was prescribed for the BD. (C) L'Encephale, Paris, 2013.

AB Objective: Latent Toxoplasma infection has been associated with widespread brain immune activation, increased blood brain barrier permeability, neural disruption, increased dopamine release in dopaminergic neurons, with NMDA activation and with schizophrenia (SZ) onset risk. Toxoplasma has been suggested to be a source of chronic low-grade inflammation and this inflammation has been associated with cognitive impairment in SZ. The objective of the present study were (i) to determine if latent Toxoplasma infection was associated with specific clinical features in stabilized SZ subjects, with cognitive impairment and with increased low-grade peripheral inflammation and (ii) to determine if Treatments with Anti-Toxoplasmic Activity (TATA) were associated with improved outcomes in subjects with latent Toxoplasma infection.
   Methods: A comprehensive 2 daylong clinical and neuropsychological battery was administered in 250 SZ subjects included between 2015 and 2017 in the national FondaMental Expert Center (FACE-SZ) Cohort. Solid phase-enzyme microplate immunoassay methods were used to measure IgG class of antibodies to T. gondii in blood sample. Latent Toxoplasma infection was defined by T. gondii IgG ratio >= 0.8, equivalent to >= 10 international units. Chronic peripheral inflammation was defined by highly sensitive Creactive protein blood level >= 3 mg/L.
   Results: Latent Toxoplasma infection has been found in 184 (73.6%) of this national multicentric sample. In the multivariate analyses, latent Toxoplasma infection has been significantly associated with higher PANSS negative (aOR = 1.1 [1.1-1.1], p = 0.04) and excitement subscores (aOR = 1.3 [1.1-1.6], p = 0.01), with two specific symptoms (i.e., reference delusion (aOR = 3.6 [1.2-10.6] p = 0.01) and alogia (aOR = 16.7 [2.0-134.7], p = 0.008)) and with chronic low-grade peripheral inflammation (27.2% vs. 7.6%, aOR = 3.8 [1.4-10.3], p = 0.004). Extrapyramidal symptoms remained significantly associated with latent Toxoplasma infection. On the opposite, no significant association of latent Toxoplasma infection with age, gender, age at SZ onset, suicide behavior or cognitive deficits has been found in these models (all p > 0.05). TATA were associated with lower depressive symptoms (aOR = 0.8[0.7-0.9], p = 0.01), and with lower rates of chronic peripheral inflammation (20.9% vs. 48.6%, aOR = 3.5 [1.5-7.9], p = 0.003) but not with higher cognitive scores (p > 0.05).
   Conclusion: The present findings suggest that Toxoplasma is almost 3 times more frequent in SZ population compared to general population in France. The potential cerebral underpinnings of the association of latent Toxoplasma infection and the above-mentioned outcomes have been discussed. Future studies should confirm that TATA may be effective to reduce Toxoplasma-associated depressive symptoms and low-grade peripheral inflammation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Overmortality in schizophrenic patients in comparison to the reference population has been found. At the present time this over mortality is mainly due to suicide or certain natural causes such as respiratory, cardio-vascular and cerebro-vascular diseases. In France there are not psychiatric cas registers that could allow us to study the mortality of psychiatric patients. The aim of the study was first to determine the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) in a group of 150 chronic schizophrenics followed during 8 years and secondly to detect the variables that could predict this mortality. Method - The subjects filled out the RDC criteria for definite chronic schizophrenia and were included from 1991 to 1995. The subjects were inpatients or outpatients and their evaluation was made by psychiatrist. The subjects were selected from the different departments of two psychiatric hospitals corresponding to two French geographic areas (the Somme and Oise, two French (( departement,,). At the initial assessment socio-demographic, clinical and psychometrical variables were collected: sex, age, educative level, number of hospitalizations, mean duration of the illness, scores on the Physical Anhedonia Scale, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). For the BPRS and PANSS, negative, positive and general subscales were extracted. In May 1999 all the subjects were contacted in order to know if they are alive or not and if they are death to know the date and the causes of their death. For the subjects that were still alive we used either direct assessement by interview of their psychiatrist or general practionner or indirect assessement by interview of their family. For the deceased subjects, we obtained informations about the date and the causes of the death by their psychiatrist or general practionner. If the patients were lost sight of we send a letter to the city of their place of birth in order to know if they are alive or not and if they are dead to know the date of their death. Moreover demographic data concerning the French and the Somme populations as well as the corresponding data concerning the mortality according to age and gender were obtained. A comparison of global mortality between patients and the French general or the Somme populations was made by the SMR. Moreover the deceased subjects and the survivors were compared by unidimensional statistical tests (chi (2) analyses for qualitative variables or Student's t test for quantitative variables) for the sociodemographic, clinical or psychometric variables. For each significant difference atp level less than or equal to 0.05 the corresponding variable was retained for a multivariate step by step discriminant analysis. Results - We found 13 deaths (10 males, 3 females) : 3 suicides, 3 cardiac diseases, 2 cancers, 1 respiratory disease, 1 car crash, 1 homicid, 1 infectious disease, 1 respiratory arrest. The mortality rate (without correction for age) were 1.08 % for both sexes, 1.44 % and 0.6 % for males and females respectively. The mortality rates (corrected for age) were 2.47 % in our cohort and 0.988 % in the Somme population. The corresponding SMR was 2.5. (chi (2) = 3.15, df = 1, p < 0.01). The overmortality was found only for males (<chi>(2) = 2.57, df = 1, P < 0.01) and not for females (<chi>(2) = 0. 034, df = 1, p > 0. 05). Concerning the comparisons between the deceased subjects and the survivors, there were five significant differences :gender, age, duration of the illness, neuroleptic dosage, negative symptoms (BPRS negative subscale).
   The deceased subjects were older, there was more men, the duration of the illness and the neuroleptic dosage were higher and the BPRS negative subscale was lower. These five variables were introduced in the discriminant analysis to explore notably their respecting weight. The corresponding power of the five variables were in decreasing order :neuroleptic dosage, negative symptoms, age, gender, duration of the illness. Discussion - Our study confirm the overmortality in schizophrenic patients, this overmortality was especially explained by natural and non natural causes of death. The overmortality concerned only schizophrenic males patients whereas schizophrenic females did not have an overmortality. This negative result could be explain by a bias selection, the males being overrepresented in our cohort. Among the variables that were linked to the overmortality, the low level of negative symptomatology confirmed previous studies that have shown a low suicide rate in deficit schizophrenic. Moreover a high level of positive symptomatology could lead to high risk behaviors (suicide attempts, sexual disinhibition...). The neuroleptic dosage was the variable whom discriminate power was the highest. At least two explanations can be proposed. Firstly, schizophrenic patients receiving high neuroleptic dosage could be vulnerable to the consequences of the side effects of the neuroleptics; neuroleptics also can act directly on the disease, masking some somatics symptoms as pain or fiever, desinhibiting an apragmatic patient... inducing then risk of mortality. Secondly, high dosage of neuroleptics could characterized the severe forms of the schizophrenia whom risk of mortality was higher than those of the less severe forms, and this severity could increase the risk of developing a somatic disease. The other variables are the age and the duration of the illness. In our cohort, there are more deaths by natural causes, and deads are more older than living people; this result is logical with the natural way of life. We also find a difference between the duration of the illness: a long time duration could increase the death exposition risk and could also argue to a severe form of the disease. In our study, the causes of death concern more natural deaths than unatural deaths, 76.93 % respect 23.07 %. The causes of death are the same than in the general population, but the lethality is more important maybe according to the disease itself and ifs treatment. These causes are also described in previous studies. suicide risk is present during all life, cardiac and respiratory diseases could be explained by sedentarity, tobacco and psychotropic treatments, results about risk of cancers are contradictious (protector role of neuroleptics treatments ?), aids infectious are noted and if could be explained by risk comportments associated as drugs and sex addictions respiratory arrest is also noted in chronic patients and could be explained by the rapeutics as well as car crashes and homicide could be explained by the disease itself. In conclusion, overmortality is always noted in schizophrenic patients, this overmortality concerned especially natural and non natural causes of death whom are more important in chronic patients. These data ask some questions : what about health care for schizophrenic patients in general hospitals ? What about schizophrenia itself (anosognosia, apragmatism), neuroleptics (masking symptoms as fiever or pain)? What link could be exist between schizophrenia and somatic diseases (genetic predisposition, immunitary system influence) ?.

AB In many European countries, the last decade has been marked by an increasing debate about the acceptability and regulation'of euthanasia and other end-of-life decisions in medical practice. Growing public sensibility to a 'right to die' for terminally ill patients has been one of the main constituents of these debates. Within this context. we sought to describe and compare acceptance of euthanasia among the general public in 33 European countries. We used the European Values Study data of 1999-2000 with a total of 41 125 respondents (63% response rate) in 33 European countries. The main outcome measure concerned the acceptance of euthanasia (defined as 'terminating the life of the incurably sick', rated on a scale from I to 10).
   Results showed that the acceptance of euthanasia tended to be high in some Countries (e.g. the Netherlands, Denmark, France, Sweden), while a markedly low acceptance was found in others (e.g. Romania. Malta and Turkey). A multivariate ordinal regression showed that weaker religious belief was the most important factor associated with a higher acceptance: however, there were also socio-demographic differences: younger cohorts. people from non-manual social classes, and people with a higher educational level tended to have a higher acceptance of euthanasia. While religious belief. sociodemographic factors, and also moral values (i.e. the belief in the right to self-determination) could largely explain the differences between countries, our findings suggest that perceptions regarding euthanasia are probably also influenced by national traditions and history (e.g. Germany). Thus, we demonstrated clear cross-national differences with regard to the acceptance of euthanasia, which can serve as an important basis for further debate and research in the specific countries.

AB Background In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) mortality has decreased substantially among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected people with access to HAART, but there are concerns regarding co-morbidities and adverse effects of HAART, which may impair vital prognosis. The Mortality 2000 study examined the causes of death in HIV-infected adults at a national level in France in the year 2000.
   Methods All French hospital wards known to be involved in the management of HIV infection were asked to notify prospectively the deaths that occurred in 2000 among HIV-infected adults. The causes of death were documented using a standardized questionnaire.
   Results The 185 participating wards notified 964 deaths. The main underlying causes of death were AIDS-related (47%, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: 23%), viral hepatitis (11%, hepatitis C: 9%, hepatitis B: 2%), cancer not related to AIDS or hepatitis (11%), cardiovascular disease (7%), bacterial infections (6%), suicide (4%), and adverse effect of antiretroviral treatments (1%). Among AIDS-related deaths, HIV infection had been diagnosed recently in 20%. Smoking was recorded in 72% of cancer-related deaths and alcohol consumption in 54% of hepatitis-related deaths. Among non-HIV related deaths between 25 and 64 years, the proportion of infectious diseases (including HCV and HBV-related deaths) was higher in HIV-infected adults than in the general population.
   Conclusions Improved strategies for detecting HIV infection before AIDS-defining complications occur are needed in the era of HAART. The prevention of non-AIDS related cancers, especially lung cancer, the management of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and of viral hepatitis are also important priorities.

AB Background: Strongly marked ideological positions on the impact of palliative care and limited hard data plague the debate on physician-assisted death.
   Methods: A national cross-sectional study on the requests to hasten death (RHD) was conducted among 789 French palliative care organisations. Data were collected for all patients with RHD encountered during year 2010. Data on patients' characteristics, medical, psychological and social context, symptoms, nature of palliative management, patient's evolution and palliative care team's interpretation of the request were obtained.
   Findings: A majority of centres responded and 342 teams provided descriptions of 783 RHD, 476 by a patient, 258 by relatives or close friends and 49 by the nursing staff. Cancer was the most frequent pathology (72%) and 68% of the patients had entered terminal stage. Patients rarely appeared with uncontrolled pain (3.7%), but had difficulties with feeding (65%), moving (54%), excretion (49%), or were cachectic (39%); 31% were considered to be anxio-depressive; 79% did not give physical reasons for their request; 37% of RHD were maintained and 24% fluctuated despite provision of regular follow-up by a palliative care team to 83% of all cases; 68% of patients died within a month; the interpretation of RHD by the staff was a wish for relief (69%), patient's inextricable situation (44%), actual desire not to continue living (36%) or to be helped to die (30%).
   Interpretation: The large number of described cases provides, for the first time, comprehensive hard data on the evolution of RHDs in a country that has not legalised euthanasia. Whatever the way RHD are expressed, they are frequently maintained despite adequate palliative care with suitable control of pain and psychological support by specialists. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In 2017 the inauguration of the Mungsten Bridge, a most ambitious, wide-span bridge from 19th century Germany, dated back 120 years. For that reason, a designation of the bridge as a UNESCO World heritage site as part of a conglomerate together with four other European bridges, the Maria Pia Bridge and the Dom Luiz I Bridge in Porto/Portugal, the Viaduct of Garabit in France and the Ponte Michele in Northern Italy, is currently prepared. The five bridges were designed and built between 1875 and 1897, and they are all similar in terms of the technological and political ambition they were projected with. The Mungsten Bridge, at that time named "Kaiser-Wilhelm-Bridge", included numerous innovative technical features concerning the design, the material as well as the applied construction methods and until today, the bridge is attributed with various legends. One of these legends deals with an engineer, who committed suicide because of false calculations or construction details, which he had contributed to the project. As Anton v. Rieppel is believed to be the only creator and designer of the "Mungsten Bridge", there was never a reason for doubting his predominance. Recently found historical sources however, name in fact another person who was supposed to be involved in the Mungsten Bridge project and could be another protagonist. Before working for the company, responsible for the design and construction of the Mungsten Bridge, he was a known engineer in 19th century steel bridge design with a large engineering expertise among eight wide span bridges over River Rhine. He died in a natural way, shortly after completion of the bridge in 1897. These facts and the situation, that he was consistently concealed in the context of the Mungsten Bridge, point at special circumstances, which lead to the complete obliteration of his lifework in professional public.

AB Drug abusers: Drugs are widely used by toxicomaniacs to reproduce drug effects. Drug abusers generally start with psychotrops, but other abuse drug classes. Toxicomanic behavior leads to addictive practices that are difficult to control.
   Barbiturates: Both the oral and intravenous routes are used. The expected result is a state of ecstasy with a feeling of comfort. Intoxication may cause respiratory depression. Barbiturates induce physical and psychic dependence. Abuse is not widespread with this class of drugs.
   Benzodiazepines: Drug abuses widely use benzodiazepines orally or intravenously. They search for a flash effect, with sedation and a feeling of comfort. All benzodiazepines induce physical and psychic dependence. Death may result from combinations leading to respiratory depression. Flunitrazepam is the most widely abused benzodiazepine in France. It induces serious neuropsychic disorders.
   Antidepressants: Few are used, mostly at high doses.
   Opiates: Administration gives the same effect as heroine injection. Opiates induce physical and psychic dependence. The adverse effects are similar to those of morphine with a higher risk of respiratory depression.
   Amphetamines: Few are used, either orally or intravenously. They induce a flash with excitation, euphoria, and a period of invincibility. This is followed by a period of depression with risk of suicide. Psychic dependence is high.
   Anticholinergic antiparkinsonians: These drugs are well known to abusers for their hallucinatory effect They induce atropinic adverse effects and physical and psychic dependence.
   Gamma-hydroxybutyrate: This anesthetic is used for its euphoria and sedation effects. It may induce falling sickness or coma, with a risk of respiratory depression.
   Ketamine: Administered via the intranasal route, ketamine induces a state of indifference. Death has been observed.
   Anabolic and androgenic steroids: These drugs are used for their physical and psychic stimulating effect. They induce potentially dangerous adverse effects such as cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological and psychiatric disorders. Clinical signs of addiction and weaning are observed.
   Others: Several other drug classes are used by abusers, including analgics, beta-adrenergic agents, nasal vasoconstrictors and corticosteroids. (C) 2001, Masson, Paris.

AB Purpose: This study evaluated the long-term psychological impact of childhood cancer and also sought to identify the risk factors in the development of psychological issues. Methods: Young adult (18-38 years) survivors of a childhood cancer (except leukemia), diagnosed younger than 15 years between 1987 and 1999 in the Rhone-Alpes region of France, were invited to a semistandardized psychological interview after a medical follow-up consultation during two successive long-term follow-up studies in Oncology (SALTO-1 and -2). Psychiatric issues from the DSM-IV were diagnosed and compared with the general French population (GFP) through interviews based on the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Results: Of the 288 childhood cancer survivors (CCSs) who attended the consultations, 247 completed the MINI interview. Fifty-five percent indicated they had suffered from psychiatric issues after their cancer compared to 31.9% of the GFP (p < 0.0001). These issues were generally anxiety problems (40.5%), mood disorders (28.7%), and substance dependency (10.5%; p < 0.0001). The risk of suicide was, however, less for the CCS group (8.9% vs. 13.6%, p = 0.03). Unemployment was a significant risk factor for mood disorders (p = 0.009). Men were 4.1 times more likely than women to be addicted during their lifetime (p = 0.0004), while adults cured of bone tumors were 14.3 times more likely to be at risk of drug dependence than adults cured of central nervous system tumors (p = 0.01). Conclusion: CCSs are particularly vulnerable to psychiatric disorders throughout their life. Systematic and long-term psychological monitoring of these patients will enable their psychiatric issues to be detected sooner.

AB "Are teachers at risk for psychiatric disorders? Stereotypes, physiology and perspectives of a job prevalently done by women". Background: Teachers are one of the so-called helping professions which are strongly exposed to the "Burnout syndrome". Nonetheless, public opinion is still convinced teachers enjoy a privileged status and physicians most often ignore psychiatric disorders following burnout due to teaching-related stress. Indeed, although France recently issued a suicide warning among teachers, and psychiatric diagnosis among this profession almost doubled in Japan in ten years, only few studies have been published on the subject in peer-reviewed journals. Objective and methods: The present study was carried out by administering a questionnaire to 1.295 teachers from ten different Italian regions aimed at evaluating teachers' conditions as well as their perception of work-related health risks. Results and conclusions: The outcome showed that teachers are mostly unaware of work-related health risks, they are discouraged by their employers, perceive union support as highly insufficient and feel under attack by the mass media as well as by the public. Further, any attempt by the head teacher to protect teacher's health - mandatory according to recent Italian legislation - is frequently misinterpreted as mobbing, due to the lack of appropriate legal knowledge. Interestingly, the study population believed that investigating the link between menopause and depressive disorders among teachers was extremely useful. In fact, over 82% of teachers are women with a median age of approximately 50. Social stress among women has in fact increased greatly given the triple role played by fifty-year old teachers (mother of adolescents, care-giver for elderly parents and teacher). Lastly, general practitioners and psychiatrists need to be educated on psychiatric disorders due to teaching-related stress in order to achieve a correct diagnosis and treatment.

AB Background: To assess the demographic, socioeconomic and health status of male arrivals in French jails and to analyze the time trends of these characteristics.
   Methods: The study was carried out in a prison for detained persons and short term prisoners. Using a standardized questionnaire, we recorded the characteristics of all male detainees and prisoners arriving in the prison between 1989 and 1995. The information collected concerned: demographic data, level of education and professional status, reasons for detention or imprisonment, social and family background, lifestyle, medical and psychiatric history, suicide attempts and illicit use of drugs. The characteristics of the study population were compared with those found in the general regional population. We analyzed developing trends in the health status of the prison population as well as their socio-economic profile over a period of seven years (1989 to 1995).
   Results: A total of 14,785 questionnaires were analyzed. Of the study population, 56% had no professional qualification, and 62% was unemployed. About two-thirds of the inmates presented psychiatric problems or problems with illicit drug use (one or several drugs). Amongst these, 70% had nor had any form of care-neither therapeutic nor educational-before their arrival in prison. Between 1989 and 1995, the proportion of drug users increased by 30%. A parallel increase was observed in the level of unemployment and in the frequency of mental problems.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest a need for therapeutic and educational care to be provided for prison inmates. This poses a problem which needs to be addressed in terms of public health. The study also illustrates the usefulness of a standardised questionnaire for each arrival. The systematic use of such a tool would make it possible to identify inmates' needs and to propose adapted care solutions.

AB The simultaneous occurrence of manic and depressive features has been recognized since classical times, but the term mixed state' was first used by Kraepelin at the end of the 19th century. From the 1980s, until the advent of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5), psychiatric disorders were classified using a categorical approach. However, it was recognized that such an approach was too rigid to encompass the range of symptomatology encountered in clinical practice. Therefore, a dimensional approach was adopted in DSM-5, in which affective states are considered to be distributed across a continuum ranging from pure mania to pure depression. In addition, the copresence of symptoms of the opposite pole are captured using a with mixed features' specifier, applied when three or more nonoverlapping subthreshold symptoms of the opposite pole are present. Mixed features are common in patients with mood episodes, complicating the course of illness, reducing treatment response and worsening outcomes. However, research in this area is scarce and treatment options are limited. Current evidence indicates that antidepressants should be avoided for the treatment of bipolar mixed states. Evidence for bipolar mixed states supports the use of several second-generation antipsychotics, valproate and electroconvulsive therapy. One randomized controlled trial has demonstrated the efficacy of lurasidone, compared with placebo, in patients with major depressive disorder with mixed features, and there is limited evidence supporting the use of ziprasidone in such patients. Further research is required to determine whether other antipsychotic agents, or additional therapeutic approaches, might also be effective in this setting.

AB Background We compared mortality inequalities by occupational class in Japan and South Korea with those in European countries, in order to determine whether patterns are similar. Methods National register-based data from Japan, South Korea and eight European countries (Finland, Denmark, England/Wales, France, Switzerland, Italy (Turin), Estonia, Lithuania) covering the period between 1990 and 2015 were collected and harmonised. We calculated age-standardised all-cause and cause-specific mortality among men aged 35-64 by occupational class and measured the magnitude of inequality with rate differences, rate ratios and the average inter-group difference. Results Clear gradients in mortality were found in all European countries throughout the study period: manual workers had 1.6-2.5 times higher mortality than upper non-manual workers. However, in the most recent time-period, upper non-manual workers had higher mortality than manual workers in Japan and South Korea. This pattern emerged as a result of a rise in mortality among the upper non-manual group in Japan during the late 1990s, and in South Korea during the late 2000s, due to rising mortality from cancer and external causes (including suicide), in addition to strong mortality declines among lower non-manual and manual workers. Conclusion Patterns of mortality by occupational class are remarkably different between European countries and Japan and South Korea. The recently observed patterns in the latter two countries may be related to a larger impact on the higher occupational classes of the economic crisis of the late 1990s and the late 2000s, respectively, and show that a high socioeconomic position does not guarantee better health.

AB This study aimed to examine differences in all-cause mortality and main causes of death across different migrant and local-born populations living in six European countries. We used data from population and mortality registers from Denmark, England & Wales, France, Netherlands, Scotland, and Spain. We calculated age-standardized mortality rates for men and women aged 0-69 years. Country-specific data were pooled to assess weighted mortality rate ratios (MRRs) using Poisson regression. Analyses were stratified by age group, country of destination, and main cause of death. In six countries combined, all-cause mortality was lower for men and women from East Asia (MRRs 0.66; 95 % confidence interval 0.62-0.71 and 0.76; 0.69-0.82, respectively), and Other Latin America (0.44; 0.42-0.46 and 0.56; 0.54-0.59, respectively) than local-born populations. Mortality rates were similar for those from Turkey. All-cause mortality was higher in men and women from North Africa (1.09; 1.08-1.11 and 1.19; 1.17-1.22, respectively) and Eastern Europe (1.30; 1.27-1.33 and 1.05; 1.01-1.08, respectively), and women from Sub-Saharan Africa (1.34; 1.30-1.38). The pattern differed by age group and country of destination. Most migrants had higher mortality due to infectious diseases and homicide while cancer mortality and suicide were lower. CVD mortality differed by migrant population. To conclude, mortality patterns varied across migrant populations in European countries. Future research should focus both on migrant populations with favourable and less favourable mortality pattern, in order to understand this heterogeneity and to drive policy at the European level.

AB Objectives To explore all-cause mortality and the association between symptoms of depression and all-cause mortality in farmers compared with other occupational groups, using a prospective cohort design.
   Methods We included adult participants with a known occupation from the second wave of the Nord-TrOndelag Health Study (HelseundersOkelsen i Nord-TrOndelag 2 (HUNT2) 1995-1997), Norway. Complete information on emigration and death from all causes was obtained from the National Registries. We used the depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to measure symptoms of depression. We compared farmers to 4 other occupational groups. Our baseline study population comprised 32618 participants. Statistical analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazards models.
   Results The estimated mortality risk in farmers was lower than in all other occupations combined, with a sex and age-adjusted HR (0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.00). However, farmers had an 11% increased age-adjusted and sex-adjusted mortality risk compared with the highest ranked socioeconomic group (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.25). In farmers, symptoms of depression were associated with a 13% increase in sex-adjusted and age-adjusted mortality risk (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.45). Compared with other occupations this was the lowest HR, also after adjusting for education, marital status, long-lasting limiting somatic illness and lifestyle factors (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.39).
   Conclusions Farmers had lower all-cause mortality compared with the other occupational groups combined. Symptoms of depression were associated with an increased mortality risk in farmers, but the risk increase was smaller compared with the other occupational groups.

ID SOCIAL RHYTHM THERAPY; DEPRESSED ADOLESCENTS; PSYCHOTHERAPY; EFFICACY;
   DISORDER
AB Introduction. Depression disorder may become the first cause of morbidity by 2030, according to the World Health Organization. It is actually one of the main causes of disease and handicap in children aged from 10 to 19. The major risk is suicide, whose prevalence is estimated, in France, around 6.7 for 100,000, which is probably underestimated. At present, the discussions about prescription of antidepressants in an adolescent's depression remain intense which is why psychotherapy becomes the first choice of treatment. We propose here to present one of them, Interpersonal PsychoTherapy (IPT), which remains largely unknown in France, and its adaptations in the adolescent population.
   Presentation of IPT. IPT is a brief psychotherapy, structured in twelve to sixteen sessions, which was created by Klerman and Weissman in the seventies inspired by the biopsychosocial model of Meyer, interpersonal theory of Sullivan, and attachment theory of Bowlby. It is divided into three parts: the initial phase, the intermediate phase, and the termination phase.
   Adaptation for adolescents. IPT was adapted for adolescents by Mufson in 1993, but a few modifications must be considered. Parental implication is the first. Indeed, parents, rather than the adolescent, often ask for the consultation; but it is the latter who benefits from the therapy. Parents may be met at some point in the therapy, for example between each phase and at the end. The initial phase is very close for the adolescent as for the adult; but the therapist must be careful about employing the "sick role" which can be used by the adolescent to avoid school, and as a consequence, to exacerbate the interpersonal deficit. The intermediate phase focuses on one of the four interpersonal issues: complicated bereavement, role transition, interpersonal role disputes, and interpersonal deficit. Complicated bereavement may become problematic when prolonged or when the adolescent had complicated relations with the deceased. The therapist essentially works on emotion verbalization. The role of transition is very common during adolescence: children become adults, they pass from high school to college, or their parents get divorced, etc. The patient and the therapist work on giving up the old role with its emotional expression (guilt, anger, and loss), and acquiring new skills, and identifying positive aspects of the new role. Interpersonal role disputes are common during adolescence, with parents or teachers for example. To determine a treatment plan, the therapist may first determine the stage of the role dispute, among impasse, renegotiation, or dissolution, and then work on the communication mode of the patient. At the least, the interpersonal deficit may be the most difficult area to work on because of the risk of psychiatric comorbidity. The therapist must be especially careful about anxious disorder which may complicate the psychotherapy and for which IPT is not the best therapy. The termination phase focuses on the new skills and abilities and works on the future without therapy. IPT is one of the psychotherapies recommended in the treatment of depression disorder in the international recommendations. But in France, all psychotherapies are considered equally. This may be a consensual approach, but the authors wonder if it is the best, especially to motivate research in the psychotherapy field.
   Other indications. - Finally, IPT has been developed in other indications in the past years, and many others are presently in research projects: depression during pregnancy, prevention of depression relapse, eating disorders, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, self-harm for example. Conclusion. - Its validity, simplicity and efficacy should stimulate psychiatrists and residents to train themselves to IPT. (C) 2016 L'Encephale, Paris.

TI Perception of adolescent medicine among French pediatric residents
SO ARCHIVES DE PEDIATRIE

DT Article
ID TRAINING NEEDS; HEALTH; CURRICULUM; ATTITUDES
AB Purpose. The perception of adolescent medicine (AM) among future pediatricians in France has scarcely been explored although adolescent health care is an integral part of the pediatrician's job. Moreover, pediatric residents seem to have a lack of enthusiasm for this field. The aim of this study was to assess the beliefs and perceptions of fourth-year French pediatric residents regarding adolescents and AM.
   Methodology. We conducted a national electronic survey among French pediatric residents in their last year of residency. An original 51-item, open-ended declarative questionnaire was sent out including questions on demographics, career expectations, AM block rotation experiences, and perceptions and beliefs regarding adolescents and AM. Difficulties and barriers experienced in this field were investigated. Queries about residents' specific AM courses and about their educational needs were also explored.
   Results. The survey was conducted online between January and March 2015. There were 121 respondents, achieving a 43% response rate. The majority of respondents perceived teens as interesting (75%), vulnerable (83%), and time-consuming (84%). Up to four fifths of respondents (81%) considered AM to be a skill that all pediatricians should acquire. A subgroup analysis showed that the residents who had not experienced an AM block rotation did notseem to be convinced of the need for training in this field (P = 0.09). The following issues were reported as major difficulties by residents: providing care for teens reluctant to seek health care (65%), managing violent behavior among adolescents in the emergency ward (98%), and managing adolescents who attempt suicide (80%). Less than half (45%) of the residents reported their residency program had a specific AM course. Among them, 73% attended the lectures and 57% found them useful. One third (32%) of the respondents had experienced a 2-month block rotation in the field of AM during their residency.
   Discussion. This is the first nationwide study in France in this field. Although the response rate is below 50%, it exceeded our expectations. Our results are in line with previous studies showing that pediatric residents report a high interest in working with adolescents and yet their educational needs in AM are unmet. The limitations of this study include the self-selection bias and implicit limitations carried by the phrasing of the survey questions.
   Conclusions. There is a need to devise a better educational approach combining a broader proposal of AM block rotations together with a specific competency framework in adolescent health, since we know it improves the quality of health care delivered to adolescents. Moreover, training pediatricians in AM is a public health priority so as to comply with medical schools' principles of social accountability and address the priority health needs for an efficient, equitable, and sustainable health system. At a time when postgraduate reform is being made, the inclusion of an AM curriculum in the general pediatrician course is necessary. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Background: Several terrorist attacks have recently taken place in France and Europe. Various studies have shown a high prevalence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other psychiatric disorders among the victims of these attacks. Nevertheless, research in this field is scarce and no cohort study has been conducted yet to evaluate the impact of a terrorist attack on teenagers directly exposed to this type of events. Therefore, we decided to work on the AVAL (Adolescents Victimes de l'Attentat de Londres) cohort study in order to measure the psycho-traumatic impact of this attack and to describe these adolescents' health care pathways. Material and method: The 53 students of a French high school who were directly exposed (criterion A1 of PTSD in DSM-5) to the terrorist attack perpetrated in London on March 22, 2017 constitute the target population of this monocentric cross-sectional observational study. We decided not to include the three students who were physically wounded and, therefore, didn't have the same sensorial exposition. The primary endpoint will be the prevalence of PTSD 12 to 15 months after the attack, measured by the PCL-5 (Post-traumatic stress disorder Check-List for DSM-5) global severity score: the diagnosis of PTSD will be retained when the score is > 32. We will also use an extensive battery of clinical tests to assess the prevalence of anxiety disorders, mood disorders, sleep disorders, addictions, suicide risk, and alterations in social, family, and school functioning 12 to 15 months after the attack. We will also describe these adolescents' health care pathways since the attack and collect data from the clinical evaluation performed during the initial intervention of the medico-psychological emergency cell within 10 days after the attack. Discussion: The findings of this study are intended to provide epidemiological data about the psycho-traumatic impact of a terrorist attack on the mental health of directly exposed adolescents and to describe these adolescents' health care pathways, thus contributing to improve the immediate, post-immediate, and delayed response strategies after a major psycho-traumatic event involving adolescents (and in particular after terrorist attacks), as well as the identification and psychiatric care of the young survivors requiring specialized care. Ethics and Dissemination: The regional ethics committee (Comite de Protection des Personnes Ouest IV-Nantes) approved the study protocol (Reference 10/18_3). All participants (and their legal guardians, for minors) must sign the informed consent to participate. The protocol was presented at the French congress of psychiatry in Nantes (France) in November 2018. After study completion, the results will be published and detailed in Marion Grenon's MD thesis in psychiatry.

AB Introduction. - Depression is a public health problem and constitutes the most frequently psychic manifestation observed among students. Its prevalence is much higher (30%) than in the other populations. Depression among students can have negative impacts on their social, relational situation and significantly impact their quality of life. Depression is misdiagnosed, misdetected and thus mistreated. In clinical practice at the University, the clinician finds difficulty in correctly diagnosing depression comorbidity including depression with a physical illness and/or somatic problems. It underestimates or overestimates depression (false negative diagnosis or false positive diagnosis). The difficulties of diagnosing depression and overlap with the physical symptoms of the disease are the challenges for the clinician to differentiate if certain symptoms are related to depression or physical illness. Thus, the difficulty in detecting and/or diagnosing depression can lead to false diagnoses of depression. So to avoid the false diagnosis of depression in the university context or in the disease, we must take into account the cognitions of depression. The BDI-FS, self-assessment scale to detect depression, considers these cognitions and therefore avoids the false diagnosis of depression in the presence of problems (such as a physical illness or somatic problems) and properly detects the depression.
   Objective. - This article presents the French validation of the Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen (BDI-FS Inventory) on a sample of students.
   Method. - A cross-sectional study was conducted on 473 students of the University of Caen Normandy.
   Results. - The Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen-France (BDI-FS-Fr) gets a good sensitivity, specificity and good positive and negative predictive value, a coefficient of Yule very strong and area under the curve satisfactory. He has a very good internal validity of structure: an exploratory factor analysis identified a factor that explains 40.21% of the total variance of the BDI-FS-Fr, and he has a satisfactory internal consistency (0.74). The BDI-FS-Fr has a very good external validity of structure (construct validity: convergent and divergent validity; P < 0.001) and discriminate validity (P < 0.001), and concurrent validity (P < 0.001). The split-half reliability (odd-even) was 0.73 (P < 0.001). The test-retest reliability was 0.82 (P < 0.001). Regarding clinical practice in the University, clinicians can use a simple questionnaire include 7 items (Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen-French: BDI-FS-Fr) to assess depression avoiding false diagnosis of depression in the University. The BDI-FS-Fr only evaluates the non-somatic symptoms (cognitive) rather than physical symptoms (somatic), which may overlap with problems due to the university or physical illness and depression may overlap. The BDI-FS-Fr only includes items the BDI-II that are related to the direct psychological experience of depression. Thus, the key strength of the BDI-FS-Fr is that it prevents symptoms of physical illness (e.g., weight loss, difficulty concentrating) from confounding the psychodiagnostic picture. The BDI-FS-Fr also allows us to evaluate the two diagnoses DSM-IV-TR (the main symptoms of depression: sadness and anhedonia). It also allows us to observe and assess the risk of suicide in people (ex. students and patients) by observing the items 2 (pessimism) and 7 (thoughts or desires of suicide) that are considered suicidal risk indicators. The BDI-FS is a diagnostic tool that minimizes the risk of giving falsely high estimates of depression in subjects focusing on the cognitive symptoms of depression. For pre-cited reasons, the clinicians can use the BDI-FS-Fr among students to diagnose their depression and assess their risk for suicide without false negative or false positive diagnosis.
   Conclusion. - The French version of the BDI-FS has very favourable psychometric properties. It is valid for self-assess depression, its intensity and its evolution, and it is a good complement to BDI for students. The BDI-FS-Fr thus has very good psychometric properties and is a useful tool for researchers and practitioners. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All right reserved.

AB Background. - The 2008 economic crisis may have had an impact on mental health but the studies on this topic are sparse, in particular among the working population. However, mental health at work is a crucial issue involving substantial costs and consequences. The aim of the study was to assess changes in behaviors and indicators of mental health in the French working population between 2006 and 2010, and to explore the differential changes according to age, origin, occupation, activity sector, public/private sector, self-employed/employee status and work contract.
   Methods. - The data came from the prospective national representative Sante et itineraire professionnel (SIP) survey, including a sample of 5600 French workers interviewed in 2006 and 2010. The behaviors and indicators of mental health studied were excessive alcohol consumption, smoking, sleep problems (sleep disorders and/or insufficient sleep duration), psychotropic drug use (antidepressants, anxiolytics and/or hypnotics), and poor self-reported health. Generalized estimating equations were used to analyze changes in behaviors and indicators of mental health, and the analyses were adjusted for age. Covariates (age, origin, occupation, activity sector, public/private sector, self-employed/employee status and type of contract) were added separately to assess differential changes.
   Results. - Increases in excessive alcohol consumption among women, sleep problems among men, and smoking, insufficient sleep duration and poor self-reported health for both genders were observed in the French working population between 2006 and 2010. Some differential changes were observed, negative changes being more likely to affect young workers and workers with a permanent contract.
   Conclusion. - Prevention policies should consider that behavior and indicators of mental health may deteriorate in times of economic crisis, especially among some sub-groups of the working population, such as young workers and workers with a permanent contract. These changes might foreshadow a forthcoming increase in mental disorders. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Background. - Estimates suggest that there are more than 700,000 adult caregivers of persons with dementia in this country, a large number of whom experience some form of sleep disturbance during the course of their caregiving career. Health care professionals are in the best position to detect and address this significant public health problem.
   Objectives. - Prospective study of sleep with the main caregivers providing home-care for demented patients.
   Methods. - This study was performed on elderly persons living at home. Two populations were concerned. The control group concerned 86 old persons living in the area of Limoges (France) and was contacted to join by the senior clubs of this city. The other group concerned caregivers to persons with dementia, living with them at home, and the assessments were done during the patient assessment. Each group had a cognitive evaluation by a Folstein's test and answered a questionnaire to describe their possible sleep difficulties.
   Results. - Sixty-eight caregivers face sleep disturbance versus 25 non-caregiver controls. Caregiver sleep-problems are often linked to sleep disturbances in the care-recipient. Night-time awakenings by persons with dementia are a common precipitating cause of sleep/wake disturbances in vulnerable caregivers. Caregivers awake 2.3 times during the night versus 1.2 for control persons. Caregivers awake earlier (around 6:20) than non-caregivers (around 7:05) and their sleep time is shorter by one hour. Caregivers are more often depressed (28 in 98 versus 13 in 86) and have more often high blood pressure (56 in 98 versus 24 in 86). They received more medications and used more often self-medication.
   Discussion. - Three major contributors to caregiver sleep-disturbance are pointed in this paper: the apparition of caregiver disrupted sleep routines, caregiver burden and depression and the caregiver's physical health status. Successful treatment of a caregiver's sleep disturbance requires careful consideration of each of these contributors. Non-pharmacological options are generally recommended as a first line of treatment for managing sleep disturbances in older adults, including caregivers of persons with dementia.

AB TEMPPO is an observational, cross-sectional and multicentre study, initiated in the French metropolitan territory in 2009. Set up from a random sample of 135 psychiatrists, it has observed the procedures for therapeutic management of a population (n = 619) of their outpatients (respectively 197 and 422 in public and private practice) with bipolar disorder type I or II disorders (DSM-IV). The patients who were followed were mostly very sick. Every patient received a pharmacological treatment. The prescription included at least one mood stabilizer or an antipsychotic (71% atypical) in 78% and 56% of cases respectively. Treatment regimen changes were frequent (61% of patients had at least one change in treatment during the last 12 months). A single molecule by therapeutic class was generally prescribed. The presence of an antipsychotic in combination therapy was often associated with the severity or difficulty of care of the patient (mixed states, severity of the global functioning impairment, manic states, high number of hospitalizations and history of suicide attempt). The combination of two antipsychotics is found only in the difficult situations of manic states. Patients with severe depressive phase are those who benefit from the combination mood stabilizer + antipsychotic + antidepressant (16% of the sample). In this study, the prescription of antidepressants significantly differs from recommendations for good prescribing practices. Indeed antidepressants were commonly prescribed in mixed-phase (63%), particularly as a monotherapy in 5% of cases. It was also found in patients in euthymic phase (48%), manic phase (12%) and hypomanic phase (29%). The prescription of atypical antipsychotics (monotherapy or combination) is now fully established in the management of all phases of the disease. The importance of non-pharmacological treatment is acknowledged by psychiatrists and proposed whether a psychotherapeutic support, information about the disease and/or lifestyle changes. The data collected in this study allowed to demonstrate that the participant psychiatrists have a pharmacological management of patients with bipolar disorder mostly in line with national and international guidelines.

TI Prevalence of pathological gambling in the general population around

LA French
DT Article

AB Introduction. - Pathological gambling is characterized in the DSM IV-TR as one of the disorders of impulse control. Problem gambling is also part of what is considered as behavioural addictions, the criteria of which have been defined by Goodman, with intrusive thoughts about the game, spending more and more to play, unable to control, reduce or stop gambling despite negative consequences, etc.
   Aim of the study. - There is no epidemiological study in France on the prevalence of pathological gambling. We wanted to study the prevalence of pathological gambling in a sample of 529 persons: 368 gamblers of Pari Mutuel Urbain and La Francaise des Jeux, and 161 persons in the general population. The study took place between January 2008 and June 2009.
   Methods. - As instruments, we used: the South Oaks Gambling Scale (SOGS) for screening of pathological gambling and the BIS-10 for impulsiveness' evaluation, the HAD scale to assess anxiety and depression and the ASRS for the evaluation of attention deficit disorder/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
   Results. - The rate of pathological gambling in the general population is 1.24% (this result is similar to those found in other places, such as in Quebec). In the general population, the rate of play at risk is of 5.59%. Among the population of gamblers, the rate for pathological gambling (JP) amounted to 9.23% and risk gambling to 10.86%. Men are overrepresented in the group of pathological gamblers (88.9%), also with consumption of alcohol and tobacco. Suicide attempts are more important than in the general population, but the difference was statistically significant. Depression and anxiety are particularly high, 40% of gamblers with an anxiety score significantly higher.
   Discussion. The results indicate rates close to those of other countries, such as Canada. It would be necessary to establish follow-up studies of populations and patients, as well as specific studies on people who frequent casinos, racetracks and internet gambling. The importance of the phenomenon is obvious, because almost 20% of players have a gambling problem or risk and these people do not consult despite their psychological problems, family, work, debts.

AB This study assessed the relationships of physical job demands (PJD), smoking, and alcohol abuse, with premature mortality before age 70 (PM-70) among the working or inactive population. The sample included 4,268 subjects aged 15 or more randomly selected in northeastern France. They completed a mailed questionnaire (birth date, sex, weight, height, job, PJD, smoking habit, alcohol abuse (Deta questionnaire)) in 1996 and were followed for mortality until 2004 (9 yr). PJD score was defined by the cumulative number of the following high job demands at work: hammer, vibrating platform, pneumatic tools, other vibrating hand tools, screwdriver, handling objects, awkward posture, tasks at heights, machine tools, pace, working on a production line, standing about and walking. The data were analyzed using the Poisson regression model. Those with PM-70 were 126 (3.81 per 1,000 person-years). The leading causes of death were cancers (46.4% in men, 57.1% in women), cardiovascular diseases (20.2% and 11.9%), suicide (9.5% and 7.1 %), respiratory diseases (6.0% and 4.8%), and digestive diseases (2.4% and 4.8%). PJD >= 3, smoker, and alcohol abuse had adjusted risk ratios of 1.71 (95% Cl 1.02-2.88), 1.76 (1.08-2.88), and 2.07 (1.31-3.26) respectively for all-cause mortality. Manual workers had a risk ratio of 1.84 (1.00-3.37) compared to the higher socio-economic classes. The men had a twofold higher mortality rate than the women; this difference became non-significant when controlling for job, PJD, smoker and alcohol abuse. For cancer mortality the factors PJD 3, smoker, and alcohol abuse had adjusted risk ratios of 2.00 (1.00-3.99), 2.34 (1.19-4.63), and 2.22 (1.17-4.20), respectively. Health promotion efforts should be directed at structural measures of task redesign and they should also concern lifestyle.

AB Efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment in children and adolescents
   Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been used increasingly since the early 1990s to treat anxiety disorders and depression in children and adolescents. Several recent reports, however cost doubt on their efficacy and especially raise questions about their role in serious adverse effects (increase in suicidal ideation and suicide attempts as well as reactions involving irritability hostility self-harm and self-destructive actions).
   The efficacy of SSRIs (fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, poroxetine) in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorders in this population is clear today although their effects are globally relatively modest. SSRls remain notably less effective than clomipramine for this indication, although a variety of factors (age, family history and psychiatric comorbidity) ore also likely to influence response to treatment.
   Only several placebo-controlled studies suggest that the SSRls (fluoxetine, sertraline and fluvoxamine) may hove some utility in the treatment of anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety, Separation anxiety social phobias) in children and teens. The additional benefits from SSRls for this indication nonetheless require confirmation.
   Imipramine and related tricyclic antidepressants ore ineffective in the treatment of depressive disorders in children and adolescents. Among the SSRIs, only fluoxetine has proven its efficacy for this indication, although its effect here too appears relatively modest. The efficacy of sertraline and paroxetine cannot be considered more than probable, requiring confirmation, and that of citalopram has not been demonstrated. Moreover because of the risk of suicidal behavior observed in some studies, SSRls are inadvisable for the treatment of depressive disorders in this population.
   Overall, although the currently available data show SSRls to be moderately effective and useful in treating anxiety disorders and depression in children and adolescents, future studies must focus on more precise identification of their indications, especially relative to psychotherapeutic strategies, which are still considered to be the first-line treatment in these disorders.
   From a legal point of view, only sertraline has been authorized in France for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorders in this population.

AB Purpose: Children growing up in homeless families are disproportionately more likely to experience health and psychological problems. Our objective was to describe social, environmental, individual and family characteristics associated with emotional and behavioral difficulties among homeless children living in the Paris region.
   Methods: Face-to-face interviews with a representative sample of homeless families were conducted by bilingual psychologists and interviewers between January and May 2013 (n = 343 children ages 4-13 years). Mothers reported children's emotional and behavioral difficulties (Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire [SDQ]), family socio-demographic characteristics, residential mobility, and parents' and children's physical and mental health. Children were interviewed regarding their perception of their living arrangements, friendships and school experiences. We studied children's SDQ total score in a linear regression framework.
   Results: Homeless children had higher SDQ total scores than children in the general population of France, (mean total score = 11.3 vs 8.9, P < 0,001). In multivariate analyses, children's difficulties were associated with parents' region of birth (beta = 1.74 for Sub-Saharan Africa, beta = 0.60 for Eastern Europe, beta = 3.22 for other countries, P = 0.020), residential mobility (beta = 0.22, P = 0.012), children's health (beta = 3.49, P < 0.001) and overweight (beta = 2.14, P = 0.007), the child's sleeping habits (beta = 2.82, P = 0.002), the mother's suicide risk (beta = 4.13, P < 0.001), the child's dislike of the family's accommodation (beta = 3.59, P < 0.001) and the child's experience of bullying (beta = 3.21, P = 0.002).
   Conclusions: Children growing up homeless experience high levels of psychological difficulties which can put them at risk for poor mental health and educational outcomes long-term. Access to appropriate screening and medical care for this vulnerable yet underserved group are greatly needed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI Postimmediate intervention of medical and psychological emergency units:
   Clinical and psychopathological study of 20 group psychological
   debriefings
SO ANNALES MEDICO-PSYCHOLOGIQUES
LA French
DT Article
AB Objectives. Group psychological debriefings belong to the various ways of treating mental trauma. Methodological and temporal structuring of group psychological debriefings is likely to highlight subjective impacts along with the evolution of the psychodynamic functioning which has been damaged by the tragic event. This contribution presents the clinical and psychopathological analysis of twenty group psychological debriefings made by the medical and psychological emergency unit of Ile-et-Vilaine (Bretagne region, France) following sudden deaths.
   Method. This study goes by the 20 "intervention reports" which have been systematically written by the unit workers after each debriefing. These documents mention: the nature of the request, the number of the group psychological debriefings made for each event, the number of persons taking part of the group, the themes brought up during the debriefing development, the presence of symptoms following the event, the offer of individual consultations to some participants, the debriefing length and its subsequently possible continuation. The twenty analysed debriefings have been put in place following fourteen different events (10 suicides, three sudden deaths, an accident on the public highway), considering that several debriefings might have been organized for one same situation. The results show: 1/ the effects on the mental functioning of the event in regard to the inventory of thoughts - or the lack of them -, affects, body manifestations, appearing at the moment of the event or its announcement; 2/ the symptomatology and psychopathological reactions that have occured since the event; 3/ the limited or lasting effects of the event on the psychodynamic functioning and the resumption of mental work that can be noticed from the evocation of perceptions about the future.
   Results. - Results hightlight mental upheavals linked to the trauma from initial disruption to the subsequent mental reorganization, depending on their limited or lasting evolution since the event till the debriefing and its regression phase. The research lists the adapted stress reaction signs and the trauma syndrom signs brought up during the debriefing, as well as the evolutive mental movements likely to avoid the fixation of the traumatic event. Results shows that, while some reveal real trauma syndroms requiring an individual psychotherapeutic treatment, trauma trivialization shall not hide the fact that not all sudden events are automatically traumatic but generally trigger an adapted stress reaction. Suicide cases, particularly at the workplace, imply a narcissistic imaginary breach, whether direct or linked to the image of the firm depending on its function to the subject involved, which is propitius for traumatic breach. Adapted stress reaction is generally noted, probably because of the nature of the events studied in this research: the-announcement of someone's sudden death - whose corpse was not discovered by those persons - without any threat against their own lives, which some call "secondarytraumatization". Hence a rather favourable and more or less rapid evolution of symptomatology, even if only a long-term epidemiological study could assess the presence of postponed, or even chronicized, symptoms.
   Conclusion. - At a scientific level, group debriefings throw light on clinical and psychopathological impacts on many people confronted with a same event which can be potentially traumatic. They also confirm the subjective dimension of the trauma. The study allows to assert that a debriefing contributes to relieve early distress and initiates, if need be, a psychotherapeutic treatment.

AB Background Tobacco smoking is common in people living with HIV, but high-quality evidence on interventions for smoking cessation is not available in this population. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of varenicline with counselling to aid smoking cessation in people living with HIV.
   Methods The ANRS 144 Inter-ACTIV randomised, parallel, double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial was done at 30 clinical hospital sites in France. People living with HIV who had smoked at least ten cigarettes per day for 1 year or longer, were motivated to stop smoking, were not dependent on another psychoactive substance, and had no history of depression or suicide attempt were eligible. Using a computer-generated randomisation sequence, we allocated (1:1) the patients to receive either varenicline titrated to two 0.5 mg doses twice daily or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks, plus face-to-face counselling. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment group allocation. Patients who were not abstinent at week 24 were offered open-label varenicline for 12 additional weeks. The primary outcome was the proportion of smokers continuously abstinent from week 9 to week 48. Smoking status was confirmed by carbon monoxide in exhaled air. Primary analyses were done in both the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and modified ITT (mITT) population, which comprised all patients who took at least one tablet of their assigned study treatment. The safety analyses were done in the mITT population. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT00918307. The trial status is complete.
   Findings From Oct 26, 2009, to Dec 20, 2012, of 303 patients assessed for eligibility, 248 patients were randomly assigned to the varenicline group (n=123) or the placebo group (n=125). After randomisation, one participant initially assigned to the placebo group was excluded from the ITT analysis for a regulatory reason (no French health-care coverage). 102 patients in the varenicline group and 111 patients in the placebo group received at least one dose of their assigned treatment and were included in the mITT analysis. In the ITT analysis, varenicline was associated with a higher proportion of patients achieving continuous abstinence over the study period (week 9-48): 18 (15%, 95% CI 8-21) of 123 in the varenicline group versus eight (6%, 2-11) of 124 in the placebo group, adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.5 (95% CI 1.0-6.1; p=0.041). In the mITT analysis, varenicline was also associated with higher continuous abstinence: 18 (18%, 95% CI 10-25) of 102 versus eight (7%, 2-12) of 111 in the placebo group (adjusted OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.1-6.5; p=0.029). The incidence of depression was 2.4 per 100 person-years (95% CI 0.6-9.5; two [2%] of 102) in the varenicline group and 12.4 per 100 person-years (95% CI 6.9-22.5; 11 [10%] of 111) in the placebo group. 14 (7%) of 213 participants had 18 cardiovascular events: six (6%) of 102 people in the varenicline group and eight (7%) of 111 people in the placebo group.
   Interpretation Varenicline is safe and efficacious for smoking cessation in people living with HIV and should be recommended as the standard of care.

AB Background: In the current public debate in France about end-of-life and legalization of euthanasia, palliative care is considered as a suitable answer or an alternative or even a supplement to euthanasia. The debate is based on opinion surveys, partly because there is a lack of objective data about the incidence of euthanasia requests (ER) in palliative care settings. The aim of this study was to collect, classify and quantify the expressions of wishes to die (WD), based on computerized files for patients admitted to an 81-bed palliative care hospital (PCH) in Paris during 2010-2011.
   Methods: Two researchers analyzed the carers' notes extracted on the basis of containing the words "wish to die", "euthanasia" or any expressions relating to death. Notes related to WD and the corresponding patients were then classified in the order: ER, suicidal thought (ST) and other wish to die (OWD). Repeated ER were qualitatively analyzed according to a grid.
   Results: We found that 195 of the 2157 patients (9%) expressed a WD: 61 (3%) expressed an ER; 15 (1%) described ST and 119 (6%) expressed an OWD without requiring acting. The WD group was predominantly female, stayed longer in the hospital (median 24 vs. 13 days), and consumed more anxiolytics and antidepressants. None of age, disease or marital status was associated with ER. More women and widows expressed an OWD. Twenty-six ER patients also expressed an OWD and two a ST. Six patients repeated their ER: all had poorly controlled symptoms with repercussions for their mental state.
   Conclusion: Our data show the existence of various expressions of WD with a low incidence of ER in a French PCH. The observation of WD including ER is suggestive of good communication between the patients and the care teams. Independent of the changeability of expressions of WD, their very existence should lead to a consideration of the dynamic changes in these WD, and to care staff paying additional attention to the individual, their suffering and the context.

AB Objective: A national network of expert centers for bipolar disorders was set up in France to provide support, mainly for psychiatrists, who need help for managing bipolar disorder patients. The aims of this article are to present the main characteristics of the patients referred to an expert center in order to highlight the major disturbances affecting these patients and to understand the most significant difficulties encountered by practitioners dealing with bipolar disorder patients.
   Methods: Patients were evaluated by trained psychiatrists and psychologists, with standardized and systematic assessment using interviews and self-report questionnaires.
   Results: All patients (n = 839) met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition criteria for bipolar disorder I (48.4%), bipolar disorder II (38.1%) or bipolar disorder-not otherwise specified (13.5%). Mean illness duration was 17 years (11.3), with 41.9% of patients having a history of suicide attempts. Lifetime comorbidities were 43.8% for anxiety disorders and 32.8% for substance abuse. At the point of inclusion, most patients (76.2%) were not in an acute phase, being considered to have a syndromal remission, but which still required referral to a tertiary system of care. Among these patients, 37.5% had mild to moderate residual depressive symptoms (Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale ranging from 7 to 19) despite 39% receiving an antidepressant. However, 47.8% were considered to be poorly adherent to medication; 55% showed evidence of sleep disturbances, with half being overweight; 68.1% of patients showed poor functioning (Functioning Assessment Short Test 12) with this being linked to residual depressive symptoms, sleep disturbances and increased body mass index.
   Conclusions: It appears that bipolar disorder patients referred to an expert center in most cases do not suffer from a severe or resistant illness but they rather have residual symptoms, including subtle but chronic perturbations that have a major impact on levels of functioning. The longitudinal follow-up of these patients will enable a better understanding of the evolution of such residual symptoms.

TI Psychiatric and cognitive difficulties as indicators of juvenile
   Huntington disease onset in 29 patients
SO ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID AGE-OF-ONSET; TRINUCLEOTIDE REPEAT; INSTABILITY; DURATION; LENGTH
AB Background: Juvenile Huntington disease (JHD) is a rare clinical entity characterized by an age at onset younger than 20 years. Patients usually have an expansion of more than 60CAGrepeats in the Huntington disease (HD) gene, and the disease is usually inherited from the father. In general, precise age at onset is difficult to assess in HD because of insidious onset and anosognosia. Onset of motor difficulty signs is usually used to define age at onset.
   Objectives: To evaluate diagnosis delay in patients with JHD and to analyze the clinical and genetic features of JHD.
   Design: Retrospective clinical and genetic review.
   Setting: Referral center for HD at Salpetriere Hospital, Paris, France.
   Patients: Twenty-nine patients with HD with onset before or at age 20 years who carried an abnormal CAG repeat expansion in the HD gene.
   Results: The mean +/- SD delay before diagnosis was 9 +/- 6 years ( range, 0-21 years). The most remarkable signs at onset were severe psychiatric and cognitive disturbances ( 19 of 29 [ 65.5%]); rigidity was absent. Unusual signs at onset included myoclonic head tremor in 3 patients, severe isolated drug or alcohol addiction in 2, psychotic disorder in 1, and difficulty writing in 1. One patient had progressive cerebellar signs associated with cerebellar atrophy on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging before signs suggestive of HD appeared. During the course of the disease, psychiatric disturbances were severe, with at least 1 suicide attempt in 7 of 29 patients. Transmission was maternal in 25% of patients. Forty-six percent of patients with JHD had fewer than 60 CAG repeats; 6 of these patients inherited the disease from their father. Anticipation ( mean +/- SD, 18 +/- 9 vs 25 +/- 11 years; P=. 27) and age at onset ( mean +/- SD, 17.14 +/- 2.2 vs 13.29 +/- 5.5 years; P=. 09) was similar in patients with maternal compared with paternal transmission, respectively.
   Conclusions: Patients with JHD started showing disease symptoms through nonspecific features, mostly psychiatric and cognitive difficulties. This led to misdiagnosis or diagnosis delay, especially in cases without a familial history of HD. Maternal transmissions and expansions of fewer than 60 CAG repeats were unexpectedly frequent in this series and should not be considered exceptional.

AB Background: In an epidemiological study, medical causes of death may be obtained from different sources. In a study on French gas and electricity company (EDF-GDF) workers, they were obtained from the national INSERM database. Additionally, the causes collected by the EDF-GDF occupational physicians were available for a subset of 1,330 deaths, which occurred between 1989 and 1994. The data from the two sources were compared with each other, in order to assess whether they were globally equivalent, and the potential impact of their differences on the results of epidemiological analyses.
   Methods: Concordance rates between causes of death in the INSERM and EDF-GDF physicians databases were calculated according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) ninth revision codes and for various causes groups. Causes of death records were also examined in order to clarify the observed divergences. SMRs were computed in order to evaluate the consequences of using each database in epidemiological analyses. Finally, some SMRs were computed with the two sources and compared with each other.
   Results: INSERM and EDF-GDF physicians causes belonged to the same causes group in 81% of cases, but the exact cause was different for more than half of them. The concordance rate was high for the deaths by AIDS and by cancer, and low for deaths by respiratory system and digestive system diseases. More causes of death were coded as "unknown". in EDF-GDF physicians data than in INSERM data. The SMRs varied widely depending on whether the INSERM or EDF-GDF physicians causes of death databases were used.
   Conclusions: Causes of death recorded in the INSERM and EDF-GDF physicians databases are very different. Therefore, using the national mortality rates computed by INSERM with the EDF-GDF physicians causes of death to calculate SMRs is not valid, and it is observed that they may be very different from those computed with INSERM data. In a general way, it should be better to use the INSERM database, which is a common source, in order to generate results comparable with other studies. However, this database has its own limitations, and it may be better, in particular situations and for internal analyses, to use another source if it seems to be a better one.

TI Mixed states vs. pure mania in the french sample of the EMBLEM study:
   results at baseline and 24 months - <i>European mania in bipolar
   longitudinal evaluation of medication</i>
SO BMC PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID DISORDERS; SCALE
AB Background: To describe the clinical course and treatment patterns over 24 months of patients experiencing an acute manic/mixed episode within the standard course of care.
   Methods: EMBLEM was a 2-year European prospective, observational study on outcomes of patients experiencing a manic/mixed episode. Adults with bipolar disorder were enrolled within the standard course of care as in/outpatients if they initiated or changed oral medication for treatment of acute mania. After completing 12 weeks of acute phase, patients were assessed every 3-6 months during the maintenance phase. We present the 24 month results, with subgroup analysis for mixed states (MS) and pure mania (PM). These subgroup analyses are driven by the high proportion of antidepressants prescribed in this cohort.
   Results: In France, 771 patients were eligible for the maintenance phase. 69% of patients completed the follow up over 24 months. The mean age was 45.5 years (sd = 13.6) with 57% of women. 504 (66%) patients were experiencing a PM and 262 (34%) a MS at baseline. The main significant differences in MS vs. PM at baseline were: a higher rate of women, and in the previous 12 months, a higher frequency of episodes (manic/mixed and depressive), more suicide attempts, more rapid cycling, fewer social activities and more work impairment. Over the 24 months of follow-up the MS group had a significantly lower recovery than PM (36% vs. 46%, p = 0.006). Overall, 42% of all patients were started on monotherapy and 58% on combination therapy; of those 35% and 30% respectively remained on their initial medication throughout the 24 months. At baseline, 36% were treated with an antidepressant, this proportion remains high throughout the follow-up period, with a significantly higher rate for MS vs. PM at 24 months (55% vs. 27%, p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: In this large sample, MS occur frequently (34%), they are more severe at baseline and have a worse functional prognosis than PM. Although antidepressants are not recommended in MS and PM, they were frequently prescribed at baseline and are maintained during the 24 months of follow-up.

AB Background: Opinion about euthanasia has been explored among the general population and recently in patients receiving palliative care. 96% of the French population declared themselves in favor of euthanasia while less of 50% of palliative care patients are. The aim of the present study was to explore and identify potential determinant factors associated with favorable or unfavorable opinion about euthanasia in a French population of cancer patients receiving palliative care.
   Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study among patients in two palliative care units. Eligible patients were identified by the medical staff. Face-to-face interviews were performed by two investigators. Two groups were defined as favorable or unfavorable about euthanasia according to the answer on the specific question about patient opinion on euthanasia. A multivariate analysis including age, belief in God, chemotherapy and gender was built.
   Results: Seventy-eight patients were interviewed. Median age was 60.5 years (range: 31-87.2). In univariate analysis, patients with a favorable opinion were most often under 60 years old (62 versus 38% unfavorable; p = 0.035), in couple (64 versus 35%; p = 0.032), didn't believe in God (72 versus 28% were non-believers; p < 0.001) and had more frequently an history of chemotherapy treatment (58 versus 42% received at least one cycle of chemotherapy; p = 0.005). In a multivariate analysis, age < 60 years, absence of belief in God and an antecedent of chemotherapy were independently associated with a favorable opinion about euthanasia (OR = 0.237 [0.076-0.746]; p = 0.014, OR = 0.143 [0.044-0.469]; p = 0.001, and OR = 10.418 [2.093-51.853]; p = 0.004, respectively).
   Conclusion: We report here determinants of opinion about euthanasia in palliative care cancer patients. Thus, young patients who do not believe in God and have a history of chemotherapy treatment are more likely to request the discontinuation or restriction of their treatment. A better understanding of these determinants is essential for the development of information and/or interventions tailored to the palliative context.

AB Background: Mental health problems and risk behaviours among young people are of great public health concern. Consequently, within the VII Framework Programme, the European Commission funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted in eleven European countries, with Sweden as the coordinating centre, and was designed to identify an effective way to promote mental health and reduce suicidality and risk taking behaviours among adolescents.
   Objective: To describe the methodological and field procedures in the SEYLE RCT among adolescents, as well as to present the main characteristics of the recruited sample.
   Methods: Analyses were conducted to determine: 1) representativeness of study sites compared to respective national data; 2) response rate of schools and pupils, drop-out rates from baseline to 3 and 12 month follow-up, 3) comparability of samples among the four Intervention Arms; 4) properties of the standard scales employed: Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-II), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (Z-SAS), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), World Health Organization Well-Being Scale (WHO-5).
   Results: Participants at baseline comprised 12,395 adolescents (M/F: 5,529/6,799; mean age=14.9 +/- 0.9) from Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain. At the 3 and 12 months follow up, participation rates were 87.3% and 79.4%, respectively. Demographic characteristics of participating sites were found to be reasonably representative of their respective national population. Overall response rate of schools was 67.8%. All scales utilised in the study had good to very good internal reliability, as measured by Cronbach's alpha (BDI-II: 0.864; Z-SAS: 0.805; SDQ: 0.740; WHO-5: 0.799).
   Conclusions: SEYLE achieved its objective of recruiting a large representative sample of adolescents within participating European countries. Analysis of SEYLE data will shed light on the effectiveness of important interventions aimed at improving adolescent mental health and well-being, reducing risk-taking and self-destructive behaviour and preventing suicidality.

AB Background: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and was associated with greater morbidity, mortality (including suicide), and healthcare costs. By 2030, MDD will become the leading cause of disability in high-income countries. Notably, among patients with a previous experience of a major depressive episode, it was indeed estimated that up to 85 % of those patients will suffer from relapse. Two main factors were associated with a significantly higher risk of relapse: poor medication adherence and low self-efficacy in disease management. Interestingly, these issues could become the targets of psychoeducational programs for chronic diseases. Indded psychoeducational program for depression are recommended in international guidelines, but have not yet been proposed in France.
   Methods/ Design: We propose to evaluate the first French psychoeducational program for depression "ENVIE" in a multicenter randomized controlled trial. The group intervention will include 9 weekly sessions. Its aim is to educate patients on the latest knowledge on depression and effective treatments through didactic and interactive sessions. Patients will experiment the latest innovating psychological skills (from acceptance and commitment therapy) to cope with depressive symptoms and maintain motivation in behavioral activation. In total, 332 unipolar non-chronic (< 2 years) outpatients with moderate to severe depression, without psychotic features, will be randomly allocated to the add-on ENVIE program (N = 166) or to a waiting list (N = 166). The follow-up will last 15 months and include 5 assessment visits. The primary endpoint will be the remission rate of the index episode at 15 months post-inclusion, defined by a Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score = 12 over an 8-week period, and without relapse during follow-up. We will also assess the response rate and relapse at 15 months post-inclusion, hospitalization rate and adherence to treatment during the follow-up period, quality of life and global functioning upon inclusion and at 9 and 15 months post inclusion.
   Discussion: If the proposed trial shows the effectiveness of the intervention, but also an increased remission rate in depressed outpatients at 15-months post-inclusion, in addition to improved treatment adherence in patients, it will further promotes arguments in favor of a wide dissemination of psychoeducational programs for depression.

   The aim was to determine the identification methods used during all the forensic investigations, but also to study causes and manner of death in this sample of the population.
   A total of 9.1% of all autopsies were on X cadavers (217 cases out of 2384). On this total, only 134 of them have been included in our series after exclusion of archaeological and animal samples, but also of unidentified individuals or incomplete data available. Almost 28% of them have been identified with molecular biology (DNA), 23% with odontological examination, 7.5% with fingerprinting and 6.7% with autopsy data.
   Manner of death was mainly suicide (40.3%) especially by asphyxia following drowning, then accidental death (17.9%) especially consecutive to multiple trauma after traffic accident, acute carbon monoxide intoxication or carbonization in a fire. A total of 11.9% natural deaths were found (50% of them being of cardio-vascular origin) and 11.2% of homicides (with the use of firearm in a third of them). For 18.7% of X cadavers, the mode of death was undetermined.
   46.4% of all unidentified bodies in our series were only identified by the police investigations, using physical recognition (direct or with photographs) or personal effects or identity documents in close relationship with the body. Our study highlights the fact that quite half of all unidentified bodies are inhumed with an identity not scientifically proved.
   Bodies which remained unidentified after all investigations represent 10.2% of X cadavers (if we consider a group of 176 cases composed of our study sample of 134 cases plus 24 subjects identified just before the autopsy and the 18 cases which remained unidentified) and 0.8% of all autopsies performed in the department.

AB Introduction: Burnout is a pathology that can affect care-giving professionals. It associates emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP) and impaired personal accomplishment (PA). Surgery entails great responsibility and frequently heavy workloads, incurring risk of burnout. Data, however, are not available for French orthopedic and trauma surgeons. We therefore conducted a prospective survey to 1) assess burnout prevalence in French orthopedic surgeons, and 2) investigate risk factors and protective factors.
   Hypothesis: Burnout prevalence is at least as high in French orthopedic surgeons as in other medical and surgical specialties.
   Materials and methods: A nationwide survey was conducted in France between February and April 2017, using a digitized questionnaire sent out by e-mail. Burnout was assessed on the MBI (Maslach Burnout Inventory), and depressive symptoms on the GHQ-12 (General Health Questionnaire-12). Demographic and occupational data were also collected.
   Results: Out of 1,900 surgeons contacted, 441 (23%) responded. Mean age was 50.2 +/- 10.1 years; 413 (93.7%) were male. Sixty one (14%) reported elevated EE, 100 (23%) elevated DP, and 82 (19%) impaired AP. One hundred and seventy two (39%) showed burnout symptomatology (e.g., pathologic score on one MBI scale), while 47 (10%) had pathologic scores on 2 or 3 scales, indicating severe burnout. One hundred and ninety three (43%) would not advise their children to take up orthopedic surgery. Thirty eight (8%) expressed suicidal ideation. Statistical analysis identified public-sector practice (OR = 4.6; 95% CI: 2.1-10.7; p = 0.0002) and pathologic GHQ-12 score (OR= 6.3; 95% CI: 2.2-17.8; p = 0.0006) as risk factors for burnout. Outside activity (OR= 0.39; 95% CI: 0.1-0.9; p = 0.0406) and male gender (OR= 0.2; 95% CI: 0.05-0.7; p = 0.0160) emerged as protective factors.
   Discussion: Despite a response rate of only 23% (n= 441/1,900), the present study sheds light on burnout rates in French orthopedic surgeons, with 39% burnout symptoms and 10% severe burnout. Burnout impacts personal and occupational life, with increased suicidal ideation and impaired quality of life. The present results confirm the importance of screening and treatment in care-providers.

SO ENCEPHALE-REVUE DE PSYCHIATRIE CLINIQUE BIOLOGIQUE ET THERAPEUTIQUE
LA French
DT Article
DE Prevalence; Trauma-related disorders; PTSD; Primary care
ID DSM-IV; COMORBIDITY
AB Introduction. - Trauma-related disorders are disabling affections of which epidemiological data change according to the country, population and measuring instruments.
   The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) appears to have increased over the past 15 years, but one cannot tell whether it has indeed increased or whether the standardized procedure has improved. Moreover, very few epidemiologic studies among the general population have been conducted in Europe, notably in France.
   Design of the study. - The "Sante mentale en population generale" (SMPG) survey, that took place in France between 1999 and 2003 among more than 36 000 individuals, gives an estimation of the prevalence of psychotraumatic disorders in the general population. Multi-varied analyses were performed on PTSD-related variables and comorbid disorders. The instantaneous prevalence (past month) of PTSD was of 0.7% among the whole SMPG sample, with almost the same proportion of men (45%) and women (55%). There was a high rate of comorbidity among PTSD individuals, notably with mood disorders, anxiety disorders and addictive behaviour. There was an obvious relationship with suicidal behaviour, with 15-fold more suicide attempts during the past month among the PTSD population.
   Results. - This survey analysed the consequences of a psychic traumatism over and above complete PTSD according to DSM-IV criteria, observing for instance the consequences for people exposed both to a trauma and suffering from at least one psychopathological symptom since the trauma. Those who suffered from a psychotraumatic syndrome, according to our enlarged definition, represented 5.3% of the population, half suffered from daily discomfort and a third of them used medication.
   Then, we compared those psychotraumatic syndromes to complete PTSD from a sociodemographic, functional and type of care point of view. There was little difference in prevalence of PTSD between men and women in the SMPG survey (45% vs 55%), which is clearly distinct from the other epidemiologic surveys named above. Regarding age, as in the ESEMeD survey, anxiety disorders appeared to be more frequent among younger people.
   The originality of the SMPG survey is obviously in the fact that it studied the functional impact of the psychic disorder, the type of care and the satisfaction level after care. Only 50% of the PTSD population feels sick which is, however, twice as high as for the psychotraumatized population. This doesn't fit either with the fact that 100% of the PTSD population say they feet uncomfortable with other people. The type of care is in the same vein: 50% of psychotherapies and 75% of medication, but also 25% of mild medicines and 25% of traditional medicines. Moreover, among the drugs, antidepressants (that are stilt the first choice treatment in all international recommendations) represent only 30%, whereas anxiolytics, hypnotics and phytotherapy represent the remaining 70%.
   Discussion. - Regarding the type of care, the differences between the psychotraumatized population and the PTSD population are obvious. They are obvious in that which concerns the type of care, since the medication is similar. From a very global point of view, patients suffering from a subsyndromal PTSD rarely choose medical care (religion, mild or traditional medicine), white full PTSD patients definitely choose classical medical care (drugs, psychotherapy, and 30% of hospitalization). The prevalence of those who ask for care is very close to that observed in the ESEMeD survey, which was four individuals out of 10 suffering from PTSD.
   Conclusion. - The SMPG data show that its necessary to maintain the distinction between subsyndromal PTSD and full PTSD since the populations differ, but both need care. (C) L'Encephale, Paris, 2008.

AB Background: School is a multi-cultural setting where students need social, material, physical, and mental resources to attain school achievement. But they are often lacking, especially for immigrant students. In an early adolescence context, this study assessed risk for school difficulties among European and non-European immigrants and the roles of socioeconomic characteristics, physical health, psychological health, social relationships, living environment, and unhealthy behaviours.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study included 1,559 middle-school adolescents from north-eastern France, who completed a self-administered questionnaire including socioeconomic characteristics (gender, age, family structure, father's occupation, and family income), WHO-Quality of life (measuring the four dimensions physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and living environment), unhealthy behaviours (last-30-day uses of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, and other illicit drugs and no regular sports/physical activities), grade repetition, low school performance (<10/20), and school dropout ideation at 16 years. Data were analyzed using logistic models.
   Results: Grade repetition affected 14.8% of students, low school performance 8.2%, and school dropout ideation 3.9%. European immigrants had a higher risk for grade repetition only with a gender-age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 2.44, vs. French students. This odds ratio decreased to 1.76 (contribution 47%) with further adjustment for all confounders (family structure, father's occupation, family income, physical health, psychological health, social relationships, living environment, and unhealthy behaviours). Non-European immigrants had a statistically higher risk for all grade repetition, low school performance, and school dropout ideation with ORs of 3.29, 3.02, and 3.42, respectively vs. French students. These odds ratios decreased to 1.76, 1.54, and 1.54, respectively (contributions 66%, 73%, and 78%) with further adjustment for all confounders.
   Conclusions: Compared with French students, European immigrant students were more affected only by grade repetition while non-European immigrant students by all grade repetition, low school performance, and school dropout ideation. The contribution of socioeconomic characteristics, physical health, psychological health, social relationships, living environment, and unhealthy behaviours was very high and much higher for non-European than for European immigrant students. Public policy should focus on these factors and services to reduce school difficulties.

AB Introduction. - Anhedonia is defined as the toss of the capacity to feet pleasure and there is no consensus with its relationship with depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, no study has investigated the problematic of anhedonia in the context of HIV-infection, which concern a lot of patients with depressive symptoms. Depressive symptomatology presents a major challenge in the management of HIV-infection due to its central role in clinical progression.
   Objective. - This study aims to disentangle relationship between determinants of anhedonia, depression and anxiety in order to optimise mental management of HIV infection.
   Method. - In 2003, a face-to-face survey (ANRS-EN12-VESPA) was conducted among patients selected in a random stratified sample of 102 French hospital departments delivering HIV care. Eligible respondents were HIV-infected outpatients, aged 18 or older living in France and diagnosed for at least six months. Among solicited patients, 2932 agreed to participate (response rate: 59%) and data about anhedonia, anxiety and depression are available for 1427 patients. The face-to-face gathered information on sociodemographic characteristics, such as education level, gender, partner, children, financial situation or housing and also psychosocial and sociobehavioural characteristics, such as drug use. Self-reported side effects of treatment were also available.
   Assessment tools. - Anxiety and depression were assessed using the hospital anxiety and depression (HAD) scale. Physical anhedonia was assessed using the French version of the Chapman scale. Three regression models were used to identify factors associated with anhedonia, anxiety and depression among demographic, psychosocial and clinical characteristics.
   Results. - Factors independently associated with anhedonia were older age (>50), lower education level, unemployment and men HIV contaminated by heterosexual relation or injecting drug use. Women, with lower education [eve[, unemployment, without steady partner, with a detectable viral load and who reported side effect of HAART presented more frequently anxiety. Unemployment, uncomfortable housing, no social support from friends, self-reported side effect and lipodystophy were independently associated with depression.
   Conclusion. - Our results underline the multiplicity of factors associated with mental disorders related to depression. These results can be explained by the fact that the anxiety and anhedonia are two cardinal symptoms of depression. Determinants of anhedonia and anxiety reported in this study may provide the key to a more exact delineation of depressive disorders in the context of HIV infection in order to optimize long-term psychological follow up of concerned patients.

AB Introduction. Clozapine, synthesized in the sixties, is an atypical antipsychotic drug whose history has been marked by its haematological toxicity. The purpose of this study was, ten years after it had been replaced at French psychiatrists' disposal, to gather data on the prescription modalities of clozapine, assess whether some factors could affect its efficacy, and describe the population of schizophrenic patients concerned. Methodology. Psychiatrists in the Paris region were asked to answer a questionnaire about their patients treated with clozapine. The information collected was about socio-demographic data, history of psychiatric disorder and the way clozapine was used. It was a retrospective study concerning 98 patients. Results. Subjects were 57 men and 41 women, with a mean age of 38 years. The majority of patients came from metropolitan France. Patients suffered from various clinical subtypes of schizophrenia, as assessed according to DSM IV criteria. Predominant symptomatology during lifetime was most often auditory hallucinations (41 Mean duration of lifetime neuroleptic treatment was 10.3 years and breaks in follow-up were rare. Mean number of hospitalisations was 6.9 and a little less than half of the patients had been committed involuntarily. Lastly, 38% of patients had attempted suicide at least once and 35% had expressed hetero-agressive behavior. Main indication of clozapine was resistant schizophrenia (88.5% of patients) and mean duration of treatment was 2 years and 4 months. Treatment efficacy was assessed as good or medium in 77.9% of patients, at mean doses (322 mg per day) in keeping with data from the literature. Tolerance was considered on the whole as satisfactory by half of the clinicians. Among the 98 patients of the study, 21.6% had stopped taking clozapine. The reasons for withdrawal were: inefficacy (6.2%), granulopenia (5.2%), epilepsy (1%) and 8.2% for various reasons (half of these cases being non-compliance with treatment). The study of the 5 cases of granulopenia showed that 3 patients had another associated psychotropic medication : 1 patient received only clozapine as monotherapy, 1 data was missing. Two thirds of all patients were receiving another psychotropic drug in association with clozapine, mainly benzodiazepines (18.4%), antidepressants (15.3%) or mood stabilizers (7.1%). The << therapeutic efficacy >> variable was compared with some variables in order to isolate factors possibly associated with a better efficacy of clozapine or, on the contrary, with a population of patients poorly responding to treatment. However, no statistically significant difference appeared according to the variables studied, such as gender or lifetime duration of neuroleptic treatment. Moreover, there was no statistically significant difference in efficacy according to schizophrenia subtype, main symptomatology during the course of illness or substance abuse. We studied whether any factor could affect the occurrence of granulopenia. No statistically significant difference was found. The mean age of patients having stopped the treatment because of granulopenia-was higher than in the group with other reasons for interruption, but did not reach statistical significance. A, trend also appeared towards female predominance (60% of women in the granulopenia group) and 3/4 of patients who had stopped their treatment because of agranulocytosis received another psychotropic drug in association with clozapine. Conclusion.
   As expected the main indication for prescribing clozapine was resistant schizophrenia, bt contrary to data from the international literature, the efficacy profile was the same whatever the clinical subtype of schizophrenia. The tolerance to clozapine was considered on the whole as satisfactory, but the high proportion of granulopenias leading to treatment withdrawal (5.2% of patients) confirms the need to remain cautious and stresses the importance of regular haematological monitoring. Furthermore, the study of the prescription modalities of clozapine shows that contrary to the guidelines, clozapine is often associated with other psychotropic drugs. In this study, it is striking to note that 75% of granulopenias occured in coprescription situation.

AB Background. - Recent studies on insight in people with schizophrenia showed that insight level is linked with treatment compliance. Therefore, many therapies are aimed at increasing the insight level, such as psycho-education. However, insight level is also probably linked with depression level. So, improving insight is at risk of increasing the level of depression. Nevertheless, results on this topic are not consensual in the scientific literature. Presumably, this could be due to the concept of insight itself, although we could hypothesise that some confounding variables are implied in the interaction between insight and depression, such as internalized stigma.
   Aims. - to test the hypothesis that the relationship between insight and depression is mediated by internalized stigma in people with schizophrenia.
   Method. - Sixty-two patients with schizophrenia (DSM-IV or ICD-10) recruited in mental health services in Ile de France (75% male), aged 20 to 64 years (m = 38.71, sigma = 0.43), filled in questionnaires assessing internalized stigma (ISMI), depression (CDSS and BDI) and insight (SAIQ, Q8, IS), after giving their written informed consent. Correlations between insight, depression and different variables were made (Hypothesis 1). Then we ran multiple regressions and partial correlations to test the internalized stigma mediation (Hypothesis 2).
   Results. - Insight, internalized stigma and depression are statistically significantly correlated with each scales used (except Q8). Insight is correlated with depressed mood (correlations between IS and CDSS: r = 0.27, P = 0.04, and BDI, r = 0.40, P = 0.001). We also found negative correlations between SAIQ and CDSS (r = -0.35, P = 0.005) and the BDI (r = -0.4265, P = 0.000) which means that good insight is linked with depression. This result validates our hypothesis 1. The statistic tests reveal other complementary results: the association between insight and depression is mediated by the level of internalized Stigma: when ISMI is controlled, the correlation between insight and depression decreased moderately with CDSS and with small intensity with SAIQ, but clearly. So, ISMI is probably a mediating variable between IS and BDI-CDSS. In conclusion, internalized stigma could be a mediating variable between insight and depression. This validates our second hypothesis.
   Conclusions. - Our results suggest that the relationship between insight and depression is mediated by internalized stigma. Patients with good insight who internalize stigma seem to be more depressed than those who don't. This result could have important consequences in clinical practice: improving insight level should be completed by a specific attention to the level and evolution of internalized stigma to avoid increasing depression. Further studies need to be conducted to confirm these results. (C) L'Encephale, Paris, 2014.

AB Introduction. Anxiety is a major and frequent symptom of schizophrenia, which is associated with an increased risk of relapse, impaired functioning, lower quality of life and increased incidence of suicide attempts. Despite its clinical relevance, anxiety in schizophrenia remains poorly understood. In the prodromic phase, anxiety indicates a progression towards psychotic decompensation. After a first episode, it is an indicator of relapse.
   Literature findings. Two approaches have been used to investigate anxiety in schizophrenia: (i) categorical approach (comorbidity of schizophrenia and anxiety disorders) and (ii) dimensional approach (anxiety as a major symptom of the "dysphoric" dimension). Clinical categorical studies reported an increased frequency of comorbidity between schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and specific phobia. The dimensional approach proposes that five different factors contribute to the structure of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), with anxiety as a major symptom of the "dysphoria" dimension. Concerning diagnosis, it is unclear whether psychotic and neurotic anxiety differs in nature or intensity. Nevertheless, both are frequently opposed.
   Discussion. Psychotic anxiety is intense, profound and hermetic. In contrast to neurotic anxiety, it is associated with psychomotor disturbances, such as agitation and sideration. There is no specific tool to evaluate anxiety in schizophrenia. The dimensional approach usually runs an evaluation using items or factors extracted from the most widely-used scales, i.e. PANSS or Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) or from anxiety scales developed in non-schizophrenic populations, such as the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). Recently, we developed a specific scale for hetero-evaluation (Echelle Anxiete Schizophrenie [EAS scale]). The EAS scale was recently validated and the study of its sensitivity is ongoing.
   Therapeutical issues. Several studies have examined the effects of antipsychotics on the anxious/depressive cluster extracted from the PANSS, and some other studies have specifically evaluated the effect of antipsychotics on depressive symptoms using the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (COSS), but to our knowledge, no study has reported the effect of antipsychotics or other treatment on anxiety when using a schizophrenia-specific scale. There are no specific guideline treatments for anxiety in schizophrenia. Among phenothiazines, cyamemazine is frequently prescribed in France, because of its potent anxiolytic activity and good neurological tolerance. Some authors have suggested a specific treatment with benzodiazepines. However, benzodiazepines should be used with caution, due to undesirable actions such as dependence, rebound and potentiation of certain lateral effects. (C) L'Encephale, Paris, 2010.

   situation in France
SO REVUE NEUROLOGIQUE
LA English
DT Review
DE Law; End-of-life; Patient's right; Advance directives; Sedation
AB On February 2, 2016, the French parliament adopted legislation creating new rights for the terminally ill. The text modifies and reinforces the rights of patients to end-of-life care and strengthens the status of surrogate decision makers. Under the new regulations, advance directives become legally binding though not unenforceable. Two types of advance directives are distinguished depending on whether the person is suffering or not from a serious illness when drafting them. The attending physician must abide by the patient's advance directives except in three situations: there is a life-threatening emergency; the directives are manifestly inappropriate; the directives are not compatible with the patient's medical condition. There is no time limit on the validity of advance directives. They are to be written in concordance with a model elaborated by the French superior health authority. This model takes into account the person's knowledge (or not) of having a serious illness when drafting his/her advance directives. In all likelihood, physicians will be called upon to help patients elaborate their advance directives. The law also has a provision for a national registry potentially the shared medical file to be designed as a reference source to facilitate storage, accessibility and safety of advance directives. The law introduces the right to continuous deep sedation until death in three specific situations: (i) at the patient's request when the short-term prognosis is death and continuous deep sedation is the only alternative for relieving the patient's suffering or one or more otherwise uncontrollable symptoms; (ii) at the patient's request when the patient chooses to withdraw artificial life sustaining treatment and such withdrawal would be rapidly life-shortening and susceptible to cause unbearable suffering; (iii) when the patient is unable to express his/her wishes and the collegiate medical decision is to withdraw aggressive futile life-sustaining treatment; continuous deep sedation is mandatory when the patient presents signs of suffering or when the patient's suffering cannot be evaluated due to the patient's cerebral or cognitive state. The law stipulates prior control of such practices, implying the development of a new type of collegiate procedure for medical decision-making. Satisfactory application of this new law will depend greatly on the implementing decrees. It will also depend on the implementation of a genuine policy for the development of palliative care. Professional guidelines will be needed. Several issues relevant to the field of neurology remain unresolved or are introduced by the new regulations. Further in-depth reflection and research are need. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose. - The seclusion is a tool of psychiatric care of common use. Few works studied its use in emergency psychiatry unit. The purpose of our study is to determine what are factors bound to a levying of the seclusion in a service of psychiatric emergencies.
   Methods. - Our study is retrospective, descriptive on 266 episodes of seclusion for patients hospitalized under constraint, in the service of Psychiatric Emergencies of the University hospital of Saint-Etienne (France).
   Results. - The results show that the histories of psychosis (P = 0.0001), drug abuse (P = 0.0326), hospitalization in psychiatry (P = 0.0307), an age lower than 37 (P = 0.0113), a diagnosis of psychotic episode (P = 0.0023), symptoms of agitation (P = 0.0038), behavior disorders (P = 0.0012) and delusion (P < 0.0001) or maniac episode (P = 0.0006) at the beginning of the hospitalisation are connected with maintain of seclusion during the transfer in another psychiatric department. While the histories of alcohol abuse (P = 0.0001), mental pathology connected with alcohol abuse (P = 0.0326), suicide attempt (P = 0.0275), an age higher than 41 years (P= 0.0113), a diagnosis of disorders connected with a psychoactive substances abuse (P = 0.0023) or personality disorders (P = 0.0014), auto-aggressive behavior (P = 0.0013), behavior problems linked to drug abuse (P = 0.0014) and depressive symptoms (P = 0.0006) are bound to a levying of the seclusion in the psychiatric emergencies. The patients for whom the seclusion is maintained in the unit are more quickly transferred towards another unit and their average duration of stay is lower than those for which seclusion is raised in the psychiatric emergency unit (P = 0.0007). Our study highlights that seclusion was used within two different frameworks: on the one hand in management of mental chronic disease requiring care with long course (Patient whose seclusion is maintained) and on the other hand for the care of the patients having a profile of "crisis" and for which seclusion is more easily raised.
   Conclusions. - Our results thus allow the clinician to determine with more objectivity, at the beginning of the hospitalisation in the psychiatric emergencies unit, if the whole of the clinical situation could be managed in the unit, in a few days ("crisis" or "psychiatric emergencies") or if an early orientation towards a general psychiatry unit must be done ("psychiatry in emergency"). It seems to be important to be able to carry on this type of studies so as to support a clinical reflexion on the rational and reasoned use of seclusion in the emergency care, and thus to decrease of it the use by reconsidering the care in particular around the problem of management of violence in practice psychiatric.

   ILLNESS; ORIGIN; SCALE; STATE
AB Background: Despite extensive research recently focused on mixed mania, it is uncertain as how best to define it clinically, psychometrically (which has major bearing on its prevalence), and the methodology needed for future research. This topic is also of historical interest, because Magnan (1890) [Magnan, V., 1890. La Folie Intermittente. G Masson, Paris.] suggested that "combined [mixed] states" linked Falret's "circular insanity" with Baillarger's "dual insanity" (both described in 1854). This work eventually led to the Kraepelinian synthesis of all manic, mixed, and depressive states into the unitary rubric of "manic-depressive insanity (1899/1921).
   Method: EPIMAN-II Thousand" (EPIMAN-II MILLE) is a French national collaborative study, which involved training 317 psychiatrists working in different sites representative of psychiatric practice in France. We recruited 1090 patients hospitalized for acute DSM-IV mania. assessed at index admission by the following measures: the Mania Rating Scale (MRS), the Beigel-Murphy Scale (MSRS), a newly derived checklist of depressive symptoms least contaminated by mania, MADRS for severity of depression, and the SAPS for psychotic features.
   Results: The rate of mixed mania, as defined by at least 2 depressive symptoms, was 30%. Even with this broad definition, we found significantly higher female representation. This clinical sub-type of mania was characterized by high frequency of past diagnostic errors, particularly those of anxiety and personality disorders. Refined definition of co-exiting depression was obtained from an abbreviated version of the MADRS (6 items), with distinct "emotional-cognitive" symptoms, and "psychomotor inhibition" factors, both of which were separable from an "irritable" factor linked to lability and poor judgment. Mixed mania was psychometrically best identified by a MADRS score of 6 (80% sensitivity, 94% specificity) and validated by a mixed polarity of first episodes, a higher rate of recurrence, psychotic features, and suicide attempts.
   Limitation: Cross-sectional study.
   Conclusions: The data deriving from EPIMAN, the largest and only national study ever conducted on mania, provide definitive characterization of the clinical and psychotic structure of mixed mania, which accounts for 1 out of 3 patients who present with mania. This figure is more accurate than higher rates reported in the literature because, in describing "mixity"; we eliminated depressive features that could be contaminated by mania. Despite the prominent affective features described herein, the bipolar nature of mixed mania is often missed, with the result that these patients are diagnosed as having anxiety and/or personality disorders. It is of great public health significance for psychiatrists to recognize the bipolar nature of this condition that has been known as a major phase of manic-depressive illness since at least Magnan, a disciple of Falret and Baillarger.

AB Introduction. - The French Mental Health Act was reformed by the law of July 5th 2011, adding new and useful tools in the therapeutic management of the mentally ill, such as the possibility of involuntary admission to a psychiatric ward in case of an "imminent danger" and involuntary psychiatric treatment in outpatient settings. In France, these measures concern over 100,000 hospital stays a year. We wished to test the hypothesis that there is no statistical distinction between groups of patients with different types of admission orders.
   Material and methods. - We designed an observational, retrospective, single-centre study. Inclusions in the sample concerned all adults (aged 18 or above) involuntarily admitted to the specialised psychiatric centre of the Sarthe county between November 1st 2013 and October 31st 2014. A single follow-up took place 60 days after the admission order had been pronounced and included data extracted from administrative and medical files.
   Results. - For the purpose of the study, each new admission was treated as a new "case". Thus, 510 cases have been included in the main sample: 342 admitted upon a third persons' application (67.1%), 115 for imminent danger (22.5%) and 53 upon the state's representative decision (10.4%). Follow-up data showed the average duration of involuntary treatment to be significantly higher between the first two groups, 31.8 vs. 26.1 days respectively (p = 0.03). The state's representative group shared distinct clinical characteristics (p <= 0.05) in terms of sex-ratio, initial application setting, length of involuntary treatment and hospital stay, as well as diagnosis, history of suicide attempt, rate of judicial hearings and care programming upon discharge from hospital.
   Discussion. - Our initial hypothesis was rejected. The type of measure was indeed significantly associated with different outcomes 60 days after admission. As was the case in other recent studies, the "imminent danger" group made up a significant part of the sample, highlighting its usefulness in emergency settings. This subgroup benefited from shorter hospital stays and had a significant tendency to see their admission order revoked at an earlier stage than in the case of a third party's application. This suggests that the incapacity to consent to treatment is less likely to last in the "imminent danger" group, although overall clinical characteristics are shared with the "third party" sub-sample. On the contrary, the combined "state's representative decision" group differed significantly from the rest of the sample on clinical grounds, especially a higher prevalence of psychotic disorders and a lower one for mood disorders. This could contribute to the higher rate of outpatient care programmes.
   Conclusion. - Our study points out some of the differences involving admission groups in psychiatric centers and is coherent with previous findings. However, given its single-centre approach and the notorious disparity of clinical practices over the national territory, it would be useful to include larger, nationwide samples, in order to assess the new Health Act's impact and to guide future public health decisions.

AB Background Previous trials have shown that pridopidine might reduce motor impairment in patients with Huntington's disease. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether higher doses of pridopidine than previously tested reduce motor symptoms in a dose-dependent manner while maintaining acceptable safety and tolerability.
   Methods PRIDE-HD was a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2, dose-ranging study in adults (aged >= 21 years) with Huntington's disease at outpatient clinics in 53 sites across 12 countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA). Eligible patients had clinical onset after age 18 years, 36 or more cytosine-adenine-guanine repeats in the huntingtin gene, motor symptoms (Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score [UHDRS-TMS] >= 25 points), and reduced independence (UHDRS independence score <= 90%). Patients were randomly assigned (1: 1: 1: 1: 1) with centralised interactive-response technology to receive one of four doses of pridopidine (45, 67.5, 90, or 112.5 mg) or placebo orally twice a day for 52 weeks. Randomisation was stratified within centres by neuroleptic drug use. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in the UHDRS-TMS from baseline to 26 weeks, which was assessed in all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment (full analysis set). Participants and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2013-001888-23) and ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT02006472).
   Findings Between Feb 13, 2014, and July 5, 2016, 408 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive placebo (n=82) or pridopidine 45 mg (n=81), 67.5 mg (n=82), 90 mg (n=81), or 112.5 mg (n=82) twice daily for 26 weeks. The full analysis set included 397 patients (81 in the placebo group, 75 in the 45 mg group, 79 in the 67.5 mg group, 81 in the 90 mg group, and 81 in the 112.5 mg group). Pridopidine did not significantly change the UHDRS-TMS at 26 weeks compared with placebo at any dose. The most frequent adverse events across all groups were diarrhoea, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, falls, headache, insomnia, and anxiety. The most common treatment-related adverse events were insomnia, diarrhoea, nausea, and dizziness. Serious adverse events occurred in the pridopidine groups only and were most frequently falls (n=5), suicide attempt (n= 4), suicidal ideation (n=3), head injury (n=3), and aspiration pneumonia (n=3). No new safety or tolerability concerns emerged in this study. One death in the pridopidine 112.5 mg group due to aspiration pneumonia was considered to be possibly related to the study drug.
   Interpretation Pridopidine did not improve the UHDRS-TMS at week 26 compared with placebo and, thus, the results of secondary or tertiary analyses in previous trials were not replicated. A potentially strong placebo effect needs to be ruled out in future studies.

   Melancholia; Psychological pain; Suicide
ID MENTAL PAIN
AB Psychological pain has been a major clinical concept in French psychiatry since the beginning of the 19th century. Pain is currently defined as an unpleasant emotional and sensorial experience, which can have a real or potential physiological cause and which may result from a number of factors including either a disease process, suffering, or causing pain behaviors. Nonetheless, pain without physical pain has continued to baffle the medical community and practitioners, particularly given the apparent lack of physiological signs in brain tissue. Some of France's prodigious medical minds have tackled this question over the years. Pierre-Jean-Georges Cabanis, greatly influenced psychiatric thinking with his distinction between the physical and psychological ("moral" in French) dimensions of mental pathologies. He defined the psychological dimension as a combination of sensations, perceptions and impressions from which thoughts are formed. Others, such as Laurent Cerise, described the moral dimension as being composed of intellectual and emotional thought processes, which predated the modern-day understanding of cognitive processes. As far as we know today, the concept of psychological pain (douleur morale) has been developed by Joseph Guislain; he even proposed that the causes of insanity are a blend of cerebral, intellectual and psychological aspects, of which psychological pain could be the root cause. Later, Jules Seglas helped to reinforce the link between psychological pain and melancholia, by proposing that the non-delirious form of melancholia is a direct result of extreme psychological pain, which invades all aspects of the individual's consciousness. A relationship between the intensity of psychological pain and suicidal tendencies was thus established by the end of the 19th century. For Henri Ey, psychological pain is almost the foundation of melancholia sickness. These days, modern French nosography evokes psychological pain in the description of certain depressive disorders. However, International classifications such as the DSM-5 and ICD-10 do not qualify psychological pain as diagnostic criteria for depression (nor as a specifier for melancholic features), yet there are indeed references to "clinically significant distress" in major depressive episodes, and suicidal thinking linked to emotional states perceived as unending and excruciatingly painful. Consequently, these varying levels of conceptualization of psychological pain may have impeded its acceptance within the international psychiatric community as a distinct concept with its own well-defined specification. Nevertheless, recent literature research has shown an emergence of similar notions, including psychological suffering, moral pain, psychache, psychological pain, emotional pain, psychic pain, or mental pain. It now appears critical on an international scale to develop a clear definition for psychological pain in order to develop common ground for future research and, perhaps most importantly, to better understand suicidal tendencies in psychiatric patients, young and old alike. And finally, with the rapid development of modern neuro-science and brain imaging, scientists may now be capable of demystifying this subjective experience of psychological pain through objective data - thus rendering "visible" what was up to now "invisible" (Michel Foucault).

AB Only few clinical epidemidlogic studies have been conducted on social phobia in France to date. It is however a frequent disorder, with often severe alteration of social adaptation and quality of life, and for which effective treatments exist Thus, it seems really important to further explore how these patients are nowadays identified and treated in psychiatry. It was the objective of the Phoenix study. In this observational multi-center study, 952 psychiatric in- or out-patients, with a primary diagnosis of social phobia according to DSM IV criteria, were included. Numerous diagnostic and psychometric evaluations were carried out, in order to evaluate the comorbidity (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), the intensity of social anxiety (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale), and various aspects of the functional and emotional impact (Various Impact of Social Anxiety scale, Sheehan Disability Scale, SF-36, Positive and Negative Emotionality scale). The patients were in majority females (57.6%), with a mean age 37.5 years, and with a mean duration of social anxiety disorder. 12.5 years. The mean scores of social anxiety on Liebowitz scale was 40.3 +/- 12.6 for the fear factor, and 38.3 +/- 13.6 for the avoidance factor. The generalized social anxiety subtype (anxiety in most social situations) was present in 67.8% of the patients. A major depressive disorder was found in 47.7% of the sample, and the prevalence of agoraphobia was even higher (49.2%). As known in clinical practice and in other studies, the prevalence rates of current alcohol dependence and substances abuse were also important In this population (respectively 10.6% and 12.7%). Mean scores of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) sub-scales were 13.9 +/- 3.8 for anxiety and 9.1 +/- 4.5 for depression. About 15% of the patients had a history of suicide attempt, and a suicidal risk was present in nearly 40% of the sample. The psychosocial impact and the alteration of quality of life (with especially a poor physical health perception) were very significant, in the family, educational or occupational and social domains. Mean scores of the Sheehan Disability Scale were 6.1 +/- 2.6 for professional impairment, 5.0 +/- 2.7 for familial impairment, and 6.6 +/- 2.3 for social life impairment. In addition to the disability due to social phobia intensity, an important part of the burden was due to depressive symptoms. Approximately 60% of the patients had already a psychiatric treatment at the time of the survey (since 1,7 years in average), but only 17% had a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and 48% had an antidepressant treatment. These proportions increased in a significant way after the consultation during which the investigation was carried out: an antidepressant was prescribed to 72% of the patients, and a CBT is proposed to 48%. On the whole, this study confirmed the severity and the morbidity of social phobia in a very large sample of French psychiatric patients. The depressive disorders, suicidal risk, and social impairment associated with this condition should incite to more detect and treat it. Seeing the long duration of the disease in our sample, and the lack of specific therapies in many cases, the identification and the treatment of social phobia must be improved, and the role of the psychiatrists in this process seems very important.

AB Introduction. - International studies estimate the incidence of pathological gambling among adults at 0.2-3%. Following the lead of Anglo-Saxon countries, France has only just begun to consider this "new" addiction in studying its own population of pathological gamblers, attempting to understand the causes of the illness, and proposing specific treatments.
   Objective. - The purpose of this study was to carry out a multiaxial assessment of French pathological gamblers, current or former outpatients of the addiction ambulatory care center of the University Hospital of Nantes, in order to compare our findings with those of the international literature.
   Method. - During a single personal interview, the participants filled in a set of questionnaires including a description of gambling characteristics (pathological gambling section in the DSM-IV, South Oaks Gambling Screen, gambling history), a screening for axis I (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview) and II (structured clinical interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders), comorbidities and personality tests using a dimensional approach (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, Sensation Seeking Scale, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, Toronto Alexithymia Scale). The number of subjects to include was not previously calculated, since the size of the sample depended upon each subject's availability and on the inclusion time period limited to 4 months. Continuous variables were described in terms of means and standard deviations, while categorical variables were described in terms of percentages. The protocol was accepted by the Advisory Committee for the Protection of Biomedical Research Subjects.
   Results. - Analysis of the findings was based on a sample of 24 subjects. Half of the subjects fell into severe pathological gambling. Gambling had started at an average age of 24.9 years (S.D. = 12.3). The gambling problem appeared on average 9.4 years later (S.D. = 8.1). Casinos (41.7%) and sports pools (45.8%) were the most commonly reported types of games. Seventy-five percent of the sample suffered from at least one axis I psychiatric comorbidity. Most common among these were current (20.9%) and past (37.5%) episodes of major depression. Risk of suicide was observed in 36% of subjects, and nearly half of them were not currently suffering from an episode of major depression. The second most common psychiatric comorbidity was substance abuse (including alcohol) (54.2%). Personality disorders were common (54.2%) and mainly cluster B disorders (29.2%). Impulsiveness and alexithymia scores were above average, unlike sensation seeking scores.
   Conclusions. - The results go along the same lines as those mentioned in the international literature and show how important it is to carry out multidimensional assessments within the context of pathological gambling, since comorbidities are such a burden. This study brings to light several perspectives. It would be interesting to repeat the assessment using a much larger sample. We plan to study those factors that influence the emergence of pathological gambling, and the initiation of specific treatments for pathological gamblers. Upon completion, the study would allow us to propose the treatment that is best suited to each gambler's profile. (C) L'Encephale, Paris, 2010.

AB Terrorism and insurgence of varying magnitude at the national and international levels have continued to threaten global peace and kept most governments and communities of the world on toes. Terrorism is the use of violence against a civilian population or non-combatant group to compel government or an international organization to act or abstain from doing an act [1], [2]. The 11th September, 2001 (9/11) simultaneous attacks in US on the World Trade Centre in New York, the Pentagon in Virginia and site at Pennsylvania claiming over 3,996 lives and leaving over 6000 others injured and which brought down to rabbles one of the biggest edifices of our time and stirred the whole world out of complacency is a typical act of terrorism. This singular event more than any previous cases of terrorism has put most nations on red alert while similar affronts to human peace and comfort continue to heighten as they last in other parts of the globe[2]. For more than a decade now, terrorism and insurgence have taken the nations of the world by storm. What started as pockets of disaffection and protests reactions at different parts of the world has assumed unimaginable sophistication and startling dimensions. The bombing and sinking of British Palestine Ship at Haifa killing 267 persons on board and Leaving 172 injured in 1940 and the poisoning of bread for prisoners in Camp Stalag 13, Germany in 1946 where 148 persons died and 124 injured [3], are nothing to compare with the 9/11 attack. The hijacking of planes and detonating of bombs by suicide bombers killing themselves and their unsuspecting victims in aircrafts, trains and train platforms, parks and garages, churches, market places, hotels, night clubs, cinema houses and even hospitals and schools where our young go to learn to improve the quality of humanity is an unparalleled dimension of terrorism[3],[2]. The Beslan school hostage in Russia in September 1-3, 2004 where 385 persons died and 783 were injured; the multiple bombing in London, United Kingdom in 2005 where 65 people died and over 700 were injured; Peshawar School attack in Pakistan in December, 2014 where 170 persons died and un-estimated number injured, and the abduction of 300 school girls in Chibok, Nigeria and taken to unknown destination since 2014 as well as the coordinated attack on Paris and St Denis, France in November 13, 2015, killing 130 persons and leaving hundreds injured is not only a clear indication of extreme radicalization of local affairs but an attempt to annihilate the world. As a matter of fact, peace is eluding many nations of the world including Nigeria [4],[5]. Of a truth, peace is eluding the whole world. Peace is when people are able to resolve conflicts without violence and can work together to improve the quality of their lives; when everyone live in safety, without fear or threat of violence and no form of violence is tolerated[6]. If this definition of peace is true then no nation today is at peace with itself thus making the concern in this study more compelling.

AB Psychiatric disorders (more specifically mood disorders and psychosis) represent the 1st cause of disability among young people. Unemployment rate between 75 to 95% for the person with schizophrenia. It is correlated to poor social integration and bad economic status, worse symptomatology loss of autonomy as well as global bad functioning. It is responsible of more than half of the overall cost of psychosis. The onset of most of psychiatric disorders occur between the age of 25 and 35 years old, a critical time in young adult life when they should build their professional as well as social future. Without appropriate care, young adult are unable to build satisfactory emotional relationships, continue their studies, live independently or fit into life. They are frequently dependent on their environment. They also have an increased suicide rate and frequent comorbid substance abuse. Despite this context, their care pathway is often marked by a delay or premature stop of care, drug treatments not always suitable and a lack of specific relay post-hospitalization regarding continuity of professional training or studies. All factors impacting future employability of adolescents. Furthermore they spend most of their time in school and school plays a key part in an individual's development including peer relationships, social interactions, academic attainment, cognitive progress, emotional control, behavioral expectations and physical and moral development. These areas are also reciprocally affected by mental illness. The initial phases of FEP are characterized by impaired academic performance, change in social behaviors and increasing absences from school, reflecting the prodrome of the illness that leads to disengagement from education. Functional decline often precedes onset of clinical symptoms and many adolescents and young adults are therefore isolated from school before their illness is recognized. School support staff may fail to recognize those who are functionally impaired because of evolving FEP although school is a key setting for promoting positive mental health, fostering resilience, detecting and responding to emerging mental ill health. So, people with psychotic illness have low levels of secondary school completion. School dropout has been defined as leaving education without obtaining a minimal credential, most often a higher secondary education diploma. In France, the school is compulsory up to the age of 16. Consequences are significant: among young people without a degree out of initial training for one to four years and present on the labour market, 47% are unemployed. School dropout depends on a number of factors, including grades, family and social environment and the relationship with the school, but also the emergence of psychiatric disorders. For first episode psychotic patients, age of onset, lack of family support, longer duration of psychosis, levels of premorbid global functioning and education, negative and cognitive symptoms, addictions, depressive comorbidities and stigma plays an important role in school dropout. However, young adults have historically received less treatment than expected considering prevalence of mental illness at that age. In the last few decades, early intervention programs for psychosis have been developed all around the world in order to promote rehabilitation and prevent long-term disabilities.
   Early intervention programs focus on the special needs of young people and their families and engage in some form of assertive community treatment, which attempts to treat patients in the community rather than using inpatient services. For early intervention in psychosis programs, the goal is to keep patients engaged with treatment, prevent them from further psychotic episodes and hospitalizations and promote rehabilitation. The additional services of an early intervention program include staff specialized in psychosis treatment, family/group/individual counseling sessions, assertive case management, and low-dose second generation anti-psychotics. In these programs, psychiatric rehabilitation practitioners already use individual counseling and supported education programs (SEd) to improve postsecondary educational outcomes. The goals of SEd are for individuals with serious mental illness to successfully be able to set and achieve an educational goal (e.g., training certificate or degree), to improve educational competencies (literacy, study skills, time management), to navigate the educational environment (e.g., applications, financial assistance), and to improve motivation toward completing educational goals. These approaches are often combined with efforts to support transitions to sustainable employment. Current evidence of these interventions are weak with limited information on specific difficulties experienced by young adults with FEP in educational tasks. Adaptive strategies are needed by young adults with FEP to succeed in educational settings but most studies do not explore it with rigorous methodology. However, common SEd components emerge: specialized and dedicated staffing, one-on-one and group skill-building activities, assistance with navigating the academic setting and coordinating different services, and linkages with mental health counseling. Continued specification, and testing of SEd core components are still needed. It is important that occupational therapy researchers and practitioners develop, and evaluate effective interventions to improve education outcomes for young adults with FEP. The objective of this work is to define school dropout, assess causes and consequences of FEP. How to help young people to maintain education? We will detail measures to support the academic re-insertion in France. (C) 2017 L'Encephale, Paris.

TI Association of Hysteroscopic vs Laparoscopic Sterilization With
   Procedural, Gynecological, and Medical Outcomes EDITORIAL COMMENT
SO OBSTETRICAL & GYNECOLOGICAL SURVEY
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB The main types of female sterilization in developed countries are laparoscopic and hysteroscopic sterilization. Approximately 1 million women worldwide have undergone the hysteroscopic procedure. In 2015, the safety of hysteroscopic sterilization was questioned following complaints reported to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by a large number of women who had received hysteroscopic sterilization. Complaints reported included adverse gynecological results such as pelvic pain, perforation of fallopian tubes or uterus, and unwanted pregnancy in addition to general symptoms such as allergy, tiredness, and depression. Similar adverse events were also reported in France-the country with the second largest number of women using this method after the United States-and other countries. As a consequence of these safety concerns, 4 recent studies compared procedural and gynecological outcomes between hysteroscopic and laparoscopic sterilization; however, none of these examined nongynecological outcomes.
   This cohort study compared the risk of reported adverse events between hysteroscopic and laparoscopic sterilization. Data were obtained from the French national hospital discharge database and health insurance claim database. Women included in the study had undergone a first hysteroscopic or laparoscopic sterilization between 2010 and 2014 and were between 30 and 54 years old. Adverse events were compared using inverse probability of treatment-weighted Cox models and included the following: risks of procedural complications (surgical and medical) and of gynecological (sterilization failure that includes salpingectomy, second sterilization procedure, or pregnancy; reoperation) and medical outcomes (allergic reactions; autoimmune diseases; thyroid disorders; use of analgesics, antimigraine medications, antidepressants, benzodiazepines; outpatient visits; sickness absence; suicide attempts; death) that occurred within 1 and 3 years after sterilization. To account for differences between the comparison groups, multivariate models were used, adjusting for baseline covariates including medical history and medication use, and weighted for inverse probability of treatment using a propensity score.
   Of 110,299 women who met inclusion criteria, 105,357 (95.5%) were included in the final analysis: 71,303 (67.7%) underwent hysteroscopic, and 34,054 (32.3%) underwent laparoscopic sterilization. Multivariable analysis showed that the risk of surgical complications was lower for hysteroscopic sterilization than laparoscopic sterilization (0.13% vs 0.78%; adjusted risk difference [aRD], -0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.67 to -0.60); the risk of medical complications was also lower (0.06% vs 0.11%; aRD, -0.05; 95% CI, -0.08 to -0.01). Hysteroscopic sterilization during the first year was associated with a significantly higher risk of sterilization failure (4.83% vs 0.69%; adjusted hazard ratio, 7.11; 95% CI, 5.92-8.54; aRD, 4.23 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 3.40-5.22). In addition, the requirement for gynecological reoperation after 1 year was higher for hysteroscopic sterilization compared with laparoscopic sterilization (5.65% vs 1.7%; adjusted hazard ratio, 3.26; 95% CI, 2.90-3.67; aRD, 4.63 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 3.38-4.75); although attenuated, these differences persisted after 3 years. The risk of pregnancy was lower for hysteroscopic sterilization within the first year, but was not by the third year (adjusted HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83-1.30; aRD, 0.01 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, -0.04 to 0.07). Hysteroscopic sterilization was not associated with an increased risk of medical outcomes over 1 or 3 years, as compared with laparoscopic sterilization.
   These findings show, in a population of women undergoing first sterilization, a significantly higher risk of gynecological complications over 1 and 3 years with use of hysteroscopic sterilization compared with laparoscopic sterilization. The data do not support an increased risk of medical outcomes with use of hysteroscopic sterilization.

AB Introduction. - For over 20 years, the unit of transsexualism of Foch Hospital receives requests for sex reassignment surgery (SRS). The requests are evaluated during a period of at least 2 years after which a multidisciplinary committee (composed of psychiatrists, psychologists, endocrinologists and surgeons) confirm or not the diagnosis of transsexualism and the indication of hormonal and surgical treatment.
   Objective. - Assessment of the well being of patients after surgery in order to confirm the adequacy of the hormonal and surgical decision.
   Patients and method. - We surveyed retrospectively, on the basis of a self-administered questionnaire developed by us, 266 transsexuels (one third of MtF and two thirds of FtM) who did the surgery from 1991 to 2009 after a psychiatric evaluation in Foch hospital. The questionnaire inquires the social, familial, sexual and professional life of each patient, as well as their mental and physical state after surgery.
   Results. - We collected data on 207 individuals (78%), but three are dead. In this population, there is a high rate of professional activity (85%), 90.5% of FtM against 73% of MtF. Only 9.5% of FtM are professionally inactive against 27% of MtF. Seventy-two percent of FtM have a high level of education (high school diploma or higher) against 55% of MtF. FtM (63.5%) live more often in families compared to MtF (40%). MtF live mainly alone (55%). Thirty percent of the FtM are married against 10% of MtF. The majority of FtM are sharing their lives with a partner, 61.5% against 41% of MtF. Most of FtM become fathers thanks to a sperm donation and few by adoption. Many of them are raising the children of their partners. The social life of the patients has generally improved for both groups except for some MtF (10%) who broke off the relationship with their families and friends. Sex life has improved for 73% of MtF and for 56% of FtM, this due to a small number of FtM who practiced a phalloplasty surgery (40%) or an insertion of an erectile prosthesis (24%). Eighty-six percent consider themselves in a good physical and mental health. The mortality rate is low: 1.5%. Two people died of cancer and one committed suicide (0.5%). In majority, patients (92.5%) profit from a medical follow-up by an endocrinologist (66.5%), or by a general practitioner (26%) and/or by a psychiatrist or a psychologist (8%). The rate of psychiatric morbidity after surgery is of 3% and the use of toxic is of 2%, both concerning only FtM. Seven percent of FtM were pursued bylaw. Sixty percent of the patients are satisfied with the surgery, 25% are dissatisfied and 15% have an ambivalent opinion. Seventy-one percent of the patients attribute their dissatisfaction to an insufficient result from an aesthetic point of view and 46% from a functional point of view. About 83.5% of the patients officially changed their sex in their civil status, 14.5% are still in process. Two patients (MtF) have never asked for a change of their civil status because of their deep regret of the SRS. One of them has also asked to return to his sex of birth. Ninety-five percent of patients do not express any regret. About 4.5% felt some regret given the results of the surgery.
   Conclusion. - The majority of patients express a sexual and psychological well being after surgery. However, a greater number of FtM are satisfied with their social and family life, whereas a greater number of MtF is satisfied with the result of the surgery and their sexual life.

AB Background Although subthalamic stimulation is a recognised treatment for motor complications in Parkinson's disease, reports on behavioural outcomes are controversial, which represents a major challenge when counselling candidates for subthalamic stimulation. We aimed to assess changes in behaviour in patients with Parkinson's disease receiving combined treatment with subthalamic stimulation and medical therapy over a 2-year follow-up period as compared with the behavioural evolution under medical therapy alone.
   Methods We did a parallel, open-label study (EARLYSTIM) at 17 surgical centres in France (n=8) and Germany (n=9). We recruited patients with Parkinson's disease who were disabled by early motor complications. Participants were randomly allocated (1: 1) to either medical therapy alone or bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy. The primary outcome was mean change in quality of life from baseline to 2 years. A secondary analysis was also done to assess behavioural outcomes. We used the Ardouin Scale of Behavior in Parkinson's Disease to assess changes in behaviour between baseline and 2-year follow-up. Apathy was also measured using the Starkstein Apathy Scale, and depression was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory. The secondary analysis was done in all patients recruited. We used a generalised estimating equations (GEE) regression model for individual items and mixed model regression for subscores of the Ardouin scale and the apathy and depression scales. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00354133. The primary analysis has been reported elsewhere; this report presents the secondary analysis only.
   Findings Between July, 2006, and November, 2009, 251 participants were recruited, of whom 127 were allocated medical therapy alone and 124 were assigned bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy. At 2-year follow-up, the levodopa-equivalent dose was reduced by 39% (-363.3 mg/day [SE 41.8]) in individuals allocated bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy and was increased by 21% (245.8 mg/day [40.4]) in those assigned medical therapy alone (p<0.0001). Neuropsychiatric fluctuations decreased with bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy during 2-year follow-up (mean change -0.65 points [SE 0.15]) and did not change with medical therapy alone (-0.02 points [0.15]); the between-group difference in change from baseline was significant (p=0.0028). At 2 years, the Ardouin scale subscore for hyperdopaminergic behavioural disorders had decreased with bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy (mean change -1.26 points [SE 0.35]) and had increased with medical therapy alone (1.12 points [0.35]); the between-group difference was significant (p<0.0001). Mean change from baseline at 2 years in the Ardouin scale subscore for hypodopaminergic behavioural disorders, the Starkstein Apathy Scale score, and the Beck Depression Inventory score did not differ between treatment groups. Antidepressants were stopped in 12 patients assigned bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy versus four patients allocated medical therapy alone. Neuroleptics were started in nine patients assigned medical therapy alone versus one patient allocated bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy. During the 2-year follow-up, two individuals assigned bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy and one patient allocated medical therapy alone died by suicide.
   Interpretation In a large cohort with Parkinson's disease and early motor complications, better overall behavioural outcomes were noted with bilateral subthalamic stimulation plus medical therapy compared with medical therapy alone. The presence of hyperdopaminergic behaviours and neuropsychiatric fluctuations can be judged additional arguments in favour of subthalamic stimulation if surgery is considered for disabling motor complications.

AB Background. - Health care seeking for a problematic use of cannabis is in progress in France.
   Objectives. - The aim is to assess the addictive and psychiatric comorbidity in cannabis users seen in the specific setting at the Lariboisiere hospital.
   Method. - Two hundred and seven cannabis users were included from January 2004 to December 2009. Twelve-month and lifetime diagnosis of abuse and dependence (cannabis, alcohol, cocaine/crack) (DSM-IV), current and lifetime mood disorders, anxiety disorders, eating disorders and psychotic disorders were assessed (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview). Logistic regression analyses identified adjusted odds ratios associated with the gender and the health care seeking (P=0.01).
   Results. - One hundred and forty-seven men (71%) and 60 women (29%), 29.3 +/- 8.6 years (15.2-51.6 years). Most of the outpatients ask for health care themselves (59.7%), whereas 19.4% are asked to seek health care by relatives (19.4%) or because of an academic, health or justice injunction (20.4%). In total, 49.3% of the outpatients are single, 35.7% are cohabitating, 9.3% are married and 6.3% are separated/divorced. About 20.4% of the outpatients are students, 35.7% have a professional activity, 19% are jobless, 2.4% are impaired, 0.5% are retired, at home and 12.1% do not have an official income. Twelve-month and lifetime prevalence of abuse/dependence are: cannabis (10.1/82.1% and 8.7/88.4%), alcohol (9.7/8.7% and 19.3/18.8%), cocaine/crack (2.4/3.4% and 4.8/11.6%). The mean duration of cannabis dependence for the current dependent users is 8.4 +/- 5,8 years. The mean number of "joints" during the last 6 months is 6 +/- 4.3, the mean amount of canridbis per week is 12.5 +/- 11.3 g. About 51.3% of the dependent users report externalized and/or internalized disorders at school during childhood and adolescence. In total, 19.4% of the dependent users have a suicide attempt history and 18.9% have a psychiatric hospitalisation history, more frequently women (P < 0.01 and P = 0.02). About 73.8% have a psychologist or psychiatrist care history. In total, 38.1% of users have at least one current mood disorder, females more frequently than males (P < 0.001). Current and lifetime prevalence of mood disorders are: major depressive disorder (MDD) (29.1% and 57.1%); current dysthymia (20.3%); hypomania (1.9 and 6.7%); mania (2.9 and 12.8%). Females have more frequently than males current and lifetime MDD (P < 0.001). About 53.2% of users have at least one current anxiety disorder, females more frequently than males (P < 0.001). Current and lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders are: panic disorder (10 and 16.4%); agoraphobia (13.9 and 17.4%); social phobia (26.9 and 32.8%); obsessive-compulsive disorder (9.5 and 12.9%); post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (6.5 and 16.4%); current generalized anxiety disorder (26.8%). Females have more frequently current and lifetime: agoraphobia (P=0.01 and P < 0.001); PTSD (P < 0.001); current social phobia (P = 0.049). Current and lifetime eating disorders prevalence are: anorexia (0 and 1.5%); bulimia (4 and 8%); females more frequently have bulimia (P=0.02 and P <0.001). In total, 4.8% have a psychotic disorder. Adjusted odds ratios of associated variables to gender (women/men) are lifetime MDD OR =4.71 [2.1-10.61] (P < 0.001) and later age of onset of cannabis abuse OR = 1.1 [1.04-1.17] (P=0.002). Adjusted odds ratios associated with personal health care seeking compared to a non personal motivated health care seeking are the numbers of criteria of 12-month cannabis dependence OR = 1.26 [1.06-1.51] (P=0.009) and age OR =1.07 [1.03-1.12] (P =0.002).
   Conclusion.- Our survey confirms the high mood and anxiety disorders comorbidity in cannabis dependent users seen in a specific setting and underlines the need to evaluate those disorders. (C) L'Encephale, Paris, 2014.

AB Introduction - The main therapeutic objective for depression is remission (absence of clinical signs of the disorder and low scores on assessment scales), yet partial remission rates remain high (insufficient criteria for diagnosing the disorder while clinically and psychometrically assessable symptoms continue to linger. The presence of residual symptoms is associated with a higher relapse rate of depression, occurring up to 5 times earlier, an increased suicide rate, significant use of healthcare services and a marked social impairment The most frequently reported symptoms are specific to depression, i.e. anxiety and irritability, depressed mood, feelings of guilt and loss of interest in activities, asthenia and difficulty falling asleep at night. Residual symptoms constitute a valid and reliable clinical marker of prognosis (especially for relapse and chronicity) and must be treated with specific therapeutic strategies. Studies on depression with residual symptoms are few and mainly focus on populations of hospitalized patients or those with a severe form of depression. Since little work has been done with regard to patients monitored on an outpatient basis, we felt it was appropriate to select a population of depressed patients from private psychiatric practice. Our main objective was to analyze the frequency of residual symptoms after 8 to 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment and to study the clinical and socio-demographic characteristics of these subjects. Design - 1 790 patients who had presented with one major depressive episode per DSM IV criteria and who had been receiving antidepressant treatment for 8 to 12 weeks were included and evaluated. 463 private psychiatrists practicing in metropolitan France were randomly selected and stratified by region and sex ratio (30 % female and 70 % male) to obtain a sample as representative as possible of the French psychiatrist population. The following were measured and assessed: anthropometric and socio-demographic characteristics, the history of depression, a description of the last major depressive episode, a description of its management, current clinical variables, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score, the physician's assessment of residual symptoms, and a description of the patient's management on the day of the appointment. Results - Following acute treatment, evaluation of depressive symptoms on the Hamilton scale showed that 549 (32 %) of subjects had a score below 8; 792 patients (46.7 %) had a score between 8 and 18; and 354 (20 %) had a score above 18. Patients in the first group (HDRS < 8) who were considered to be in remission started treatment early (x(2) = 18.28, DOF= 4, p < 0.01) for a first episode (51.3 %) with a low number of initial symptoms x(2) = 27.03, DOF = 6, p < 0.01). The evaluators found persistent depressogenic factors (x(2) = 15.9, DOF = 2, p < 0.01) and significant psychiatric co-morbidity (x(2) = 18.28, DOF= 4, p < 0.01) in subjects in partial remission (HDRS between 8 and 18). The non-responders (HDRS > 18) presented a history of more depressive episodes 2 = 17.04, DOF = 4, p < 0.01) and a delay of more than 30 days before treatment was initiated (x(2) = 18.2, DOF = 4, p < 0.01). With regard to the nature of residual symptoms, at least 50 % of subjects in partial remission were very symptomatic for depressive mood (65.4 %), psychic anxiety (56.6 %), and loss of interest and time away from work (49.4 %). Indicators of severe depression (early morning insomnia, psychomotor retardation, agitation, hypochondriasis, weight loss and lack of awareness
   Conclusion - These results illustrate three important points. First, a significant percentage (46.7 %) of patients who responded to treatment subsequent to the acute period presented with residual symptoms. Second, these symptoms are included in the areas of, depressed mood - psychic anxiety,. Third, a delay in initiating treatment seems to have an effect on response. These results confirm the need to develop strategies to screen for these residual forms of depression, as well as specific methods to treat them.

AB Introduction. - Despite recent legislation favouring home treatment services, international literature contrasts with its development in France, where those programs stay rare. They were implemented since the deinstitutionalization movement of the 1970s, to provide care to severe mentally ill outpatients, who used to stay in long-term inpatient wards. Those home treatment programs can be divided in two groups: Assertive Community Treatment and crisis interventions teams.
   Objectives. - This article first aims to describe those two types of programs, and then to review their evidence level. Finally, we will discuss the actual controversy about effectiveness of home treatment.
   Method. - This article is a literature review of international research about home treatment programs for adults' severe mental illness. It excluded children psychiatry, addictology and elderly psychiatry. We selected reviews and research articles taken from international publications, using a PubMed research.
   Results. - This article concerns home treatment programs, belonging to "mobile teams", which is a group of psychiatric teams including varied goals: Improving continuity of care, community assessment, avoiding admissions to psychiatric hospital, improving skills in community living, and supporting families. Those programs practice assertive outreach. Some provide care and others only assess and direct people to other services. Only the first ones are concerned by this article. We distinguish two types of home treatments: Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) and Crisis Intervention teams. Assertive Community Treatment, also named Assertive Outreach teams or Intensive Case Management, is a very well described model which aims to keep people with severe mental illness in the community. It is an intensive kind of Case Management. It is specially addressed to high services users, with frequent admissions. ACT consists in visiting people at home, providing cares and social support, developing skills to cope with daily living. It is provided by a 24-hour available multidisciplinary team, in an unlimited time. The first Stein and Test study showed benefits compared to standard treatment, but more recent trials failed in improving hospital use or clinical and social outcomes. Some even show and increased hospitalization rate. This variation can be explained by an improvement of standard care with time, and international heterogeneity. A higher fidelity to the original model could,decrease bed use. Fidelity scales have been developed to compare different programs. ACT seems to be useful to improve engagement in care for people with a high level of needs, and to maintain them in housing. Studies also show a dilution of the effectiveness of ACT in routine practice. Those results limit its implementation. The second group of home treatments is crisis intervention and home treatment teams, also called crisis assessment teams. Those teams aim to treat crisis at home for severe mentally ill people. Crisis is defined as a symptomatic exacerbation in severe mental illness. Treatment is provided by a 24 hours available multidisciplinary team which assesses the situation, directs the patient and programs a crisis intervention. The intervention is time limited, about six weeks. It helps people to resolve crisis in the community. It could avoid 50% of psychiatric admissions, without increasing readmission rates. A recent study shows it could reduce the suicide rate. It also improves satisfaction with care and engagement.
   Conclusions. - Despite the controversy, home treatment services can be useful to improve engagement in care, user's satisfaction, and to avoid psychiatric admissions. Visiting patient at home and associating social interventions with medical treatment improve bed use outcomes. Less intensive but well organized community teams can also bring benefits. In the French context, the lack of visibility,of home treatment teams can be explained by several hypotheses. We can cite the lack of systematic evaluation of care, programs, the persistence of more inpatient beds than in other countries, the difficulty to implement home treatment in rural areas or the cultural use of hospital.

AB Objectives. - The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, and to test the mediating role of hopelessness between depressive symptoms and the wish to kill oneself.
   Method. - A random sample of 1547 high school students from the department of Haute-Garonne, France, (854 girls, mean age = 16.9 +/- 1.5; 693 boys, mean age = 17.4 +/- 1.5) completed a questionnaire assessing cannabis use, the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) completed by the three items subscale measuring suicidal ideation proposed by Garrison et at. (1991) ("I felt life was not worth living"; "I felt like hurting myself"; "I felt like killing myself"). The measure of hopelessness was based on a single item, "I felt life was not worth living".
   Results. - At least occasional wish to kit( oneself were reported by 13% of boys and 14% of girls (NS). The mean CES-D score for girls was significantly higher than for boys (20.3 +/- 10.7 versus 16.7 +/- 9.9; p < 0.01). According to the cut-off score of 24, 19% of boys and 34% of girls had a moderate to severe depressive symptomatology (p < 0.0001). The mean suicidal ideation score was significantly higher in participants scoring 24 or above on the CES-D than participants scoring less than 24 (2.4 +/- 2.7 versus 0.3 +/- 0.9; p < 0.0001). Among participants with CES-D greater or equal to 24, 34% reported at least occasional wish to kill oneself versus 6% of participants with CES-D less than 24 (p < 0.0001). CES-D scores and suicidal ideation scores were moderately correlated in girls (Pearson's r = 0.59) and boys (r = 0.61) in the total sample. To explore the role of hopelessness as mediator between depressive symptoms and the wish to kit( oneself, multiple regression analyses were performed separately by gender. To establish mediation, three regression equations should be estimated and the four following conditions must hold: First, the independent variable (CES-D scores) must affect the mediator in the first equation; second, the independent variable must affect the dependent variable (the wish to kill oneself) in the second equation; third, the mediator must affect the dependent variable in the third equation regressing the dependent variable on both the independent variable and on the mediator; fourth, the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable must be less in the third equation than in the second. Among girls, in the first equation, CES-D score explained 35% of the variance of hopelessness (beta = 0.59, t = 21.5, p < 0.001). In the second equation, CES-D score explained 16% of the variance in the wish to kill oneself (beta = 0.40, t = 12.7, p < 0.001). In the third equation, CES-D and hopelessness scores explained 32% of the variance in the wish to kill oneself. Hopelessness was the main predictor (beta = 0.50, t = 14, p < 0.001) while the effect of CES-D was markedly reduced (beta = 0.10, t = 2.9, p < 0.01). Among boys, in the first equation, CES-D score explained 38% of the variance of hopelessness (beta = 0.62, t = 20.7, p < 0.001). In the second equation, CES-D score explained 25% of the variance in the wish to kill oneself (beta = 0.50, t = 15.1, p < 0.001). In the third equation, CES-D and hopelessness scores explained 47% of the variance in the wish to kill oneself. Hopelessness was the main predictor (beta = 0.60, t = 17, p < 0.001) white the effect of CES-D was substantially weakened (beta = 0.13, t = 3.6, p < 0.001).
   Discussion. - These results showed a strong association between depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation in this nonclinical sample of adolescents. According to Beck's assumption, hopelessness appeared to be a mediator between depressive symptoms and the wish to kill oneself both in boys and girls. These findings are relevant for prevention and therapy. They suggest that targeting hopelessness may be as important in adolescents as in adults to reduce suicidal ideation and prevent suicidal attempts. (C) L'Encephale, Paris, 2009.

AB This article attempts to identify and put into perspective the different approaches that could globally prevent the suffering induced by schizophrenia, from the detection of early psychosis to the impact on individual and family functioning and emotional health. Schizophrenia causes, at the community level, a number of difficult consequences and associated costs, which likely could be reduced if specific strategies, already known and documented internationally, were applied. Two areas not explored in this article: the role of medication and the issue of suicide prevention. In the scope of screening and early treatment, genetic risk, as well as the predictive ability of the clinical criteria for individuals at "ultra-high risk" of developing schizophrenia justify an increased vigilance for the detection of symptoms in order for treatment to begin earlier and to be more effective. These risk factors should not be neglected as the benefits of early management impact the course of illness and functional outcome. At this stage of the emergence of the disorder, it is difficult to systematize a therapeutic protocol. Two options are open to the clinician: "wait and watch" given the lack of a conclusive diagnosis and a more pro-active intervention, focused on the therapeutic alliance and enhancing insight and awareness. The second approach seems more productive but requires transparency with the patient and family regarding the uncertainty of the clinical situation, and an attitude that favors sharing information, along the lines of early psych education. Once a pathological stage is reached, early and accurate clinical care is fundamental. They depend heavily on access to care, proximity and availability to clinics or out-reach teams, capable of a thorough diagnostic work-up. Yet conversely, the availability for early and accurate clinical care faces obstacles which are closely related to the pejorative view of psychiatry held by the general public, health care professionals, and public officials. This poor image of psychiatry is partly due to cases of clinical decompensation, dangerous in some instances, underscoring why it is be important to understand and anticipate the contributory factors to these outcomes in the first place so as to avoid them. In this sense, defending a complacent and conciliatory approach can be counter-productive. Following developments of recent decades in other chronic diseases (diabetes, cancer, AIDS, severe heart disease...), the implementation of systematic clinical programs, treatment protocols, psycho-education to reinforce adherence to therapeutic measures, their simplification, the support and appreciation of the role of caregivers, destigmatizing due to proximity of contact, and therefore an increase in the use of care. Similarly, the systematic search for side-effects of medication and pro-actively managing to minimize their occurrence strengthen compliance, a recognized factor of relapse prevention. Preventable comorbidities, addictions, and common physical illnesses are not systematically screened (neoplastic diseases, diabetes, hypertension, dental health, gynecology...) in this population and thus also represent significant potential for a better life expectancy. The tools of psychosocial rehabilitation, unfortunately, are too infrequently used in France.
   Their goal is to improve the functional outcome of patients, a determinant of social integration and to lessen the burden shouldered by family and other carers, and ultimately to reduce exacerbations of the illness due to situations of interpersonal stress. Work has also proven its worth as a protective factor, as well as strengthening a sense of self-efficiency, of self-esteem, of empowerment, of quality of life, helping attain recovery. It is clear that not all social and health care systems are primarily geared towards these objectives, although they have at their disposal, by the means described above, strong preventive measures for relapses. Beyond the issue of the implementation of clinical programs, the existing culture would benefit from being infused with a prioritization of resource deployment, with debates of these issues regarding parity for mental health services, advocated by users, and forging a place, for example, for the intervention of "peer supports", sociologists, social workers, interested beyond the disease, in community environment, employment opportunities, and housing. Overall, this work argues for updating our conceptions of clinical care, supporting the systematic implementation of modern models of care, and expanding the scope of our concerns regarding patients' lives.

TI Can one talk of benzodiazepine "drunkenness"? About acute benzodiazepine
   intoxication, without suicidal or mortiferous tendencies
SO ENCEPHALE-REVUE DE PSYCHIATRIE CLINIQUE BIOLOGIQUE ET THERAPEUTIQUE
LA French
DT Article
DE Acute Intoxication; Drunkenness; Psychoactive substance; Benzodiazepine;
   Abuse; Dependence
ID DEPENDENCE
AB Backgrounds. - When we refer to "drunkenness", more often than not, we think of alcohol or cannabis being the instigator rather than pharmacological drugs, even if outside the toxic origins, "drunkenness" may also occur without any substance intake: one can be drunk on love, poetry, music and even mania. Benzodiazepine "drunkenness" is not a classical notion in medicine. But the concept of addictology allows one to enlarge different approaches and to consider the relationship with psychoactive substances according to the same references. So, in a single fashion, between use and misuse, is it possible to resort to the same concepts for pharmacological drugs, including "drunkenness"?
   Clinical findings. - Any intake of a psychoactive substance, limited in time, which will take the consumer some time to recover from, can be called simple use, intoxication or drunkenness. Intoxication is rather a classical medical concept linked with poisoning, and hence the toxicological aspects prevail particularly through the concept of a toxidrome. However, little research has been done on "drunkenness" in other medical aspects, neither psychological aspects nor sociological aspects. If poisoning is defined as soon as a poison is introduced into the body, the intoxication arises after a threshold (that toxicology usually defines), but no means are available to measure the onset of the inebriation, neither any ingested amounts nor any toxic concentration in the body. It is hard to define "drunkenness" simply. At first, it is most often seen as a pathology in medicine, unlike in every day life. "Drunkenness" can be the result of physiological disturbances, notably through the effects of substances and can therefore be the manifestation of a cerebral dysfunction. Alternatively, it can arise from a variation of emotional or sensorial stimuli. If the feelings associated with drunkenness are positive and pleasant a repetition will occur in the search to reproduce enjoyable effects in reference to neurophysiological models of reward systems of the brain, and can tend to be limited to a search for pleasure. Moreover, "drunkenness" may be considered as a leak, a regression or a kind of renouncement. It may sometimes be a search for sedation, for conscious sleep, or to avoid reality. And, finally, "drunkenness" may be suicidal. Since the launch of benzodiazepines on the market during the sixties, their prescription has developed, making them so readily available in France that they are nearly as easy to obtain as alcohol. The widespread diffusion of these psychoactive substances, obtained with or without medical prescription, renders them one of the principle means of chemically modulating thought and consciousness that has become accessible to all. One of the first reasons for this is the easy and wide prescription of these drugs by almost all practitioners. Choosing between benzodiazepines or alcohol (or associating both substances) is not fortuitous. Besides intoxication with pharmacological drugs, whether voluntary or otherwise, medication overdose and iatrogenic effects, there is an incidence of a substantial use of over the counter psychoactive drugs in order to trigger other effects than suicide or self-harm. This use of pharmacological drugs, sometimes referred to as "entertaining", can lead to massive intake with dramatic behavioural response. Is it then possible to use the same term "drunkenness" for a pharmacological drug-induced state as for a state provoked by other psychoactive substances with addictive potential? The clinical presentation of benzodiazepine "drunkenness" resembles the pharmacological effects of these drugs. If we link alcoholic and benzodiazepine "drunkenness", we can draw a parallel between the properties, the action mechanisms, the effects and the risks incurred by the consumption of these two classes of psychotropics. The similarities concern the existence of a preclinical phase, of the same biochemical or neurophysiological basis, of the same properties, notably complex relationships with anxiety. They also have the same amnesiac effects, possible paradoxical effects, or sedation potentialities that may lead to coma, respiratory depression and death.
   But differences exist for benzodiazepines, in the lack of disinhibition effects, the lack of cerebellar effects, the variability of elimination kinetics according to the molecules, the rarity or the lack of "recreational" intakes, and the lack of easy blood level measurements.
   Conclusion. - An attempt is made to outline the definition of benzodiazepine "drunkenness", including sociological, psychological, and medical dimensions beyond the sole toxicological aspects. So, studying the misuse of benzodiazepines in more detail including the acute effects such as "drunkenness", except suicidal or mortiferous tendencies, can allow further development of its recognition, screening and prevention.

AB Objectives - Numerous studies emphasized the, high prevalence of sleep problems in adolescents. However, it remains to be seen whether these problems are developmental or if they are related to pathological conditions. In order to try to answer this question, we conducted an epidemiological study investigating the prevalence and correlates of sleep disorders in a population of high school adolescents. Method - The sample for this investigation consisted of 652 high school students (344 males and 308 females), aged 13 to 19 years (mean age : 15.1+/-1.2 years), attending colleges in the North of France. Data for the study were obtained by means of revised versions of the INSERM self-report questionnaires for adolescents. One questionnaire included 113 response choice items investigating the sleep parameters and the sociodemographic, behavioural, health, and environmental condition of the subject. This questionnaire was completed by a self-portrait questionnaire including 27 response choice items about mood, anxiety, instability and the quality of relations with others. In addition, a clinical examination was performed by the clinicians of the school health department in order to investigate the medical history of the subject and his (her) pubertal development. Results - In a first step, statistical analysis showed some significant differences in sleep rates and troubles between males and females. If the total sleep time was found similar in males and females, females were found exhibiting significantly earlier bedtime (p < 0.01) and waking time (p < 0.005) than males. In addition, trouble falling asleep (p < 0.0001), nightmares (p < 0. 001), need for daytime sleep (p < 0.05), and stimulant pill intake (p < 0.05) were found significantly more frequent in females. Then, the adolescents were classified into two subgroups. Insomnia group, included the students who answered often, or always - to one of the five questions about: having trouble falling asleep, the occurrence of early awakenings, their need for daytime sleep, sleeping pill intake, and bad sleep quality much less than Non insomnia group much greater than included those who answered, much less than never much greater than or much less than sometimes much greater than in response to the five questions. Results showed that 233 adolescents (35.7%) exhibited persistent sleep disorders, insomnia type. 40.2% of females and 31.6% of males were included in the insomnia group (p < 0.05). Pubertal development was found significantly more advanced in the, insomnia group, adolescents, more particularly in females. In the same way, concerns about body weight (46.7% vs 38.8%; p < 0.005), size and shape (15% vs 8%; p < 0.01) were found significantly more frequent in the much less than insomnia group much greater than; 32.3% of the, insomnia group adolescents vs 17.9% in the much less than non insomnia group much greater than reported health problems (p < 0.0001). School difficulties were found significantly more frequent in the, insomnia group, compared to the much less than non insomnia group much greater than. The proportion of subjects who have previously repeated at least one school year (p < 0.01), who reported bad school performances (p < 0.01), and who reported to be, sometimes, or, often, away from school (p < 0.01) was significantly higher in the much less than insomnia group much greater than than in the much less than non insomnia group much greater than. In the same way, data showed that school investing was also significantly weaker in the much less than insomnia group much greater than adolescents (p < 0.01).
   The proportion of subjects who believed that their relations with parents (12.4% vs 6%; p , 0.05), teachers (21.4% vs 10.5%; p v 0.0001), or peers (10.2% vs 4.1 %; p < 0.002) was found significantly higher in the much less than insomnia group much greater than. Risk behaviours were also significantly more frequent in the, insomnia group, adolescents: suicidal ideation (25.1% vs 11.7%; p < 0.001), suicide attempt (7.3% vs 3.6%; p < 0.05), psychotropic drug use (11% vs 4.9 %; p < 0.02), regular stimulant drug use (10% vs 5.1%; p < 0.005), regular tobacco use (7.8% vs 2.2 %; p < 0.001), regular alcohol use (13.3% vs 8.3%; p < 0.05), and illicit drug use (5.2% vs 1%; p < 0.001). Lastly, all the dimensions of the self-portrait were found significantly more affected or negative in the, insomnia group - than in the, non insomnia group,. For example, the proportion of subjects who described themself usually sad (10.2% vs 3.4%; p < 0.001), anxious (54.9 % vs 40.5 %; p < 0.0001), downcast (41.1% vs 32.6 %; p < 0.05), or instable (56.9% vs 41.7%; p < 0.0001) was significantly higher in the, insomnia group. Conclusion In this descriptive study, if some data suggest that pubertal development may be involved in the sleep rates or troubles observed in adolescents, the results also show that persistent sleep disorders are significantly associated with physical, psychological or social difficulties. In summary, this study shows that it is essential to take an interest in the quality of sleep in adolescents, which may be a way to approach their psychosocial difficulties.

AB The strategy in the choice of antipsychotic agent must take into account the hepatic tolerance according to non-negligible incidence of liver disorders among psychiatric population (presence of risk factors like alcoholism, drugs of abuse intake, polymedication including potentially hepatotoxic drugs...). More than 1000 drugs have been listed as being responsible of hepatic side effects; 16 l of these agents were neuropsychiatric drugs. Antidepressive drugs (tricyclic agents or SSRI), mood stabilizing agents and neuroleptic drugs have been implicated in biological or/and clinical hepatotoxicity. For these reasons, some psychotropic agents have been withdrawn of the pharmaceutical market like alpidem or medifoxamine. Atrium*, sometimes used to correct tremor induced by neuroleptic drugs, has been withdrawn recently, as well. Isolated elevations of hepatic enzymes occur frequently with phenothiazines drugs (frequency evaluated to 20 %) but also with other classes of neuroleptic agents, as well. On the contrary, clinical hepatitis have been more rarely described with neuroleptic drugs like phenothiazine agents (0,1-1 %) or with haloperidol (0,002 %). The definition of hepatotoxicity is based on biological parameters (elevation of alkaline phosphatase enzyme, SGPT, SGOT and GGT) or on clinical abnormalities (hepatitis, jaundice...). Clinical hepatitis could be either cytolytic or cholestatic. Clinical diagnosis and the research of its origin may include many investigations like abdominal ultrasonogram and percutaneous liver biopsy. The present article describes the cases of hepatic disorders reported with AAD (Atypical Antipsychotic Drugs), which are available in France (amisulpride, clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone). This new pharmacological class of antipsychotic drugs has showed great interest to improve negative symptoms of schizophrenia and to reduce disabling side effects like dystonia. According to the bibliographic data available, the following points and information must be clinically taken into account. Frequency of hepatic troubles : according to the bibliographic data, AAD appeared generally well tolerated in most cases. The frequency of hepatic troubles remains in general very low or rare. The cases published were observed with clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone. Nevertheless, some authors have observed higher frequency of hepatic enzymes elevation with some AAD. In an investigation comparing hepatic tolerance of clozapine (n = 167) versus haloperidol (n = 71), 37,3 % of clozapine treated patients showed a relevant SGPT increase versus 16,6 % with haloperidol. Nature of the hepatic troubles: among the clinical observations, asymptomatic biological disorders of the hepatic function are generally described but cytolytic or cholestatic hepatitis were reported, as well. Symptomatic hepatic dysfunctions were, sometimes, associated with other disorders like convulsions, pneumonia or malignant syndrome. Thus, hepatic check-up maybe relevantin case of significant side-effect outcome. Delay time before the hepatic episode hepatic injuries generally occurred within the first weeks of treatment but this delay highly varied in the literature from 1 to 8 weeks, 12 days to 5 months, 1 day to 17 months for clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone, respectively. These delay times are very similar to those observed with other psychotropic drugs.
   Reversibility of the hepatic troubles and rechallenge of the responsible agent: all cases were reversible after the AAD withdrawal except with one patient (39 years old) treated by clozapine (350 mg/day) who developed a fulminant and irreversible hepatitis after 8 weeks of monotherapy. In most cases, the AAD was withdrawn after the hepatic episode according to the significant risk of irreversible alteration. Nevertheless, normalization of hepatic enzymes has been described despite AAD maintenance at the same dosage or after dosage reduction. Rechallenge of clozapine after a first episode was performed for three patients, only one redeveloped a new hepatic disorder. According to different authors, special care is required if maintenance or rechallenge of the agent is indispensable after a first episode of isolated hepatic enzyme elevation (i.e resistance or intolerance to other treatments). In this case, biological and clinical supervision has to be carefullyscheduled, which demands a satisfactory compliance from the patient. On the contrary, in case of clinical hepatotoxicity, rechallenge or maintenance is absolutely inadvisable. Mechanism of the hepatic troubles: precise mechanisms of the hepatotoxicity remain unclear. Contrary to phenothiazine drugs, no information is available on the respective rule of the agents and their metabolites. Hypersensitivity syndrome or eosinophilia has been reported, suggesting a possible immuno-allergic mechanism. Presence of risk factors : risk factors have been retrieved, in some observations, like high daily dosage, high plasmatic concentration, age, alcoholism, obesity or antecedent of hepatic disorders like Gilbert syndrome. Special care is advisable with these patients. As hepatotoxicity has been observed after surdosage (or suicide attempt), a hepatic check-up has to be performed in these clinical situations. Co-medication with hepatotoxic drugs may increase the risk as it has been suggested. In many observations, co-medication made difficult the incrimination of the AAD in the hepatic disorders outcome. Monotherapy has the great advantage to make easier the withdrawal of the responsible agent and its substitution. As drugs of abuse like cocaine or ecstasy are notoriously responsible of hepatotoxicity, they represent a probable factor of risk. Moreover, their detection is fundamental during the clinical investigation. Conclusion - Diagnosis of toxic hepatitis is mainly based on the chronology between agent introduction and hepatic disorder onset but other causes must be excluded. Bibliographic data analysis greatly contributes to confirm toxic hepatitis diagnosis. Nevertheless, this article emphasized the limits of bibliographic review to compare drugs towards tolerance. Most of the bibliographic data were case-reports for which it was sometimes difficult to provide absolute evidence of the responsibility of the agent. Moreover, spontaneous notification to health national administration is rarely systematic, in particular with isolated elevation of hepatic enzymes, and even more rarely published in international reviews. Nevertheless, according to the present data available in the literature, systematic and regular hepatic survey does not seem necessary in absence of risk factors. As for other side effects, which may occur more or less rapidly, great advantages may be obtained from psycho-education programs associating the patients in order to detect the first symptoms.
   Because little long-term hepatic follow-up comparing AAD is available, controlled studies should be carried out to precise the frequency and the risk factors (covariables) to prevent hepatitis outcome.
