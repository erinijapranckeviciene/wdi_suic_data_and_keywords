AB Background: Suicide is a major cause of premature death in Italy and occurs at different rates in the various regions. Aims: The aim of the present study was to provide a comprehensive overview of suicide in the Italian population aged 15 years and older for the years 1980-2006. Methods: Mortality data were extracted from the Italian Mortality Database. Results: Mortality rates for suicide in Italy reached a peak in 1985 and declined thereafter. The different patterns observed by age and sex indicated that the decrease in the suicide rate in Italy was initially the result of declining rates in those aged 45+ while, from 1997 on, the decrease was attributable principally to a reduction in suicide rates among the younger age groups. It was found that socioeconomic factors underlined major differences in the suicide rate across regions. Conclusions: The present study confirmed that suicide is a multifaceted phenomenon that may be determined by an array of factors. Suicide prevention should, therefore, be targeted to identifiable high-risk sociocultural groups in each country.

AB There is a marked difference between the suicide rates and trends in the U.S. versus Italy, with Italy having lower rates and a downward trend. It is hypothesized this suicide decrease may be explained in terms of an anthropological-based theory that a period of liminality and resulting communitas occurred. During research conducted in Italy, I interviewed four mental health practitioners, toured medical facil-ities, attended educational lectures and took various history related tours. I have chosen to undertake a qualitative approach with literature searches on suicide and related phenomena in both the U.S. and Italy. Combined with semi-structured interviews and first-hand observations, information on the "why" reveals disparity between the two countries. More structured studies of this nature must occur to ad-dress the epidemic of suicide in the U.S. and to validate the success of practices outside the United States.

AB The aim of this study is to update age and sex mortality rates for suicide in Italy; to evaluate the methods of suicide; to consider the effect of under-reporting on mortality rate for suicide; to compare age-adjusted mortality rates for suicide; and to examine some possible causes for the misclassification of suicide. Temporal trends, from 1980 to 2002, were analyzed using joinpoint regression. Suicide rates decreased from 1980 to 2002 by 10.5% for men and by 44% for women. The change in suicide methods indicated an increasing use of highly lethal methods. The under-reporting of suicide seems to have no effect on temporal changes in mortality rates or on the geographical distribution. These data indicate that Italy is a country at low risk for suicide.

ID GREAT RECESSION; MENTAL-HEALTH
AB Purpose To analyze the association between unemployment and suicide in Italy during the years 1990-2014, with a peculiar focus on the great recession (GR) and the role played by social protection as buffering mechanism against the negative effect on health outcomes.
   Methods Fixed effects panel regressions were used to assess the association between changes in unemployment rate and suicide rates. Additional models investigated the role of active labor market programs (ALMPs) as possible moderators of the association. Analyses were carried out for both males and females, stratified by age and region.
   Results The negative time-trend displayed by suicide rate in Italy until 2007 was slowed down by changes in unemployment at the beginning of the GR, when this trend reversed and the rate of suicide started increasing. Male workers aged 25-64 and women aged 55-64 years were affected by both "normal" unemployment rate fluctuations as well as severe economic crises. Women aged 35-44 were only influenced by the latter. Men benefit from ALMPs mainly in Central Italy, while women did not benefit significantly from ALMPs.
   Conclusions In Italy, economic downturns were associated with increased suicides mainly among men, while severe economic crises were associated with increased suicides among both men and women. ALMPs showed to be effective in moderating the association between unemployment and suicide among men aged 45-54 only in Central Italy. The overall small effectiveness of such programs may be due to lack of sufficient funding.

ID DURKHEIM
AB The study Suicide: An Essay on Comparative Moral Statistics by the Italian psychiatrist Enrico Agostino Morselli (1852-1929) is generally considered a major contribution to the European debate on suicide of the late decades of the nineteenth century and an important statistical source for Durkheim's own Suicide. The rise of suicidology in nineteenth-century Italy as well as the political and intellectual context from which Morselli's work emerged, however, have remained largely unexplored. This article sets out to deal with statistical studies on suicide in nineteenth-century Italy and, in particular, the political and intellectual context from which Morselli's statistical work on suicide emerged. Until the second half of the nineteenth-century, suicide in the Italian Peninsula was an uncharted phenomenon. It became the object of statistical study in the troubled years that followed the unification of the country, within a wider context characterized by concerns for the country's cultural and economic fragmentation, and for the high rates of violent crime and illiteracy that relegated Italy to the edge of civilized Europe. Forged in the political crucible of the newly unified Italian state, the determinism and evolutionist principles inherent in Morselli's Suicide explain much about contemporary perceptions of Italy in particular, and notions of civilization, modernity and nationalism in general. Morselli's Suicide remains a crucial element in the contextualization of suicidology as the direct antecedent to Durkheim's own study of the same name.

AB The purpose of the present study was to analyze sex and regional differences in the suicide rate of adolescents and the methods they used for suicide in Italy during the period 1970-2002. Temporal trends and regional variations in suicide for Italian adolescents were retrieved from the Italian database on mortality for the period 1970-2002, collected by the Italian Census Bureau and processed by the Italian National Institute of Health-Statistics Unit. In the period 1970-2002, 3,069 adolescent suicides were monitored in Italy. Analyses of these suicides identified significant differences by region of residence and sex. Males were 2.1 times more likely than females to kill themselves. Male and female suicides had inverse trends in the years analyzed, so that the sex difference at the present time is the result of a continuous increase in male suicides and a decrease in female suicides since 1970. The dramatic peaks observed over the time period studied cannot be attributed to a single cause, indicating that further studies are needed to better understand the phenomenon.

AB Previous research reported that economic crises may have important implications for increasing suicide rates. We investigated official data on completed suicide in Italy during the recent economic crisis as related to age and gender. Data were extracted from the Italian Mortality Database. The trend in suicide rates from 1980 to 2010 (the most recent year available) was analysed by joinpoint regression analysis. Rate ratios were calculated to compare suicide rates before and after the present economic crisis. Suicide rates for men 25-64 years of age (those involved in the labour force) started to increase in 2008 after a period of a statistically significant decrease from 1994 to 2007 and their suicide rate was 12% higher in 2010 compared with that in 2006. In contrast, suicide rates declined for women of all ages and for men younger than 25 and older than 65 years of age. After 2007, there was a noticeable increase in suicide rates among Italian men involved in the labour force.

   factors in Italy: Results from the European Study on the Epidemiology of
   Mental Disorders-World Mental Health study
SO COMPREHENSIVE PSYCHIATRY

   TRENDS
AB Background: As in other Mediterranean countries, suicide mortality rates in Italy are generally lower than they are in Northern and Central European countries and on other continents (eg, North America, Australia). Yet, no studies to date have examined the prevalence of and risk factors for suicide ideation, plans, and attempts, in the general population ill Italy.
   Methods: Suicide ideation, plans, and attempts and potential risk factors were assessed in a community survey conducted with 4712 adult respondents (response rate, 71.2%). The participants had been selected from Italian municipality resident registries and made up a stratified, multistage, clustered probability sample. The project was part of the World Health Organization World Mental Health (WMH) Survey Initiative.
   Results: The lifetime prevalence (SE) of suicide ideation, plans, and attempts was 3.0% (0.3), 0.7% (0.1), and 0.5% (0.1), respectively. Prevalence rates of these suicide-related phenomena did not differ by Italian geographic macro-area (Northern, Central, and Southern Italy, including the islands of Sicily and Sardinia). Among ideators, the probability of ever making a plan was 24.6% (4.0) and attempt was 18.2% (4.5). The probability of making an attempt for ideators having made a suicide plan was nearly 50%. Risk factors for lifetime suicide-related phenomena were female sex, younger cohort, fewer years of education, and earlier onset age of suicide ideation. The presence of a common mental disorder, especially if comorbid, was associated with a significantly increased risk for all suicide phenomena investigated (ideation, plans, and attempts suicide). There were no substantial differences in the frequency of these phenomena among the 3 main macro-areas examined, that is, Northern, Central, and Southern Italy (including Sicily and Sardinia), which conversely show marked climate, socioeconomic, and cultural differences.
   Conclusion: As shown in previous studies examining suicide, suicide continuum phenomena (in terms of ideation, plans, and attempt) in Italy were lower than typically observed for other European countries and did not differ for different macro-areas presenting remarkably different socioeconomic conditions. Prevalence rates of common mental disorders were equally lower in Italy than in other European countries. Although the detection of mental disorders represents an important step in suicide prevention, the correlations observed between various suicidal continuum manifestations suggest that timely recognition of suicide ideation and plans is an equally crucial factor in the implementation of effective preventive policies.

AB Homicide-suicide is an event in which the murderer commits suicide after the homicide. There are at least 14 epidemiological studies on the topic, and all have found that homicide-suicide is more common among family members. The murderers are most often males and the victims females. There is no recent research on this phenomenon in Italy. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the incidence of homicide-suicide in Italy over a period of 24 yrs and to compare Italian data with published international data. We used information gathered by press agencies and from the four major Italian newspapers. Between 1985 and 2008, 662 cases of homicide-suicide were identified, with 1776 deaths. The murderer was male in 84.6% of the cases, typically using a firearm. The most common motivation was romantic jealousy, followed by socio-economic stress. The rate of homicide-suicide was 0.04%. Comparison with international studies is not always possible due to the lack of information for certain categories. The common factors identified may be helpful for prevention.

AB The proportion of suicide attempts ending up in the death of the attempter was used in past studies as an index of suicide lethality, or case fatality. This study aimed at investigating whether case fatality of suicide has decreased in Italy over the latest 25 years using available data, as an alternative hypothesis to the proposed general decrease in suicidal behavior resulting from better identification and treatment of people with mental disorders. The official data on completed and attempted suicides by males and females in Italy, from 1983 to 2007, were analyzed with joinpoint regression analysis, to identify the points (i.e., "join-points") where linear trends changed significantly in direction or magnitude. It should be noted that only the most severe suicide attempts are recorded in Italian official statistics. Suicide rates decreased in both sexes, particularly from 1990 onward. Attempted suicide rates increased progressively in males, while in females they reached their peak in 1996-1998 and then decreased. In both sexes suicide case fatalities significantly decreased from 1990 onward. Improved survival after a suicide act is probably the main reason behind this favorable trend. The spreading of emergency services may prevent suicide. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aim Suicide trends in older adults were examined in Italy from 1980 to 2015. Age groups considered were 65-74 years, 75-84 and 85 + years. Methods Data on suicide deaths were obtained from the Italian Mortality Database (IMDB) collected by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) and processed by the Statistics Unit of the Italian National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanita). Joinpoint regression analyses were carried out for age subgroups by sex. In addition, data related to four main macro-areas of Italy were considered: North-West, North-East, Centre, and South with Islands (Sicily and Sardinia). Results Starting by 1985, declines were noted in all age groups with more noticeable decreases in older adults aged 75-84 and 85 + years. Female subjects demonstrated more ample falls in rates than male individuals. Declines were detected in all macro-areas of Italy. Conclusion Improved health assistance and quality of life of older individuals have probably contributed to the decline of suicide rates of senior citizens, who also showed improved poverty indices in the country, differently from all other age groups.

AB The purpose of the study was to describe the deaths by suicides that occurred in an area of Southern Italy in the period 1998-2002. Data were obtained from death records, and population estimates for each year were provided by the National Institute of Statistics. A total of 367 suicides were retrieved. The number of suicides was stable for the 5 years recorded, with the highest value for 1998, ranging from 1.4% for ages 0 to 14 to 25.1 % for ages 25 to 44 years. Age-specific rates of suicide showed that the highest rates were in those 75 to 84 years old. Rates are always higher in males, with a tendency to stability or decrease in all age groups in the years observed, except for males in the 45- to 64-year-old age range, in whom an increase from 5.71 to 7.28 was observed. The suicides increased proportionally with age, in those with the lowest level of education (53.3%) and among retirees (46.5%). Hanging/suffocation (44.1%) and jumping from high places (23.2%) were the most frequently used methods of suicide. Males had higher standardized suicide rates ranging from 5.4 per 100,000 in 1999 to 7.7 in 1998, whereas in females the range was 1.4 per 100,000 in 2001 to 2.4 in 1998. The study shows that suicide rates in Southern Italy are lower compared with national trends. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study was to discover whether suicide mortality among patients diagnosed with cancer during the period 1985-1999 had decreased with calendar time in comparison to the rate in the general population. 90 197 cancer patients resident in Tuscany, Central Italy and incident during the period 1985-1999 were followed up for life status to 31 December 2000. The mortality codes for suicide were considered (E950-E959). Time trends for suicide rates were assessed by using Kernel smoothing estimators, standardised mortality ratios and Poisson analysis of the observed/expected ratios. The standardised mortality ratios were 324, 224, and 185 for cancer patients diagnosed during the periods 1985-1989, 1990-1994, and 1995-1999, respectively. Tests for linear trends were borderline significant (P=0.053). Suicide mortality among cancer patients in central Italy had decreased with calendar time relative to the suicide trend in the general population. Improved treatment options and better communication of diagnosis are possible explanations of this finding. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Given the well-documented acute increase in psychopathology after disasters as well as the greater likelihood of suicide among persons with psychopathology, it may be expected that suicide rates also rise after such events. Aim: To investigate the suicide rate 1 year after the April 2009 earthquake that struck L'Aquila (Italy). Methods: Suicide rates were collected from administrative data sets of the Italian National Institute of Statistics for the years 2004 through 2009. Results: The number and rate of suicides during 2009 are the lowest since 2004 - and significantly lower than the two prequake years. Conclusions: The findings suggest that an investigation of resilience and posttraumatic personal growth might be useful in guiding public health efforts on suicidal prevention in the aftermath of disasters.

AB Background: Recent studies have reported changes in the time patterns of suicide, with conflicting findings regarding the direction of these changes: data from Italy were investigated to evaluate the influence of recent social and medicine-related changes on the seasonality of suicides in the country.
   Methods: A total of 71227 male suicides and 26466 female suicides occurring in Italy from 1974 to 2003 were investigated with harmonic spectral analysis to extract their monthly seasonal dispersion by five-year intervals.
   Results: The suicide rates of both males and females showed a rising trend, with an evident peak in the 1987-1994 period and a decrease thereafter. Seasonality of suicides, with a clear peak in spring as against the other seasons, accounted for a statistically significant proportion of total variance: around 40% among males and 39% among females. Seasonality did not change across time in a relevant way; however, an anticipation of the peak was observed in both males and females over time, with amplitude increasing or decreasing as a function of yearly suicide rates.
   Limitations: Data could not be analysed according to age or to the method of suicide, since this information was not available across the whole time interval.
   Conclusion: The seasonal effect on mortality by suicide is positively related to suicide rates, so much that changes in suicide rates over time correspond to changes in suicide seasonality. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background In some Western countries increasing suicide rates have been observed among males, especially young men, with a decline of female suicides. The present study analysed age-specific and age-standardised suicide rates in Italy. Method From 1986 to 1996 national statistics on numbers of suicides in each sex and age group were examined. Results Overall, suicides have remained substantially stable from 1986 to 1996. Among males over 45 years of age rates progressively decreased, and among subjects below 15 years rates remained stable. In the 15-24 and 25-44 age groups rates progressively rose: an overall increase of 2.76/100,000 and 1.60/100,000 was recorded, respectively. Among females over 45 years of age suicide rates progressively decreased, while rates in the other age groups remained fairly stable. Conclusion The present analysis documents a rise in suicides among young men, and highlights the need for age-specific suicide prevention programmes.

AB Objective: This study investigated the impact of the increasing consumption of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and newer antidepressants on the following public health indicators: ( 1) suicide rates, (2) proportion of completed suicides by poisoning with solid or liquid substances, and (3) hospital admissions for depression and proportion of admissions for depression that were first admissions.
   Method: Data collected by IMS Health on antidepressants dispensed in Italy from 1983 to 2000 were obtained from the Italian Ministry of Health, while data on suicide deaths from 1955 to 2000 were obtained from the Italian National Institute of Statistics.
   Results: In Italy from 1983 to 2000, the use of tricyclic antidepressants remained substantially stable, and the use of SSRIs and newer agents dramatically increased. In contrast, suicide rates for males decreased from 1955 to 1974 and subsequently increased, reaching a peak in 1985 and then declining. In females, suicide rates remained substantially stable until 1978. A subsequent increase occurred up to 1985, followed by a steady decline. Suicide by poisoning using solids or liquids dropped by nearly 50% from 1986 to 2000. Admissions to the hospital for depression showed an erratic pattern; however, no decline was observed. No change was observed in the rate of first admissions for depression.
   Conclusion: Despite a reduction in suicides by poisoning using solids or liquids, the analysis of long-term trends in suicide did not suggest that increases in antidepressant prescribing lie behind recent reductions in population suicides. Furthermore, in Italy, newer antidepressants had no impact on the total number of admissions for depression or on the proportion of all admissions that were first admissions.

DT Review
DE Suicide; Primary prevention; Italy
ID MORTALITY
AB Suicide is a serious public health problem The World Health Organization (WHO), recognizing the growing problem of suicide worldwide and urged member nations to address the phenomenon Since the time of Enrico Morselli, the suicide rate the changed dramatically in some Italian areas whereas It has remained approximately the same in other regions During the period 1980-2006, about 4000 suicide deaths among Italian residents were certified on average each year For each suicide there are probably about twenty suicide attempts resulting m a great burden for individuals, their families and society Suicidal individuals often talk about suicide, death, and/or having no reason to live Most suicidal individuals give definite warnings of their suicidal intentions, but significant others are either unaware of the significance of these warnings or do not know how to respond to them The assumption that these individuals want to die because they suffer from a psychiatric disorder must be substituted by a phenomenological approach to suicide An approach centred on the mtersubjectivity allows recognition an unbearable psychological pain for which the suicide is perceived as the best solution Suicide is best understood not so much as a movement toward death as It is a movement away from something and that something is always the same intolerable emotion, unendurable, or unacceptable anguish If the level of suffering is reduced the individual will choose to live The author looks back and ahead for preventing suicide in the Italian territory and reflects on the many suicide activities across Italy in which he was involved over the past two years

ID TRACE-ELEMENTS; EXPOSURE; LITHIUM; LEVEL
AB Arsenic, as a toxin, may be associated with higher mortality rates, although its relationship to suicide is not clear. Given this uncertainty, we evaluated associations between local arsenic concentrations in tapwater and mortality in regions of Italy, to test the hypothesis that both natural-cause and suicide death rates would be higher with greater trace concentrations of arsenic. Arsenic concentrations in drinking-water samples from 145 sites were assayed by mass spectrometry, and correlated with local rates of mortality due to suicide and natural causes between 1980 and 2011, using weighted, least-squares univariate and multivariate regression modeling. Arsenic concentrations averaged 0.969 (CI: 0.543-1.396) mu g/L, well below an accepted safe maximum of 10 mu g/L. Arsenic levels were negatively associated with corresponding suicide rates, consistently among both men and women in all three study-decades, whereas mortality from natural causes increased with arsenic levels. Contrary to an hypothesized greater risk of suicide with higher concentrations of arsenic, we found a negative association, suggesting a possible protective effect, whereas mortality from natural causes was increased, in accord with known toxic effects of arsenic. The unexpected inverse association between arsenic and suicide requires further study.

ID ECONOMIC RECESSION; GREAT RECESSION; MENTAL-HEALTH; MORTALITY; RATES;
   CRISIS; IMPACT; TIME; LIFE; AGE
AB From the mid-1990s on, the suicide rate in Italy declined steadily, then apparently rose again after the onset of the Great Recession, along with a sharp increase in unemployment. The aim of this study is to test the association between the suicide rate and unemployment (i.e., the unemployment rate for males and females in the period 1977-2015, and the long-term unemployment rate in the period 1983-2012) in Italy, by means of cointegration techniques. The analysis was adjusted for public unemployment spending (referring to the period 1980-2012). The study identified a long-run relationship between the suicide rate and long-term unemployment. On the other hand, an association between suicide and unemployment rate emerged, though statistically weaker. A 1% increase in long-term unemployment increases the suicide rate by 0.83%, with a long-term effect lasting up to 18 years. Public unemployment spending (as percentage of the Italian gross domestic product) may mitigate this association: when its annual growth rate is higher than 0.18%, no impact of unemployment on suicide in detectable. A decrease in the suicide rate is expected for higher amounts of social spending, which may be able to compensate for the reduced level of social integration resulting from unemployment, helping the individual to continue to integrate into society. A corollary of this is that austerity in times of economic recession may exacerbate the impact of the economic downturn on mental health. However, a specific flexicurity system (intended as a combination of high employment protection, job satisfaction and labour-market policies) may have a positive impact on health.

AB Background to investigate the suicide phenomenon among the elderly (people aged 65 and over) in the Italian provinces of Novara and Verbania, in the time span between January 1990 and December 2000, in order to evaluate if the characteristics of the suicide behaviour correlate to the place of living with particular attention to the psychosocial factors.
   Methods the information was collected from the Republic Procuration of the two provinces. Frequencies and contingency tables were evaluated to compare the data found in the two provinces. Standardised Mortality Ratios (SMRs) with their confidential intervals (95% confidence intervals) were calculated in comparison with the average suicide rates in North West Italy in the same period and in the same age group.
   Results One hundred and eighty-four suicides were committed from the elderly, with an average rate of 14.07 per 100000 inhabitants in Novara and 25.56 in Verbania. The most common methods used to commit suicide were hanging and jumping from height. The factors chiefly related to suicide were mental disease, followed by organic illness. The analysis of SMRs point out that the incidence of suicide in the province of Verbania is higher than in North West Italy while in Novara it is lower.

AB From January 1987 to December 2012, 19 homicide-suicide events were registered at the Brescia Institute of Forensic Medicine (Northern Italy), leading to 39 deaths (20 homicide victims and 19 suicide victims). The homicide victims were females in the total of the cases (100%), while perpetrators were exclusively males (100%). Only one event involved foreigners as both victim and perpetrator, all the other cases regarded Italian people. The average age was 37.3 years for the homicide victims and 41.57 years for the offenders. Perpetrators usually used a firearm both for murder (65%) and suicide (84%). In 66% of the cases the homicide-suicide events occurred at home; homicide victims were strictly bound to their perpetrators (husband, boyfriend or ex boyfriend, father) in all the events.

AB This study investigated the prevalence of suicidal behavior and psychological distress in university students across 12 nations. A total of 5,572 university students from 12 countries were surveyed about suicide ideation, suicide attempts, and psychological distress by means of a self-administered questionnaire. Almost 29% of the samples reported having contemplated suicide and 7% reported attempting suicide. Of the total sample, 51.1% scored above the General Health Questionnaire-123 cut-off points, 41.6% above the GHQ-124 cut-off points, and 33.8% scored above the GHQ-125 cut-off points. While odds of suicide ideation were elevated in Austria and the UK, reduced ORs were detected for China, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Turkey. Similarly, while odds of suicide attempt were high in Jordan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, and to some extent in Turkey, reduced ORs were observed for Austria, China, Italy, Japan and the United States. Elevated ORs for psychological distress were seen in Japan, Jordan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Turkey but reduced ORs were noted in Austria, China, Iran, Italy, and the United States. Psychological distress was strongly associated with reports of suicide ideation and attempts. Suicide ideation, suicide attempt, and psychological distress are common in university students but their rates vary depending on the sociocultural context. Due attention should be devoted to the mental health needs of young adults enrolled in higher educational institutions and more cross-cultural research is warranted to better understand the etiology of the observed intersocietal variations in suicidal behavior and psychological distress.

AB The aim of the current study was to evaluate whether socioeconomics risk factors and depressive symptoms are associated with suicide in men with alcohol use disorders in South Tirol, Italy. The authors hypothesize that socioeconomics inequalities interact with greater psychopathology in men with alcohol use disorders who committed suicide. The authors found a positive association between unstable work positions and low educational attainment and alcohol use disorders in individuals who committed suicide. The results point to the need for careful assessment of subsyndromal depression in individuals with alcohol use disorders, especially when abuse is associated with socioeconomic risk factors such as lower educational attainment and unemployment or employment instability.

AB Objectives. Higher natural concentrations of lithium in drinking water may be associated with lower local rates of suicide. Methods. Lithium concentrations in drinking water were assayed by mass spectrometry at 145 sites in Italy, and compared with reported local suicide rates for men and women between 1980 and 2011. Results. Lithium concentrations in drinking water averaged 5.28 [CI: 4.08-6.48] g/L (0.761 [0.588-0.934] Eq/L) and ranged from 0.110 to 60.8 g/L (1.58 to 8.76 Eq/L). Lithium concentrations and local suicide rates were not significantly inversely related, except in 1980-1989, particularly among women. Conclusions. A proposed association between trace lithium concentrations in drinking water and risk of suicide was only partially supported, and mechanisms for potential clinical effects of trace levels of lithium are unknown.

TI Fatal firearm wounds: A retrospective study in Bari (Italy) between 1988
   and 2003
SO FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Review
DE firearms wounds; forensic pathology; Southern Italy
ID SUICIDE
AB Fatal gunshot injuries are routinely encountered by forensic pathologists practicing in Southern Italy. Bari, the capital city of the Italian region known as Apulia, is a leader with regard to the number of firearm deaths in Italy. This is mainly attributable to local organized crime groups which control a variety of illicit activities. This retrospective study analyzes autopsy data related to fatal firearm wounds, handled by the Institute of Legal Medicine [University of Bari], between 1988 and 2003. A total of 717 cases were selected and classified as follows: firearm homicides (634); suicides (82); and accidental death (1).
   A significant number of variables have been reviewed such as: month in which the violent event took place; the victims' nationalities; gender and age of victims; site and number of entrance wounds; weapon type used; and manner of death (i.e. homicide; suicide; accidental). Analysis has revealed a homicide versus suicide ratio of almost 8: 1. Victims were mostly male with a lower mean age than in other similar studies. Homicides with multiple gunshot wounds were more common than ones with single entrance wounds. For example, in one case, 30 entrance wounds were identified in the murder of a gang boss. Four suicides with two entrance gunshot wounds were identified. Handguns were the most frequently used weapon in all groups (i.e. homicide, suicide, and accidental), with 7.65 mm and 9 mm being the most common calibres.
   This study revealed a very low incidence of suicide among females. Mental and other types of illness, as well as financial stress were the apparent motives which prompted most of the suicide victims. The homicide cases described were most often related to continual, ongoing fights among local criminal gangs (75%). (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Completed suicide is associated with marital status; being unmarried is associated with a higher suicide rate as compared with being married or living with a partner. Moreover, the region of origin may be particularly important when trying to explain major inequalities in suicide rates across a country. Data were obtained from the Italian Database on Mortality, collected by the Italian Census Bureau (ISTAT) and processed by the Italian National Institute of Health-Statistics Unit. The Italian population in the last Italian census (October 2001) was used to estimate age-standardized mortality rates from suicide by marital status (ICD-9 revision: E950-959) and "natural" causes (ICD-9 revision: 0-280; 320-799). Rate Ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using married individuals as a reference. All analyses were conducted separately for men and women for 2000-2002, the most recent years with data available. Logistic regression analysis was used to compare differences by marital status for suicide versus death from natural causes. There are major inequalities in suicide rates in Italy. The North region has the highest suicide rates both for married and non-married individuals. Sardinia Island has the highest male suicide rate in Italy-23.07 per 100,000 per year-compared with the average national male suicide rate of 13.80, a difference which is significantly higher by 67% (RR: 1.67; 95%CI = 1.40-1.99). In contrast, Sardinia has one of the lowest female suicide rates among the Italian regions, close to that of the South and the Center regions. The North-East is the only region where the suicide rate among divorced men is significantly higher than that of married men. In the South, widowers have the highest suicide rate, with a rate 6-times that of married men (RR = 5.66; 95%CI = 4.46-7.18). Major inequalities in suicide rates by region may derive from different socio-cultural backgrounds, confirming the notion that suicide is a multifaceted phenomenon. The results of the present study indicate that suicide prevention must take into account the social and cultural characteristics of different communities. Moreover, these findings support the notion that marital status may play a central role in influencing suicide.

AB The authors report an unusual case of suicide of an anesthesiologist, in which the suicide manner and means depend upon the victim's occupation. This is the first case report published in Italy of a death involving propofol and other drugs. The anesthesiologist was found dead with an empty drip still inserted in the hand and another one near his body. Forensic and toxicological findings suggested that the cause of death was a respiratory depression due to a self-administration of a rapidly infused lethal drug mixture. Analytical drug quantification was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Blood analysis revealed: zolpidem (0.86g/mL), propofol (0.30g/mL), midazolam (0.08g/mL), thiopental (0.03g/mL), and amitriptyline (0.07g/mL). Adipose tissue and hair analysis suggested a previous and repeated use of these drugs verifying the fact that in Italy recreational abuse of anesthetic and sedative agents in health care practitioners is becoming an increasing problem.

AB Background: Worldwide, prisoners are at high risk of suicide. Reducing the number of suicides in jails and prisons is an international priority. Several risk factors for suicide attempts, such as historical, prison-related, psychosocial and clinical factors, have been found in prisoners. We assessed whether demographic, conviction-related and neuro-behavioral variables might be associated with current suicide risk and lifetime suicide attempts in two large central Italy prisons.
   Methods: On a preliminary sample of 254 detainees within an ongoing project, we assessed whether demographic, conviction-related, psychiatric, cognitive variables and illness comorbidity might be associated with current suicide risk and lifetime suicide attempts in two large central Italy prisons. Psychiatric disorders and suicide risk was evaluated using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. We also have identified the detainees with clear-cut previous suicide attempts. The cognitive function was assessed with a brief neuropsychological battery including trail making A, trail making B, Digit Span, and Symbol Digit test. Impulsivity was assessed with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. Cumulative illness was evaluated with Charlson Comorbidity Index.
   Results: Impairment in global cognitive function was the strongest predictor of both high suicide risk and lifetime suicide attempts (both p < 0.001), independently of psychiatric disorders, psychopharmacological treatment, detention status, conviction time, substance use disorder, impulsivity, and illness comorbidity. Limitation Limitation: Cross-sectional study design and relatively small sample size.
   Conclusion: Cognitive deficits may improve our understanding of the suicidal vulnerability and should be systematically included in the assessment of suicide risk, as potential predictors of suicidal acts and targets of preventive interventions.

AB The problem of the possibility of modifying blank cartridge dummy firearms to make them fire a real bullet has long been known, but the phenomenon has been constantly on the increase in the recent years. In Italy, there are no restrictions on the purchase of an inoffensive weapon. However, few modifications are frequently enough to transform the inoffensive weapon into a harmful one: a procedure is often undertaken to avoid the mandatory control and registration of firearms.
   We describe a case of suicide of a man in Trieste, Italy, in 2002, with a blank cartridge dummy pistol that had been modified to fire homemade bullets.

AB The Italian Constitutional Court has surprised many commentators by making a provisional decision declaring the crime of assisted suicide unconstitutional, under certain conditions. Before officially striking down the article of the criminal code, however, the Court (following the Canadian example) gave the Parliament one year to enact a comprehensive law on the topic. The deadline is running out and the picture is far from clear: given the complexity of the legal system and the inertia of the Parliament, the right of sick and suffering people to be aided in taking their life is likely to remain, at least for a while, wishful thinking.

AB Objective The aim of this multicenter study was to investigate the differences in personality traits, particularly Neuroticism, in three clinical samples and three student samples in Austria and Italy and their impact on suicide. Methods In total, 1,043 people (410 psychiatric inpatients and 633 university students) were tested in three regions of Europe: central Italy, northeast Italy, and eastern Austria. Psychiatric diagnoses were evaluated using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, and the following instruments were used: Sociodemographic Questionnaire, Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale-B, Symptom-Checklist-90-Standard, and Big Five Inventory. Results The study found that the intensity of Suicidal Ideation was associated with the personality traits of Neuroticism, Anxiety, and Extraversion but also with Depression. Conclusions In conclusion, without the presence of Depression symptoms, neuroticism was a protective factor against Suicidal Ideation, whereas neuroticism when comorbid with Depression symptoms increased suicide risk in psychiatric patients. In all three regions, the clinical samples had higher scores for Neuroticism and for Depression symptoms than the student sample and consequently higher scores for Suicide. Furthermore, we demonstrated an interaction between gender and culture on personality traits, supporting the hypothesis that the distribution of self-reported personality traits is organized geographically.

SO JOURNAL OF FORENSIC AND LEGAL MEDICINE

DT Review
DE Complex suicide; Complicated suicide; Autopsy; Forensic pathology
ID SHARP FORCE INJURIES; MEDICINE
AB Generally, the term complex suicide refers to a form of suicide in which more than one traumatic method is applied, simultaneously or consecutively, through multiple self-injurious actions using different methods and involving various bodily sites.
   A distinctive feature of complicated suicides is the failure of the initial attempt of the self-suppressive method that, nonetheless, results in death due to a subsequent accidental occurrence. In such cases, forensic pathologists and coroners are faced with the challenging differential diagnosis that generally includes homicide as well as suicide.
   We retrospectively analyzed autopsies from complex and complicated suicides registered at the Medicolegal bureau of Genoa (Italy) from 2006 to 2017. In the considered period, nineteen cases of complex suicides were identified and with only one case of a complicated suicide. In our series, the most frequent method of complex suicide was the cutting of the wrists followed by (unplanned) hanging for a total of eight cases (42.1%). The next most common cause (21% of cases) involved the jumping from a height after wrist cutting.
   In each case, it was necessary to meticulously examine the crime scene, reconstruct the chain of events, confirmed by the testimonies of relatives or eyewitnesses, review any medical history, particularly for psychiatric conditions, and perform a thorough autopsy so as to firmly establish the methods and causes of death.

AB This study adopts a psychological autopsy method to compare (1) unemployed suicides, (2) other suicides who were either employed or not in the labor force, and (3) psychiatric outpatients without any prior suicidal behavior. A total of 245 consecutive suicides from Province of Parma (Italy) with recorded employment status were included in the analysis. The control group included 41 psychiatric outpatients aged 18 to 64 years, who had not engaged in any previous suicidal act, and who were unemployed. The unemployed suicides had a risk 17 times higher to have had financial problems in the last 12 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.0/149.5; p<0.01) than other suicides. Unemployed suicides (compared to living unemployed controls) were 10 times more likely to have had poor social support (95% CI: 1.7/56.1; p<0.01), 16 times more likely to have had any stressful life events in the past 12 months (95% CI: 2.5/103.9; p<0.01), and 22 times more likely to have a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (95% CI: 2.4/203.2; p<0.01). New suicide prevention strategies for those who are facing job loss need to focus on social support and personality disorders, as well as hopelessness and despair.

   Italy
AB This retrospective study analyzes post-mortem examination data of 164 firearm-related casualties recorded by the Brescia, Italy Institute of Forensic Medicine between the years 1994 and 2006. The following variables were considered: year, month and day of death, gender and age of the victim, manner of death (homicide, suicide, accidental), type of weapon used, anatomical site and number of wounds, scene of death, and, whenever requested by the local District Attorney's Office, results of the toxicological examinations conducted on the corpses of the deceased.
   In the County of Brescia. Italy, the 2006 firearm-related mortality rate amounted to 0.84 per 100,000 residents, with an average of 12.6 cases per year. The most common manner of death was suicide (60.4%), followed by homicide (35.9%) and accidental death (3.7%). Most victims were male, with an average age of 47.2 in cases of suicide, 37.9 in cases of homicide, and 47.5 in cases of accidental death. Considering all of the death manners contemplated in this study, the weapon types most frequently resorted to were single-action, short-barrelled guns, followed by multiple-action, long-barrelled ones. In cases of suicide, entry wounds were primarily situated on the head (right temple) and chest (precordium), while in cases of homicide no conclusions could be drawn as to the entry wounds' predominant location.

AB Although continued use of antidepressants (AD) has been found to be associated with a lower risk of suicide, AD discontinuation is reported repeatedly. The aim of this case-control study, thus, was to assess whether discontinuation to AD was associated with an increased risk of suicide, according to different genders and age groups. The Social and Health Information System of Friuli Venezia Giulia Region, Italy, was used to collect data on suicides, diagnoses and AD use from 2005 to 2014. We selected, as cases, all suicides that had at least one prescription of AD in the 730 days before death (N = 876), and we matched with regard to age and sex each case with five controls from the general population. Conditional logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association between suicide and modifications of AD treatment. We found that 70% of suicides and controls from the general population discontinued AD in the 2 years before the index date. In two-thirds of them, discontinuations were two or more. Discontinuation of AD, however, did not represent a significant risk factor for suicide. More appropriate care of depression, particularly by primary care physicians who widely prescribe AD, should be fostered in order to prevent suicide. However, more research is needed to assess to which extent AD discontinuation can affect suicidal risk.

AB Background The factors most strongly associated with suicide are age and gender-more men than women, and, more people over 65 kill themselves. As a number of Governments have targets to reduce suicide levels we compare elderly suicide rates over a 20-year period in England and Wales. And the major Western countries focusing upon age and gender.
   Method WHO mortality data were used to calculate three-year average General Population Suicide Rates (GPSR) for 1979-1981 to 1997-1999 and rates of people aged 65-74 and 75+ suicide by gender to provide ratios of change and a statistical comparison of England and Wales and the Major Western countries over the period.
   Results Male GSPR: '65-74' suicide ratios fell significantly in six countries and in three for the '75+'. Female GSPR: '65-74' suicide ratios fell in every country except Spain. Proportionately, there were more suicides in the over 65s in countries with an 'extended family' tradition, Spain, Italy, Germany, France and Japan, than in the five 'secular' countries. England and Wales male '65-74' suicide fell significantly more than Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Netherlands and the USA, and did significantly better than the other countries for all female senior citizen suicides.
   Conclusion Suicide of the over-65s has improved in seven countries, especially in England and Wales, who had the greatest proportional reduction, which reflects well upon the psycho-geriatric and community services. However, in all countries, male 65-74 rates did not match the female out so extra efforts are needed to improve male rates. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

ID PREVENTION; BEHAVIOR
AB Background Previous short-term work reported fewer suicides among elderly users of a telephone helpline and emergency response service (the TeleHelp-TeleCheck Service).
   Aims To examine long-term effects of the service on suicide in an elderly population of northern Italy.
   Method The service provided twice-weekly support and needs assessment telephone calls and a 24 h emergency alarm service. Data from 1988 to 1998 allowed comparison of 18 641 service users with a comparable general population group of the Veneto region in Italy.
   Results Significantly fewer suicide deaths (n(OBSERVED)=6) occurred among elderly service users (standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 28.8%) than expected (n(EXPECTED)=20.86; chi(2)=10.58, d.f=1, P < 0.001) despite an assumed overrepresentation of persons at increased risk. The service performed well for elderly females (n(OBSERVED)=2, SMR=16.6%, n(EXPECTED)=12.03; chi(2)=8.36, d.f=1, P < 0.001).
   Conclusions The study confirms the initial promise of the TeleHelp-TeleCheck service over a much longer time period. Further research will clarify the apparent lack of benefit for elderly males.

   UNEMPLOYMENT; TRENDS; QUEST; BIRTH
AB Birth cohort effects in suicide rates are well established, but to date there is no methodological approach or framework to test the temporal stability of these effects. We use the APC-Detrended (APCD) model to robustly estimate intensity of cohort effects identifying non-linear trends (or 'detrended' fluctuations) in suicide rates. The new APC-Hysteresis (APCH) model tests temporal stability of cohort effects. Analysing suicide rates in 25 WHO countries (periods 1970-74 to 2005-09; ages 20-24 to 70-79) with the APCD method, we find that country-specific birth cohort membership plays an important role in suicide rates. Among 25 countries, we detect 12 nations that show deep contrasts among cohort-specific suicide rates including Italy, Australia and the United States. The APCH method shows that cohort fluctuations are not stable across the life course but decline in Spain, France and Australia, whereas they remain stable in Italy, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. We discuss the Spanish case with elevated suicide mortality of cohorts born 1965-1975 which declines with age, and the opposite case of the United States, where the identified cohort effects of those born around 1960 increase smoothly, but statistically significant across the life course.

AB In Italy, postvention models specifically designed for people surviving the suicide of a loved one are very scarce. The SOPRoxi project was developed to respond to this particular lack. By involving different professional and nonprofessional figures (GPs, mental health professionals, social workers, volunteers, etc), the SOPRoxi project aims to remove the stigma associated with this condition and to offer adequate, multifaceted help to survivors.

TI Validity of suicide statistics in Europe in relation to undetermined

SO INJURY PREVENTION

AB Background The suicide rate is a macro indicator of the population's psychosocial wellbeing and an evaluation criterion of the effectiveness of suicide prevention strategies. A high level of injury deaths of undetermined intent (UD) is usually discussed in connection with the validity of suicide statistics. An effort is made to develop a criterion to characterise the quality of suicide statistics.
   Methods Standardised rates of suicides (X60-X84) and UD (Y10-Y34) by the International Classification of Disease version 10 as an average for the past five available years were taken from the WHO European mortality database. Rate ratios were computed by dividing rates of UD by suicide rates.
   Results There is considerable variation in suicide and UD rates among countries. The highest overall rates of UD were registered in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, and the lowest in Greece, Spain and Italy. The EU-15 average UD rate of 1.97 and the rate ratio of 0.194 UD to suicides were combined into a '2-20 benchmark', in which the primary indicator is 2.0 UD cases per 100 000 and the secondary indicator is the proportion of UD to suicides 0.20 (20%), which enables countries to be clustered according to the quality of suicide statistics. The following countries satisfied the benchmark: Greece, Norway, Spain, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Austria, Italy, Romania, Hungary, Ireland and Finland.
   Conclusion This study used the developed '2-20 benchmark' in Europe to assess suicide registration quality in a particular country, to compare the relative position of countries, and to set a target for those European countries that have not yet achieved the benchmark.

AB The present study examined data on symptom patterns in the week prior to admission for suicide attempt, in a nationwide representative sample of patients. Socio-demographic, clinical, and treatment data was gathered for 1,547 patients admitted over a 12-day index period during the year 2004 to 130 public and 36 private psychiatric facilities in Italy. Patients were evaluated in terms of whether they had been admitted for having attempted suicide or not. A detailed checklist was used to assess symptom pattern at admission; diagnoses were based on ICD-10 categories. Two-hundred thirty patients (14.8%) in the sample had been admitted for suicide attempt. Patients with depression or with personality disorders were more frequently observed among suicide attempters. First-contact patients were significantly more likely to have been admitted after a suicide attempt, the only exception being individuals with bipolar disorder, manic phase. No diagnosis was statistically related to admission after suicide attempt, once symptoms pattern at admission had been accounted for. Disordered eating behavior, depressive symptoms, substance abuse, and non-prescribed medication abuse were positively related to attempted suicide, as were any traumatic events in the week prior to admission; symptoms of psychosis (hallucinations/delusions) and lack of self-care were negatively associated with suicide attempt admission. Greater attention to symptoms immediately preceding or concomitant with admission after a suicide attempt can be a key factor in establishing the best treatment plan and discharge strategy, the most effective community-service referral, and targeted intervention programmes for patients hospitalized for a suicide attempt.

   study
SO ANNALS OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Increased prescription of antidepressants has been consistently associated with a decrease in suicide rates in several countries. The aim of this study is to explore antidepressant consumption, suicide rates and admission for depression in the Veneto Region, Italy, in order to see whether the same pattern could be detected.
   Methods: Data from the Italian Ministry of Health (admissions for depression), the Pharmacy Service of a Local Health Unit (antidepressant prescribing) and from the Epidemiological System of the Veneto region (suicide rates) were collected from 2000 to 2005 for the Veneto region.
   Results: Suicide rates did not show any marked increase but were stable in males and females. Antidepressant prescribing increased exponentially over the period examined, whilst admissions for depression markedly decreased. The trend for an exponential increase in antidepressant prescribing in the Veneto region is shared with other countries and locales.
   Conclusions: It is possible that the increase in antidepressant prescribing might be associated with earlier treatment of depression, thus decreasing the likelihood of aggravation of depression.

AB Aims: The aim of the present study was to investigate potential differences between suicide decedents who had contact with a psychologist or psychiatrist before committing suicide and those individuals who had not had previous contact with a mental health professional prior to ending their lives.
   Methods: Psychological autopsy interviews (N = 396) were conducted for individuals who died by suicide between 1997 and 2007 in South Tirol, Italy.
   Results: The study found that suicide decedents known to mental health professionals were more frequently women and more frequently unemployed or with unstable employment. These decedents were significantly more likely than those unknown to mental health professionals to have a family history of mental illness, one or more past suicide attempts, and more frequent substance abuse, and likely to have frequent alcohol abuse. They more often had visited a physician in the last four weeks before dying and more frequently complained about psychological symptoms. In the prediction of group membership, individuals whom were known to mental health professionals prior to their suicidal act were 3 times more likely to have a family history of mental illness, 5.8 times more likely to have one past suicide attempt, 9.7 times more likely to have two or more past suicide attempts and 3.5 times more likely to have visited a physician in the four weeks prior to their death.
   Conclusion: Our findings indicate that suicide decedents who had contact with mental health services can be distinguished from those who were not known to mental health professionals.

AB People seeking information and news regarding suicide are likely to use the Internet. However, evidence of the relationship between suicide-related search volumes and national suicide-rates in different countries can be strikingly different. We aimed to investigate the relationship between suicide-rates and Google suicide-related search volumes in the Italian population (2008-2012) using the Italian mortality database that provided monthly national data concerning suicides (2008-2012). Moreover, this study aimed to identify future trends of national suicide rates on the basis of the results we obtained concerning the period 2013-14. Google Trends provided data of online monthly search-volumes of the term "suicide", "commit suicide" and "how to commit suicide" in Google Search and Google News (2008-2014). Google Search volumes for the term "suicide" lags suicide by three months (p=0.482, p-value < 0.001), whereas no correlation was found between search volumes for "commit suicide" and "how to commit suicide" and national suicide rates. Google News search volumes for the three terms resulted in white noise. Apparently, online searches for suicide-related terms in Italy are more likely to be linked to factors other than suicidiality such as personal interest and suicide bereavement.

AB The international literature shows that in 4050% of the cases, homicidessuicides involving children under the age of 10 are committed by mothers. Here, we report some results on homicidessuicides, in the motherchild relationship, occurred in Italy between 1992 and 2010. We examined 36 cases of filicidesuicide mothers by consulting the archives of RAI, daily newspapers, and the ANSA news agency. We focused on: mothers and children's age, place of residence, date and place of the murder, number and sex of the murdered children, and modality of the homicidesuicide. At the time of the homicidesuicide, the average age of mothers was 35.4. The number of children killed by each mother was one, except in seven cases. All the women had underestimated psychopathological disorders and only six women were regularly treated. The dynamics and characteristics of the events were much more similar to suicides than homicides, so we can consider them as extensive suicides."

AB The prediction of suicidal behavior is a complex task. To fine-tune targeted preventative interventions, predictive analytics (i.e. forecasting future risk of suicide) is more important than exploratory data analysis (pattern recognition, e.g. detection of seasonality in suicide time series). This study sets out to investigate the accuracy of forecasting models of suicide for men and women. A total of 101 499 male suicides and of 39 681 female suicides - occurred in Italy from 1969 to 2003 - were investigated. In order to apply the forecasting model and test its accuracy, the time series were split into a training set (1969 to 1996; 336 months) and a test set (1997 to 2003; 84 months). The main outcome was the accuracy of forecasting models on the monthly number of suicides. These measures of accuracy were used: mean absolute error; root mean squared error; mean absolute percentage error; mean absolute scaled error. In both male and female suicides a change in the trend pattern was observed, with an increase from 1969 onwards to reach a maximum around 1990 and decrease thereafter. The variances attributable to the seasonal and trend components were, respectively, 24% and 64% in male suicides, and 28% and 41% in female ones. Both annual and seasonal historical trends of monthly data contributed to forecast future trends of suicide with a margin of error around 10%. The finding is clearer in male than in female time series of suicide. The main conclusion of the study is that models taking seasonality into account seem to be able to derive information on deviation from the mean when this occurs as a zenith, but they fail to reproduce it when it occurs as a nadir. Preventative efforts should concentrate on the factors that influence the occurrence of increases above the main trend in both seasonal and cyclic patterns of suicides.

AB Background: There is abundant empirical evidence of a surplus risk of suicide among the unemployed, although few studies have investigated the influence of economic downturns on suicidal behaviours in an employment status-stratified sample.
   Aims: We investigated how economic inflation affected suicidal behaviours according to employment status in Italy from 2001 to 2008.
   Methods: Data concerning economically active people were provided by the Italian Institute for Statistical Analysis and by the International Monetary Fund. The association between inflation and completed versus attempted suicide with respect to employment status was investigated in every year and quarter-year of the study time frame. We considered three occupational categories: employed, unemployed who were previously employed and unemployed who had never worked.
   Results: The unemployed are at higher suicide risk than the employed. Among the PE, a significant association between inflation and suicide attempt was found, whereas no association was reported concerning completed suicides. No association was found between completed and attempted suicides among the employed, the NE and inflation. Completed suicide in females is significantly associated with unemployment in every quarter-year.
   Conclusion: The reported vulnerability to suicidal behaviours among the PE as inflation rises underlines the need of effective support strategies for both genders in times of economic downturns.

TI Suicide prevention among youths. Systematic review of available

SO MINERVA PEDIATRICA

DT Review
DE Suicide; Adolescent; Adolescent psychiatry
AB Suicide completion is a leading cause of death for children, adolescents, and young adults. There is evidence that the suicide rate for those aged 15 to 24 years has tripled since 1950, and suicide is now the second or third leading cause of death in this age group. Recent studies indicate that the incidence of suicide attempts among adolescents may exceed 10% annually. The role of caregivers and schools (as well as colleges and universities) is important in the assessment, management, and prevention of suicidal behaviour in children and youth. Recognition of risk factors for suicide is of paramount importance for prevention. Furthermore, a number of educational programs have demonstrated possible key roles in implementing suicide prevention strategies. As suicide is a problem of concern among Italian youths, this paper overviews current official statistical evidence of the phenomenon and suggests a national suicide prevention strategy based on a number of tools already involved in this field, especially in the USA.

ID INTELLIGENCE; CLIMATE
AB This article is a review of Voracek's report (2009) of aggregate intelligence and suicide rates in Italy's regions, contending some findings and proposing new evidence and suggestions for further research. Voracek did not use intelligence data, but educational attainment, which in Italy's regions is affected by sharp imbalances in the quality of public schools and may not reflect differences in intelligence. The statistical analyses were inadequate given the small number of cases; the resulting correlation could be meaningless or even misleading. The paper shows that when the analysis is extended to other variables (latitude) or historical periods (1911) the correlations reported by Voracek are not significant. This criticism is based on perspectives among different branches of psychology and cognitive sciences, economic and social history, and economic geography.

Most subjects did not consider suicide as a reasonable option even in cases of a serious and incurable disease. Moreover, subjects did not consider euthanasia as a possible option either; however, they did express an opposite attitude when considering euthanasia in a third-person perspective. People with a personal history of suicidal behavior appear to present as a different population, overall expressing more open attitudes.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Suicidal behaviors are among the leading causes of death worldwide. The large spread of suicide suggests that educational programs and literature to parents or guardians should include information about the potential risks and potential consequences of the onset of the idea of suicide in children. We identified 55 cases of suicide among children and young adults < 18-year-old occurring in Italy between 1st January, 2011 and 31st December, 2013. The results point to the need to increase our understanding of the dramatic rise in suicidal behaviors during childhood/adolescence and of the causal pathways linking these behaviors to child-adolescent mental disorders. During routine care visits, pediatricians should be skilled to recognize risk factors for adolescent suicide in order to intervene appropriately.

   DISEASE; HEALTH; TRENDS; BORN; SEX
AB Completed suicide has been reported as being linked to marital status, with being unmarried associated with a higher suicide rate as compared with being married or living with a partner.
   Data were obtained from the Italian Data Base on Mortality, collected by the Italian Census Bureau (ISTAT) and processed by the Italian National Institute of Health-Statistics Unit. The Italian population in the last Italian census (October 2001) was used to estimate age-standardized mortality rates from suicide by marital status (ICD-9 revision: E950-E959) and "natural" causes (ICD-9 revision: 0-280; 320-799). Rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using married individuals as a reference. All analyses were conducted separately for men and women and for three different age groups (25-44 years, 45-64 years and 65 years and over) for 2000-2002, the most recent years with data available. Logistic regression analysis was used to compare differences by marital status for suicide versus death from natural causes.
   Being married appears to be a protective factor for suicide, but the impact of being never-married, divorced/separated or widowed varies with age and gender. It is noteworthy that the differences between married and non-married women were less consistent than those among men, especially for elderly women. The results confirm that the protective impact of marriage is higher for suicide than for natural causes of death, and the comparison between the risks of suicide and natural causes of death reveals that the groups relatively more at risk for suicide are divorced/separated women, divorced/separated men (under the age of 64) and widowed men.
   Both among men and women, being unmarried, widowed or divorced/separated is associated with a higher suicide rate. This study, however, adds information on suicide mortality in specific age-groups compared to mortality from natural causes of death. Overall, these findings support the notion that marital status may dramatically influence the risk of suicide.

DT Article
ID CARE
AB The aim of the study was to compare the management of suicide attempts by patients in Sweden and Italy with a view to providing a perspective on differences in treatment. Two consecutive samples of suicide attempters from Huddinge (n=97) and Padua (n=100) were studied in trans of sociodemographic characteristics previous care, referral, medical and psychiatric care, hospitalization, aftercare and short-term compliance. In Italian somatic management of acute suicidal crises, there are more physicians specializing in anesthesia or internal medicine working in ambulances and emergency wards, and there is a heavier emphasis on somatic care. Swedish management procedures seem to entail more medical examinations and biohumoral tests. Moreover, the procedures at the Swedish hospital give priority to early psychiatric intervention, and admission to psychiatric inpatient care is more frequent. However, it is not normal practice in emergency psychiatric care at either of the centers for specialists to serve in the immediate liaison consultation. There are differences in assessment and treatment between the two countries that may provide a perspective on their procedures, implying that current procedures for managing patients belonging to groups identified as "high-risk" in terms of suicide may be modified.

AB This work is the result of a kind of categorization of suicidal conduct based on an empirical-phenomenological approach, with integrated assessment of certain criteria, such as the dynamics, correlation of types of injury and how they were produced, evidence gathered during official inspections in loco, and case history findings about suicide. This categorization is an attempt to provide a nosographic definition of atypical suicide, that is, cases in which the parameters of typical suicide are missing. Case studies are described, taken from a systematic exploration mainly of the Italian specialized literature of the 20th century, supplemented by earlier references when deemed significant. In-depth analysis of atypical suicide can supply additional interpretations of the problem of differential diagnosis of suicide, homicide, and accidental death, that is, the real punctum dolens in overall medico-legal determination of the cause of death in scenarios in which death cannot be definitely traced to a deliberate act.

DE suicide; attempted suicide; nursing home; elderly
ID IDEATION; POPULATION
AB Objective: To assess suicide and attempted suicide (AS) rates and their characteristics among older residents in Nursing Homes (NHs) of the Veneto region, in the North-East of Italy.
   Method: The complete list of NHs was provided by the Regional Department of Health. Structured interviews were completed with NH managers, inquiring about NH, staff and management characteristics, mental health care available and the number of completed and attempted suicides (AS) in 2001 made by residents older than 65 years, occurring either inside or outside NHs. All facilities which reported suicidal events were asked additional information.
   Results: In the study period, five completed suicides and eight AS were reported, i.e. a rate of 18.6/100000 and of 29.7/ 100000 respectively. All but one suicides and one AS had a history of mental disorders. Seven subjects; had been living in a NH for less than one year. There were no significant differences in the frequency of suicidal events between the facilities which employed or did not employ mental health workers.
   Conclusion: The suicide rate found in this facility sample is much higher than the rate reported by the Italian National Statistic Institute for the over-65-year-old population of the Veneto Region in 2001, and is similar to the rate reported in a previous study conducted in another country. In Veneto NHs behavioural control of residents, lack of access to a variety of means used for suicidal purposes and medical supervision does not seem to have protected the NI-I population from Suicidal risks.

AB PurposeIncreased frequency of suicide in rural areas of Tuscany has been described since the 1970s. A case-control study was conducted in 2014 and 2015. The objective of this study was to identify major individual risk factors related to suicides in six rural districts of Tuscany.MethodsCases were identified as all 128 suicides occurred in six rural districts between 2009 and 2013. Controls (three for each case) were matched for age, sex, and general practice. Information was collected from GPs using a structured questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to investigate the association between individual risk factors and suicide.ResultsInformants for 91 cases of the 128 identified cases were successfully interviewed (response rate 71.1%). About 40.5-65.9% suicide cases and 11.4-20.0% of controls had some psychiatric pathology, accordingly to different definitions. Univariate conditional regression analysis showed that living in isolated houses (OR 2.48), living alone (OR 2.97), not being married (OR 2.63), low income (OR 2.73), psychiatric pathology (OR 9.70), psychotropic medication (OR 5.58), problems with relatives (OR 14.78), psychiatric family history (OR 5.67), and suicidal ideation (OR 15.61) were all risk factors. Practising religion (OR0.27) was the only protective factor identified. Multivariate regression identified two independently and significantly associated variables namely, psychiatric pathology (OR 8.87) and living alone (OR 2.30).ConclusionsResults of this study showed, similarly to recent research, that not all suicide events are the results of psychiatric pathology. Prevention strategies should, therefore, target both socio-economic and clinical risk factors.

TI RATIONALIZABLE SUICIDES: EVIDENCE FROM CHANGES IN INMATES' EXPECTED
   LENGTH OF SENTENCE
SO JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
ID BEHAVIOR; HOPELESSNESS
AB Is there a rational component in the decision to commit suicide? Economists have been trying to shed light on this question by studying whether suicide rates are related to contemporaneous socioeconomic conditions. This paper goes one step further: we test whether suicides are linked to forward-looking behavior. In Italy, collective sentence reductions (pardons) often lead to massive releases of prisoners. More importantly, they are usually preceded by prolonged parliamentary activity (legislative proposals, discussion, voting, etc.) that inmates seem to follow closely. We use the legislative proposals for collective pardons to measure changes in the inmates' expectations about the length of their sentences, and find that suicide rates tend to be significantly lower when pardons are proposed in congress. This suggests that, among inmates in Italian prisons, the average decision to commit suicide responds to changes in current expectations about future conditions. At least partially, therefore, the decision seems rationalizable.

ID MOOD DISORDERS
AB Introduction: Suicidal ideation and attempts account for a significant number of Emergency Department visits and represent a major public and mental health problem. Suicide and suicide attempts are a major cause of death and morbidity worldwide.
   Subjects and methods: 111 suicide attempters (81 F (73%), 30 M (27%)) were consequently recruited in the Emergency Department of the Santa Maria della Misericordia, Perugia, Italy between June 2011 and June 2012. Patients were assessed and demographic and clinical data were collected in clinical records. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS software. Chi-square test and logistic regression were used as appropriate. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant
   Results: Females attempt suicide 3 times more frequently than males and generally use a non-violent suicide attempt method. In our sample unmarried status is the most represented and the most common diagnosis is major depressive disorder, followed by borderline personality disorder. Suicide attempts are more frequent in January.
   Conclusion: It is of crucial importance to conduct a suicide risk assessment when subjects are admitted to an ED given that the strongest known predictor for future suicide is attempted suicide.

AB This retrospective study analyses post-mortem examination data of 251 homicide victims recorded by the Brescia Institute of Forensic Medicine between the years 1982 and 2012. The following variables were considered: year, month and day of death; gender, age and nationality of the victim; type of injurious mean; cause of death; homicide-suicides events; multiple murders; scene of death; toxicological data. Victims were usually young (30% was in the 21-30 years class) and males (64%). Although the victims were mostly Italians (73%), from 1990' s more and more foreign victims appeared, following the migratory flow that affected Brescia County. The offenders frequently used firearms to kill their victims (41%), in particular for multiple murders. Sharp instruments were used mostly by foreigners. The study also emphasized 20 homicide-suicide events, mostly committed between intimates and family members. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB We study the relationship between suicide rates and socioeconomic factors by using a panel data at Italian province level in the time span 1996-2005. Our analysis focuses on the impact of social norms on suicidal behaviors. In particular, beyond the usual social correlates of suicide rates, we propose an aggregate measure of social conformity which refers to the religious sphere as an area of conflict between individual and social behaviors. GMM and dynamic spatial panel data approach are implemented to control for serial and spatial autocorrelation.
   The results confirm the primary role of family, alcohol consumption and population density in explaining the suicide rates in Italy, while the economic variables, namely income per capita and economic growth, do not appear to have any effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB To verify the hypothesis that suicide attempts are associated with lower serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels of patients with mood disorders, 26 patients with mood disorders (bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder) were admitted after a medically serious suicide attempt to the emergency department and then hospitalized in the psychiatric unit of the Sant' Andrea Hospital (Rome, Italy). Controls were 87 patients who had not made a recent suicide attempt. Attempters and nonattempters did not differ in the levels of serum cholesterol or triglycerides. Indeed, attempters had nonsignificantly higher serum levels of cholesterol and lower serum levels of triglycerides. The use of biologic indicators such as levels of serum cholesterol and triglycerides in the prediction of suicide risk in mood disorders was not fully supported from this small sample.

AB Objective: To investigate the possible impact of the increased use of antidepressants on suicide rates in the Italian region of Friuli Venezia Giulia (FVG).
   Method: Individual-based data on antidepressants in FVG from 1997 to 2006 were obtained from the regional prescription database, and linked to data on suicide for the same period obtained from the regional health information system. Age and sex were considered.
   Results: The number of users of antidepressants increased almost fivefold during the study period. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors accounted for 71% of the individual users in 2006. The number of defined daily doses (DDD) per patient increased almost sevenfold. In parallel, the suicide rate decreased by one-third in men as well as in women, and in subjects under and over the age of 60 years.
   Conclusion: Suicide rates in FVG have declined in agreement with the hypothesis that the use of antidepressants may prevent suicide.

DE euthanasia; assisted suicide; law reform; medical assistance in dying
AB This paper outlines the recent Canadian experience of replacing the blanket prohibition of assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia with a new regulatory regime for "medical assistance in dying". The aim is to illustrate how lawnmakers in Canada have pursued the project that the Italian Court has urged Italy's parliament to undertake. Thus, the paper traces the arguments behind this law reform and highlighting ongoing disagreements over the manner in which it reconciles the protection of constitutional rights and the pursuit of particular policy objectives. Of course, the constitutional structures, political dynamics, medical cultures, and legal systems of these two countries differ in potentially salient ways. This paper is not a case for substituting Canada's MAID regime for Italy's current end-of-life laws whole cloth. Instead, the goal is to signal ways of thinking about, and responding to, some of the more pressing and difficult challenges to which efforts at law reform in this area may give rise.

AB The aim of this observational study was to assess rates of suicide and suicide attempts, in relation to gender, age, place of birth and security levels, in north-eastern Italian prisons during 2010-2016, and investigate associations with prison overcrowding, offence type and prior self-harm and suicide attempts. The study was based on individual data on suicides and suicide attempts from 16 prisons, with an average yearly number of 3900 inmates during the study period, for all prisons combined. Descriptive and binomial regression analyses were performed.
   Rates of suicide and suicide attempts in Triveneto prisons were land 15 per 1000 inmates, respectively. > 90% of suicides and suicide attempters were men aged between 21 and 49 years old, and most had committed violent offenses. Only half the prisoners who died by suicide and 30% of those who made a suicide attempt in custody were Italians. 'Cooperative witnesses' had the highest mean suicide attempt rate (30/1000 inmates). Fourteen per cent of suicides and 19% of attempters had a prior history of suicide attempts and self-injury. In binomial regression analyses, predictors of suicidal behaviour were being a male inmate in standard security conditions, with a mean age of 30 years.
   The study highlighted that there is a need for suicide prevention policies in Triveneto; these should take into account predictors of suicidal behaviours and individual characteristics of suicidal inmates. More research is warranted in order to both evaluate the effectiveness of prevention plans and better assess risk of suicide in specific groups, such as cooperative witnesses.

DT Article
DE Railway suicide; Reliability; Registration and coding procedures; Europe
ID MORTALITY; DEATH
AB Background: National suicide data are an underestimation of the actual number of suicides but are often assumed to be reliable and useful for scientific research. The aim of this study is to contribute to the discussion of the reliability of suicide mortality data by comparing railway suicides from two data sources.
   Methods: Data for the railway suicides and the concurrent causes of death of fifteen European countries were collected from the European Detailed Mortality Database and the European Railway Agency (ERA). Suicide rates, odds ratios and confidence intervals were calculated.
   Results: The suicide data from the ERA were significantly higher than the national data for six out of fifteen countries. In three countries, the ERA registered significantly more railway suicides compared to the sum of the national suicides and undetermined deaths. In Italy and France, the ERA statistics recorded significantly more railway related fatalities than the national statistical offices. In total the ERA statistics registered 34% more suicides and 9% more railway fatalities compared with the national statistics.
   Limitations: The findings of this study concern railway suicides and they cannot be extrapolated to all types of suicides. Further, the national suicide statistics and the ERA data are not perfectly comparable, due to the different categorisations of the causes of death.
   Conclusions: Based on the data for railway suicides, it seems that the underestimation of suicide rates is significant for some countries, and that the degree of underestimation differs substantially among countries. Caution is needed when comparing national suicide rates. There is a need for standardisation of national death registration procedures at the European level. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

ID MENTAL-DISORDERS; DRUG-ABUSE; URBAN JAIL; PREVENTION
AB Data on suicides, attempted suicides and other self-harming behaviours that occurred in Italian prisons from 1990 to 2002 was studied on official records, as documented by the Ministry of Justice.
   Over the study interval, completed suicide rates in Italian prisons were constantly about ten times higher than among the general population, but over time they did not increase significantly despite nearly a doubling in the absolute number of inmates. The rate of completed suicides in overcrowded prisons was about ten times higher than in non-overcrowded ones. Attempted suicides were about ten times higher than completed suicides with females being significantly more likely to attempt to take their own lives and males being more likely to complete suicide. Self-injuring acts without the intent to die involve about one in every ten individuals, with foreigners (non-EU citizens mostly) being twice as likely to self-harm than residents.
   A better identification of the people suffering from mental disorders and a reduction in prison overcrowding are two key issues that need to be implemented to reduce the impact of suicide and self-harming behaviours among convicts.

AB Background: The global increase in surface temperature (known as global warming) was found to impact on mortality through ill health, particularly among the elderly and in summer. This study sets out to explore the impact of global warming on suicide mortality, using data from Italy.
   Methods: Monthly data on suicide mortality and temperature were obtained for a 30-year period (from January 1974 to December 2003), and the relation between them was investigated using the Gaussian low-pass filter, linear correlation analysis and rank analysis.
   Results: For males, increasing anomalies in monthly average temperatures associated to a higher monthly suicide mean from May to August and, to a lower extent, in November and December. In January, on the other hand, increasing anomalies in monthly average temperatures appeared to be coupled to a lower number of suicides. For females, the links between temperature and suicides are less consistent than for males, and sometimes have a reverse sign, too.
   Limitations: Data could not be analyzed according to age, since this information was not available across the whole time interval. The use of monthly data, instead of daily data (unavailable), is another major limitation of this study.
   Conclusions: An improvement in the ability of communities to adjust to temperature changes by implementing public health interventions may play an important part in preserving the wellness of the general population, and also in limiting the worst consequences of suicidal behaviour.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate the variables shown to be linked to serious suicide attempts. Cases requiring emergency admission to intensive care were collected from medical records of the University Hospital in Messina (Italy) for the years 2006-2010. 107 cases of serious attempted suicide were examined, 39 of which ended in the death of the patient. The results showed the following variables to be linked highly significantly (P < 0.01) and have good nominal association (V > 0.30) with a fatal suicidal attempt: the year of the attempt, deceased father, history of physical illness prior to hospitalization and method used to carry out the suicide attempt. These results confirm the severity and the multidisciplinary importance of this phenomenon.

AB Complex suicide is performed using more harmful methods, simultaneously or consecutively. In these cases, the distinction between suicide and homicide represents a challenge for forensic pathologists.
   In literature, complex suicide is divided in two subgroups: "planned complex suicide" or "unplanned complex suicide" depending from forensic features and often related to psychiatric variables.
   Aim of this study was to show the casuistry of complex suicide in Parma's Forensic service analyzing, for each case, the forensic medical problems (type and site of lesions on the body), and the supplementary data [Police's inspection report, toxicological analysis and psychiatric anamnesis (when available)], trying, through a multidisciplinary approach, to determine a possible correlation between the victim's mood and suicide's method chosen, whether planned or unplanned.
   Our results showed the importance of all the elements collected on the crime scene to distinguish suicide from homicide, and the correlation between bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia with unplanned complex suicide (because of the impulsiveness), and major depression disorder and anxiety disorder with planned complex suicide.
   Being able to understand the causes behind this extreme gesture may become important not only for forensic pathologists and judicial authority, but also, and above all, for the family as well.

AB A year after Mario Monicelli's suicide, the death of another famous person in Italy, Lucio Magri, reawakened the Italian debate on social, ethical and juridical issues in end-of-life decisions. Unlike Monicelli, Lucio Magri decided to end his own life in Switzerland with the help of a physician because his mental illness rendered his life unbearable. Both Monicelli and Magri suffered from a severe depression. The authors analyze the ethical issues regarding the right to die for mentally ill patients and neurological disabled patients, discussing the decision-making autonomy in persons suffering from severe depression. The role of the psychiatry in the management of end-of-life decision requests is considered along with pros and cons of suicide prevention and rationale suicide.

AB We report an unusual suicide, committed with a common pencil. A 72-year-old male inflicted himself a penetrating thoracic wound while being hospitalized for a hip prosthesis operation. Although the patient was immediately operated, the cardiac injury appeared to be fatal. Cases of suicidal penetrating wounds of the anterior chest wall are rare and they are mostly inflicted by knives, glass fragments, or other sharp instruments. The potential danger of a pencil should be taken into consideration, especially in psychiatric hospitals and imprisonment facilities. We examined the legislation in Italy and Finland concerning the regulation of privacy in special care institutions.

AB Murder-suicide is a relatively rare event, and familicide is rarer still. However, it is certainly not unknown, and has been described in the scientific literature from both a socio-criminological and pathological-forensic perspective since the last century. In a civilized urban area such as Milan and province, where there is a general reduction in the homicide rate, homicide-suicide occurs almost exclusively within the family, and has specific features that differentiate it from other types of homicide, whether connected with general criminality or organized crime. This article analyses the quantitative and qualitative features of cases of homicide-suicide occurring in Milan and province between 1990 and 2009 (20 years), considering temporal aspects and the development of the events, the weapons used, and the epidemiological and psychopathological features of the perpetrators and their victims.

DE suicide; fire; burns; economic crisis
AB Suicide by fire is an uncommon way among all suicide methods. The manner of death by fire can be suicide, homicide or accident. Two cases of demonstrative suicides by fire are presented. Both very close in time and place. They occurred in Southern Italy in 2011, both very close in time and place. Unemployment and personal financial problems due to Italian economic crisis spread, were the causes of the insane act. The first case describes a man found burned and decomposed in the countryside two days after his disappearance. The autopsy, performed to exclude homicidal events, revealed carbon monoxide poisoning as the cause of death. A long surviving time was also documented. The second case describes a man that set himself to fire in the main square of his town. Personal economic problems were the cause of the demonstrative suicide performed in front of a crowd of standing people. He died for complications of extensive burns after twelve days of hospitalization. The external examination was sufficient to detect cause and manner of death.

DE Natural rate of suicides; Cointegration; Time series; OECD
ID COINTEGRATION; UNEMPLOYMENT
AB This paper provides further evidence on the hypothesis of the natural rate of suicide using the time series data for 15 OECD countries over the period 1970-2004. This hypothesis suggests that the suicide rate of a society could never be zero even if both the economic and the social conditions were made ideal from the point of view of suicide (Yang and Lester, 1991). This research relates the suicide rates to harmonized unemployment and divorce rates to test the natural hypothesis statistically. We also address methodological flaws by earlier suicide studies by employing autoregressive-distributed lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration advocated by Pesaran et al. (2001). In majority of regression equations, the constant term was positive and statistically significant, indicating a non-zero natural suicide rate. In particular, we find evidence that at aggregate level. Turkey has the lowest (3.64) and Japan has the highest (13.98) natural rate of suicides. In terms of the male natural suicide rates, the United Kingdom ranks the lowest (4.73) and Belgium ranks the top (15.44). As for the female natural suicide rates, japan takes the lead (16.76) and Italy has the lowest (5.60). The results are also compared and contrasted to each other with a view to drawing plausible policy conclusions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background Suicidality is constituted by all those phenomena that are apparently positioned along a continuum, with the two extremes represented by death wishes and completed suicide.
   Objectives The aim of this paper is to show the one-year prevalence of the phenomena constituting this possible continuum in the elderly population (aged 65 years and over) of a northern Italian city and to evaluate the relationship between some of these phenomena with psychological suffering.
   Method Emotional feelings and suicidal thoughts have been investigated by an epidemiological survey conducted in a central quarter of that city. Data on attempted and completed suicide derived from the data. bank of the Padua's WHO Collaborating Centre for Research and Training in Suicide Prevention that monitors these phenomena since 1989.
   Results and Conclusions Results suggest the existence of some continuity in suicidal phenomena, where prevalence decreases from those of emotional/ideational nature to most extreme behaviour. Subjects presenting with more severe suicidal ideation were those also obtaining highest scores in a number of sub-scales of the Brief Symptom Inventory. Copyright 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Background: Changes in the suicide rate within one region over time had been hypothesised to correspond to changes in suicide seasonality: a recent investigation from Italy confirmed such an assumption. Data from Slovenia were investigated to further evaluate the links between suicide rates and seasonal amplitude.
   Methods: A total of 14 325 male suicides and 4350 female suicides occurring in Slovenia from 1971 to 2002 were investigated with harmonic spectral analysis to extract their monthly seasonal dispersion by eight-year intervals. Changes in rate over time were analysed with a test for trend based on regression analysis.
   Results: The suicide rates of both males and females increased over time, with an evident peak in the 1987-1994 period and a decrease thereafter. Seasonality decreased across time in both sexes; however, no change of the peak was observed over time. The amplitude of the major 12-month cycle was slightly positively related to suicide rates, but the correlation was only statistically significant among females (P=0.0053; males: P=0.22).
   Limitations: Data could not be analysed according to age, the method of suicide, or the diagnosis attributable to the deceased, since this information was not available.
   Conclusion: The study confirmed that the seasonal effect on mortality by suicide is positively related to suicide rates, so much so that changes in suicide rates over time correspond to changes in suicide seasonality, but in Slovenia this effect was only evident among females, further pointing towards differences by sex in the mechanics leading to suicide.

AB Aims: This study set out to test the hypothesis that the suicides that can be attributed to a psychiatric illness show a higher seasonality than the suicides due to any other reason. Methods: All the suicides registered in Italy from 1984 to 2000 ( 57,796 deaths by suicide: males = 41,741, yearly rate = 11.3 per 100,000; females = 16,055, yearly rate = 4.0 per 100,000) were analyzed with circular statistic techniques, based on the maximization of mean vector length method and on the Rayleigh test. Results: The suicides clearly attributed to a psychiatric illness were 35.0% among males and 51.3% among females. An economic reason for suicide was more frequently found among males; somatic illness or sentimental reasons were equally distributed in both sexes. The suicides attributable to a psychiatric illness showed a significantly higher seasonal unevenness than the suicides attributable to somatic illness and to sentimental or economic reasons. Conclusions: The main drawback of this study is that psychiatric diagnoses were not formally assessed by a forensic specialist. However, it succeeded in showing that the dynamics of suicidal behaviour are not unilineal: suicides due to psychiatric or somatic illness mainly happen in spring/ summer and those due to economic difficulties mainly in December. Patients with psychiatric and/or somatic illness should be more carefully followed in spring/summer. Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Background: Recent Italian statistics on suicide distribution by time of day also report data on gender and age of victims, factors which have been shown to influence the seasonal distribution of suicide and which could also affect the influence of biological circadian rhythms on suicidal behaviour. This study aims to identify and evaluate any diurnal variations that may be present in suicide occurrence by age and gender in Italy, considering data from 1994 to 1997. Methods: The null hypothesis that there are no variations in the distribution of suicides by time of day (or over the three major periods of the chi (2) day: morning, afternoon, evening/night) was tested with the chi (2) goodness-of-fit test and with ANOVA. Results: A clear diurnal variation in the distribution of suicides over time can be observed for both genders, with a peak in the late morning (08:00-11:00 h), and a subsequent decrease to a trough in the night hours. This trend varies with age for both genders: in particular, the age groups 45-64 and 65 + show a clear suicide peak in the morning (08:00-11:00 h), whereas younger people have a peak number of suicides in the late afternoon (16:00-19:00 h). Adults (25-44 years old) show an intermediate trend, with a less pronounced peak between the morning and early afternoon hours. The observed trend is more marked among males; however, the distribution of suicides by time of day is clearly congruent by age. between both genders. Conclusions: Diurnal variation in suicide occurrence by age group may be affected by factors distributed unevenly across age groups. In particular, age distribution of disorders leading to suicidal ideation, and the sensitivity of biological systems of different age groups to environmental cues may affect each group's risk of suicide. Socio-relational factors are also likely to contribute to diurnal variation in suicide risk by age and gender. Children and adolescents can generally be presumed to be at school during the morning, therefore their opportunity for self-barm. is restricted to afternoon hours. The elderly, on the other hand, may find themselves alone in the morning, when family and friends spend more time away from home due to daily work activities. Limitations: Data are based on time of death and not on presumed time of the suicidal act. For suicides committed by certain methods (e.g., poisoning) there may be a considerable difference between time of act and time of death. Clinical relevance: The existence of a temporal window in suicide risk implies an improvement in the surveillance of people at risk of suicide and greater attention to chronobiological factors affecting those suffering from mental disorders leading to suicide ideation.

ID MORTALITY STATISTICS; SUICIDE; MISCLASSIFICATION; VALIDITY
AB The death certificate is mandated by civil law and serves as a medical-scientific document useful for biostatistics and epidemiological research. For a variety of reasons, death certificates can be misclassified. We reviewed data from self-inflicted deaths collected over an 8-year period by the Forensic Institute of the University Sacro Cuore of Rome (Italy). Four hundred and thirty-five of 2904 were classified as self-inflicted deaths (15%). The comparison with death certificates processed by the local public health authority (ASL) and by the Italian National Census Bureau (Istat) and with the judicial investigation results available in the Italian Penal Court archive shows some discrepancies. One-hundred and twenty-four of 435 deaths were not considered to be self-inflicted but due to a crime (29% overrecording suicide) with a higher reduction for women, suggesting that it is easier to confuse a murder for suicide in female cases. Any discrepancies between the mortality and crime data are discussed in details.

AB Suicides account for more than 30,000 deaths per year in the US alone. Suicide rates change over time, and the factors influencing them remain poorly understood. Economic factors, in particular unemployment, have been suggested as a major influence. However, the evidence for this has been inconsistent, which may be partly explained by shortcomings of the statistical methods used.
   Time series analytical techniques (unit root and co-integration tests) were applied to test the associations over time between economic factors, i.e. unemployment, real gross domestic product per capita (RGDP) and the consumer price index (CPI) and death rates by suicide as collected by national agencies in the UK (1901-2006), US (1900-1997), France (1970-2004) and Italy (1970-2001). Traditional correlation analyses were used when appropriate.
   Co-integration and correlation tests showed a long-run association between economic factors and suicide rates. Increase/decrease of unemployment predicted an increase/decrease of suicide rates over long historical periods and in different nations. RGDP and the CPI were also linked with suicide rates, but this was not consistently so and the direction of the association varied.
   Unemployment is a major factor influencing suicide rates over long periods of time and in different national contexts. It needs to be considered as a confounding factor in evaluations of suicide prevention strategies.

AB A survey about history of non-fatal suicidal behaviour was performed on 1,171 subjects in the waiting room of general practitioners' practices in the territory of Rovigo (Northern Italy). The mean age of interviewed subjects was 52.9 +/- A 17.0, with a majority of female individuals. Two and two percent admitted previous experience of non-suicidal self-injury, 4.7 % admitted having had serious suicidal thoughts/plans, and 1.8 % reported at least one suicide attempt. Compared to the rest of the sample, people with history of suicidal behaviours resulted to be of younger age (p < .05), whilst their level of well-being was poorer (p < .001). When compared to the results of the Italian arm of the European Study of the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders, carried out on general population samples, the present study produces higher rates of suicidality, despite the much higher mean age of the interviewed subjects compared to the general population.

AB Background: Suicide rates among physicians are higher than in the general population, and rates among female physicians are particularly high. More female than male physicians report suicidal thoughts, with suicidal ideation being a well-recognized precursor of suicide. The urgent need to find the reasons for suicide risk in female physicians is underscored by society's increasing dependence on this group of health care providers.
   Objective: The aim of this paper was to identify potential risk and protective factors associated with recent suicidal ideation in female physicians.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey analysis of work-related health, organizational culture, career paths, and working conditions was performed among permanently employed female physicians from the HOUPE (Health and Organisation among University Physicians ill four European countries) study: 385 in Sweden and 126 in Italy. The main outcome measure was recent (within the prior 12 months) suicidal thoughts.
   Results: Overall, 13.7% and 14.3% of the participants from Sweden and Italy, respectively, reported suicidal thoughts within the prior 12 months. Among the physicians from Sweden, the most powerful multivariate model for such thoughts included 2 independent variables related to work: degrading experiences/harassment at work (odds ratio [OR], 3.03; 95% CI, 1.48-6.23), and work meetings to discuss stressful Situations (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.19-0.69). The model included self-diagnosis and self-treatment as a significant factor. Work meetings to discuss stressful situations were also in the multivariate model for the Italian physicians (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.05-0.86), together with being given work assignments without adequate resources (OR, 5.0; 95% CI, 1.32-18.8). Significant non-work-related factors in the Italian model were younger age and seeking professional help for depression or burnout.
   Conclusions: In both Sweden and Italy, work stressors have been identified that may increase the risk for suicide for female physicians. A potential protective factor was meetings to discuss stressful work experiences. These findings suggest that such meetings should be more broadly implemented.

AB The present article reviews the state of public debate and legal provisions concerning end-of-life decision-making in Italy and offers an evaluation of the moral and legal issues involved. The article further examines the content of a recent law concerning informed consent and advance treatment directives, the main court pronouncements that formed the basis for the law, and developments in the public debate and important jurisprudential acts subsequent to its approval. The moral and legal grounds for a positive evaluation of this law, which attests that the patient may withhold or withdraw from life-prolonging treatment, will be offered with reference to liberal approaches and particularly to the frameworks of care and virtue ethics; but reasons will also be offered in order to consider not only the latter but also broader range of end-of-life treatment decisions as morally apt options. In this light, we argue in favour of a further development of the Italian legislation to encompass forms of assisted suicide and active euthanasia.

AB Aims. The aim of the present study was to investigate suicidal risk in psychiatric referrals admitted to a University Hospital Emergency Department (ED) who had a substance use disorder. Methods. The participants were 135 psychiatric referrals (84 men and 51 women) admitted to the ED of the Sant'Andrea Hospital of Rome (Italy) between January 2006 and February 2007. The data were collected for the purpose of this research via electronic medical records of ED patients. Results. Attempters with substance use disorders were more likely to have higher burden of major affective disorders, and psychiatric history than substance use disorder referrals without recent suicide attempt; and they were at higher risk of suicide (higher rates of suicidal ideation reported during the psychiatric interview). Conclusions. When evaluating suicide attempters with substance use disorders, health professionals working in the ED settings have to assess not only somatic emergencies that can undermine patient's life but also the chance of repetition of suicidal behavior.

AB The field of suicide prevention has been enriched by research on the association between spirituality and suicide. Many authors have suggested focusing on the various dimensions of religiosity in order to better understand the association between religion and suicidal risk, but it is unclear whether the relationship between spirituality and suicidality differs between countries with different cultures, life values, and sociohistorical experiences. To explore this, the aim of this multicenter study was to investigate the possible relationship between suicide and spirituality in Italy and Austria. In the two countries, two different groups of subjects participated: psychiatric patients and university students. The patients were evaluated with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. In addition, the following measures were used: a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale-B, the Symptom-Checklist-90-Standard, and the Multidimensional Inventory for Religious/Spiritual Well-Being. Our results confirmed the multifactorial nature of the relation between suicide risk and the various religious/spiritual dimensions, including religious/spiritual well-being and hope immanent. However, regional differences moderated this relationship in both the clinical and nonclinical samples.

AB Purpose To compare the use of antidepressant (AD) classes and compounds in individuals who committed suicide and in controls from the general population and to assess to what extent adherence and current use of different AD classes can affect the risk of committing suicide.
   Methods Individual data on suicide, diagnoses and AD use in Friuli Venezia Giulia from 2005 to 2014 were obtained from the Regional Social and Health Information System. All suicides that had at least one prescription of AD in the 730 days before death (N = 876) were included as cases. Each case was matched with regard to age and sex with five controls from the general population. The association between suicide and AD use was assessed using conditional logistic regression analysis.
   Results Almost 70% of all suicides occurring in the10-year period had been prescribed AD. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) accounted for more than the 90% of the prescriptions, with paroxetine the most prescribed AD. All AD compounds and classes were not associated with a higher suicide risk, with the exception of SSRI (OR = 1.6). A decreasing trend in suicide risk was observed when adherent subjects or current AD users were compared to the others.
   Conclusions AD treatment is an important factor for preventing suicide, since the use of AD at adequate dosage and for a proper duration was associated with a lower suicide risk. The proper use of AD should be ascertained by physicians, particularly in a primary care context.

AB Objective: To analyse trends in mortality from suicide over the period 1965 - 99.
   Method: Data were derived from the WHO database, including data for 47 countries.
   Results: In the European Union (EU), all age suicide mortality peaked at 16.1/100 000 in men in 1980 - 84, and declined thereafter to 14.4/ 100 000 in 1995 - 98. In females, the fall was 29% to reach 4.6/100 000. A similar pattern of trends was observed in several eastern European countries. In contrast, mortality from suicide rose substantially in the Russian Federation, from 37.7/100 000 in males in 1985 - 89 to 58.3/ 100 000 in 1995 - 98 (+ 55%), and to 9.5/100 000 (+ 12%) in females. In the USA and most other American countries providing data, no consistent pattern was evident for males, but falls were observed in females. Steady declines were registered for Japan, starting from the highest suicide rates worldwide in the late 1950s. Suicide rates were upwards in Ireland, Italy, Spain, the UK, Cuba, Australia and New Zealand. Substantial rises were observed in a few countries ( Ireland, Cuba, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand) for young males.
   Conclusion: In spite of mixed trends, suicide remains a significant public health problem worldwide.

DT Article
DE Suicide; Child; Adolescent; Adolescent behaviour; Epidemology
ID EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Background: Data and statistics oil suicide mortality in several countries have been published and discussed over the last few decades but gaps in knowledge are present in the epidemiology of suicide among Italian youths.
   Methods: Suicide mortality data for the years 1973-2002 were obtained from the Italian Central Institute of Statistics (ISTAT). Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated and examined for trends over time.
   Results: During the last 3 decades the Italian population's overall suicide rate increased slightly from 67.8 per million in 1973 to 76.7 in 2002. Suicide rates were higher in males than females (2.8:1) and in Northern compared to Southern Italy. Suicide rates increased with age from 4.4 per million for children 10-14 years old to 25.8 (15-19 years) and 95.6 (>= 20 years). The major increase over time was observed for 15-19 year old males.
   Limitations: Routine Suicide mortality data have several weaknesses; these are especially, related to the level of accuracy in the certification of violent causes of death.
   Conclusion: A national research programme to Study suicidal behaviour and risk factors in children and adolescents is essential. The permanenet monitoring of the situation, exploring gender and interpersonal issues with the aim to plan protective initiatives in an appropriate manner, is also fundamental.

AB Background: Many somatic disorders are complicated by depression and increase the risk of suicide. Little is known about whether antidepressants might reduce the suicidal risk in patients with somatic disorders.
   Methods: Data on diagnoses and antidepressant prescriptions were derived from the Social and Health Information System of the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region. Cases were all suicides that occurred in the region during the years 2003-2013 and were sex- and age-matched to controls from the general population. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between suicide and somatic disorders.
   Results: The suicide rate in Friuli Venezia Giulia decreased from 113 to 10.7 per 100,000 inhabitants during the years 2003-2013, however patients with somatic disorder had a three times increased risk of suicide. Elderly somatic patients' suicide risk was twice as high as younger patients. The risk increased from 2.6 to 9.8 times as the number of comorbid disorders increased from I to 4 and over. Although no significant risk of suicide in patients with somatic disorders was found when patients were adherent to antidepressants, only 11.5% of the suicides was adherent in the year prior to death.
   Conclusions: Medical illnesses and underlying depressive symptoms may have a synergy effect on the risk of suicide, particularly in older patients and in patients with multiple morbidities. Since medically ill subjects adherent to antidepressants did not show a significant risk of suicide, early identification and adequate treatment of depression in somatic patients should be considered in order to prevent suicide.

AB Aim was to investigate psychological characteristics that may predict suicide ideation and behaviour in male prisoners. Sample consisted of 1117 prisoners detained in jails of the District of Abruzzo-Molise in Italy. All underwent psychiatric interviews and comprehensive psychometric assessments related to different psychological characteristics. Principal component analysis of psychometric variables derived four components. Multivariate logistic regression was designed to test them as predictors of suicidal ideation and attempt. Main findings: (1) approximately 40% prisoners reported lifetime suicide ideation and 13% attempted suicide; (2) different psychometric variables tend to associate in male prisoners. Three of them - childhood trauma, emotional lability and substance abuse - seem to increase the risk of suicide ideation and attempt, while sensation seeking behaviour might decrease it; (3) ideators and attempters scored higher on scales measuring aggression, hostility, childhood trauma, depression. psychoticism and neuroticism, when compared to non-ideators and non-attempters; (4) suicide ideators and attempters scored lower on extraversion and resilience scales; and (5) childhood trauma was the strongest positive predictor for suicide ideation and attempt. This is the first report on psychological characteristics in a large sample of prisoners. We believe it might add new value to evidence-based suicide prevention strategies in prisons.

AB A total of 852 participants attending 11 centers for addiction treatment in north Italy following problems due to cocaine abuse between 1989 and 2013 were recruited. Two typologies were created: cocaine users (never heroin) (CU) and heroin and cocaine users (HCU). During the 38-year follow-up period, 4.8% of the whole cohort died. Over the whole period, tumors were the main causes of death; starting in 2010, suicide deaths became the first cause of death. Among CUs, most deaths were due to road accidents and suicide; among HCUs, most of the deaths were from opiate overdose and from cardio-circulatory system diseases. The excess mortality observed for all causes in either sex was 6.24; higher in females (15.03) as compared in males (6.23), higher in HCUs (9.06) as compared in CUs (5.21). The directly age-sex standardized mortality rates were 5.31 per 100, higher for females, declining after 2009 for all patients and after 2004 for HCUs. Multivariate analysis confirms the decreasing trend in the risk of death and shows a higher mortality risk for participants in the under-25age group. Among cocaine users, special attention should be paid to the prevention of suicide deaths.

AB Background Completed suicide is more frequent among older adults than any other age group. Data on suicide in nursing homes and other residential facilities are inconsistent. This work aims to describe the characteristics of elderly suicide victims in different residential settings compared to young suicide victims. Methods Data on people who died by suicide in the South Tyrol (Alto Adige) region of Italy between 2000 and 2009 were gathered from the local Provincial Mortality Register. Further detailed information was collected via questionnaires to mental health departments and psychological services, family physicians and relatives of the deceased. Results A total of 525 cases of suicide were recorded, with a linearly decreasing trend during the study period. About one-third of the suicides occurred in those aged 60 years and over. Suicide in the elderly was associated with low education level (odds ratio (OR) = 7.1, P < 0.001), living in a one-person household (OR = 2.4, P < 0.01), not having economic troubles (OR = 6.1, P < 0.01), having seen a doctor in the past month (OR = 2.4, P < 0.01) and living in a residential facility (OR = 2.6, P < 0.05). Twenty-four (17.9%) suicide victims aged 60 years and over were in a residential facility/hospital at the time of the death. They were more likely to be women, not married, and to die by jumping from a height. Conclusions The suicide risk should be carefully assessed in the elderly who live alone or are institutionalized or hospitalized. Efforts are warranted to reduce seniors' access to high places in hospitals and facilities.

AB Objective: To explore to what extent and under which diagnoses individuals who committed suicide had received psychiatric in-patient care, and how many had previously committed non-lethal self-harm. To investigate the antidepressant treatment received by these individuals. Methods: Case-control study based on a health register. Results: Psychiatric hospitalisation was found in 31.2% of the cases and 2.3% of the controls, and was a strong predictor for suicide with an odds ratio (OR) = 19.5. This did not differ significantly between diagnostic categories (except anxiety disorders with OR = 5.3). Non-lethal self-harm in the study period was committed by 14.3% of the cases and 0.14% of the controls, and was twice as common in female cases than in male cases. Previous self-harm was a very strong independent predictor for suicide with OR = 53.1 when a single episode of self-harm had occurred, and OR = 98.0 for repeated episodes (adjusted for age, gender and hospitalisation). Only 16.1% of the cases were currently on antidepressant medication at the time of suicide. Conclusions: Few of the suicides had previously been psychiatric in-patients. Even fewer had current prescriptions for antidepressants. This suggests that better diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric patients is an important suicide preventive intervention.

AB While linkages between some macroeconomic phenomena and suicides in some countries have been explored, only two studies, hitherto, have established a causal relationship between fiscal austerity and suicide, albeit in a single country. The aim of this study is to provide the first systematic multiple -country evidence of a causal relationship of fiscal austerity on time-, gender-, and age-specific suicide mortality across five Eurozone peripheral countries, namely Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain over the period 1968-2012, while controlling for various socioeconomic differences. The impact of fiscal adjustments is found to be gender-, age- and time-specific. Specifically, fiscal austerity has short-, medium- and long-run suicide increasing effects on the male population in the 65-89 age group. A 1% reduction in government spending is associated with a 138%, 2.42% and 3.32% increase in the short, medium- and long-run, respectively, of male suicides rates in the 65-89 age group in the Eurozone periphery. These results are highly robust to alternative measures of fiscal austerity. Improved labour market institutions help mitigate the negative effects of fiscal austerity on suicide mortality.

AB A mixed male-female sample of 950 school-aged adolescents, corresponding to 10% of the young population aged 15-19 living in a rural district of Northeast Italy, was investigated with self-reported questionnaires about the links between social desirability and suicide ideation. On the whole 30.6% of females and 23.9% of males reported suicidal ideation of some degree, with 5% in both genders reporting suicide ideation of a high degree (i.e. quite a lot/extremely often). Those who scored higher at the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (SDS) reported lower levels of psychiatric symptoms on the Symptom checklist 90R (SCL-90R), with the "denial" subscale of the SDS resulting specifically associated to lower scores on SCL-90R items measuring hopelessness, thoughts about death and suicide ideation. The personality traits measured by the Marlowe-Crowne SDS, such as defensiveness, denial and self-deception, might be conceived as a protection against psychiatric disorders and suicide ideation.

AB A retrospective study was carried out on postmortem examination data of 131 sharp force-related casualties recorded by the Brescia Institute of Forensic Medicine between 1982 and 2012. The objective was to identify relevant parameters that may be used to distinguish the manner of deaths between homicide, suicide, and accident. The following variables were considered: manner of death; demographic data; scene; type of sharp object; location and numbers of wounds; the presence of hesitation marks/defense wounds; toxicological findings; psychiatric history. There were 92 homicides, 28 suicides, and 11 accidents. Most victims were male, with an average age of 43. Injuries in isolation were present in 9.8% of homicides, in 35.7% of suicides, and in 54.5% of accidents. Most injuries involved the left anterior chest in homicides and the forearms in suicides. This study underlines the importance of a meticulous postmortem examination of injuries on the body and their relationship with other results from the death scene investigation.

AB The identification of change points in a sequence of suicide rates is one of the fundamental aspects of Durkheim's theory. The specification of a statistical standard suitable for this purpose is the main condition for making inferences about the causes of suicide with distinctive trends of persistency and variability just as Durkheim theorized. At present, the statistical 'strategy' employed by the French social scientist is too 'rudimentary'. A hundred years later, I take the opportunity to test Durkheim's theory through modern methodological instruments, specifically the Bayesian change-point analysis. First of all, I analyzed the same suicide data which Durkheim took into consideration. Change-point analysis corroborates the Durkheimian analysis revealing the same change-points identified by the author. Secondly, I analyzed Italian suicide rates from 1864 to 2005. The change-point analysis was very useful. Durkheim's theory 'works' until 1961: suicides rates increased as industrial development increased. However, after 1961 and the economic boom, they declined, and when they began increasing again, after 1984, they did not reach the same level as before. This finding obliges us to 'adjust' the Durkheim's theory giving space to Halbwach's convergence law. Therefore, as high economic and social development levels are attained, suicide rates tend to level-off: People adapt to the stress of modernization associated to low social integration levels. Although we are more 'egoist', individualism does not destroy identity and the sense of life as Durkheim had maintained.

AB Background: The international classification of diseases (ICD) provides guidelines for the collection, classification and dissemination of official cause-of-death statistics. New revisions of the ICD can potentially disrupt time trends of cause-of-death statistics and affect between-country comparisons. The aim of this study was to measure how switching from ICD-9 to ICD-10 affected mortality statistics for external causes of death, i.e. intentional and unintentional injuries, in Italy and Norway.
   Methods: A sample of death certificates (N = 454,897) were selected in Italy from the first year the ICD-10 was implemented (2003) and reclassified from ICD-10 to ICD-9 by the Italian National Institute of Statistics. A sample of death certificates was also selected in Norway (N = 10,706) from the last year the ICD-9 was used (1995) and reclassified according to ICD-10 by Statistics Norway. The reclassification (double-coding) was performed by special trained personal in governmental offices responsible for official mortality statistics. Although the reclassification covered all causes of death (diseases and injuries) in the sample, our analysis focused on just one ICD chapter XX. This was external causes of mortality (injury deaths), and covered 15 selected categories of injuries.
   Results: The switch from ICD-9 to ICD-10 had a significant net impact on 8 of the 15 selected categories. In Italy, accidental falls decreased by 76%; traffic accidents decreased by 9%; suicide by hanging decreased by 3%; events of undetermined intent decreased by 69%; and overall injury deaths decreased by 4%. These net decreases reflect the moving of death records from injury categories in ICD-9 to other injury or disease categories in ICD-10. In Norway, the number of records in three categories decreased significantly: transport accidents, 9%; traffic accidents, 13%; and suicide by self-poisoning, 18%. No statistically significant differences (net changes) were observed in the total number of accidents, suicides and homicides in either country.
   Conclusions: Switching to ICD-10 did not change the overall trends for accidents, homicides and suicides in either country. However, the number of records in some injury subcategories e. g. accidental falls and traffic accidents, decreased. Changing classification can thus affect the ranking of causes of injury mortality, with consequences for public health policy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The criminal use of weapons is a very topical issue in the industrialized countries and worldwide, and a reconsideration of the legislation governing their possession is warranted. We retrospectively analyzed the homicides and suicides involving the use of firearms and piercing and/or cutting weapons recorded at the Medicolegal Bureau in Milan from January 1, 1993, to December 31, 2008. First we considered the clinical histories of the deceased and the circumstantial details of their deaths, then we examined the data relating to the cause of death recorded in the autopsy reports. Our case series consisted of 414 homicides (54.2%) and 350 suicides (45.8%). Firearms were responsible for more deaths (64%) than piercing and/or cutting weapons (36%). The firearms involved were legally licensed in 40% of cases (suicides) and illegal in 22% (homicides). Our findings suggest the need to review the criteria considered for the issue of firearms licenses, in Italy at least.

AB To report on the effects on health that the 2008 Great Recession is producing in Italy, by comparing the consistency of Italian data with general observations reported in the scientific literature, and by pointing out consequences on the rates of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, male suicidal behaviours, daytime alcohol drinking and traffic fatalities.
   This is an ecological study in which MEDLINE, PsycINFO and PubMed were searched for the literature with combinations of the following keywords: economic recession, financial crisis, unemployment, health, suicide and mental health. Data from two Italian government agencies (Italian Institute of Statistics, ISTAT, and Italian Agency of Drugs, AIFA) in the years from 2000 to 2010 were obtained and analysed, by producing models of multiple linear regressions.
   After the recession onset, all-cause mortality remained stable, and was not associated with the economic fluctuations. Differently, cardiovascular mortality was associated with the rate of unemployment, and showed a significant increase in 2010. Alcohol consumption increased in 2009, the year with the worst real GDP decrease (-5.1 %). Though the total rate of suicide was not associated with the economic situation, male completed and attempted suicides due to financial crisis were significantly associated with the rate of unemployment and the real GDP. The increasing diffusion of antidepressants was not associated with a lowering of the rate of suicide.
   The data on the Italian situation here discussed are sufficiently reliable to conclude that a link exists between the ongoing economic recession and health and mental health of Italians. Further research is needed to understand more in detail and with stronger reliability such link, to support primary and secondary preventive interventions and orient the development of effective sociopolitical interventions.

AB Objective: Evidence that clinical treatment reduces suicide risk in major depressive disorder (MDD) is limited and inconsistent. Since lithium shows major antisuicidal effects in bipolar disorders and in heterogeneous mood disorder samples, we evaluated evidence of antisuicidal effects of lithium in patients with recurrent MDD.
   Data Sources: We searched MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2006; search terms: lithium, suicide, affective disorder, depression, major depression, and mood disorder) for studies reporting suicides or suicide attempts during treatment with and without lithium in recurrent MDD patients, and we added data for 78 new subjects, provided from the Lucio Bini Mood Disorders Research Center in Sardinia, Italy. Suicide rates were pooled and analyzed by use of incidence-rate ratios (IRRs) and meta-analytic methods.
   Data Synthesis: Eight studies involved 329 MDD patients and exposure for 4.56 years (1149 person-years) with, and 6.27 years (1285 person-years) without, lithium. Overall risk of suicides and suicide attempts was 88.5% lower with vs. without lithium: 0.17%/y versus 1.48%/y (IRR = 8.71; 95% CI: 2.10 to 77.2, p =.0005); for completed suicides (85% risk reduction), IRR = 6.77 (95% CI: 1.29 to 66.8, p =.01). Meta-analysis by risk difference and risk ratio supported these findings, and sensitivity analysis yielded similar results with studies omitted serially.
   Conclusions: This is the first meta-analysis suggesting antisuicidal effects of lithium in recurrent MDD, similar in magnitude to that found in bipolar disorders.

AB Objectives: To investigate factors differentiating old-old elderly (those aged 75 years and older) who died by suicide from middle-aged (those aged 50-64 years) and young-old (aged 65-74 years) adults who took their own lives, and from living psychiatric outpatients 75 years and older who had no suicidal behaviors in the last 12 months before assessment. Methods: Cases for psychological autopsy interviews were 117 old-old elderly who died by suicide between 1994 and 2009. Comparisons were 97 young-old adult and 98 middle-aged suicide victims and 117 psychiatric outpatients admitted to the Department of Psychiatry of the University of Parma (Parma, Italy) between 1994 and 2009. Information for suicide decedents was gathered through proxy-based interviews, and data regarding living comparison subjects were extracted from medical records. Results: A high number of old-old elderly were widowed and lived alone before death; widowhood was more prevalent in the old-old elderly than in the younger suicide groups and the psychiatric outpatients. In addition, old-old elderly were more frequently characterized by the presence of life stressors in the few months before death compared with the psychiatric outpatients. Conclusions: Clinicians involved in the prevention of suicide in older adults should pay particular attention to loneliness and lack of social support, two conditions that may push the individual to feel hopeless, especially in those individuals who are facing stressful life events.

AB Background: Affective temperaments have been shown to be related to psychiatric disorders and suicidal behaviors. Less is known about the potential contributory role of affective temperaments on suicide risk factors. In the present study, we investigated whether the effect of affective temperaments on suicide risk was mediated by other variables, such as hopelessness, mentalization deficits, dissociation, psychological pain, and depressive symptoms. Methods: Several assessment instruments, including the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI); the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, and San Diego Autoquestionnaire (TEMPS-A); the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS); the Gotland Male Depression Scale (GMDS); the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES); the Psychological Pain Assessment Scale (PPAS); and the Mentalization Questionnaire (MZQ), were administered to 189 psychiatrically hospitalized patients (103 women, 86 men) in Rome, Italy. Results: In single-mediator models, hopelessness, depressive symptoms, and mentalization, but not psychological pain or dissociation, were significant mediators in the association between prevalent temperament and suicide risk. In a multiple-mediator model, a significant indirect effect was found only for depression. Results demonstrated that patients with negative temperaments reported higher suicide risk, psychological pain, hopelessness, and depression, and less mentalization than patients with no prevalent temperament or hyperthymic temperaments. Conclusions: Hopelessness, depression, and mentalization are all factors that mediate the relation between affective temperaments and suicide risk. Identifying factors that mediate the effects of affective temperamental makeup on suicide risk should enhance screening and intervention efforts.

AB Objectives: The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to evaluate the role of several variables hypothesized in previous research to be associated with suicide in older adults. Design: Psychological autopsy study. Setting: Suicides who were resident in the province of Parma and Piacenza and who died between 1994 and 2004. Participants: Ninety-nine elderly suicides ( age >= 65 years; 77 men and 22 women) and 134 younger comparison suicides ( 115 men and 19 women). Younger victims were subdivided in two more homogeneous groups: young adults ( age < 36 years) and adults ( age: 36-64 years). Measurements: Direct proxy-based interviews with relatives and family physicians. Results: Elderly victims were nine times ( OR=9.09; 95% CI: 1.32-62.63) more likely to live alone, 26 times ( OR = 26.76; 95% CI: 9.04-79.24) more likely to be retired, and 14 times ( OR = 14.57; 95% CI: 2.48 - 85.65) more likely to have attended school for no more than 5 years than adult suicides. Although, more than 50% of older suicides were diagnosed as DSM-IV-TR depressed, only 20%-30% of them had been treated with medications. Conclusion: Diverse patterns of risk factors for suicide have to be evaluated in older adults. Physicians must be aware that the concomitant presence of depressive symptoms and several life events ( especially loss and loneliness in women and physical illness in men) should be considered warning signs for suicidal behavior.

AB Objective. - The aim of the research is to study whether any differences exist in the rates and characteristics of suicide by ethnicity and sex in South Tirol, Italy.
   Methods. - Psychological autopsy interviews were conducted for Suicides who died between March 1997 and July 2006.
   Results. - 332 individuals belonging to the three major South Tirolean ethnic groups (Germans, Italians, Ladins [Ladin is a Rhaeto-Romance language related to the Venetian and Swiss Romansh languages I) (lied by Suicide. Around 23% of the victims had experienced suicidal behaviour among family members, and more than 31% of them had experienced trauma during their childhood. Germans were 1.37 times more at risk to commit suicide than Italians (95% CI: 1.04/1.80 z = 2.26, p < .05). 69% Of the Suicides had attended school for less than 8 years: Germans (OR = 4.62; 95% CI: 2.52/8.47; p < .001) and Ladins (OR = 11.24; 95% CI: 2.99/42.30; p < .001) were more likely to have lower education than Italians. There were several differences by ethnicity and sex but no sex-by-ethnicity interactions.
   Conclusions. - The study indicated that suicide, an alarming health and social problem in south Tirol, may require different preventive interventions for men and women and for those of different ethnicities. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB To verify if attempted suicides follow different seasonal distributions according to the method chosen, we studied the Italian monthly distribution of admissions for attempted suicide in the period 1984-1995 according to gender and age, distinguishing between non-violent (ICD 950-952) and violent (ICD 953-958) attempted suicides. The effect of temperature was also taken into account. A clear asymmetry in seasonal distribution of events can be observed in the oldest age groups in both genders, with a peak in warmer months. Only male attempted suicides by violent methods show a clear asymmetry in seasonal distribution, with a peak in spring months and a trough in autumn months. Spectral analysis, more accurate in detecting seasonal rhythms than analyses that only compare monthly seasonal means, identifies a circannual rhythm for violent suicides in both genders. The seasonal components of total variance in attempted suicides account for 16.5 and 12.4%, respectively, of violent male and female attempted suicides. Among males, a significant (p < 0.05) 4 cycles/year pattern is seen alongside the more relevant (89.4%, p < 0.01) 1 cycle/year distribution. Among females, aside from the 1 cycle/year distribution (63.3%, p < 0.01) noted, a 6 cycles/year pattern is found to contribute significantly (16.9%, p < 0.05) to the seasonal component of variance. A clear relationship with temperature indicators is noted among males: higher temperatures positively correlate with attempted suicides, whereas cooler temperatures seem to exert a protective action. Female attempts show a less evident correlation with indicators of temperature. Sample composition by age and gender and the lack of distinction between methods of attempted suicide may have obscured the seasonal component of some classes of attempted suicide in previous studies. The circannual rhythm found in this study of violent attempted suicide in relation to climate seasonal change confirms the importance of taking chronobiological variables into account in the evaluation of patients at risk of suicide.

AB Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of involuntary admissions with regard to seasonality and clinical associated features, in a sample of patients admitted to a psychiatric unit in a period of 24 months.Methods: All subjects consecutively admitted to the Psychiatric Inpatient Unit of the San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Orbassano (University of Turin, Italy) from September 2013 to August 2015 were recruited. Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were collected.Results: Seven hundred and thirty admissions in psychiatric ward were recognized. The prevalence of involuntary admission was 15.4%. Patients with involuntary hospitalizations showed a higher education level, a higher prevalence of admission in spring/summer with a significant peak in June, a longer duration of hospitalization and a lower suicide ideation. Among involuntary admissions, physical restraint and suicide attempts were more prevalent during spring compared to the other seasons.Conclusions: Seasonality has an important role in the psychopathology of psychiatric disorders, particularly in bipolar and related disorder, and may represent an influencing factor in hospital admissions and hospitalizations. Seasonal pattern must be considered while managing diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders, with regard to prevention and psychoeducation of patients.

AB The aim of this paper was to review current end of life (EOL) practice in Italy. The authors have made an appraisal of the existing literature in order to understand current end aide care practice in Italy. This manuscript focuses on analyzing the dying process, the transoceanic similarities and differences in the end of life decision-making practice, and the Family involvement. The authors acknowledge the importance of the recent Englaro court case verdict on current practice in Italy. Dying has changed as a process over the last century in term of causes of death, costs, communication of the prognosis, and needs of the patient's family. Regardless of national and international guidelines, there is no agreement among Italian doctors regarding the gold standards of daily clinical practice at the EOL. (Minerva Anestesiol 2010;76;203-8)

AB Aims:
   The aim of this survey was to describe patients in care at a large mental health department in northern Italy who attempted suicide, and the clinical management adopted by their psychiatrists before the event.
   Methods:
   Data collection was based on a questionnaire administered to the reference psychiatrists.
   Results:
   Over a period of 12 months, 166 catchment area residents attempted suicide. Sixty-six (40%) had contacted the mental health department in the previous two years and completed data were obtained on 63. Twenty-nine (46%) suffered from mood, 26 (41%) from personality and 11 (18%) from schizophrenic disorders. Thirty-four attempts occurred within one year of psychiatric ward discharge, mostly in the first quarter.
   The reference psychiatrists reported that, at the last evaluation, 38 of 63 patients (60%) presented no change in clinical conditions, and 41 of 63 (68%) were considered at no immediate risk of suicide. Most of the attempted suicides in question (45, 72%) were judged to be unpreventable. In the two logistic regression analyses carried out, no independent variables were able to statistically significantly explain the variance in judged suicidal risk or the preventability of the index attempted suicide.
   Conclusions:
   According to the psychiatrists' descriptions of their last contact with the patients, most attempted suicides have not been preceded by a change in clinical conditions. Moreover, psychiatrists, irrespective of their age and gender, and of patient diagnosis, frequently judged the attempts to have been unpreventable.

AB Suicidality is high in schizophrenia, particularly in first-episode patients. Little is known about patients with prodromal symptoms of psychosis or otherwise high-risk persons.
   In a sample enrolled in an early intervention program implemented in Milan (Italy), a history of attempted Suicide before enrollment was found in 6 first-episode schizophrenia (out of 87, 6.9%), and 7 high-risk of psychosis (out of 81, 8.6%) patients.
   In the first-episode group, a history of suicide attempts was related to a shorter duration of untreated psychosis. In the high-risk group, a family psychiatric history in first/second degree relatives of patients and a personal history of Substance abuse were both associated with an enhanced risk of attempted suicide before enrollment.
   During the first year of treatment, 3 new attempted suicides were recorded among 57 (5.3%) high-risk patients, and none among first-episode patients (n = 58) (no dropout in the sample). The levels of suicide ideation on the BPRS did not differ by group at assessment, and significantly declined from assessment at entry to 1-year follow-up, except in seven HRP patients who become positive for core symptoms of schizophrenia, as measured on the BPRS. At enrollment, patients at high risk of psychosis had the same prevalence of past suicide attempts than first-episode schizophrenia patients: since suicide attempt is the most important predictor of a future suicidal attempt, the assessment of suicide risk should be given a privileged role in patients at high risk of psychosis as well.

ID FEATURES
AB In Italy, railway-related deaths give rise to extensive inquiries because it is mandatory for the public prosecutor to investigate the circumstances of death. For the railway embankment, normal traffic rules are not valid and the guilt of the engine driver usually cannot be proven. Consequently, these cases are very often declared as suicides without adequate evidence. Furthermore, there is a potential risk of confusion with homicide, body dismemberment or mutilation. Our medico-legal institutes are increasingly engaged with expert opinions on questions of accident, suicide or homicide because they lead to complications in the fields of insurance, criminal and civil law.

AB Self-incineration is one of the most dramatic and lethal suicide methods. It is rarely reported in Western countries and is more frequent in developing regions. We illustrate the forensic cases of self-immolation occurring over 24 years in the city of Milan, Italy, highlighting the main issues of such a complex and rare suicide. We selected 33 cases of self-incineration among 23,417 autopsies (4022 suicides) performed at the Department of Legal Medicine of the University of Milan over a period of 24 years (1993-2016). Several parameters were included and analysed: gender and age of the victims, pathological history, previous suicide intentions/attempts, duration of burning, place of death or discovery of the corpse, circumstantial data of fatal events and autopsy findings, with particular attention to thermal injuries. Self-incineration was found in 0.8% of total suicides and 0.14% of total autopsies. One of these cases involved a complex modality (association with plastic-bag suffocation). The typical characteristics of the victim were an Italian man with psychiatric illness, frequently moved by passion, existential discomfort and economic problems. During the 24-year period, the number of cases of self-incineration progressively reduced. This study provides a general overview in one of the biggest metropolitan Italian areas and is one of the few works performed on this topic. It may be helpful in understanding and studying such an unusual manner of suicide.

AB The purpose of the study was to investigate the association between suicide and demographic and socioeconomic measures in Tuscany. Data on standardized rates of suicide from 1997 to 2005 in addition to census-derived variables, income and abstention were derived from the Mortality register, the 2001 Census, the Tax Agency and the Regional Electoral Office databases. Pearson's correlation and stepwise multiple regression analyses (unweighted and weighted by population) were used to analyze the association between suicide rates and demographic and socio-economic measures for the 34 health districts for both males and females. The correlation analyses showed that suicide was significantly associated with many variables in men, but only with old age in women. The multiple regression analyses showed that the best predictors in men were education, single person households and isolated houses (only education and single person households in the weighted model). For women, the best predictors were-the proportion of elderly people and income (this was also true for the weighted model, but in the opposite order). An ecological correlation between suicide and measures of economic deprivation and social fragmentation was found in both men and women. Among the best predictors, isolated houses may act as a marker for remoteness and isolation on a small scale. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Over the past decades, problematic internet use (PIU) has dramatically increased, especially among young people. PIU has been recently associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and autistic traits. Subjects with PIU report an increased suicidal risk and the same has been demonstrated among patients with ASD. The aim of this study was to investigate putative PIU rates among students and explore the correlation between autistic traits and suicide risk. Methods: A sample of 178 high achieving university students was assessed by means of the Adult Autism Subthreshold Spectrum (AdAS Spectrum), Autism Quotient questionnaire (AQ). Suicide risk was investigated by some specific items of the Trauma and Loss Spectrum-Self Report (TALS-SR) and putative PIU was identified on the basis of a specific AdAS Spectrum item. Results: 27.5% subjects reporting putative PIU. This subgroup showed higher scores in all domains of AdAS Spectrum and AQ compared with others. Students with putative PIU showed a significant correlation between suicide risk and the non-verbal communication domain of the AdAS Spectrum and the Social skills domain of the AQ. Conclusions: We found that students with PIU show higher levels of autistic traits compared to those without PIU. A significant correlation was found between autistic traits and suicide risk.

AB In order to assess whether substance-abusing people show a higher risk of dying from unintentional acute intoxication in specific periods of the year, and whether this unevenly distributed risk is subject to the same seasonal influences observed in suicide cases, we studied a total of 15 792 drug-related deaths ( males = 14259; females = 1533) and 20 332 deaths by suicide ( males = 15 571; females = 4761), ascertained in Italy among 15 - 44-year-old people from 1984 to 2000. Distribution of deaths by month was studied with circular statistic techniques, based on the maximization of mean vector length method and the Rayleigh test. The monthly distribution of deaths over the study period followed an uneven trend that clearly differed, however, between the two time-series characterizing suicides and drug-related deaths. A clear seasonal variation was found for suicides in both genders, recurring on a significant circannual cycle. No circannual cycle was observed in the monthly distribution of drug-related deaths, which seem to be influenced by non-casual oscillations following a thrice-yearly cycle, linked to a significantly more evident 6-month recurrence. Some periods of the year, however, are clearly and consistently linked to an enhanced risk of dying by unintentional, acute intoxication by illicit drugs.

AB The article looks into the case involving Fabiano Antoniani, who, following a major road accident, was left tetraplegic. Marco Cappato drove him to a Swiss clinic where Mr. Antoniani took his own life by self-administration of lethal pentobarbital sodium. Cappato was put on trial, but the Italian Constitutional Court urged the Parliament to decriminalise assisted suicide in extremely serious cases. From a comparison with other European countries, approaches range from restrictive (banning both active euthanasia and assisted suicide), to entirely permissive. An intermediate approach only entails a ban on active euthanasia. It would be desirable to uniformise the diverse national statutes on a European level, which would make it possible for everyone to receive assistance towards ending their suffering, with limitations to incurable cases to be medically verified, and at the end of a path designed to ensure that patient freedom of choice is upheld at all time.

AB The objective of the study is to evaluate temporal trends, gender effects and methods of completed suicide amongst children and adolescent (aged 10-17) when compared with temporal trends of deaths from other causes. Data were extracted from the Italian Mortality Database, which is collected by the Italian National Census Bureau (ISTAT) and processed by the Statistics Unit of National Centre for Epidemiology, Surveillance and Health Promotion (CNESPS) at the National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di SanitA ). A total of 1,871 children and adolescents, age 10-17 years, committed suicide in Italy from 1971 to 2003 and 109 died by suicide during the last 3-year period of observation (2006-2008). The average suicide rate over the entire period of observation was 0.91 per 100,000; the rate was 1.21 for males and 0.59 for females. During the study period, the general mortality of children and adolescents, age 10-17 years, decreased dramatically, the average annual percentage change decrease was of -3.3% (95% CI -4.4 to -1.9) for males and -2.9% (95% IC -4.4 to -2.5) for females. The decrease was observed, for both genders, for all causes of deaths except suicide. For males, the most frequent method was hanging (54.5%), followed by shooting/fire arms (19.6%), falls/jumping from high places (12.7%); for females, the most frequent method, jumping from high places/falls, accounted for 35.7% of suicides during the whole study period. In conclusion, this study highlights that over the course of several decades suicide is a far less preventable cause of death as compared to other causes of death amongst children and adolescents. Our study demonstrated that suicide rates in adolescents are not a stable phenomenon over the 40 years period of study. It suggested that rates for males and females differed and varied in different ways during specific time periods of this study. National suicide prevention actions should parallel prevention measures implemented to reduce other causes of death.

AB BACKGROUND: Suicidal behaviour represents a social and health-related issue of prime importance in both the general and psychiatric population. People with mental illness are at great risk of suicide, but indirect evidence suggests that the treatment of psychiatric disorders may prevent suicide. The aim of our study was to compare the risk of suicide in the population of psychiatric patients with that of the general population in Friuli Venezia-Giulia (FVG).
   METHOD: We analyzed the suicide rates, based on the official statistical database, relating to the resident population in FVG during the years 1998 - 1999. The sucide rates ( per 100 000 subjects) were standardised by sex and age. The characteristics of suicidal behaviour in subjects who had been in contact with ( Community Mental Health Centres) CMHC ( n = 65) were compared with that of suicidal subjects not in contact ( n = 237).
   RESULTS: There was an increase in the suicide phenomenon in the elderly population in FVG over the tested period. The rates were three times higher in males than in females. The rates of patients in contact with CMHC in 1998 and in 1999 were, respectively, 14 and 20 times higher than that of the general population. Most suicidal schizophrenics and 37% of the depressed patients have been previously hospitalised.
   CONCLUSION: The population of north-eastern Italy is at high risk of suicide compared to other regions. The mortality ratio of psychiatric subjects who commit suicide in our sample is elevated. Since Italian community-oriented services rely less on hospitalisation than in other countries, the fact that about 50% of suicidal psychiatric patients have been previously admitted in a psychiatric ward may indicate that previous hospitalisation is a hierarchic factor related to suicide.

   TRENDS; CRIME; AGE; TOXICOLOGY
AB Circadian and seasonal rhythms have an impact on the risk of violent death in humans, with more evidence available in suicide than in homicide. This study set out to investigate the pattern of deaths by homicide in Italy, taking into account the month, the day of the week and the time of day when the homicidal incident happened. Data based on official statistics on deaths by homicide (n = 3894) from 2003 to 2008 were analysed by spectral analysis and circular statistics techniques based on the Rayleigh test. Homicides showed seasonal distribution with a bimodal pattern, with summer (July and August) and winter (December and January) peaks over the other seasons. Homicides also peaked on Sundays and Mondays and were at their highest at night-time (00:00 to 5:59 hours). These rhythms in homicide victimization could be accounted for by social factors within the framework of the routine activity theory - by psychological factors, including those leading to domestic violence, and by biological factors, including those impacting on impulse dyscontrol. The identification of risk or protective factors involved in the victim's surviving or succumbing to an assault might be important for the prevention of the worst outcome of injury at large, suicides and accidents included.

AB Introduction. Ketamine is an essential medicine used as an anesthetic in low and middle-income countries and in veterinary medicine. Recreational use is widespread throughout the world, especially owing to its lower price compared to other substances. In Western countries its use has been mainly linked to subpopulations of young people who use drugs recreationally. Ketamine misuse is associated with amnesia, dependence, dissociation, lower urinary tract dysfunction and poor impulse control. Regular ketamine use is associated with abdominal pains.
   Aims. The aims of this study are to analyze characteristics and main symptoms of ketamine abusers attending emergency departments (EDs) in the metropolitan area of Bologna, Emilia-Romagna Region, northern Italy.
   Methods. We identified 74 records of ketamine-related visits: 30% female; 22% nonnatives; mean age 25.6 years. Forty-two percent reported ketamine use alone, 46% reported the use of other illegal substance (cocaine 19%, heroin 18%), 26% alcohol misuse.
   Results. The most common reported symptoms were neurological (soporous state 18%, agitation 14%, confusion 7%, panic attacks 7%, mydriasis 7%, tremors 7%), gastro-intestinal (abdominal pain 15%, vomiting 11%), urological (6.8%) and cardiac (palpitations 5%, chest pain 5%). Complications secondary to falls and cuts (7%) were the most frequent trauma complications. We highlight a significant number of visits regarding suicide attempts (10%) and overdose (4%).
   Conclusions. The results highlight a particular population of problematic ketamine users identified using the hospital's ICT system. In particular, poly-drug users who consume ketamine in combination with heroin or cocaine presenting to the ED represent a specific target for targeted prevention projects on non-lethal overdoses and suicide attempts.

AB Background: Prospective cohort studies on biological risk factors of completed suicide are scarce. We aimed to test which biological risk factors independently identify subjects at increased risk of suicidal death.
   Methods: In the prospective cohort of the Seven Countries Study, 5,321 middle-aged men from Finland, Serbia, Italy, and Greece were included. Completed suicide (ICD-8 codes E950-959) was assessed during 40 years of follow-up. Biological cardiovascular risk factors (including forced vital capacity [FVC] and height) were tested for their role as predictors in multivariable Cox models stratified by country.
   Results: There were 4518 deaths during follow-up, with 64 from suicide (1.4%). In univariable models, only FVC and height were strongly inversely related with suicide. Socio-economic status and being unmarried were potential confounders. In multivariable models taking these confounders into account, both a low FVC (0.30 for top vs. lowest quartile: 95% CI: 0.12-0.76: P=0.006 for trend) and a low FVC/height ratio (0.37 for top vs. lowest quartile; 95% CI: 0.17-0.82; P=0.004 for trend) were strongly inversely related with completed suicide.
   Limitations: Information oil proximal causes, such as prior Suicidal ideation, emotional distress and depression, was lacking at baseline.
   Conclusions: Poor respiratory function in middle-aged men was an independent risk factor for completed suicide. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The risk of suicide in Bipolar Disorder (BD) has been estimated up to 20-30 times higher compared with the general population. Previous suicide attempts (SAs) represent a well-established risk factor for further attempts and for death by suicide in patients with psychiatric disorders. However, little is known about the socio-demographic and clinical profile of BD patients with a history of multiple SAs (MSAs). The present study sought to characterize BD patients with MSAs versus single suicide attempt (SSA) within a large Italian sample.
   Methods: An original sample of 354 bipolar patients, recruited at the University Clinic and related community services at the Department of Psychiatry, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico of Milan (Italy), was screened for the presence of previous SAs (n = 95). Socio-demographic and clinical variables were then compared between patients with multiple vs single lifetime suicide attempts.
   Results: Bipolar patients with MSAs versus SSA had longer bipolar illness duration (26.9 +/- 12.6 vs 21.2 12.8 years; p = 0.05), and more frequently lived alone (38.5% vs 17.2%; p < 0.05), had more than one psychiatric comorbidity (39.3% vs 17.5%; p = 0.04), and utilized substance ingestion (e.g., overdose) (78.6% vs 47.2%, p = 0.009), although the latter was the most common suicide attempt method in both groups.
   Conclusion: Present findings suggest different socio-demographic and clinical characteristics in bipolar patients with MSAs versus SSA. Further investigation is needed to confirm reported data. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID INJURY
AB The captive bolt pistol is an atypical firearm exclusively produced and used for butchery of breeding animals, but in some rare cases. it has been used as a lethal weapon for committing suicide by butchers, breeders and other people who have access to such weapons during then professional activities. This study describes the suicide committed by a butcher in the province of Udine (N. Italy) in 2001 who shot himself with his own captive bolt pistol that produced in the right temporal region a circular wound and a bone lesion of the temporal squama with it groove involving the frontal lobed he died five days later of the fatal consequences of the meningo-encephalic lesions. The medico-legal issues implicated in this case, seen in the light of the data reported in the international literature, illustrate the difficulties faced when diagnosing these types of lesions. bearing in mind their rarity and peculiar nature. and introduce elements of differcritial diagnosis regarding lesions produced by similar weapons that lead to ascertainment of the event as accidental, suicidal, or homicidal.

AB Purpose: The WHO/EURO multicentre study on suicidal behaviour showed the lowest rates of suicide attempts in the Italian centre of Padua. Present study aims to discover changes in non-fatal suicidal behaviour rates and characteristics by comparing hospital-admitted subjects in two study periods (1992-1996 and 2002-2006).
   Methods: Data were obtained from the University Hospital of Padua. The crude prevalence rates of events and persons by year per 100,000 (subjects aged 15+ years) were calculated. Rate ratios, Chi-square tests and t tests were calculated.
   Results: The mean prevalence rate per year showed a significant increase during the second study period from 59.2 to 93.6 per 100,000 (RR = 1.58, 95%CI = 1.24-2.02). Changes were significant for both genders, but the increase was stronger in males. The proportion of subjects with non-fatal suicidal behaviour was highest in the youngest age group (15-29 years) in the first period and in adults (30-44 years) in the second period. The absolute number of subjects with non-fatal suicidal behaviour increased more than two times for adults aged 30-44 years. Changes in other age groups were minor. The absolute numbers of non-Italian-born subjects with non-fatal suicidal behaviour increased from 11 to 135 persons. The proportion of poisoning was significantly lower in the second period.
   Conclusions: When comparing the time periods 1992-1996 and 2002-2006, there was a significant increase in suicidal events in Padua. There have been remarkable changes in the characteristics of suicide attempt(er)s. The most remarkable change was in the number of non-Italian-born subjects, who should be specifically targeted by suicide prevention activities.

AB ObjectivesTo report worldwide trends in suicidemortality during a period that covers 7years after the 2008 global crisis.MethodsWe performed a time trend analysis with joinpoint regression.ResultsOver the 2000s, suicide mortality decreased with the largest declines observed in some Eastern European countries. The downward trends were followed by an increase in concomitance with the 2008 global crisis in some countries, including Greece (annual percentage change=+6 in men and +11.8 in women), the Netherlands (+4.2 in men and +4.0 in women), and the UK (+1.6 in men), while the pre-crisis downward trends stopped in Germany, Italy, and Spain. The joinpoint analysis also revealed long-term rises in Brazil (+0.8 since 1990 in men and +1.8 since 1999 in women), Mexico (+1.3 since 1995 in men and +3.6 since 1990 in women), the USA (+1.7 since 2005 in men and +4.2 since 2010 in women), and Australia (+1.8 in men and +3.7 in women, since 2006 in both sexes).ConclusionsDespite downward trendsin several areas of the world, in some countries suicide rates increased since the 2008 global crisis.

ID HUMAN REMAINS; FIRE; IMMOLATION; DEATHS
AB Suicide by self-incineration is an uncommon method of suicide in the western world in contrast with Asian countries, where this type of suicide is more common. If there is a lack of witnesses, genetic analysis for identification is mandatory, especially when anthropologic or dental identification is barely significant.
   The authors report a case of self-incineration of a 55-year-old white man, which occurred near Siena, Tuscany, Italy.
   The recovered bones were classified according to the Crow-Glassman scale and assigned to category 5 (the highest extent of combustion according to this scale). Therefore, because of the extent of the bone damage, analyzing the residual soft tissue around the pelvic bones was the only way to reach a genetic identification.
   The authors report this case to emphasize that even if the highest level of burn injury to human body is reached, an accurate analysis of the findings may lead to a genetic identification. In these cases, an efficient cooperation among police, fire experts, and forensics is necessary, especially because it is the only way to determine if the modality of death was accidental, suicidal, or homicidal.

   DEPRESSION
AB Background: There have been only a few reports illustrating the moderate effectiveness of suicide-preventive interventions in reducing suicidal behavior, and, in most of those studies, the target populations were primarily adults, whereas few focused on adolescents. Essentially, there have been no randomized controlled studies comparing the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and cultural adaptability of suicide-prevention strategies in schools. There is also a lack of information on whether suicide-preventive interventions can, in addition to preventing suicide, reduce risk behaviors and promote healthier ones as well as improve young people's mental health.
   The aim of the SEYLE project, which is funded by the European Union under the Seventh Framework Health Program, is to address these issues by collecting baseline and follow-up data on health and well-being among European adolescents and compiling an epidemiological database; testing, in a randomized controlled trial, three different suicide-preventive interventions; evaluating the outcome of each intervention in comparison with a control group from a multidisciplinary perspective; as well as recommending culturally adjusted models for promoting mental health and preventing suicidal behaviors.
   Methods and design: The study comprises 11,000 adolescents emitted from randomized schools in 11 European countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden serving as the scientific coordinating center. Each country performs three active interventions and one minimal intervention as a control group. The active interventions include gatekeeper training (QPR), awareness training on mental health promotion for adolescents, and screening for at-risk adolescents by health professionals. Structured questionnaires are utilized at baseline, 3- and 12-month follow-ups in order to assess changes.
   Discussion: Although it has been reported that suicide-preventive interventions can be effective in decreasing suicidal behavior, well-documented and randomized studies are lacking. The effects of such interventions in terms of combating unhealthy lifestyles in young people, which often characterize suicidal individuals, have never been reported. We know that unhealthy and risk-taking behaviors are detrimental to individuals' current and future health. It is, therefore, crucial to test well-designed, longitudinal mental health-promoting and suicide-preventive interventions by evaluating the implications of such activities for reducing unhealthy and risk behaviors while concurrently promoting healthy ones.

AB Background: The atrocity of 9/11 exemplified 'external' caused civil violent deaths, which have major policy implications for the countries contributing armed forces to the 'Coalition-In-Iraq' [C.I.I]. C.I.I Government's resources for perennial 'internal' violent deaths (suicide, homicide and road), are likely to be threatened by alternative priorities. C.I.I 'internal' deaths are compared with those of 9/11 to provide information to determine relative risks.
   Material/Methods: To uniformly compare mortality between countries we utilise the most recent WHO mortality data, taking the latest three years 1997-1999 and calculating an average annual number and rate of 'internal' deaths in each country, these are compared with the 9/11 fatalities, calculating a proportional ratio, as an indicator of differential damage to families and society.
   Results: USA 'external' deaths were 3,074 people and annual average suicides were 30,966. Total 'internal' deaths exceeded 'external' more than 30 times. Every fortnight there are more USA 'internal' violent deaths than on 9/11. Except Australia and Bulgaria, every country had more suicides than died on 9/11. Apart from Bulgaria, total 'internal' deaths exceeded the 'external' toll in all other CAI countries- by 14 times in Japan; 6 in Republic of Korea, 4 in Italy, 3 in Spain and the UK, twice in Canada and 1.5 times in Australia.
   Conclusions: The extent of 'internal' civil violent deaths, such as suicide, highlight the perennial pressures upon psychiatric services and the need to defend resources at a time of competing priorities.

AB Objective: A recent article reported a reduction in the suicide rate in the inhabitants of L'Aquila (Italy) in 2009, when on the night of April 6, a devastating earthquake struck the city. The potential implications of the role of resilience in the aftermath of natural disasters, together with the limitations of existing evidence on this topic, suggest a need for more research. We aimed to retrospectively investigate the impact of the L'Aquila earthquake on a standardized self-reported measure of health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
   Methods: HRQoL data were collected through 2 separate cross-sectional surveys conducted during 2008 and 2010, before and after the earthquake that occurred in 2009, on 2 random samples of adults living in L'Aquila.
   Results: The data seemed to suggest no decrease in the inhabitants' HRQoL level after the disaster, which may suggest the role of resilience in supporting survivors' HRQoL. The findings were also consistent with previous observations of a reduction in the suicide rate in the same inhabitants after the earthquake.
   Conclusions: After a natural disaster, people likely activate personal resources and protective social factors that result in better subjective outcomes.

DT Review
DE Euthanasia; Assisted suicide; Legal liability; Europe
ID OF-LIFE PRACTICES; CHILDREN; TRENDS
AB INTRODUCTION: End-of-life legislation, because of its bioethical, medico-legal, and judicial implications, is heatedly disputed in Europe and throughout the world, engendering a variety of legal end-of-life care options in different countries. We thought it could be interesting to compare the Italian law with current European legislation regulating end-of-life matters.
   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic search of the Medline, Cochrane Central, Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases was conducted using the search words: "euthanasia", "law", "Europe", and "assisted suicide". The search word "euthanasia" was entered singly or in combination with each of the other search terms.
   EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: To date, only three countries in Europe (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) have legalized euthanasia, and four countries (Switzerland, France, Austria, Germany) permit only assisted suicide. Acceptance by the general public of euthanasia and assisted suicide increased in 11 of 13 European countries between 1981 and 2008, in parallel with a decrease in religiosity (except for Italy and Holland) and an increase in secularization. There was also a trend toward a correlation between an increase of the value of self-determination in important life issues and an increase in acceptance of euthanasia.
   CONCLUSIONS: This review shows that end-of-life decisions constitute a challenge for political governance and bioethical deliberation in modern liberal democracies. It appears that in certain situations, euthanasia is perceived more as a means to reduce health care costs rather than an ethical question regarding self-determination.

AB Aim: To assess whether substance-abusing people have a higher risk of dying from unintentional acute intoxication in specific periods of the year. Methods: A total of 15 792 deaths (males = 14 259; females = 1533) were ascertained to be due to unintentional acute intoxication by illicit drugs in Italy in the study period (1984-2000). Distribution of deaths by month was studied with circular statistics techniques, based on the maximization of mean vector length (MMVL) method. The Rayleigh test was used to verify the hypothesis of uniform distribution of the events across some relevant periods. Density estimates for significant periodicities were derived with the kernel method for circular variables. Results: Over the study period there was a steady increase in the number of deaths by overdose in Italy, affecting both genders, but more evident among males. The monthly distribution of deaths over the study period followed an uneven trend, with a slightly higher risk in the period between December and January, and in August, in both genders. The monthly distribution of deaths due to unintentional acute intoxication by illicit drugs appears influenced by non-casual oscillations following a thrice-yearly cycle, interlaced with a significantly more evident 6-monthly recurrence. Conclusions: There does seem to be a higher risk of dying from unintentional overdose in specific periods of the year. Better knowledge of the factors affecting the risk of mortality among substance-abusing people-due to changes in environmental or biological rhythms - could allow prediction of negative events, hence their prevention.

AB Ethical issues regarding patient care have recently been raised in Italy by the case of Eluana Englaro, a 36-year-old woman who remained in a persistent vegetative state (PVS) for 17 years. There are no specific laws on the books in Italy regarding euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. In November 2008, a controversial decision by the Italian Supreme Court granted the woman's father his wish to discontinue nutrition and hydration provided to her. Because of this historic decision, the authors carried out a survey of Italian physicians' beliefs regarding end-of-life practices.
   A questionnaire was e-mailed to 70,000 physicians working for the Italian Public Health System and University Medical Hospitals.
   A total of 22,219 doctors responded to the questionnaire (32.3%), of whom 17,252 (77.6%) had some experience in treating PVS patients. Nearly 70% of responding doctors were aware of PVS diagnostic criteria; most of them (61%) considered tube feeding to be a medical therapy, and 66% of respondents believed that withdrawal of assisted nutrition and hydration (ANH) might be appropriate depending on the patient's wishes. Moreover, even though 50% of doctors surveyed were not in favor of euthanasia, a significant percentage (42%) did approve of it, while 8% of this sample was uncertain.
   Italian doctors probably have the least experience in end-of-life decisions in Europe, therefore this national survey is a great chance to understand their authentic opinions regarding such remarkable issues. There is broad consensus that a clear legislative position regarding euthanasia and ANH is needed.

AB Many studies have shown that women are more religious than men, a difference long accepted as an established fact in the sociology of religion. But some recent research has revealed that this difference is not 'universal', varying in space and time. However, only a few scholars have focused on religiosity gender-gap trends over time, either on the theoretical or empirical levels. The aim of this article is to help fill this gap by analysing the progress of gender differences in religiosity from 1981 to 2009 in Italy, an interesting cultural context because of the gradual penetration of secularisation and the high level of gender inequality. Our empirical analysis is based on a longitudinal approach, using data from the European Values Study. The findings show that the gender gap in Italy was quite stable in regard to many aspects of religiosity, with three noteworthy exceptions: the gender gap decreased in beliefs, in intergenerational transmission of faith and in adherence to the Church's doctrines on prostitution, abortion, divorce, euthanasia, suicide and adultery. Contrary to expectations, in most cases this narrowing came about because of an increase in men's religiosity, not a decrease in women's.

AB The Italian mental health care is based on Law 180 (it. Legge 180), also called Legge Basaglia, from the name of the author of the reform, Franco Basaglia. It was adopted on May 13th 1978. The new legislation resulted from the actions of a strong anti-psychiatric movement and it brought about a major change in the organization of psychiatric care. The reform and its consequences were widely studied by the researchers, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The authors point out many successes of the reform, especially in its beginning. They seek the sources of its failure in a faulty and incomplete implementation. Legge Basaglia completely changed the structure of mental health care in Italy, finally bringing psychiatry back to medicine and the general hospitals, as well as promoting community-based psychiatry. Deinstitutionalization in Italy was not related to an increase in compulsory psychiatric hospitalizations, suicide attempts by the mentally ill, nor did it raise the number of crimes committed by them. It also did not cause common trans-institutionalization, with the transfer of patients to the private sector, as predicted by its opponents.

AB Studies of happiness or subjective well-being (SWB) employ a variety of conceptualizations and item formats. Some authorities prefer to focus on the cognitive or evaluative component of SWB in studies of national happiness, and consider the affective component a lesser priority. However, we show that the latter component has unique and important predictive properties. We measured the stable element of the affective component (being "usually happy and in a good mood") in 44,096 respondents recruited probabilistically from 56 societies (nations and some ethnic groups), from all inhabited continents. Consistent with previous studies, we obtained the highest positive affect scores in the nations of northern Latin America and Africa, whereas the highest percentages of respondents "rarely in a good mood" were recorded in East Asia, Russia, Italy, and the Arab world. Our happiness measure is a significant negative predictor of national suicide rates and cigarette consumption, after controlling for other plausible predictors, including other SWB measures from the World Values Survey, Veenhoven's World Database of Happiness, and climate and socioeconomic variables.

AB Immigrants may experience several negative consequences as a result of their migration including discrimination, unsatisfactory economic conditions, and rejection from the host countries, which may contribute to psychiatric illness and vulnerability to suicidal behaviors. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether or not the theorized components of measured dimensions of suicide risk and psychopathology vary across samples of Italians and immigrants.
   We investigated 237 Italians and 234 immigrants, who were administered self-report questionnaires to assess temperament (TEMPS-A), hopelessness (BHS), personality (EPQ-R), and self-other perception (9AP).
   Multi-group confirmatory factor analyses were conducted, which yielded a final model with an excellent fit to the data (chi ((53)) (2) = 57.56; CFI = 0.994; RMSEA = 0.014). This final model fits significantly better than the previously tested models and indicated that the same pattern of relationships was found between suicide risk and psychopathology across both groups.
   Although immigrants represent a unique population and may experience specific stressors contributing to psychopathology and suicide risk, our findings suggest that the samples of Italians and immigrants may be more similar on the study variables under investigation than previously thought. Implications are offered for the improved identification and treatment of immigrants and resident citizens in Europe in general and in Italy in particular.

AB Femicide is the intentional killing of a woman because she is female, and often occurs when there are pre-existing relations, intimate or otherwise, between the victim and the murderer.
   A retrospective epidemiological study was made of 34 female homicides recorded in a university departmental register of post-mortems, pertaining to a judicial district of about 700,000 inhabitants in north eastern Italy, during a 21-year period from January 1st 1993 to December 31st 2013.
   The temporal trend, the socio-demographic characteristics of victims and perpetrators, the circumstances surrounding the crime and the risk factors for femicide were studied with the aim of identifying and developing preventive strategies.

AB Background: The evidence on the association between politics and health is scarce considering the importance of this topic for population health. Studies that investigated the effect of different political regimes on health outcomes show inconsistent results. Methods: Bayesian time-series cross-section analyses are used to examine the overall impact of regional politics on variations in Italian regional life expectancy (LE) at birth during the period 1980-2010. Our analyses control for trends in and unobserved determinants of regional LE, correct for temporal as well as spatial autocorrelation, and employ a flexible specification for the timing of the political effects. Results: In the period from 1980 to 1995, we find no evidence that the communist, left-oriented coalitions and Christian Democratic, centre-oriented coalitions have had an effect on regional LE. In the period from 1995 onwards, after a major reconfiguration of Italy's political regimes and a major healthcare reform, we again find no evidence that the Centre-Left and Centre-Right coalitions have had a significant impact on regional LE. Conclusion: The presented results provide no support for the notion that different regional political regimes in Italy have had a differential effect on regional LE, even though Italian regions have had considerable and increasing autonomy over healthcare and health-related policies and expenditures.

AB Evidence from a range of sources demonstrates that end-of-life (EoL) care practices and preferences vary across countries; culture is consistently one of the main explanations given for this. In order to understand how cultural factors are used. to explain similarities and differences in EoL care between Spain, Italy and Portugal, database and hand searches were performed and cross-cutting core themes identified. Similarities included higher proportions of people who wished to die at home than actually died at home, a persistent trend for partial disclosure in Italy and Spain, low use of advance directives, and low incidence of all medical EoL decisions (with the exception of terminal sedation) compared to northern European countries. The role of religion and the importance of family ties were the two main cultural factors used to explain the similarities. Further research is needed in order to interpret the important differences that were also found. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study set out to explore the frequency and correlates of suicidal ideation in a community sample of school-aged adolescents living in a northeastern area of Italy. The study involved a mixed male-female sample of 1000 adolescents. corresponding to 10% of the young population aged 15-19 in the district. We investigated psychological distress through the revised Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R), from which we also derived our indicators on suicidality (items concerning hopelessness and suicidal ideation). Propensity to aggression was measured with an Italian version of the Aggression Questionnaire. Females scored significantly higher than males on all SCL-90-R subscales, with the exception of the hostility subscale. In our sample, 30.8% of females and 25.3% of males reported having thought about suicide; one adolescent out of 20 reported suicidal ideation of high intensity (5% out of the total sample in both (genders). Males scored significantly higher than females on the Aggression Questionnaire. Both males and females who reported suicidal feelings had significantly higher scores on the Aggression Questionnaire than did those who denied suicidal ideation. Suicidal ideation is a rather widespread occurrence among adolescents and correlates with other indicators of psychological distress. Psychological distress in adolescence might also be expressed through turbulent behaviors and conduct disorders. Identification of the mental disorders underlying a higher propensity to aggression might help to prevent other negative outcomes such as suicide. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aims and background. In Italy, euthanasia and assisted suicide remain illegal but have been the subject of constant debate. Such discussions, however, seem to take relatively little account of physicians' views and attitudes.
   Methods and study design. We used an anonymous questionnaire to survey the attitudes and practices concerning euthanasia and the care of terminally ill patients of 5000 Italian physicians from among the approximately 20,000 members of seven of the most important Italian scientific societies. They were asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire consisting of 15 items, which also collected demographic and professional information.
   Results. The response rate was 23.5%, and 855 questionnaires were returned. The respondents (75% males) had a median age of 51 years and 47% practiced medicine in a hospital or university setting. The survey showed that the attitude of Italian physicians towards caring for terminal patients is generally against the practice of euthanasia insofar as 84% and 87%, respectively, would, on a theoretical basis, be unwilling to prescribe or administer lethal drugs. Only 1.2-2% of the physicians declared that they had resorted at least once to active euthanasia practices consisting of the prescription and/or direct administration of lethal drugs during their professional lives, and 0.5-0.9% during the previous year. The main factor significantly influencing the opinions and behaviors of the physicians was religion.
   Conclusions. To our knowledge, this is the first Italian survey investigating the opinions and practices on euthanasia of a large sample of physicians from all over the country, belonging to various medical specialties. Our findings confirm the considerable influence of religion on physician's opinions and practice concerning end-of-life care. Free full text available at www.tumorionline.it

AB Completed suicide (CS) is a leading cause of death worldwide and its rates are available for most developed countries. On the other hand, attempted suicide (AS) is a risk factor for CS but there are limited data on its rates in various countries. In constructing a ratio for AS/CS rates, most would agree that for CS, the denominator should be the annual suicide rate ( per 100 000). As for the ratio's numerator (AS) per 100 000, there are three possible calculations: (1) annual prevalence from population surveys, (2) annual prevalence from national clinical registers or (3) lifetime prevalence from population surveys. We think that the first possibility would probably be the best choice but, unfortunately, surveys providing the annual prevalence of AS are lacking for most countries. Annual prevalence from national registers is also lacking for most countries and is contaminated by under-reporting. Therefore, in this editorial, we are left with only the last option, a ratio for lifetime prevalence of AS (per 100 000) divided by annual rate of CS (per 100 000). This ratio for AS/CS rates appears to differ substantially across countries worldwide but presents no big regional differences other than two remarkable exceptions, one per continent. In Europe, Spain and France had greater ratios (174.4 and 152.5, respectively) than Italy (64.1). In Asia/Pacific, New Zealand has a higher ratio (345.9) compared with China (75.8) and Japan (76.9). The ratio for AS/CS rates could be a good index for implementing evidence-informed decision-making regarding suicidal behaviour (SB) among health service managers, and for helping them in the allocation of health resources for the prevention of SB.

TI Relatives' attitudes towards informing patients about the diagnosis of

SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English

ID DEMENTIA; SUICIDE; TRUTH; TELL; TOLD
AB Objectives: To evaluate relatives' attitudes towards informing patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) about their diagnosis.
   Setting: A university hospital in Italy.
   Methods: The closest relatives of each of 71 subjects diagnosed for the first time as having AD were interviewed, using a semistructured questionnaire. Spontaneous requests by relatives not to communicate issues concerning the diagnosis were also recorded.
   Results: Forty three (60.6%) relatives spontaneously requested that patients not be fully informed. After being interviewed, nobody thought that the patient should be given all the information. Justifications were related to the fear of the onset or worsening of depressive symptoms in the patient.
   Conclusions: In Italy relatives' opposition to informing AD patients appears to be common. Knowledge of the relatives' attitudes may be useful for clinicians but disclosure of diagnosis should be based on the clinical evaluation of the patient and on a prudent evaluation of the relationship between the patient and her/his relative caregiver.

AB In 1978 Italy implemented Law Number 180, the reform law that blocked all new admissions to public mental hospitals. After 40 years without mental hospitals, we aim at understanding the consequences of the Italian reform in terms of mental health care facility and staff availability. We compared the organization of the Italian mental health system with that of countries belonging to the Group of 7 (G7) major advanced economies. Italy has nearly 8 psychiatrists, 20 nurses, 2 social workers and less than 3 psychologists per 100,000 population, while for example in France there were 22 psychiatrists, in Japan 102 nurses, in the United States 18 social workers, and in Canada and France more than 45 psychologists per 100,000 population. In terms of inpatient facilities, no beds in mental hospitals were available in Italy, while in the other G7 countries mental hospital beds ranged from 8 in the United Kingdom to 204 in Japan per 100 000 population. In Italy there were fewer beds for acute care in general hospitals but more beds in community residential facilities than in the other G7 countries. Service use data showed variability in the provision of mental health care throughout the country. Soon after the implementation of the Italian reform the absolute number of compulsory admissions progressively declined, from more than 20,000 in 1978 to less than 9000 in 2015. Alongside the progressive decline of psychiatric beds imposed by Law 180, the age-adjusted suicide rate remained stable, ranging from 7.1/100,000 population in 1978 to 6.3/100,000 population in 2012. The population of psychiatric patients placed in Italian forensic psychiatric hospitals progressively declined. During the last 40 years without mental hospitals, Italy has seen a progressive consolidation of a community-based system of mental health care. We highlighted, however, reasons for concern, including a decreasing staffing level, a potential use of community residential facilities as long-stay residential services, a still too high variability in service provision across the country, and lack of national data on physical restraints. At a national level, the resources allocated to mental health care are lower in Italy than in other high-income countries.

AB Interest in focus group discussions has grown recently, and so has the recognition of them as a valuable method for qualitative data collection. Despite increasing popularity, they are not an easy option, and moderators must find appropriate ways to approach participants to achieve good-quality data. A path to reach this aim is the inclusion in the focus group agenda of some "exercises" (or activity-oriented questions) that are enjoyable and productive supplements to questions. Exercises provide a different way of gathering information and are beneficial, for instance, for more reflective participants. They can help focus the group's attention on the core study topic and also make subsequent comparative analysis more straightforward. They can also be helpful with young people and to discuss sensitive topics. The author describes and provides suggestions for use and examples of several exercises, illustrating their application in a research project investigating the cultural meaning of youth suicide in university students in Italy, India, and Australia.

AB Background: Male and female physicians are at elevated suicide risk. The work environment has become a focus of attention as a possible contributor to this risk. The potential association between work environment and suicidal thoughts has been examined among female physicians in several countries, and significant findings have been reported.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the role of the work environment in relation to suicidal thoughts among male university hospital physicians in 2 European countries.
   Methods: Cross-sectional multivariate analysis was performed to identify significant associations between work-related factors and suicide risk among male physicians from the Health and Organization among University Hospital Physicians in Europe (HOUPE) study. The dependent variable was termed recent suicidal thoughts, which includes having thought about suicide and/or having thought about specific ways to commit suicide within the previous year. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and CIs are reported.
   Results: Of the 456 Swedish (56%) and 241 Italian (39%) male physicians who participated, 12% of the physicians from each country reported affirmatively regarding recent suicidal thoughts. Degrading work experiences were associated with recent suicidal thoughts for the Swedish and Italian physicians (OR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.01-4.5; OR = 3.3; 95% CI, 1.3-8.0, respectively). Role conflict was associated with recent suicidal thoughts among the Swedish physicians (OR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.2). Support at work when difficulties arose appeared to be protective for the Swedish physicians (OR = 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-0.96). Italian physicians with little control over working conditions had an increased risk of recent suicidal thoughts, whereas confidential discussions about work experiences appeared to be protective (OR = 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9).
   Conclusion: Attention should be paid to the work environment as it relates to suicide risk among male university hospital physicians, particularly to bolstering social support and preventing harassment. (Gend Med. 2011;8:269-279) (C) 2011 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Current methodologies employed in collecting data for suicide research present several limitations. In this article, we describe a novel method and tool to prospectively study suicidal behavior and its related risk and protective factors in different countries. This tool is a web-based database, which will initially be developed and piloted by suicide research groups from Austria, Brazil, Chile, France, Italy, Mexico, Spain, Sweden, and the US. The database will develop and integrate research tools key to collaboration, permit exploration of ethical considerations, and provide a universal interface in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, and German that will make it possible to incorporate new groups from different countries to the network. The common database resulting of this cross-national effort will allow researchers to share and compare data across countries in a large sample of patients. Using anonymous electronic records of patients, we will: 1) determine the impact of risk and protective factors (viz. aggression and religious affiliation) in different socio-cultural environments; 2) develop a clinical model of suicidal behavior that integrates the multiple dimensions implicated; 3) try differentiating the effects of biological, environmental, and cultural factors on suicidal behavior, and 4) offer the global psychiatric research community a tool that will standardize assessment across nations, allowing for better generalization.

TI Atypical suicides or the first undiagnosed autoerotic deaths in Europe?
SO JOURNAL OF FORENSIC AND LEGAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Auto-erotic death; Asphyxiophilia; Suicide; History
AB Autoerotic accidental deaths (AAD) are increasingly reported deaths occurring during solitary sexual rituals used to enhance sexual excitement. The majority of these fatalities involve hanging or other form of self-inflicted asphyxia. The German medical literature, with the first recognized AAD published in the early 1900s, has antedated by decades the first significant AAD reports (1950-1953) in English. Early contributions in languages other than English and German are mostly overlooked in current AAD reviews, although AAD were recognised in some European countries as early as the 1940s and 1950s. For a variety of reasons, it is likely that, before the description of the first AAD in the medical literature, some asphyxia deaths have been classified as suicides with peculiar features, instead of as accidents resulting from life-threatening sexual practices. In the present study, we review and comment on three such atypical asphyxia deaths investigated in central Europe (Austria, Italy, Switzerland) during the period 1821 to 1927. The retrospective analysis of these cases revealed some circumstantial and individual features which nowadays could be linked to AAD, and disclosed the reluctance of medical examiners to analyse their motivational, and possibly sexual, background.

AB To investigate the role of sociodemographic factors in the risk of death by homicide in Italy, official statistics from 1980 to 1994 concerning death by homicide have been studied. Homicide rates increase from 1980 to 1994 for males and, to a much lesser extent, for females. Clear differences exist by age and gender, with rates peaking in both genders at young adult age (25-34) and men having five times higher rates than women. Mean rate in the general population is 1.98 per 100,000, one of the highest rates in the civilized world. These findings are mostly influenced by higher homicide rates for both males and females in southern regions, where cultural attitudes towards violence, linked to the greater diffusion of criminal organizations, greatly influence the risk of death by homicide. About 75% of homicides involve firearms: clearly in Italy availability of lethal weapons is a key factor in homicide. Intervention aimed at increasing community awareness of the causes and methods of prevention of violence (including the roles of substance abuse and social inequality) are needed if adequate policies are to be developed to reduce the risk of death by homicide. Differences in homicide rates across countries clearly indicate that homicide is a preventable cause of death.

AB In the context of an European collaborative research project (EURELD), a study on attitudes towards medical end-of-life decisions was conducted among physicians in Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. Australia also joined the consortium. A written questionnaire with structured questions was sent to practising physicians from specialties frequently involved in the care of dying patients. 10,139 questionnaires were studied. Response rate was equal to or larger than 50% in all countries except Italy (39%). Apart from general agreement with respect to the alleviation of pain and symptoms with possible life-shortening effect, there was large variation in support-between and within countries-for medical decision that may result in the hastening of death. A principal component factor analysis found that 58% of the variance of the responses is explained by four factors. 'Country' explained the largest part of the variation of the standardized factor scores. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Review
AB Tullio Terni (1888-1946) was a pioneer of neuroanatomy at the University of Padua. He gave milestone contributions in the knowledge of cardiac innervationwith the discovery of the "Terni column", a preganglionic autonomous nervous center.
   Due to "racial laws" introduced in Italy in 1938 by the Fascist government, he, being Jewish, was expelled from the University of Padua like many others from Italian universities. At the end of the 2nd WorldWar, he was reinstated to his chair of Anatomy, however, having belonged to the Fascist party, he was dismissed from the Lincei Academy. It was a paradox that deteriorated his depression up to the suicide. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of our study is to evaluate the temporal trend of deaths in a cohort of i.v. drug users (IVDU) followed in a city of Northen Italy (Bologna), and to assess its relationship with HIV infection and AIDS, and availability of potent anti-retroviral therapy. One thousand and 214 IVDUs (mainly heroin addicts), 916 males and 298 females, attending an outpatient service for treatment and prevention of substance abuse between 1977 and November 1996, were enrolled into our observational cohort, and their vital status was ascertained up to December 31, 2002. The large majority of enrolled subjects were born in the Bologna metropolitan area and surroundings; no extra-European immigrants were present. During the observation period, 271 IVDUs (22.3%) died, 211 males (23.0%), and 60 females (20.1%). No death was recorded before 1984. Main death causes result as follows: AIDS (52.8% of episodes), heroin overdose (22.1%), street accidents (7.4%), decompensated liver cirrhosis (6.3%), and suicide (2.9%). The highest absolute number of deaths was observed between years 1991 and 1996. Crude mortality rate caused by AIDS was 10.0 per 1000 for males and 13.2/1000 for females; the rate of death due to other causes proved 11.1/1000 among males and 5.2/1000 among females. In most recent years, a sharp decrease in the number of AIDS-related deaths, attributable to the increased use of potent antiretroviral regimens, was recorded among IVDUs, although overall mortality rate remained appreciable.

AB National statistics on female homicide could be a useful tool to evaluate the phenomenon and plan adequate strategies to prevent and reduce this crime. The aim of the study is to contribute to the analysis of intentional female homicides in Italy by comparing Italian trends to German and United States trends from 2008 to 2014. This is a population study based on data deriving primarily from national and European statistical institutes, from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting and from the National Center for Health Statistics. Data were analyzed in relation to trends and age by Chi-square test, Student's t-test and linear regression. Results show that female homicides, unlike male homicides, remained stable in the three countries. Regression analysis showed a higher risk for female homicide in all age groups in the U.S. Middle-aged women result at higher risk, and the majority of murdered women are killed by people they know. These results confirm previous findings and suggest the need to focus also in Italy on preventive strategies to reduce those precipitating factors linked to violence and present in the course of a relationship or within the family.

AB Background In Italy, where all mental hospitals have been gradually phased out since 1978, psychiatric patients requiring long-term care are being treated in non-hospital residential facilities (NHRFs), However, detailed data on these facilities are sparse.
   Aims The Progetto Residenze (PROGRES) residential care project is a three-phase study, the first phase of which aims to survey the main characteristics of all Italian NHRFs.
   Method Structured interviews were conducted with the manager of each NHRF.
   Results On 31 May 2000 there were 1370 NHRFs with 17 138 beds; an average of 12,5 beds each and a rate of 2.98 beds per 10 000 inhabitants. Residential provision varied ten-fold between regions and discharge rates were very low. Most had 24-hour staffing with 1.42 patients per full-time worker.
   Conclusions There is marked variability in the provision of residential places between different regions: discharge rates are generally low.
   Declaration of interest Funding was received from the National Institute of Health.

AB A major issue in the care of terminally ill patients is communication and information provision. This paper reports the extent to which physicians in Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland discuss topics relevant to end of life care with terminally ill patients and their relatives (without first informing the patient), and possible associations between physician-specific characteristics and such discussions. Response rates to the postal survey ranged from 39% to 68% (n = 10139). Physicians in most of the countries except Italy in principle, always' discuss issues related to terminal illness with their patients but not with patients' relatives without first informing the patient, unless the relatives ask. Cross-national differences remained strong after controlling for physician characteristics. The majority of physicians appeared to support the principle of patient-centred care to terminally ill patients, consistent with palliative care philosophy and with the law and/or professional guidelines in most of the countries studied.

AB AimsAcute drug overdose, especially with paracetamol, may cause acute liver failure leading to registration for transplantation (ALFT). Population statistics and between-country differences for ALFT related to overdose have been poorly described. The aim of the present study was to evaluate overdose ALFT in the multi-country Study of Acute Liver Transplantation (SALT).
   MethodsAll adult overdose-related ALFT, with or without suicidal intent, in France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and the UK between 2005 and 2007 were identified from liver transplant registries and hospital records. These were compared with whole-country and per capita use of paracetamol.
   ResultsSix hundred cases of ALFT were identified in 52 of 57 eligible transplant centres, of which 114 involved overdose (72 intentional, 10 non-intentional, 32 uncertain). Overdose represented 20% of all-cause ALFT: Ireland 52%, UK 28%, France 18%, the Netherlands 8%, and Italy 1%. Overdose ALFT were mostly females (61%), mean age 33.610.9years. A total of 111 (97%) of the overdoses involved paracetamol. Event rates ranged from one ALFT for 20.7 tons of paracetamol in Ireland, to one for 1074 tons in Italy and one case in 60 million inhabitants over 3years in Italy to one case in 286000 inhabitants per year in Ireland. Per-country event rates for non-overdose ALFT exposed to paracetamol were between 2.5 and 4.0 per million treatment-years sold.
   ConclusionsParacetamol overdose was found to represent one-sixth of all-cause ALFT. There was a 50-fold difference in Europe in the rates of paracetamol overdose ALFT, and a 200-fold difference per million inhabitants.

AB To screen and clinically interview European adolescents reporting current suicidality (suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) and investigate attendance at the clinical interview.
   The Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) Project was carried out in 11 European countries. A baseline questionnaire was completed in school by 12,395 adolescents (mean age 14.9; SD 0.9). Those who screened positive for suicidality (attempting suicide and/or serious suicidal ideation or plans) in the past 2 weeks were invited to a clinical interview with a mental health professional.
   Of the 12,395 adolescents, 4.2 % (n = 516) screened positive for current suicidality. The prevalence ranged from 1.1 % in Hungary to 7.7 % in Israel (p < 0.001). 37.6 % (n = 194) of those who screened positive subsequently attended the clinical interview. Female students were more likely to attend for interview (42.0 % versus 30.6 %, p = 0.010). The attendance rate varied considerably across countries, from 5.7 % in Italy to 96.7 % in France (p < 0.001). Improved attendance was associated with using school as the only interview setting (Mean attendance rate, MAR = 88 vs. 31 %, p = 0.006) and arranging the interview within 1 week of contacting the student (MAR = 64 vs. 23 %, p = 0.013). The greater the travel time to interview, the lower the attendance rate (Pearson's r = -0.64, p = 0.034). Independent of the variation by country, at the individual level, adolescents with more depressive symptoms and a recent suicide attempt more often attended for interview.
   A high rate of current suicidality was found amongst European adolescents. However, the majority of these displayed limited help-seeking behaviour. Future studies should investigate ways of making screening programmes and other interventions more acceptable and accessible to young people, especially young males.

AB The use of keratin matrix, in detecting drug consumption, offers compelling advantages compared to other conventional biological matrices used for these types of investigation, and provides important information to surveys which are characterised by a general underestimation, especially in Italy. In our study we collected and analysed 424 hair samples from corpses autopsied in Perugia from January 2001 to December 2011 in order to detect traces of drugs and especially of cocaine, and evaluate their involvement in several types of death. Hair samples were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the Laboratory of Forensic Toxicology of the Department of Legal Medicine of the University of Perugia: 232 samples derived from cases of overdose deaths; 192 were connected to different causes of death. The average concentration of cocaine in the keratin matrix samples was of 3.74 ng/mg in people who died from overdose, 3.09 ng/mg in people who died from other causes. In 232 cases of overdose deaths, 135 were positive for cocaine (accounting for 58.18% of total); in 192 deaths from other causes, 39 were positive for cocaine (accounting for 20.31% of the total). Our study demonstrated the crucial role of cocaine in overdose deaths and in other deaths, as is well known in other research.

AB Background: The Great Recession has caused worldwide tangible costs in terms of cuts in employment and income, which have been widely recognised also as major social determinants of mental health. Italy has not been spared from the financial crisis with severe societal and mental health consequences. In addition, a strong earthquake hit the province of Modena, Italy, in 2012, that is, amid the crisis.
   Aims: In this study, we explored and investigated the possible additional impact of concurrent events such as economic crisis and a natural disaster.
   Methods: Our analysis elaborated data from two local surveys, ICESmo2 (2006) and ICESmo3 (2012), and a national survey carried out in 2013 by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istituto Nazionale di Statistica (ISTAT)). A regression model was adopted to distinguish the effect of the crisis and the earthquake.
   Results: Our analysis confirmed the negative effect of the economic crisis on psychological wellbeing, but within the province of Modena such an effect resulted as even stronger compared with the rest of Italy, particularly within those areas struck by the earthquake.
   Conclusion: Being hit by a combination of two major negative events might have a significantly increased negative effect on psychological health. The higher repercussion observed is not only attributable to the occurrence of a natural disaster but can be reasonably related to the additional effect of unemployment on psychological dimensions.

ID MENTAL-DISORDERS; SUICIDE RATES; DRUGS; PATTERNS
AB Objectives: The study assessed the consumption of antidepressants in Italy between 2000 and 2011 and identified trends in use. Methods: Data on use of antidepressant drugs between 2000 and 2011 were collected from the Italian Medicines Agency database. Data were expressed as the daily defined dose (DDD) per 1,000 inhabitants. Trends in drug consumption were ascertained by logarithmic transformation of incidence rates by using the formula ln(y)=b X x, where y is the incidence rate, b is the regression coefficient, and x represents the calendar years. Time trends were expressed as expected annual percentage change (EAPC). A significance level of .05 was chosen. Results: Antidepressant consumption increased drastically between 2000 and 2011, from 8.18 to 36.12 DDD per 1,000 inhabitants per day. A single joinpoint (time point with a significant trend change) occurred in 2002 (EAPC=56.4%, 2000-2002, and 6.2%, 2002-2011). The trend analysis stratified by type of drug showed a huge increase in consumption of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants and a decrease in consumption of tricyclic antidepressants. Conclusions: Mental disorders are less stigmatized now than in the past. In Italy and elsewhere, antidepressant use is growing, and it would be important to monitor this trend, especially considering the possible effects of the current economic crisis on mental health. In this scenario, the role of public health in mental health promotion has become fundamental.

AB Introduction: The aim of this study is to measure the prevalence of suicidal ideation and thoughts of death in elementary school children in a European survey and to determine the associated socio-demographic and clinical factors.
   Methods: Data refer to children aged 6-12 (N=7062) from Italy, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Germany, and the Netherlands randomly selected in primary schools. Suicidal thoughts and death ideation were measured using a computerized pictorial diagnostic tool from the Dominic Interactive (DI) completed by the children. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was administrated to teachers and parents along with a socio-demographic questionnaire.
   Results: Suicidal ideation was present in 16.96% of the sample (from 9.9 in Italy to 26.84 in Germany), death thoughts by 21.93% (from 7.71% in Italy to 32.78 in Germany). Sl and DT were more frequent in single-parent families and large families. Externalizing disorders were strongly correlated with Sl and DT after controlling for other factors and this was true for internalizing disorders only when reported by the children.
   Conclusion: Recognizing suicidal ideation in young children may be recommended as part of preventive strategies such as screening in the context of the presence of any mental health problems whether externalizing or internalizing. (C) 2015 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The primary aim of the present study was to determine the survival rates and identify predictors of disease duration in a cohort of Huntington's disease (HD) patients from Southern Italy. Methods: All medical records of HD patients followed between 1977 and 2008 at the Department of Neurological Sciences of Federico 11 University in Naples were retrospectively reviewed and 135 patients were enrolled in the analysis. At the time of data collection, 41 patients were deceased (19 males and 22 females) with a mean +/- SD age at death of 56.6 +/- 14.9 years (range 18-83). Results: The median survival time was 20 years (95% Cl: 18.3-21.7). Cox regression analysis showed that the number of CAG in the expanded allele (HR 1.09 for 1 point triplet increase, p=0.002) and age of onset (HR I.05 for 1 point year increase, p=0.022) were independent and significant predictors of lower survival rates. Conclusions: We believe that these findings are important for a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and may be relevant in designing future therapeutic trials.

AB ObjectivesEvaluating socio-economic inequality in cause-specific mortality among the working population requires large cohort studies. Through this census-based study, we aimed to quantify disparities in mortality across occupation-based social classes in Italy.MethodsWe conducted a historical cohort study on a sample of more than 16 million workers. We estimated the mortality rate ratios for each social class, considering upper non-manual workers as reference.ResultsNon-skilled manual workers showed an increased mortality from upper aero-digestive tract, stomach and liver cancers, and from diseases of the circulatory system, transport accidents and suicides in both sexes, and from infectious diseases, diabetes, lung and bladder cancers only in men. Among women, an excess mortality emerged for cervical cancer, whereas mortality from breast and ovarian cancers was lower. When education was taken into account, the excess mortality decreased in men while was no longer significant in women.ConclusionsThere are remarkable disparities across occupation-based social classes in the Italian working population that favour the upper non-manual workers. Our data could be useful in planning policies for a more effective health and social security system.

AB The aim of this study was to collect all available data from 2009 to 2016 focusing on the epidemiological, clinical and pharmacological issues only related to acute intoxication fatalities in the Unit of Legal Medicine of the Department of Medicine and Surgery at the University of Parma. All death certificates and autopsy reports were retrieved from the archives and evaluated to identify cases in which only acute intoxication from xenobiotics could be defined as the cause of death, however statistical and descriptive analyses were applied to all the data.
   A more comprehensive analysis on all causes of death showed that out of 1005 total cases the most common is haemorrhagic shock/traumatic shock (36.5%), followed by cardiogenic shock with 27.4%; asphyxia ranks as the third cause of death (11.8%); concerning encephalic injuries, our data show 10.9% of cases, while acute intoxication by xenobiotics accounts for 5.7%.
   Data show that the majority of subjects are poly-abuser (75.4%); people not enrolled within a preventive treatment (59.4%) were more likely to commit suicide (28.1%), whereas only 6.2% in the sub-population in treatment (40.6%) committed suicide: therefore, data strongly suggest the evidence that joining a preventive programme can decrease the probability of extreme action.
   Access to a full case history may indeed save considerable time and expense in carrying out tests, but also valuable targeted samplings. The investigating officer should, therefore, submit as much information as possible about the case, as this may influence the type and extent of analysis undertaken, as well as the interpretation of analytical results.

   RATES; MORTALITY; SMOKING; DEATH; POPULATION; COMPONENTS
AB Over the course of the 20th century the sex differential in life expectancy at birth in the industrialized countries has widened considerably in favour of women. Starting in the early 1970s, the beginning of a reversal in the long-term pattern of this differential has been noted in some high-income countries. This study documents a sustained pattern of narrowing of this measure into the later part of the 1990s for six of the populations that comprise the G7 countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, England and Wales (as representative of the United Kingdom) and USA. For Japan, a persistence of widening sex differences in survival is noted. The sex differences in life expectancy are decomposed over roughly three decades (early 1970s to late 1990s) from the point of view of four major cause-of-death categories: circulatory diseases, cancers, accidents/violence/suicide, and,other' (residual) causes. In the six countries where the sex gap has narrowed, this has resulted primarily from reduced sex differences in circulatory disease mortality, and secondarily from reduced differences in male and female death rates due to accidents, violence and suicide combined. In some of the countries sex differentials in cancer mortality have been converging lately, and this has also contributed to a narrowing of the difference in life expectancy. In Japan, males have been less successful in reducing their survival disadvantage in relation to Japanese women with regard to circulatory disease and cancer; and in the case of accidents/violence/suicide, male death rates increased during the 1990s. These trends explain the divergent pattern of the sex difference in life expectation in Japan as compared with the other G7 nations.

AB Background: Mortality in psychiatric patients both from natural and non-natural causes was reported to be markedly higher than in the general population. The effect of the psychiatric hospital (PH) closure process on mortality has nonetheless seldom been investigated. We studied mortality in a cohort of PH patients, taking into account the closure process in Italy. Methods: A total of 2915 patients from 12 PH were described in the period 1994-1996 and followed up until June 2000, and discharges and deaths were registered. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) for natural and non-natural causes were computed on the basis of regional death rates. Results: Observed deaths were 714 vs. 291.2 expected. The all-causes SMR was 2.47 in males and 2.43 in females. The SMR was 26.92 in males and 13.75 in females for psychiatric causes, 6.84 and 7.89 for undefined causes, 9.57 and 7.27 for pneumonia, 6.38 and 7.78 for chronic obstructive respiratory disease, and 1.27 and 1.58 for ischemic heart disease. No excess was observed for all cancers in males, but the SMR was 1.50 for lung cancer in males, 2.30 for breast cancer and 1.48 for all neoplasms in females. SMR for suicide was 3.85 in males and 2.73 in females. Most SMR were higher at younger age, although the rate of absolute excess deaths was greater above age 60. The SMR for all causes was 2.66 before discharge from PH, and 2.09 after discharge. Conclusions: Mortality remained high after leaving the PH, but no increase was associated to the PH closure.

AB This study describes the psychological effects of an experience of death education (DE) used to explore a case of suicide in an Italian high school. DE activities included philosophical and religious perspectives of the relationships between death and the meaning of life, a visit to a local hospice, and psychodrama activities, which culminated in the production of short movies. The intervention involved 268 high school students (138 in the experimental group). Pre-test and post-test measures assessed ontological representations of death, death anxiety, alexithymia, and meaning in life. Results confirmed that, in the experimental group, death anxiety was significantly reduced as much as the representation of death as annihilation and alexithymia, while a sense of spirituality and the meaning of life were more enhanced, compared to the No DE group. These improvements in the positivemeaning of life and the reduction of anxiety confirmed that it is possible tomanage trauma and grief at school with death education interventions that include religious discussion, psychodrama and movie making activities.

AB We investigated the drugs used in the alleviation of pain and symptoms (APS) with a possible life-shortening side effect in six European countries' end-of-life care. We sent mail questionnaires to physicians who signed a representative sample of death certificates in each country. APS with a possible life-shortening effect occurred from 19 % of all deaths in Italy to 26 % in Denmark. Physicians usually administered opioids (from 76 % of APS cases in Italy to 96 % in The Netherlands), but the type of opioids and administration Practice differed markedly between countries. The doses of opioids given in the last 24 hours also varied signifcantly and were usually lower than 300 mg oral morphine equivalent (from 83 % of cases in Belgium to 93 % in Sweden). The highly variable results bring into question whether existing guidelines for pain relief were applied appropriately and to what extent unfounded concerns about the possible life-shortening effect of opioids resulted in less than optimal Symptom management in end-of-life care.

AB This work reflects on the character of the modalities that non-status migrants are deploying in the context of current politics of the camp, with special attention to the Italian context. It will suggest that once the possibilities of dissent through the voice (the political tool par excellence in a liberal democracy, and one associated primarily with rationality and the capacity for reason) are foreclosed, migrants tend to resort to another powerful tool: their own body. Detainees have made their bodies speak by resorting to practices of self-mutilation, hunger strike, suicide attempts, and lips and eyes sewing. Detainees' violent acts of dissent are not dissimilar from the violent modalities used, a few centuries earlier, by some enslaved people who chose liberty through death. The aim is not so much to make comparison between the two figures, but to emphasise the way in which, under conditions of extreme control, subjugation or unfreedom, acts of dissent and resistance - and thus acts of politics, as articulated in Ranciere's concept of dissensus - are not necessarily enacted through democratic practices but, on the contrary, through whatever modalities are available to them, including violent (self-harm) modalities.

LA English
DT Article
DE Fascist censorship; self-censorship; German popular fiction; literary
   translation
AB Between the 1920s and 1930s, the translation of foreign contemporary novels into Italian was encouraged by publishers, meeting the needs of a new readership, which was larger and more heterogeneous than before the war. However, the sharp rise in the number of imported novels provoked strong disapproval. In a context of heightened nationalism and cultural autocracy, translation was considered a polluting, anti-patriotic and servile practice. The censorship that took place, however, was mostly implemented via a tacit compromise between the publishers and the regime, rather than by repressive institutional actions. In order to protect themselves from sanctions and requisitions, publishers and translators often deleted potentially unpleasant elements from the texts, including topics such as abortion, suicide, pacifism, sexuality, women's emancipation or episodes belittling Italy. The analysis of German popular fiction translated into Italian in this period suggests that popular literature was translated with a high degree of manipulation. This may be ascribed to the low cultural status accorded to this type of literature and the modernity of the themes it contained. Furthermore, while 'high literature' catered to a niche readership, the widespread circulation of popular literature made it seem more dangerous and thus more subject to censorship.

AB In recent years, satanic groups have been responsible for various types and degrees of crimes. We report the case of a number of murders committed in Italy by a group of young people calling themselves the Bestie di Satana. Forensic psychiatric assessment of the members of a satanic sect charged with the crime revealed that all the young people had a fragile, immature personality, a very low level of education and were socially disadvantaged. The trial of the members of the Bestie di Satana sect was concluded with the verdict of deliberate murder, and all the members were given long jail sentences. This report should lead us to explore social and cultural responses to juvenile satanism, statistically shown to be a relatively rare phenomenon but with a high criminal potential.

AB The aim of this study was to examine mortality risk and causes of death for natives and non-natives in a cohort of heroin population of treated in Northern Italy. Crude Mortality Rates (CMRs) were 12.78 per 1,000 Person Years (PY), Standardized Mortality Rate (SMR) was 9.93. Mortality has been decreasing over time, was higher for patients who accessed the treatment services before 2001 and has been increasing with age. CMRs and SMRs were higher among natives, while non-natives were distinguished by higher CMRs and SMRs for suicide. The natives were at greater risk of death than non-natives both injecting and non-injecting, but the mortality risk was not statistically significant in the different periods of first admission. Among non-native patients, older on average, there was a lower proportion of injecting, and a higher quota of people unemployed than among Italian natives. We highlight differences between the various areas of origin concerning consumption patterns and risk of death. The results of the study highlight a particular sub-population of heroin users, the non-natives, who as compared with the Italians, have less invasive consumption styles, reach the health services later but benefit from fewer medical controls.

AB Objective. - The review aims to identify the extent and nature of research on mental disorders and their care in immigrant populations in three major European countries with high levels of immigration, i.e. Germany, Italy, United Kingdom (UK).
   Method. - Peer-reviewed publications on the subject from the three countries between 1996 and 2004 were analyzed. The research questions addressed, the methods used, and the results obtained were assessed.
   Results. - Thirteen papers reporting empirical studies were found from Germany, four from Italy and 95 front the UK. Studies addressed a range of research questions and most frequently assessed rates of service utilization in different immigrant groups, The most consistent finding is a higher rate of hospital admissions for Afro-Caribbean patients in the UK. Many studies had serious methodological shortcomings with low sample sizes and unspecified inclusion criteria.
   Discussion. - Despite large scale immigration in each of the three studied countries. the numbers of relevant research publications vary greatly with a relatively high level of empirical research in the UK. Possible reasons for this are it generally stronger Culture of mental health service research and a higher number of researchers who are themselves front immigrant backgrounds ill the UK,
   Conclusion. - Overall the evidence base to guide the development of mental health services for immigrant populations appears limited. Future research requires appropriate funding, should be of sufficient methodological quality and may benefit from collaboration across Europe. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB To increase access to treatment, Italy made assessment at community mental health centers (CMHCs) independent of medical referral, resulting in increased numbers of patients to be triaged efficiently. To support this process, we evaluated SCL-90-R item-ratings to identify factors that best predicted adverse early outcomes among persons seeking first-time CMHC care in a 24-month period in Rome. A psychiatric nurse screened subjects with a brief interview and self-administered SCL-90-R and psychiatrists provided CGI ratings and ICD-9 diagnosis. Of 832 screened subjects, 32 (3.85%) were hospitalized or attempted suicide within 90 days. Six SCL-90 items (15,41,55,57,78,88) scored much higher with than without such adverse outcomes; their sum is proposed as a predictive measure ("SCL-6"). In binary multivariable logistic modeling, this factor, but not age, sex, diagnosis, or other SCL-90-derived subscales strongly predicted adverse outcomes. A ROC curve for SCL-6 reflected a strong separation between subjects with versus without adverse outcomes (AUC = 0.76). This simple screening tool may support timely identification of patients at risk of early adverse clinical outcome who require especially close follow-up.

AB An estimated 800 000 suicide deaths occur worldwide. The global suicide rate is 11.4 per 100 000 population; 15.0/100 000 for males and 8.0/100 000 for females. Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year olds. In a collaborative effort to reduce the high rates of suicide and mental health problems among youth across Europe, the European Union 7(th) Framework funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. SEYLE is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to promote mental health and healthy lifestyles, while preventing psychopathology and suicidal behaviours among adolescents. The epidemiological data on 11,110 pupils in the age group 14-16 years, with a mean age of 14.8 years (SD +/- 0.8), who were recruited from 168 schools across 10 European Union countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden as the coordinating centre showed the following prevalences: alcohol use (13.4%), smoking (30.9%), physical inactivity (32.8%), pathological Internet use (4.4%) and sleeping on average 7.7 hours per night. In terms of reproductive health, the prevalence of sexual debut was 18.8% for the total sample. Pupils aged >= 16 years had a higher prevalence (38%) of sexual debut compared to those aged <= 15 years (13.2%). Males had a higher prevalence (21.3%) than females (16.9%). Three clusters of adolescents were identified: 57.8% with low frequency of all risk-behaviours; 13.2% with high frequency of all risk behaviours; and 29% so-called `invisible' risk group, which did not show any striking externalised risk behaviours, but scored positive for high use of Internet/TV/videogames, sedentary behaviour and reduced sleep. When comparing pupils in the `invisible' risk group with those in the high-risk group, similar prevalence rates of anxiety (8% vs. 9.2%), subthreshold depression (33.2% vs. 34%), depression (13.4% vs. 14.7%) and suicidal thoughts (42.2% vs. 44%) were observed. Pupils meeting the criteria of depression and subthreshold depression were 10.5% and 32%, respectively. Prevalence rates for anxiety and subthreshold anxiety was 5.8% and 29.2%, respectively. Lifetime prevalence of deliberate self-injurious behaviours (D-SIB) was 27.6%, with higher rates reported for occasional D-SIB (19.7%) compared to repetitive D-SIB (7.8%). Suicidal ideation was present in approximately one third of the sample (32.3%). More than four percent (4.2%) of the sample reported attempting suicide during their lifetime, with a significantly higher prevalence among girls (5.1% vs. 3.0%, p<0.05). In comparing the effectiveness of the three active SEYLE interventions, based on three specific preventive strategies directed towards teachers and school staff, professionals and pupils in comparison to a control group, the intervention empowering pupils, called the Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) showed significant results in preventing new cases of suicide attempts, severe suicidal ideation with plans and depression. More than a 50% reduction of incident cases of suicide attempts (OR: 0.45 [0.24 - 0.85]; p=0.014), and of incident cases of severe suicidal ideation and plans (OR: 0.50 [0.27 - 0.92]; p=0.025), as well as a significant reduction by 30% of incident cases with moderate to severe depression (OR: 0.71 [0.52- 0.97]; p=0.031) was observed.

AB Background: Suicidal behavior is one of the most alarming signs not only in psychiatry, and current major depressive episode is the most frequent medical condition among suicide victims and attempters. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between the individual pattern of affective temperaments, non-typical symptoms of depression as measured with the Gotland Scale for Male Depression (GSMD), hopelessness and suicidal behavior in major mood disorder patients.
   Methods: Participants were 346 adult inpatients (151 men and 195 women) with major mood disorders consecutively admitted to the Department of Psychiatry of the Sant'Andrea University Hospital in Rome, Italy. All the patients were administered the TEMPS-A, the GSMD, and the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).
   Results: A Two Step Cluster Analysis procedure, performed to reveal natural groupings within patients' response set, indicated that there were 2-groups: a cyclothymic-depressive-anxious group and a hyperthymic group. More than 81% of the patients with prevailing cyclothymic-depressive-anxious temperament had mild to severe suicidal risk on the MINI vs. only around 42% of the patients with prevailing hyperthymic temperament Sixty-four percent of patients with prevailing cyclothymic-depressive-anxious temperament had BHS scores of 9 or higher versus only 13% of patients with prevailing hyperthymic temperament. Also, patients with prevailing cyclothymic-depressive-anxious temperament more likely had higher GSMD than patients with prevailing hyperthymic temperament.
   Limitations: The correlational nature of the study limits causal conclusions to be drawn.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that affective temperament measure along with Gotland Scale for Male Depression could be useful tools in screening and identifying those affective disorder patients who are at higher risk of suicidal behavior. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The authors report the case of an accidental death of a 3-year-old child who unintentionally shot himself while he was handling his father's handgun.
   The peculiarity of the observed injury makes the case particularly interesting, along with the fact that, in Italy, unintentional firearm-related deaths are rather uncommon among children and adolescents.
   Because of the presence of only 1 bullet hole on the parietal-occipital region, radiological cranial examinations were performed,before proceeding with the autopsy.
   Computed tomographic scans were useful to confirm the entrance site of the bullet and, especially, to establish the trajectory with the whole spectrum of fractures.
   The case shows that the unusual entrance site of the bullet through the nose led to a fatal cranial injury, as a result of curiosity of a 3-year-old child in the presence of an unsupervised handgun.

ID SAMPLES
AB Accident, suicide, or homicide might have caused the death of Countess Agusta who fell from the 80-m tall cliff of her villa. Two mismatched slippers were recovered along the cliff. Use was made of microscope, X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy, and microprobe techniques to compare 40 mg of soil collected from the slipper soles with samples from the villa garden. Structural details of the slipper soles were consistent with the lady wearing them during the fall. Analysis of the soil residues confirmed that they originated from the garden only. The features of a few, minute glass chips adhering to the slipper soles reasonably matched those of other fragments that were found on a small ledge on the cliff beyond the garden parapet. Based on this and other evidence, the case was closed with a verdict of accidental fall.

AB Interest in psychiatrists' professional liability in Italy has increased in recent years because of the number of medical malpractice claims. Professional liability for failure to prevent violent behaviour by psychiatric patients is particularly debated. This study describes three Italian cases in which health professionals - physicians and nurses - were found guilty of manslaughter for murders committed by psychiatric patients. Examination of the cases focuses on claims of malpractice, patients' characteristics, the circumstances of the homicide and the reasons for the court's judgment. In particular, the predictability of violent behaviour and the concept of causal links are examined in detail. The cases provide an opportunity for a study of comparative jurisprudence. The topics discussed are relevant not only to practicing psychiatrists but also to experts assessing medical liability in cases of criminal acts committed by psychiatric patients.

AB Aaron Swartz has been one of the pivotal characters in the recent history of the Internet. As an American activist, programmer, hacker, and open access advocate, Swartz was involved in the launch of now established Web standards and services and has been vocal in some of the recent debates about digital rights, copyright, and free access to the Web. Beginning in 2011, Swartz was involved in a legal battle for copyright infringement, having allegedly downloaded thousands of academic papers from the JSTOR archive. In 2013, at age 26, Swartz committed suicide. This article, based on a content analysis of 272 articles, sheds light on how eight news outlets (mainstream newspapers from Italy, UK, U.S., and two online-only technology websites) portrayed Swartz over the course of a three-year time frame, from July 2011 to December 2014.

AB Continuous deep sedation (CDS) is sometimes used to treat refractory symptoms in terminally ill patients. The aim of this paper was to estimate the frequency and characteristics of CDS in six European countries: Belgium, Denmark, Italy, The Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland. Deaths reported to death registries were sampled and the reporting doctors received a mailed questionnaire about the medical decision making that preceded the death of the patient. The total number of deaths studied was 20,480. The response rate ranged between 44 % (Italy) and 75 % (The Netherlands). Of all deaths, CDS was applied in 2.5 % in Denmark and up to 8.5 % in Italy. Of all patients receiving CDS, 35 % (Italy) and up to 64 % (Denmark and The Netherlands) did not receive artificial nutrition or hydration. Patients who received CDS were more often male, younger than 80 years old, more likely to have had cancer, and died more often in a hospital compared to nonsudden deaths without CDS. The high variability of frequency and characteristics of CDS in the studied European countries points out the importance of medical education and scientific debate on this issue.

AB << SISMI-Telecom scandal >>, as it is known in Italy, is illegal phone tapping by some people in charge of security at the Telecom Italia Company. The case became common knowledge in September 2006 because 34 people were indicted and there were 21 provisional arrests among many employees at Telecom Italia, among national police and members of the Carabinieri Corps (paramilitary police of the Italian Armed Forces) and of the Guardia di Finanza (Inland Revenue Police)>>.
   In 2010, some journalists revealed what was happening and stated that thousands of people had been secretly put under unauthorised surveillance by Telecom Italia and illegal dossiers had been created. People's lives were monitored as well as their bank accounts; even the data banks of the Italian Ministry of the Interior were accessed.
   Ultimately, the SISMI-Telecom trial ended with very mild sentences between settlements and state secrets. Yet, in the information age, the SISMI-Telecom scandal can be considered "dead" only from a procedural point of view. According to the interpretation of some experts on the case, the famous law that has destroyed and ordered the destruction of those dossiers, is a suicide law because those files were all in electronic format, and of course continue to circulate and keep producing poisons.

AB Aim: To determine whether there has been an increase in deaths by overdose in Italy, as elsewhere in the Western world, over the past fifteen years. Method: This study's conclusions are based on analysis of official data on overdose deaths attributed to illicit drug addiction and abuse (ICD-9 codes 304 and 305) from 1984 to 2000, drawn from two archives of drug abuse information: the Direzione Centrale per i Servizi Antidroga (DADE) of the Italian Ministry of the Interior (1984-2000), and the Health Statistics held at the Italian Central Statistics Institute (ISTAT) (1984-1997). Mortality rates have been calculated for both genders in the following age groups: 15-24, 25-34, and 35-44 years. Results: Official data indicate that there has been a steady increase in the number of deaths by overdose in Italy over recent 15 years. This trend has affected both genders, but is more evident among males. Over the whole period females had consistently lower overdose rates than males. In both genders the age group 35-44 was subject to the highest mortality rate increase over the study period.. however, the highest overdose rates for both males and females were observed in the 25-34 age group. Consistently higher rates were witnessed in the northern regions of Italy with an overall increase across all latitudes. However, the greatest increase over the study period occurred in the South. In 5190 cases evaluated by the Italian Forensic Toxicology Group, 95.9% of deaths were attributed to heroin, but in about half of these, mixtures of three or more substances (heroin, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, methadone) were found in the deceased at doses that were likely to have contributed to death. Conclusions: The increase observed in the rates of death by overdose is likely to be a reflection of increased use of illicit drugs in the general population. Reporting practice by forensic pathologists might explain the extent of attribution of cause of death to heroin. Drop-out from addiction treatment is a commonly observed antecedent of fatal opioid overdose, therefore, caution is required when establishing treatment protocol for patients. Interventions that aim specifically at improving patient compliance with medical and psychiatric therapies should be favoured. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO STUDI STORICI

DT Article
AB Inspired by Richard Hofstadter's pioneering studies on conspiracy theory as a tool of historiographical investigation, the purpose of this study is to examine the specific case of the intellectual and professional life of Giovanni Preziosi and the use made by him of conspiracy as an argument and a weapon of political confrontation.
   The analysis focuses on the years 1913-1915, a very intense period in Italian politics with the debate over the War, and its purpose is to investigate Giovanni Preziosi's contribution to the interventionist cause. Focusing on the global threat of pan-Germanism and denouncing its Italian accomplices, especially the Giolittian neutralists, the future publisher of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion exposed the enormous political and commercial power of Banca Commerciale Italiana, as well as the dangers of excessive tolerance of the German elements in Italy, ascribing everything to a conspiracy to enslave Italy to Germany's will. Divided into economic, military and political variants, the idea of the pan-German plan served as a response to the neutralists' arguments and for authorities who were considered accomplices of German imperialism to invoke more nationalist war measures.
   With his periodical La Vita Italiana, Preziosi anticipated many of the anti-Semitic ideas of the Fascist period, becoming a characteristic voice on the interventionist front. He was to adhere to these ideas concerning the occult forces of the world until his suicide in 1945.

AB Background: Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by the abnormal expansion of CAG triplet repeat. We aimed to reappraise HD epidemiology in a northern Italian population, in relation to introduction of genetic testing. Methods:Through ICD-9M code 333.4 and medical fare exemption code RF0080, HD cases were identified from administrative health data and medical records from the Units of Neurology and Genetics, Ferrara University Hospital, and from other provincial neurological structures. Results: HD mean annual incidence rate in 1990-2009 was 0.3 per 100,000 (95% CI 0.2-0.5). All incident cases were found to have symptoms of the disease's classic form, and neither juvenile nor the rigid Westphal variant was detected. The mean (SD) age at onset was 50.2 (12.7 years; range 32-82 years), 54.9 (14.6) for men and 45.8 (9.4) for women. On prevalence day, December 31, 2014, HD prevalence was 4.2 per 100,000 (95% CI 2.4-7.0), with a male:female ratio of 1:2. Conclusions: The prevalence and incidence of HD in our population were lower than the prevalence and incidence reported for other European and Italian populations, but higher compared to those of Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe.

AB BACKGROUND: Unemployment is a very stressful experience that significantly impairs an individual's perception of their overall wellbeing. Interaction between unemployment and physical health is complex.
   OBJECTIVE: To analyze how specific coping strategies and socio-demographic variables may influence the level of physical and mental health perceived by those searching for work at an employment centre in Catanzaro, Italy.
   METHODS: Participants completed a set of self-administrated questionnaires including a socio-demographic questionnaire, the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS) and the SF-12 Health Survey (SF-12). A forward stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to ascertain those coping strategies significantly associated with participants' perceived health status.
   RESULTS: Complete documentation was received from 113 registered unemployed participants, (61 men and 52 women) giving a response rate of 45%. Physical health status was significantly and positively associated with age and task-oriented coping, while the perception of mental health was associated not only with age, but also by lower emotion-oriented coping and a low number of previous job losses.
   CONCLUSION: The perception of health status is reduced among unemployed. Age is the only socio-demographic variable that influences the perception of health status. Adaptive Task-oriented coping strategies are related to better physical health perception, whereas Emotion-oriented coping makes people prone to poorer mental health perception.

AB Objectives: This research aimed to identify incidents of mothers in Italy killing their own children and to test an adaptive evolutionary hypothesis to explain their occurrence.
   Methods: 110 cases of mothers killing 123 of their own offspring from 1976 to 2010 were analyzed. Each case was classified using 13 dichotomic variables. Descriptive statistics and hierarchical cluster analysis were performed both for cases and variables, and significant differences between clusters were analyzed.
   Results: The Italian sample of neonaticides (killings of children within the first day of life) was found to satisfy all evolutionary predictions for an evolved behavioral, emotional and motivational pattern to increase fitness, showing a consistent profile for offending mothers. Relatively young, poor women with no partner kill their offspring non-violently, either directly or through abandonment, and they attempt to conceal the body. These women have no psychopathologies and never attempt suicide after killing their children. All neonaticide cases fall in a single cluster that is distinct from all other offspring killings by mothers. Infanticide (killing of children within the first year of life) and filicide (killing of children after the first year of life) do not significantly differ according to any of the variables measured. The common profile of mothers who have committed infanticide or filicide includes psychopathology, suicide or attempted suicide after killing their children, violent killing of their victims, and no attempt to conceal the victims' bodies. These results suggest that maternal infanticide and filicide represent an improper functioning of adaptation, and their profile are much more variable than those of neonaticide offenders.
   Conclusion: Our study confirms that only neonaticide is an adaptive reproductive disinvestment, possibly evolved in the remote past, to increase the biological fitness of the mother by eliminating an unwanted newborn and saving resources for future offspring born in better conditions. Neonaticide is shown to be clearly distinct from infanticide and filicide and therefore should be approached, prevented, and judged differently. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To increase understanding of the influence of photoperiod variation in patients with bipolar disorders.
   Methods: We followed a sample of Italian bipolar patients over a period of 24 months, focusing on inpatients. All patients admitted to the Psychiatric Inpatient Unit of San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital in Orbassano (Turin, Italy) between September 1, 2013 and August 31, 2015 were recruited. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected.
   Results: Seven hundred and thirty patients were included. The admission rate for bipolar patients was significantly higher during May, June and July, when there was maximum sunlight exposure, although no seasonal pattern was found. Patients with (hypo) manic episodes were admitted more frequently during the spring and during longer photoperiods than those with major depressive episodes.
   Conclusions: Photoperiod is a key element in bipolar disorder, not only as an environmental factor but also as an important clinical parameter that should be considered during treatment.

The purpose of the paper is to increase the knowledge and the classification of the phenomenon and give a contribution for the forensic medicine and psychiatric implications. The dynamics of the investigation of the scene, the autopsy finding and the examination of the medical history are particularly important for forensic professionals that must classify the event as a suicide, homicide or as an accidental event. The Authors describe the phenomenon also from the epidemiological point of view that shows a high prevalence of men, even if in Italy there are not official estimates. Last but not least the Authors and take in consideration and discussed about the existence in the subject of a para-physiological habitude or a real type of pathology as paraphiliac disorders (masochism, fetishism, travestic fetishism).

AB The objective of the present study was to describe the incidence and the characteristics of Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors (SITBs), among adolescents aged 11-18 admitted, over a two year period, to all the Emergency Departments of a Region of North-eastern Italy through a comprehensive analysis of medical records. A two-step search was performed in the regional ED electronic database. First, we identified the cases that had been clearly diagnosed as SITBs by an Emergency Department physician. Secondly, suspect cases were detected through a keyword search of the database, and the medical records of these cases were hand screened to identify SITBs. The mean annual incidence rate of SITBs was 90 per 100,000 adolescents aged 11-18 years. Events were more frequent in females. Drug poisoning was the most frequently adopted method (54%). In 42% of cases a diagnosis of SITB was not explicitly reported by the physician. In 65% of cases adolescents were discharged within hours of admission. Only 9% of patients started a psychiatric assessment and treatment program during hospital stay. This research confirms the high incidence of SITBs among adolescents and highlights the difficulty in their proper diagnosis and management. Such difficulty is confirmed by the fact that only a few patients, even among those with a clear diagnosis, were sent for psychiatric assessment. Correct identification and management of SITB patients needs to be improved, since SITBs are an important public health problem in adolescence and one of the main risk factors for suicide.

AB Toxicological analyses are often performed in drug-facilitated sexual assaults (DFSA), when the victim shows or reports impaired consciousness and reduced ability. However, in other crimes or fatalities, especially in cases of concurrent natural disease or when another likely cause of death has been established, the involvement of drugs can be overlooked. The aim of this study is to report a series of cases of (i) victims of drug-facilitated crimes (DFC) other than DFSA and (ii) victims of acute intoxications, in which "licit" psychoactive drugs were found in blood samples, with the aim of understanding in which circumstances and to what extent prescription drugs have been used for non-medical purposes in recent Italian casuistry. Circumstantial, autopsy, and toxicological data were collected through a retrospective analysis performed between 2013 and 2017 in the Forensic Toxicology Unit of the University of Bologna. Cases of "DFC other than DFSA" and "Acute Intoxication" in which "psychoactive drugs" or "prescription drugs" or "licit drugs" were found in the blood samples of the victims were included in the study. Nine cases of DFC other than DFSA, and 11 cases of acute intoxication, were identified. Different categories of "licit" psychoactive drugs (e.g. hypnotics, antipsychotics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants) had been used to facilitate diverse types of crime (homicide, robberies, elder abuse, fatal poisoning) or acute intoxication (suicide, attempted suicide, accidental death). The circumstances of these cases, as well as toxicological findings in blood samples and other relevant forensic elements, are reported, summarized and discussed in this paper. The non-medical use of pharmaceuticals has been identified by recent forensic literature and the present study as a significant and growing phenomenon, and its implication in fatalities should be taken into consideration and accurately investigated through appropriate toxicological analysis. Our study presents an overview of the circumstances of non-medical use of prescription drugs, usually considered "safe drugs", and their involvement in cases of DFC, suicides and accidental intoxication. In order to estimate the real incidence of these medications in DFC and acute intoxication, and thus collect more analytical and contextual data, further studies are needed, along with effective cooperation among police officers, clinicians, forensic pathologists, and toxicologists.

   scene
AB Geberth in 2006 stated that "staging is a conscious criminal action on the part of an offender to thwart an investigation." In the present paper two crime scenes staged by handling digital evidence are reported. The first case involves a 50-year-old woman who had been living with the offender for three years before he murdered her at the end of their relationship. He staged the scene as a sex-related crime committed by an unknown perpetrator. The second case concerns a young woman who was found dead in Southern Italy in January 2004 with a gunshot on the forehead. The boyfriend, responsible for the murder, had staged the crime scene as a suicide. Three years earlier in Germany, he had also murdered the victim's mother. In both cases, the correlation of physical and digital forensic evidence was crucial in the definition of the manner of death. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Samples of mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were collected from natural beds on the Adriatic Sea in front of Ancona Province (Marches, Central Italy) officially recognized for human consumption. The Mussels were analyzed to evaluate the prevalence of Aeromonas spp. pathogenic strains. Out of 144 samples, 32 Aeromonas strains were isolated and 12 showed virulence and enterophatogenicity on mice. Isolates were also examined to check their sensitivity to different antimicrobial agents. All isolates were sensitive to imepenem, neomycin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, doxycicline, chloramphenicol, polymyxin B, and colistin sulfate, but resistant to penicillin, carbenicillin, cephalotin, sulfamethoxazole, lincomycin, novobiocin, and rifampicin. Multiple resistance to antimicrobial agents with different mechanism of action was observed. Owing to the high occurrence of pathogenic Aeromonas strains, the risk of developing human infections by eating raw or undercooked Mussels is envisaged. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Health indicators in the time of crisis in Italy Epidemiol Prev 2012; 36 (6): 337-366 SCOPE: to estimate for the first time in Italy the consequences of the national current economic crisis on health and on social determinants of health, assessing its impact on a set of distal determinants (development and economic wellbeing, labour and environment) and of prossimal ones (material, psychosocial, professional, environmental and behavioural risk factors) on health care performance and on health outcomes normally related to economic trends, as self-perceived health, depression, number of suicides attempts, road traffic incidents and work injuries.
   The analysis is therefore aimed at identifying the most promising entry points in order to plan and implement either health care and other policies to tackle the negative effects of crisis on health.
   DESIGN: using the main international and national references on the measure of wellbeing and on the role of social determinants, this paper draws a conceptual framework of all the connections between recession and health. For each-mechanism identified, it examines the value of the main available indicators before and during the crisis in order to measure its impact, adjusting if possible for the trend observed in the previous years.
   Indicators have been selected according to their availability in the main Italian national informative sources and, when not possible, circumscribing the analysis to the regional or local level.
   RESULTS: regarding the short term impact, results have shown an association between the recession and the raise of mental health related problems (measured in terms of number of suicides, depression and substance misuse), especially on the most disadvantaged groups because of their higher job and financial insecurity. A first ex-ante impact assessment on long term effects allows to attribute almost two hundred deaths a year due to the increase of unemployment rate.
   Regarding the budget cuts on public expenditure of the health care sector, significant reductions have been shown in specialist care and in drug prescriptions, associated with the increase of co-payment and with a stronger effect on the most vulnerable socioeconomic groups. Nevertheless the crisis does not seem to be associated with a reduction of indicators of quality, continuity and outcomes of the health care, at least in the considered clinical pathways (diabetes and maternal and child health).
   At the same time the crisis seems to be associated with the reduction in the rate of injuries in the workplace (although it has been observed an increase of the serious ones) and car crashes, probably explained by the reduction of industrial production and of household consumptions.
   CONCLUSIONS: the conceptual framework seems to be the appropriate tool to set an Italian surveillance system for assessing the short and medium term impact of crisis on health, in particular the health of the most disadvantaged groups, mainly focusing on unemployed which are the most vulnerable target.

AB After legislative changes in 1978, Italian psychiatry underwent a thorough overhaul, with the gradual closure of all Mental Hospitals. A nation-wide network of Departments of Mental Health now deliver outpatient and inpatient care, but also run semi-residential and residential facilities (the latter with 2.9 beds per 10,000 inhabitants). Hospital care is delivered through small psychiatric units (with no more than 15 beds). There are also many private inpatient facilities operating in Italy, and the number of private inpatient beds per 10,000 inhabitants exceeds the number of public beds; overall there are 1.7 acute beds per 10,000 inhabitants-one of Europe's currently lowest numbers. There is marked quanti- and qualitative variation in the provision of out- and inpatient care throughout the country, and service utilization patterns are similarly uneven. Studies examining quality of life report a fairly high degree of patient satisfaction, whereas patients' families frequently bear a heavy burden. In conclusion, the Italian reform law led to the establishment of a broad network of facilities to meet diverse care needs. Further efforts are required to improve quality of care and to develop a more effectively integrated system. Greater attention must be paid to topics such as quality of care and outcomes, public and private sector balance, and the coordination of various resources and agencies.

AB Background: benzodiazepines (BDZs) highly increase the risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), especially in the elderly with certain medical conditions.
   Methods: point-prevalence study in December 2017; 2,456 patients >= 65 years were included from 14 regional public and private hospitals, 24 long-term chronic care facilities (LTCCFs) and 20 nursing homes (NHs). Data regarded BDZ prescriptions and comorbidities, co-prescriptions, or concurrent diseases, which could increase the risk of ADRs in BDZ users. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess associations between ADRs in BDZ users vs. non-users, as well as within users.
   Results: 671 patients were prescribed BDZ, whose half were in NHs. Being prescribed 10 or more drugs was twice more common among BDZ users compared to non-users. BDZs were prescribed for long-term to 80% of patients in NHs, while proportions were halved in hospitals and LTCCFs. In the analyses within BDZ users, patients in NHs and LTCCFs were at higher risk of dementia and concurrent use of opioid analgesic and antipsychotics compared to hospitalized patients.
   Conclusions: the use of BDZs in older patients is common in FVG. A great extent of comorbidities and concurrent medications at higher risk of ADRs was found. Analyses in different healthcare settings can allow to drive evidence-based interventions in order to discourage the use of BDZs and monitor the raise of ADRs.

ID PHYSICAL ABUSE; AGGRESSION; DEPRESSION; IDEATION; VIOLENCE; CHILD;

AB Suicidal cognition is defined here as the combination of thinking about committing suicide and engaging in self-harm and is considered to indicate maladjustment following an extreme internalized reaction to negative life events. Victimization at home and at school might lead some youth to suicidal cognition. The present study aimed to examine cross-sectional predictors of suicidal cognition focusing on the unique influence of 'direct victimization' at school by peers and at home by parents, over and above that of vicarious victimization (i.e. exposure to domestic violence). Participants were 998 adolescents randomly recruited from high schools in Italy who had to fill in a cross-sectional survey measuring different dimensions associated with suicidal cognition.
   Thoughts about committing suicide and self-harming in the previous 6 months were reported by almost a fourth of the whole sample, with girls having these thoughts more frequently than boys. A high prevalence rate was reported also for direct victimization at school (over half of the sample), and at home (a third of the sample) and for vicarious victimization at home (reported by a fifth of the entire sample).
   Multiple hierarchical regressions showed that a significant proportion of the total variance of suicidal cognition was explained by gender and age, meaning that older girls are more at risk of suicidal cognition than boys; relational victimization at school is also a risk factor. Direct victimization at home by the father for boys and by the father and the mother for girls significantly predicted suicidal cognition after controlling for exposure to domestic violence.

AB Background: Several studies have demonstrated that bipolar II (BD-II) disorder represents a quite common, distinct form of major mood disorders that should be separated from bipolar I (BD-I) disorder. The aims of this cross-sectional study were to assess temperament and clinical differences between patients with BD-I and BD-II disorders and to assess whether temperament traits are good predictors of hopelessness in patients with bipolar disorder, a variable highly associated with suicidal behavior and ideation.
   Method: Participants were 216 consecutive inpatients (97 men and 119 women) with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), BD who were admitted to the Sant'Andrea Hospital's psychiatric ward in Rome (Italy). Patients completed the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego-Autoquestionnaire, the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), and the Gotland Scale of Male Depression.
   Results: Patients with BD-II had higher scores on the BHS (9.78 +/- 5.37 vs 6.87 +/-4.69; t(143.59) = 3.94; P < .001) than patients with BD-I. Hopelessness was associated with the individual pattern of temperament traits (ie, the relative balance of hyperthymic vs cyclothymic-irritable-anxious-dysthmic). Furthermore, patients with higher hopelessness (compared with those with lower levels of hopelessness) reported more frequently moderate to severe depression (87.1% vs 38.9%; P < .001) and higher MINI suicidal risk.
   Conclusion: Temperaments are important predictors both of suicide risk and psychopathology and may be used in clinical practice for better delivery of appropriate care to patients with bipolar disorders. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: This study investigated the rate of suicidal intention and its relationship with the features of religious involvement in a non-clinical sample of the adult population exposed to the L'Aquila earthquake.
   Methods: The study population was composed of 426 people who had experienced the earthquake (188 males and 238 females). For comparison, 522 people were recruited from nearby unaffected areas. The sample was investigated for suicidal intention screening, distinguishing Suicidal Screen-Negative (SSN) subjects from Positive (SSP) subjects. Brief Multidimensional Measure of Religiousness/Spirituality (BMMRS) and Impact of Event Scale (IES) assessments were administered.
   Results: More SSP subjects were observed in the population exposed to the earthquake (Odds Ratio 3.54). A higher proportion of females showed suicidal ideation. Multivariate analysis showed overall significance for the between-subject factor. Univariate F tests for each BMMRS variable that contributed to significant overall effect showed that negative spiritual coping was significantly different No differences were observed for IES scores between the two groups, but correlations with negative spiritual coping were found.
   Limitations: The samples are relatively small and data are based on self-reports.
   Conclusions: Negative religious coping such as expression of conflict and doubt regarding matters of faith, as well as a feeling of being punished or abandoned by God, can prevail in response to prolonged stress without relief, as was experienced by the population exposed to the earthquake. These features are more associated with suicide ideation. Degree of religious affiliation and commitment examination by mental health practitioners can be useful when suicidal ideation is investigated. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Design. Retrospective analysis of data, obtained from the Annual Register of each Centre and the Municipal Registry Office of each local health district. Setting. Thirty-six PCDUs in north-eastern Italy and Medical Service for Addictive Disorders of the University of Verona. Participants. All IDUs who had sought medical care at least once in the PCDUs during the study period. Findings. Of 2708 deaths, overdose was found to be the major cause (37%), followed by AIDS (32.5%) and road accidents (9.4%). The percentage of deaths due to AIDS increased steadily from 2.7% in 1985 to 42.2% in 1996, and then decreased to 16.9% in 1998. Deaths due to overdose remained almost constant. The average age of death per year rose from 26 in the mid eighties to 34 in 1998. The mortality rate among IDUs proved much higher compared to the general population of the same age (13-fold, 95% CI, 11.3-14.6). The proportion of all deaths attributable to regular use of illegal opiates in the 15-34 age group in the general population in 1991 was 16%. HIV prevalence was not a significant factor in suicides and deaths by overdose. Conclusions. The mortality rate was 13 times greater than in the general population. To be female and to have dropped out of any kind of treatment proved an important risk factor for overdose. The fall in deaths from AIDS enhances the problem to prevent and treat HCV infection. Decisions in drug projects, in research and in training should be influenced by the strikingly high percentage of deaths due to drug use.

AB Self-directed aggressive behaviors of human beings show a 24h pattern. The aim of this study was to evaluate if violence of psychiatric inpatients against one another and hospital staff varies over the 24h. The clock time occurrence of 334 episodes of assault behaviors by 119 psychiatric inpatients (78 males and 41 females, mean age 34.8 +/- 11.3 years) committed during a 5-year span in the psychiatric unit of the university-based hospital of Ferrara, Italy, was evaluated. The clock time of each event was categorized by hour during the 24h and into one of four 6h intervals for analysis of temporal variation by cosinor and X-2 tests, respectively. A significant 24h variation, characterized by an early afternoon peak, was detected irrespective of gender and number (single vs, repeated) of episodes committed. Changes during the 24h in ward activity, patient contact, and endogenous circadian rhythms are likely to contribute to the observed 24h pattern, although further study is needed to confirm our findings and to define causal factors.

AB Introduction.
   Gender identity disorder or transsexualism is a complex clinical condition, and prevailing social context strongly impacts the form of its manifestations. Sex reassignment surgery (SRS) is the crucial step of a long and complex therapeutic process starting with preliminary psychiatric evaluation and culminating in definitive gender identity conversion.
   Aim.
   The aim of our study is to arrive at a clinical and psychosocial profile of male-to-female transsexuals in Italy through analysis of their personal and clinical experience and evaluation of their postsurgical satisfaction levels SRS.
   Methods.
   From January 1992 to September 2006, 163 male patients who had undergone gender-transforming surgery at our institution were requested to complete a patient satisfaction questionnaire.
   Main Outcome Measures.
   The questionnaire consisted of 38 questions covering nine main topics: general data, employment status, family status, personal relationships, social and cultural aspects, presurgical preparation, surgical procedure, and postsurgical sex life and overall satisfaction.
   Results.
   Average age was 31 years old. Seventy-two percent had a high educational level, and 63% were steadily employed. Half of the patients had contemplated suicide at some time in their lives before surgery and 4% had actually attempted suicide. Family and colleague emotional support levels were satisfactory. All patients had been adequately informed of surgical procedure beforehand. Eighty-nine percent engaged in postsurgical sexual activities. Seventy-five percent had a more satisfactory sex life after SRS, with main complications being pain during intercourse and lack of lubrication. Seventy-eight percent were satisfied with their neovagina's esthetic appearance, whereas only 56% were satisfied with depth. Almost all of the patients were satisfied with their new sexual status and expressed no regrets.
   Conclusions.
   Our patients' high level of satisfaction was due to a combination of a well-conducted preoperative preparation program, competent surgical skills, and consistent postoperative follow-up.

AB The paper explores the opportunities and challenges of combining media literacy and social-emotional literacy to promote mental health and wellbeing in school curricula. It describes the implementation of an experimental module within the program Crescere insieme What's Up (Growing up together What's Up). This upstream prevention and health promotion program, from the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region (north-eastern Italy) is designed to harness the protective effects of developing and strengthening life skills to move beyond risk factors to prevent youth suicide, fostering connections and support between school and mental health institutions, peers and adults. The program activities involved role plays and reflection activities, collaborating in project group work, consulting and producing media (such as articles, Youtube videos and Powerpoint presentations) for peer-to-peer education. It adopted an experiential approach enabling active engagement of high school students, their parents and teachers, and 'learning by doing' with agency and responsibility. Qualitative feedback from students and teachers, study limitations and further implications are discussed.

DE hanging; art-Judas; La Brigue
AB The medieval chapel of Notre Dame-des-Fontaines (Our Lady of the Fountains), in the French Maritime Alps, is entirely covered by the fresco cycle of the Passion (15th century) that depicts the last days of Jesus from the Last Supper to the Resurrection. Under a small window, there is the brutal representation of the suicide of Judas Iscariot, hanging from a tree, with the abdomen quartered from which his soul, represented by a small man, is kidnapped by a devil. The author, Giovanni Canavesio, represented the traitor's death with very detailed anatomical structures, differently thus from other paintings of the same subject; it is therefore possible to assume that the artist had become familiar with the human anatomy. In particular, the realism of the hanged man's posture, neck bent in an unnatural way, allows us to hypothesize that it probably comes from direct observation of the executions of capital punishment, not infrequently imposed by the public authorities in low medieval Italy.

AB The aim of this survey was to describe the attitude of Italian oncologists towards palliative care.
   A survey on palliative care was carried out among 400 Italian oncologists.
   Seventy-two percent indicated that the management of patients with advanced stage cancer represents the majority of their practice. They are often involved in the management of pain (78%) and complications of chemotherapy (61%), and frequently, in the treatment of terminal patients (60%). Only 8.5% reported having frequent collaboration with psychiatrists in support of emotional and psychological patients' disturbances. About 40% are often directly involved in the management of existential or spiritual distress. Discussions on euthanasia and assisted suicide, which are illegal in Italy, took place never (68%) or occasionally (27%).
   Respondents agreed that all oncology centres should have access to palliative care service. These results are in line with those of the European Society of Medical Oncology survey and may be usefully employed to improve the organisation of palliative care.

AB Hanging is a form of asphyxia caused by external pressure on the upper airways deriving from a band tightened by the gravitational weight of the body. During a 33-year period from 1983 to 2015, there were 260 hanging deaths examined at the Brescia Institute of Forensic Medicine (Northern Italy), which represented approximately 40% of all the asphyiial deaths recorded during this period. Almost all of the cases were represented by suicidal events, 1 case was a homicide event and there also was a case of sexual asphyxia. Eighty-two percent of the victims were men; 18% were women. There was an increasing tendency in the ages between 20 and 60 years, and the highest number of cases was observed in the 41- to 50-year age group (23% of the cases). The most common place chosen by the victim was the home setting followed by isolated outdoor places. The most common ligature material was a rope. The pathological findings were evaluated in all cases.

AB Objective: To explore the links between propensity to aggression and eating disorders in a sample of school-aged adolescents in a northeastern area of Italy.
   Method: In a mixed male-female sample of 1000 adolescents (10% of the district's population aged 15-19 years) we administered the Eating Attitudes Test, the Bulimic Investigatory Test of Edinburgh and the Body Attitudes Test, as measures of abnormal eating attitudes and behaviours, and the Aggression Questionnaire, as a measure of the propensity to aggression.
   Results: Females scored significantly higher than males at all eating disorders inventories (P < 0.0001). Males scored higher than females at the Aggression Questionnaire. In both genders, there was a positive correlation between scores at any of the eating disorders inventories and those at the Aggression Questionnaire (P < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: Overtly expressed aggression might have a negative impact on the course of eating disorders and on the compliance with treatment, also enhancing the risk of suicide.

AB Background. Sedative drugs are often used at the end of life for different clinical indications, and sometimes sedation is not interrupted until the patient dies. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of patients who died while deeply sedated in Italy in 2007.
   Methods. Cross-sectional survey which asked physicians about the last death that occurred among their assisted patients during the last year, and about their attitudes towards end-of-life decisions. All general practitioners (N=5,710) and a random sample of hospital physicians (N=8,950) from 14 Italian provinces were invited to participate.
   Results. The response rate was 20%. Among 1855 reported deaths, 1466 (79.2%) were classified by physicians as expected or non-sudden; 18.2% of these expected or non-sudden deaths occurred while the patient was deeply sedated. GPs were the least likely to report deep sedation, whereas anesthetists were the most likely. In 8% of cases, sedation occurred along with an abrupt increase in the dosage of opioids during the last day of life, reaching a dosage considered higher than necessary by the doctor. No association with positive attitudes of the physician towards physician assisted death was found, whereas reporting sedation was associated with a positive attitude towards respecting the choice of relatives to forgo life-sustaining treatment in the case of an incompetent patient.
   Conclusion. Our study confirms the high prevalence of patients in Italy who die while being deeply sedated and shows that different practices may converge under the same label. Careful descriptive language is needed.

AB Background Several previous randomised controlled trials of dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) since Linehan's original have shown that it has an advantage over standard care or other psychological treatments, but focus is usually on suicide-related behaviours, and little is known about its effect with offender-patients. Aims To evaluate DBT with a group of offender-patients in the Italian high intensity therapeutic facilities-the Residenze per l'Esecuzione delle Misure di Sicurezza (REMS), established under the Italian Law 81/2014. Methods Twenty-one male forensic psychiatric in-patients with borderline personality disorder were enrolled and randomly assigned to 12 months of standard DBT together with all the usual REMS treatments (n = 10) or usual REMS treatments alone (n = 11). All participants completed the same pretreatment and posttreatment assessments, including the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), and Toronto Alexithymia Scale 20 (TAS-20). Results Men receiving DBT showed a significantly greater reduction in motor impulsiveness, as measured by the BIS-11, and emotional regulation, as reflected by the DERS total score, than the controls. There were no significant differences between groups in alexithymia scores. Conclusions Italy has innovative forensic psychiatric facilities with a new recovery-rehabilitation approach, but the ambitious goals behind these cannot be achieved by pharmacology alone. For the first time in clinical forensic settings in Italy, there has been limited access to DBT. This small pilot study suggests this is likely to help ameliorate traits associated with violent and antisocial behaviours, so a full-scale randomised controlled trial should follow.

AB Aims - Most of the available evidence on the relationship between socioeconomic indicators of social deprivation and patterns of use of mental health services has been produced in the United Kingdom, where the Ministry of Health has developed a resource allocation formula based upon the results of those studies. The main aim of the paper is to evaluate the replicability in the Italian context of such research, and of the resulting allocation strategies. Methods - Detailed description of the resource allocation method currently adopted in the United Kingdom, whose main purpose consists in reaching the best balance between available funding and patterns of need. Detailed description of resource allocation processes in Italy; discussion of the main methodological and statistical limitations restraining the replicability of the British formula in the Italian context. Conclusions - There is a growing interest in Italy towards the introduction of evidence-based methods in health decision making, in order to correct the overwhelming influence of political issues. What is needed is a better understanding of the relationship between higher levels of equity in health services access, and their effects in terms of better outcomes.
   Declaration of Interest: the current paper has been developed within a Research Programme funded by the Agenzia Regionale per i Servizi Sanitari, Regione Piemonte (Deliberazione n. 54 del 31.07.02).

AB Background: Precise knowledge of the epidemiology of suicidality provides necessary information for designing prevention programs. The aims of the present study were to investigate the prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideas and attempts in the general population of Europe.
   Methods: The European Study on the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders (ESEMED) is a cross-sectional household survey carried out in a probability representative sample of non-institutionalised adults (aged 18 years or older) of six European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain). The Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0) was administered to 21,425 individuals.
   Results: Lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation was 7.8% and of suicidal attempts 1.3%. Being women, younger and divorced or widowed were associated with a higher prevalence of suicide ideation and attempts. Psychiatric diagnoses were strongly related to suicidality. Among them, major depressive episode (Rate ratio 2.9 for lifetime ideas and 4.8 for lifetime attempts), dysthymia (RR 2.0 and 1.6), GAD (RR 1.8 and 2.3 for lifetime), PTSD (RR 1.9 and 2.0) and alcohol dependence (RR 1.7 and 2.5) were the most important. Population attributable risks for lifetime suicidal attempt was 28% for major depression.
   Limitations: Information about suicidal ideas and attempts was self reported, psychiatric diagnoses were made using fully structured lay interviews rather than clinician-administered interviews.
   Conclusions: In spite of meaningful country variation in prevalence, risk factors for suicidality are consistent in the European countries. Population prevention programmes should focus on early diagnosis and treatment of major depression and alcohol abuse and in those individuals with recent appearance of suicidal ideas.

AB Objective: Rural/urban differences in the prevalence of mental disorders have often been reported in the last 30 years, among others in the distribution of eating disorder symptoms and suicide rates. The role of sex, age and socioeconomic status in the differences by place of residence has often been neglected in past studies.
   Method: Two independent community samples of students (mean age = 17.4 years, SD = 1.4), taken from among those attending high school in an urban district (Cagliari; n = 817) and in a rural one (Carbonia; n = 507) of south Sardinia, Italy, were invited to fill in the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT), the Bulimic Investigatory Test of Edinburgh (BITE), the Body Attitudes Test (BAT) and the revised Hopkins Symptom checklist (SCL-90-R).
   Results: Female students scored higher than male students on all inventories. In male participants, the scores on the EAT were higher in the urban than in the rural sample. Conversely, in both male and female students the rural sample reported higher scores on the BITE symptoms subscale. When the comparison was confined to the fraction of those who scored higher than the suggested cut-off on the EAT and the BITE, students in the urban sample outnumbered those in the rural sample. No other differences were found. Socioeconomic status and age did not influence the differences in the reporting of eating disorder symptoms by place of residence.
   Conclusions: Although caution is required when reading the findings drawn from self-report instruments, it is evident that the factors influencing the distribution of eating disorder symptoms and their psychological correlates by place of residence are far more complex than currently thought.

   committed intellectual
AB In The Disappearance of Majorana, the Italian novelist Leonardo Sciascia contends that a brilliant young physicist did not commit suicide in 1937, as is widely believed, but instead, sequestered himself into a convent rather than contribute to the development of an atomic bomb. Thus, Sciascia equates Ettore Majorana's 'refusal of science' with 'responsible science', whose scope, Sciascia suggests, must at times be restricted. By contrast, the author argues that Sciascia's Majorana is a fictional character, not the historical persona who was hardly the conscientious objector Sciascia portrays, but instead a supporter of Fascism. The author also argues, more importantly, that Sciascia's narrative, while plausible, falsifies the historical record in order to spark debate on issues in the ethics of science. However, such debate, if it were to stay within the parameters set forth by Sciascia, would fail to consider the responsibility of non-scientists to monitor how new scientific discoveries and technologies are applied by economic and political power and would absolve intellectuals from responsibility for the consequences of their choices.

DE macro indicators; Europe; alcohol; drug; suicide; mental health care
ID SUICIDE
AB Background This paper reports the findings of an analytical comparison of several macro indicators collected routinely from institutional sources in Europe. Methods We carried out a review of macro indicators capable of providing a synthetic description of mental health status and the availability of psychiatric care in European countries. These were collected routinely from sources such as WHO, OECD, EUROSTAT, and IMS. The evaluation of temporal trends in each nation permits subsequent comparisons between countries. Results In all European countries, a decreased trend of suicides was observed in the period 1980 - 2000, with the exception of Ireland and ( partially) of Spain. In Ireland, the increased trend was particularly strong, with a high risk in young and adult males. Portugal and Greece had respectively the highest and the lowest rates of undetermined causes of death. Most countries that were high consumers of alcohol in the initial period of observation had a rate above the national mean until 1980, after which consumption decreased. Most nations that were low consumers in 1960 had rates below the mean until 1980, when the rates progressively increased. However, a general decrease of alcohol-related deaths was apparent in all countries. Mortality associated with mental disorder increased, most clearly during the mid 1980s. The number of psychiatrists per 100,000 inhabitants ranged from 3.6 in Spain to 17.5 in Finland; of child psychiatrists, from 0.9 in Germany to 5.1 in Portugal. Psychiatric beds ranged from 0.4 per 1,000 inhabitants in Italy and Spain to 1.3 in Ireland. Nine countries showed a trend towards a reduction in psychiatric beds, whilst in a further five countries no change was observed. Rates of long-stay patients varied from 9.5 in the UK to 84 in Belgium, with a generally decreasing trend. The use of outpatient facilities differed markedly between countries, although there was a general increase over time. Official data were scarce in relation to the sale of psychotropic drugs. IMS data indicated increasing consumption in all European countries for antidepressant and antipsychotic medication. Conclusions The official data resources available for European countries seem to indicate some discrepancies, probably relating to methods of recording. Better co-ordination in the collection of data about mental health status in the European Union and an improvement of the quality in available services is needed.

AB Migraine headache is the cause of an estimated 250,000,000 lost days from work or school every year and is often associated with decreased work productivity. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the relationship between perceived disability, job satisfaction and work productivity in patients affected by chronic migraineurs. Participants were 98 consecutive adult outpatients admitted to the Regional Referral Headache Centre of the Sant'Andrea Hospital in Rome, Italy. Patients were administered the Italian Perceived Disability Scale, The Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Work Subscale and The Endicott Work Productivity Scale. Perceived disability is significantly associated with job satisfaction and work productivity. Job satisfaction is significantly related to work productivity and mediates the association between perceived disability and work productivity in patients affected by chronic migraineurs. Our results confirm that patients suffering from migraine headaches who have negative perceptions of their disability are less satisfied with their job, which in turn, decreases their work productivity.

AB Background: Self-reported health status in underserved population of prisoners has not been extensively explored. The purposes of this cross-sectional study were to assess self-reported health, quality of life, and access to health services in a sample of male prisoners of Italy.
   Methods: A total of 908 prisoners received a self-administered anonymous questionnaire pertaining on demographic and detention characteristics, self-reported health status and quality of life, access to health services, lifestyles, and participation to preventive, social, and rehabilitation programs. A total of 650 prisoners agreed to participate in the study and returned the questionnaire.
   Results: Respectively, 31.6% and 43.5% of prisoners reported a poor perceived health status and a poor quality of life, and 60% admitted that their health was worsened or greatly worsened during the prison stay. Older age, lower education, psychiatric disorders, self-reported health problems on prison entry, and suicide attempts within prison were significantly associated with a perceived worse health status. At the time of the questionnaire delivery, 30% of the prisoners self-reported a health problem present on prison entry and 82% present at the time of the survey. Most frequently reported health problems included dental health problems, arthritis or joint pain, eye problems, gastrointestinal diseases, emotional problems, and high blood pressure. On average, prisoners encountered general practitioners six times during the previous year, and the frequency of medical encounters was significantly associated with older age, sentenced prisoners, psychiatric disorders, and self-reported health problems on prison entry.
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that prisoners have a perceived poor health status, specific care needs and health promotion programs are seldom offered. Programs for correction of risk behaviour and prevention of long-term effects of incarceration on prisoners' health are strongly needed.

AB A tribute to Italian physiologists of Jewish descent evicted during the persecution ordered by the Fascist Regime in 1938. Adv Physiol Educ 31: 123-128, 2007; doi:10.1152/advan.00059.2006. - The present report commemorates the persecution of five renown Italian physiologists of Jewish descent that lost their chairs in medical schools because of the anti-semitic policies of the fascist regime. In 1938, Mussolini promulgated the Racial Laws, officially with the aim of safeguarding the purity of the Italian race in conquered African colonies. However, their true intent was to persecute the Italian Jewish community in agreement with the policy of Nazi Germany. In accordance with the Racial Laws, all non-Aryans were banished from professional activities and were evicted from public, social, and academic life. As a result, 98 full professors in Italian universities were removed from their academic positions. In medical schools, physiology, more than other discipline, lost the most prominent faculty members. Of the 17 full Professors of Human Physiology, five were of Jewish descent, and all were evicted: they were Camillo Artom from Palermo, Mario Camis from Bologna, Carlo Foa from Milan, Amedeo Herlitzka from Turin, and Ugo Lombroso from Genoa. All were talented and famous scientists who were forced to leave Italy and take refuge in foreign countries. At the end of World War II, Camis, Foa`, Herlitzka, and Lombroso returned to Italy and resumed their previous academic positions, whereas Artom remained in the United States. Unfortunately, Camis died later that year. During the postwar period, some of the fascists responsible for the Jewish persecution were killed or committed suicide while the survivors were imprisoned and prosecuted. However, all were soon released and resumed their former positions.

AB Benzodiazepines, which are typically used to treat insomnia and anxiety disorders, are widely prescribed in all medical fields. This widespread use has led to frequent, often inappropriate forms of consumption. Although benzodiazepines and illicit drugs are commonly associated, the rise in consumption outside the sphere of legitimate prescriptions, even in the general population, has been seriously underestimated. To better describe this phenomenon we assessed benzodiazepine prevalence and typology in 212 autopsy cases examined by the Forensic Medicine Department, University of Modena (Italy) in the three-year period from 2006 to 2008. The biological samples analysed for this study were central blood and urine. All the tests were performed using ultrasensitive liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry in "tandem Mass Spectrometers". After classifying the various causes of death, the study population was divided into the following groups: 70 deaths from natural causes (33%), 51 from accidental injuries (24%), 40 due to overdose (19%), 23 to homicide (11%), 23 to suicide (11%) and 5 from medical professional causes (5%). 30.8% of the females were BZD-positive, while that feature was identified in 25.9% of the males. The xenobiotics most frequently found were: Diazepam (29.6%), Delorazepam (22.5%), Flurazepam (14.1%), Lorazepam (12.7%), Alprazolam (11.3%) and Lormetazepam (11.3%). It is worth noting the total lack of Flunitrazepam, which is particularly prominent in the Drug Users group, because, worldwide, Flunitrazepam has been the most abused benzodiazepine among polydrug users. This finding tends to suggest that Flunitrazepam has been disappearing from the illegal market in Italy; it also seems to show that recent restrictions on its prescription in this country have already decreased its legal use or actually reduced it to zero.

AB Citrus medica cv. liscia' and C. medica cv. rugosa' are two taxa of citron, belonging to the biodiversity of South Italy, in particular of Amalfi Coast, in the Campania region. The chemical composition of the essential oils (EOs) from fruit peels of both C. medica cultivars was studied by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses. In all, 100 compounds were identified, 82 for C. medica cv. liscia', accounting for 91.4% of the total oil, and 88 for C. medica cv. rugosa', accounting for 92.0% of the total oil. Monoterpene hydrocarbons are the main constituents in both oils of C. medica cv. liscia' (79.1%) and C. medica cv. rugosa' (80.2%). In both oils, limonene (67.2%-62.8%) and camphene (8.5%-10.9%) are the main constituents. The antimicrobial activity of the EOs was assayed against some bacterial strains: Bacillus cereus (DSM 4313), Bacillus cereus (DSM 4384), Staphylococcus aureus (DSM 25693), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 50071), and Escherichia coli (DSM 8579). Low concentrations of C. medica cv. rugosa' EO showed an inhibitory effect on P. aeruginosa and higher concentrations inhibited more B. cereus (4384) and E. coli than S. aureus. The cytotoxicity of the EO was evaluated against SH-SY5Y cell line. The influence of the EO on the expression of adenylate cyclase 1 (ADCY1) was also studied. The antimicrobial activity registered confirm their traditional uses as food preserving agents and led us to hypothesize the possible use of these oils as antimicrobials. The alterations in ADCY1 expression suggested a role for limonene in effects on the central nervous system.

AB BACKGROUND: an earthquake of 6.3 magnitude struck the town and province of L'Aquila on 6th April 2009. About 100,000 buildings were damaged, 1,600 people remained in-jured and 309 deceased; 66,000 people were left homeless by the disaster. The studies performed on the consequences of this seismic event have been numerous, more than those published on the occasion of similar events in Italy.
   DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: an electronic bibliographic research was conducted through Embase, MedLine, Current Contents, Web of Science, PsycINFO during a reference period from April 2009 to August 2015. All articles fulfilling keywords criteria of "L'Aquila" and/or "earthquake" were eventually selected. A further search was conducted on Google and Google Scholar and authors were contacted if necessary to obtain article copies. Finally, 56 papers were identified and grouped in areas of interest: studies in general population, clinical studies on psychiatric sample, studies on medical conditions, studies on suicidal behaviours, and studies human and animal behaviours.
   RESULTS: Twenty-three studies were conducted on general populations, 9 of whom on adolescent samples. All studies were done in convenience samples. Thirteen clinical studies were conducted in psychiatric samples and 16 in medical or paraphysiological conditions. Three studies were conducted in suicidal ideations and behaviours. One article is about human and animal behaviours. These studies show that different population groups were characterized by specific kinds of response to the trauma with different possible interactions of risk and protective factors.
   CONCLUSIONS: from such observations it can be conceived that research on the evaluation and identification of the interventions have to change across years in order to meet the needs of the different subgroups of survivors.

AB Introduction. To the average consumer, "cosmetics" are not considered to cause damage to human health under normal conditions of use. Thus, cosmetic "safety" does not require any particular attention to the possibility that cosmetics may result in a toxic exposure, especially for children. Poison Control Centres (PCCs) provide specialized and rapid information for consumers and health professionals to ensure management of events related to the exposures to different agents, including Cosmetics. Poison Control Centres also represent a unique source of information to investigate the frequency and type of exposures to cosmetic and the related risks. Objective. An analysis of cases concerning human exposures to cosmetics collected from 2005 to 2010 by the FCC at the Ospedale Niguarda Ca' Granda (Milan, Italy) was performed. Results. During this period, 11 322 human exposure cases related to cosmetics were collected accounting for 4.5% of the total human clinical cases. Almost, all the requests for assistance came from consumers (53%) and hospitals (40%). The most frequently reported site of exposure was the consumer's own residence (94%). The exposures mainly involved children younger than 4 years (77%). No difference in gender distribution was observed (female 49%, male 51%). Almost, all of the exposures were unintentional (94%). Intentional exposures, mainly related to suicide attempts and accounted for 6% of cases involving persons aged more than 12 years. Personal hygiene products (30%), perfumes and hair care products (excluding hair dyes) (both 13%) were the most frequently involved categories. Symptoms were present only in 26% of the exposures and were mostly gastrointestinal (46%). Most of the cases were managed at home (43%) whereas hospital intervention was required in 38%. Conclusion. Since the exposure frequency seems more likely to reflect product availability and accessibility to ingestors, our results call for closer attention to this type of hazard, especially for children younger than 4 years of age.

AB This article explores the case of ?illegal? immigration at the end of the Second World War and, specifically, the events that unfolded at the Italian port of La Spezia. In April 1946, 1014 visa-less Jewish refugees, who were attempting to reach the British Mandate of Palestine, were detained on a vessel by Italian authorities under the instruction of the British. Rather than conceding to Whitehall?s rejection of entry visas, the Spezia refugees remained defiant, threatening collective mass-suicide and staging hunger strikes until passage was finally granted. The Spezia narrative has, however, remained on the periphery of academic scholarship, with the case of the ship Exodus 1947, which set sail the following year, dominating historiographical accounts. This article demonstrates the impact of the La Spezia Affair on post-war migratory movements and, most notably, the importance of refugee agency within the context of forced migration. Analysing the events at La Spezia from the port itself recasts the narrative through a ?local? lens, recovering the role of the refugees which has been largely overshadowed by state-level responses. In so doing, traditional perspectives from ?above? are confronted with those from ?below?, reconfiguring our historical understanding of refugees and transnational migration in the twentieth century.

AB Objective: To evaluate long-term mortality rate of anorexia nervosa (AN) patients in a southern Italy population compared to the most recent literature.
   Design: Retrospective and review setting.
   Patients and interventions: One hundred and forty-seven female AN patients, consecutively admitted from 1994 to 1997 to the Outpatient Unit, were re-examined between June and November 2003. Our data are compared with 10 other studies published since 1988.
   Results: One hundred and twenty-three deaths in 2240 patients, amounting to a total mortality rate of 5.25% were reported in the literature. Deaths due to suicide, AN-related and AN-unrelated diseases were 1.20, 3.07 and 0.98%, respectively. After correcting for unrelated deaths, mortality rate was 4.27%. In our 8-year follow-up, we found a mortality rate of 2.72% (1.82% after correcting for unrelated deaths). Standardized mortality ratio was 9.7.
   Conclusion: We interpret our favourable findings as a consequence of an integrated, clinical-nutritional and psychiatric approach. Finally, considering AN demographic characteristics, that is young female subjects in Westernized societies, mortality rate is confirmed to be dramatically high.

TI 'Making the World Weep'? Decapitation/Castration in Puccini's
   <i>Turandot</i>
SO ROMANCE STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE Puccini; Turandot; opera; decapitation; psychoanalysis; women
AB Drawing upon Freudian psychoanalysis, in this article I argue that decapitation in Puccini's Turandot - that is, the beheading of Turandot's suitors - functions as an enactment of the male castration complex. As such, it is the site upon which fears of castration on the part of Puccini and the patriarchal society to which he belonged are played out. The opera illuminates the composer's latent misogyny - a misogyny which permeated a substantial proportion of the national psyche during the early twentieth century in Italy, as well as many men's attitudes towards women during this period which saw the aftermath of the rise of the movement for female emancipation. I begin by discussing the theme of decapitation in the opera before examining the archetypal suffering heroine in Puccini's oeuvre. I then focus on a secondary character from the opera, Liu, Puccini's partial addition to the dramaturgy: Liu is made to suffer for approximately fourteen minutes during the final act, after which, somewhat sadistically, she is made to commit suicide. Following recent work by feminist musicologist Carolyn Abbate and philosopher Adriana Cavarero, I argue that Liu's 'undoing' in the dramaturgy is surpassed by the 'envoicing' of the diva - the female performer - singing her role.

AB In spite of the diffusion of focus groups method across disciplines and in several areas of research, and although scholars have indicated the utility of this method in cross-cultural research and research with ethnic minority groups, focus groups have been used in this kind of study to a limited extent. One of the reasons for this might be due to the lack of confidence of the researcher in using this kind of method in culturally diverse populations. Being culturally sensitive and, at the same time, pursuing data comparability, makes doing cross-cultural focus groups research a difficult task that necessitates adequate planning and preparation. In this chapter, I present advantages and possible pitfalls of the use of focus groups in cross-cultural research, referring to my recent experience as moderator of focus group discussions in Italy, India and Australia. Suggestions and recommendations for the use of this method with culturally diverse groups are provided, looking at the three phases of the focus groups process: planning, conducting and analysing/reporting.

AB ObjectivesTo investigate the prevalence and associated psychosocial factors of occasional and repetitive direct self-injurious behavior (D-SIB), such as self-cutting, -burning, -biting, -hitting, and skin damage by other methods, in representative adolescent samples from 11 European countries.
   MethodsCross-sectional assessment of adolescents was performed within the European Union funded project, Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE), which was conducted in 11 European countries. The representative sample comprised 12,068 adolescents (F/M: 6,717/5,351; mean age: 14.90.89) recruited from randomly selected schools. Frequency of D-SIB was assessed by a modified 6-item questionnaire based on previously used versions of the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory (DSHI). In addition, a broad range of demographic, social, and psychological factors was assessed.
   ResultsOverall lifetime prevalence of D-SIB was 27.6%; 19.7% reported occasional D-SIB and 7.8% repetitive D-SIB. Lifetime prevalence ranged from 17.1% to 38.6% across countries. Estonia, France, Germany, and Israel had the highest lifetime rates of D-SIB, while students from Hungary, Ireland, and Italy reported low rates. Suicidality as well as anxiety and depressive symptoms had the highest odds ratios for both occasional and repetitive D-SIB. There was a strong association of D-SIB with both psychopathology and risk-behaviors, including family related neglect and peer-related rejection/victimization. Associations between psychosocial variables and D-SIB were strongly influenced by both gender and country. Only a minor proportion of the adolescents who reported D-SIB ever received medical treatment.
   ConclusionThese results suggest high lifetime prevalence of D-SIB in European adolescents. Prevalence as well as psychosocial correlates seems to be significantly influenced by both gender and country. These results support the need for a multidimensional approach to better understand the development of SIB and facilitate culturally adapted prevention/intervention.

AB Introduction: The severity of emotional responses to life events (PTSD spectrum) as part of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in Substance Use Disorder (SUD) patients has often been considered from a unitary perspective. Light has also been shed on the possible definition of a specific psychopathology of SUD patients. This psychopathology has been proved to be independent of treatment choice, of being active in using substances, of lifetime psychiatric comorbidity and primary substance of abuse (heroin, alcohol, cocaine).
   Methods: To further support this unitary perspective, in this study we have compared the severity and typology of the five psychopathological dimensions found in SUD patients, by dividing 93 HUD patients (77.4% males and 22.6% females), characterized by the lifetime absence of exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence, on the basis of the severity of their PTSD spectrum. We used the cut-off that differentiated people developing (High PTSD spectrum; H-PTSD/S) or not developing (Low PTSD spectrum; L-PTSD/S) a PTSD after the earthquake that hit L'Aquila, Italy, in April 2009.
   Results: Using a canonical correlation analysis, the significant (p < 0.001) canonical variate set-one (psychopathology) is saturated negatively by "panic anxiety" and positively by the "worthlessness-being trapped" and "violence-suicide" dimensions. Set-two (PTSD spectrum) is saturated negatively by "emotional, physical and cognitive responses to loss and traumas", and positively by "grief reactions", "re-experiencing numbing", "arousal symptoms" and "personality traits". When comparing the two groups, all five psychopathological dimensions were significantly more severe in H-PTSD/S patients, who were distinguished by higher values of worthlessness-being trapped, sensitivity-psychoticism and violence-suicide symptomatology. No differences were observed regarding the typology of psychopathology.
   Conclusions: This study further supports the SUD-PTSD spectrum unitary perspective and argues in favor of the inclusion of the PTSD spectrum in the psychopathology of SUD. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study aims to explore rates of deliberate self-harm (DSH) behaviors and their psychological and psychopathological correlates within a sample of nonclinical young adults (N = 365; 63% women; M age = 23 +/- 4.06). Participants completed the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory and other self-report questionnaires assessing clinical (borderline personality, dissociative, and depersonalization traits) and nonclinical (body perception, behavioral inhibition and activation, cognitive emotional regulation, and the Big Five traits) dimensions of their personality. The rate of DSH in the present sample was 39%, comparable to that found in previous studies of young adults in other countries. Further, consistent with past research, DSH was found to be associated with clinical dimensions of personality pathology, including borderline personality and dissociative symptoms. Finally, results revealed an association between DSH and nonclinical dimensions of personality, including the behavioral activation dimension of fun-seeking, more negative body perception and lower body protection, the use of more nonadaptive cognitive strategies for regulating emotions, higher levels of openness to experience, and lower levels of emotional stability. This pattern of results is consistent with those found for other impulsive behaviors and impulse control disorders.

AB Objective: Although a large number of studies have investigated the association between Non-suicidal Self-injury (NSSI) and personality pathology, they have adopted exclusively a categorical approach, neglecting the study of maladaptive personality functioning. The aim of the current study is to investigate whether and which dimensions of maladaptive personality functioning are mainly associated with the presence of NSSI in a community sample of adolescents.
   Method: Severity of maladaptive personality functioning and NSSI were evaluated in 247 adolescents (68.8% females, M = 15.57, SD = 2.24) recruited from middle and secondary schools in Northern Italy.
   Results: Results showed that lifetime self-injurers reported more difficulties in domains of Social Concordance, Self-control, Identity Integration and Responsibility than adolescents with no lifetime NSSI. On the contrary, no significant differences were found in the Relation domain between participants with and without lifetime NSSI.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest the importance of taking into account a dimensional approach that consider the level of personality functioning in order to deeper understand the association between maladaptive personality and NSSI. In particular, our results indicate that intrapersonal aspects of maladaptive personality functioning, rather than interpersonal ones, have a key role in the presence of NSSI during adolescence.

AB Purpose: To investigate to which extent occupational status, and job titles, were associated with types of hospitalisations and psychiatric diagnoses among inpatients of Friuli Venezia Giulia Region, Italy. Methods: Cross-sectional study based on 10 years register data (2008-2017) on 2929 subjects hospitalised in General Hospital Psychiatric Units. Odds ratios (OR) of hospitalisations and psychiatric diagnoses for occupational status and job titles were calculated by logistic regression analysis. Results: Employed were at lower risk of urgent and involuntary hospitalisation. The risk of urgent hospitalisation was higher for affective, organic or other disorders, while all psychiatric diagnoses were at lower risk of involuntary hospitalisation than psychosis. Using white collars as reference category, army showed a higher risk for urgent hospitalisation (OR = 2.3) and affective disorders (OR = 1.9). A higher risk for affective disorders was found in managers (OR = 2.0). Blue collars were at higher risk for alcohol and substance abuse (OR = 1.7). Conclusions: Employment was protective for urgent and involuntary hospitalisations and severe diagnoses. Hospitalisation for affective disorders was more likely in managers, army, and for substances abuse in blue collars. More research is needed to assess the association between specific occupational groups and involuntary hospitalisation.Keypoints Employment was shown to be a protective factor for both urgent and involuntary hospitalisations and diagnosis of severe mental disorder. Managers, police and military forces were at higher risk of being hospitalised for affective disorders, while blue collars were at higher risk of hospitalisation for alcohol and substances abuse. Future research would benefit from a better analysis on the association between more specific occupational groups and hospitalisation for psychiatric disorders, with a particular focus on involuntary treatment. Further research is needed to compare the risk of hospitalisation for mental disorders in temporary or permanent position, according to recent international changes in labour market and its impact on mental health.

DE Fair Vida/Lepa Vida; myth; human sacrifice; Rene Girard; Duino/Devin
AB According to Rene Girard, sacrificial rites and myths reenact the founding murder, which puts an end to the mimetic crisis and allows the formation of a human community. in this light, it is interesting to observe the 70 folk songs and the fairy tale about Lepa Vida (Fair Vida) that may present several motifs; characteristic of sacrificial myths. The mimetic crisis is symbolized by the sea, particularly the red and green sea in one of the songs from the Resia Valley (Slovene: Rezija, Italian: Val Resia), by the pair of male antagonists (Husband/Father and Zamorec/Seaman) and by the sun-moon pair. Vida's violent death is transformed into a suicide, a departure for a foreign land, or a long/eternal journey on the sea. The maritime abduction motif might narrate a sacrificial offering from a boat, in which Vida is the offered sacrifice, while Zamorec/Seaman is the priest. The folklore connects Fair Vida with Duino/Devin near Trieste (Italy). The etymology of the place's name, the collective understanding of Devin as the setting of Fair Vida and the legend of the White Lady suggest that the place might have been a site Of human sacrifice. Preseren stressed Fair Vida's ambivalent scapegoat quality, thus making it more interesting for literary and media renditions.

AB In a mixed male-female sample of 1000 adolescents age 15 to 19 years in a northeastern area of Italy, we investigated the links between eating disorders and suicidal tendencies by means of self-compiled measures, including the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT), the Bulimic Investigatory Test of Edinburgh (BITE), the Body Attitudes Test (BAT), and the SCL-90-R. More females than males reported abnormal eating patterns suggesting eating disorders: we found that 100 females (15.8%) and 8 males (2.8%) achieved scores above the suggested cutoff on EAT (cutoff = 30), 26 females (4.1%) and 1 male (.3%) achieved scores above the suggested cutoff on BITE (cutoff = 20), and 287 females (45.5%) and 24 males (8.6%) achieved scores above the suggested cutoff on BAT (cutoff = 36). More females than males also reported symptoms of hopelessness (44.3% vs. 30.5%) and suicidal ideation (30.8% vs. 25.3%). Both males and females reporting suicidal ideation achieved significantly higher scores on the eating disorders inventories, with no independent contribution by age, socioeconomic status, or body mass index. Although caution is required when drawing conclusions from self-reported measures, studies on mood disorders and suicidality in youth clearly need to include measures of eating disorders.

AB Psychiatric disorders and in particular depression have increased during the "Great Recession". The aim of this study was to investigate the consumption of psychotropic drugs in people who lost their permanent employment, using administrative data. The study considered all of the subjects domiciled in Lombardy, Northern Italy, who lost a permanent employment between 2008 and 2010, not assuming psychotropic drugs and who did not find a new job within the following 12 months. The control group included people who did not lose permanent job in the study period, matched to the cases for gender, age, nationality, skill level, education and economic sector, using propensity score matching. The subjects who lost their permanent employment were 17 % more likely to receive one or more drug prescriptions than the controls, but the difference was significant only for males. Females, subjects aged > 50 years, low skill level workers and Italians were more likely to have received a prescription for psychotropic drugs than respectively males, subjects aged 20-29 years or aged 30-39 years, low skill level workers and non-Italians. The average number of drugs prescribed for those who lost their job and those who continued working was respectively 2.9 and 3.1. In conclusion, losing a permanent job increases significantly psychotropic drugs consumption in males but not in females.

DE Unemployment; mortality; health promoting factor; dignity of person
ID MENTAL-HEALTH; UNEMPLOYMENT; MORTALITY; SUICIDE; GENDER; ADULTS; IMPACT
AB "Work as a basic human need and health promoting factor". The Italian Constitution (1948) defines 'work' as the founding value of the Italian Republic. This choice was not motivated by mere economic reasons, but rather stemmed from the recognition that work is the most appropriate tool for the expression of the human personality in society, that it is an asset and a right that will increase the dignity of every person, and which corresponds to a fundamental human desire to fulfil oneself in relationship with other persons and the entire world. This view of work, including its technical and manual aspects, was unknown to the ancient mentality and became familiar to us through the monastic orders of the early middle ages, which began to conceive and practise human work as a means of participating in the work of creation and transmitted this value over the centuries. As we experience today, if occupation is lacking, a basic condition for the development of the person and for his/her contribution to the growth of society is lost. Given the meaning of work in human experience, it is not surprising that unemployment represents not only a worrisome economic indicator, but also the cause of ill health. At the end of 2009 unemployment in the European Union reached 10%, similar to the rate in the US; in Italy it was estimated at 8.5% in December 2009 and is expected to reach 10% in 2010. In Lombardy, although employment had been constantly increasing between 1995 and 2008, and the current unemployment rate is as low as 4.9%, 100,000 jobs were lost in 2009. Several scientific papers have demonstrated the association between lack of occupation and lack of physical and mental health. In the present period of crisis, increases of 30% in cases of anxiety syndrome and of 15% in cases of depression have been reported. An increase in suicides among unemployed persons has been documented in several countries even if there are still problems of interpretation of the causal chain of events. Mortality among the unemployed increased, not only that due to violent causes, but also mortality for all causes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. A survey in the Turin area, Northern Italy, showed a twofold increase in mortality among unemployed men. Women were affected both by husbands' unemployment and by their own unemployment because of the previous increasing rate of female occupation. The worse the occupational condition (from "seeking work" to "temporary employment" down to "unemployed and no longer seeking work") the higher the mortality: in the latter category, where the most evident problem is marginalization and social exclusion, the increase in mortality was fourfold. The role of occupational health physicians is to recognize the possible negative effects of working conditions and at the same time promote a positive approach to work, even in difficult conditions. This makes prevention more effective and promotes health. To be aware of the meaning of work makes work itself more liveable and more productive. This is how health promotion contributes to the wellbeing of the individual and, at the same time, to the development of the economy and society at large.

   killer; Criminal profiling
AB Between 1995 and 1997, in the territories of Southern Italy, there were fifteen murders of elderly women over the age of 70 years old. Initially, however, not all the murders were attributed to a single serial killer. The majority of the victims were stabbed multiple times in the neck, except for three cases in which the cause of death was manual strangulation. There was evidence of sexual assault in only one of the cases. All the victims were discovered in their own apartments, which were located on the ground level, with no signs of forced entry. In most of the cases, the offender stole money and/or jewellery. A multi-disciplinary team reviewed the cases during the investigation and created a profile of the killer. The team determined that the method of operation was completely unusual for the local criminal element. They suggested that the perpetrator could be an immigrant, who committed the murders for sexual motivation and who may have been arrested previously for sex-related incidents. On 15th September 1997, a suspect was arrested. He was identified as Ben Mohamed Ezzedine Sebai, a 35-year-old white male, originally from Tunisia. He was charged and convicted of four of the murders and was given a life sentence. In 2005, Sebai confessed to the murders of four additional elderly women, for which nine other people had already been previously tried and convicted, among them, a man who committed suicide in jail. In 2007, Sebai finally confessed to committing fifteen murders that occurred between 1995 and 1997. Sebai also admitted to experiencing sexual gratification at every homicide scene, even though there was no physical proof at most of the crime scenes. The goal of this article is to illustrate a little-known but noteworthy case concerning a serial sexual killer of elderly women that occurred in Southern Italy, highlighting the method of operation, the victim selection process, and the injuries inflicted. The article will also discuss his motivation, the mental health history of the offender, his clinical diagnosis, and his self-reported childhood abuse. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

ID INTENSIVE-CARE UNITS; EUTHANASIA; ATTITUDES; DEATH
AB Background: In this study we investigated (a) to what extent physicians have experience with performing a range of end-of-life decisions (ELDs), (b) if they have no experience with performing an ELD, would they be willing to do so under certain conditions and (c) which background characteristics are associated with having experience with/or being willing to make such ELDs.
   Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was sent to 16,486 physicians from specialities in which death is common: Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland.
   Results: The response rate differed between countries (39-68%). The experience of foregoing life-sustaining treatment ranged between 37% and 86%: intensifying the alleviation of pain or other symptoms while taking into account possible hastening of death between 57% and 95%, and experience with deep sedation until death between 12% and 46%. Receiving a request for hastening death differed between 34% and 71%, and intentionally hastening death on the explicit request of a patient between 1% and 56%.
   Conclusion: There are differences between countries in experiences with ELDs, in willingness to perform ELDs and in receiving requests for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. Foregoing treatment and intensifying alleviation of pain and symptoms are practiced and accepted by most physicians in all countries. Physicians with training in palliative care are more inclined to perform ELDs, as are those who attend to higher numbers of terminal patients. Thus, this seems not to be only a matter of opportunity, but also a matter of attitude.

AB The aim of our study is to evaluate the temporal trend of deaths in a cohort of i.v. drug users (IVDU) followed in a city of Northen Italy (Bologna) and to assess its relationship with HIV infection and AIDS, and availability of potent antiretroviral therapy. One thousand and 214 IVDU (mainly heroin addicts), 916 males and 298 females, attending an outpatient service for treatment and prevention of substance abuse between 1977 and November 1996, were enrolled into our observational cohort, and their vital status was ascertained up to December 31, 2002. The large majority of enrolled subjects were. born in the Bologna metropolitan area and surroundings; no extra-European immigrants were present. During the observation period, 271 IVDU (22.3%) died, 211 males (23.0%), and 60 females (20.1%). No death was recorded before 1984. Main death causes result as follows: AIDS (52.8% of episodes), heroin overdose (22.1%), street accidents (7.4%), decompensated liver cirrhosis (6.3%), and suicide (2.9%). The highest absolute number of deaths was observed between years 1991 and 1996. Crude mortality rate caused by AIDS was 10.0 per 1000 for males and 13.2/1000 for females; the rate of death due to other causes proved 11.1/1000 among males and 5.2/1000 among females. Over the last few] In most recent years, a sharp decrease in the number of AIDS-related deaths, attributable to the increased use of potent antiretroviral regimens, was recorded.

AB Objective: The aim of the present study was to test whether circadian differences in the response to opiates exist in humans and, if so, whether they are synchronized with the well-known circadian variations in overdose frequency.
   Design: Daily variations in opiate overdose frequency, total amount of naloxone necessary to treat the comatose state, and frequency of hospitalization were examined in pure, nonlethal, consecutive cases of opiate (presumably intravenous heroin) overdoses. Furthermore, daily variations in the frequency of lethal overdoses were examined in all cases observed during the same period.
   Setting: An 8-yr prospective, observational study in the city and suburban area of Ferrara, Italy.
   Patients: A total of 518 consecutive cases of nonlethal opiate overdoses in 327 different patients, plus 110 consecutive cases of lethal opiate overdoses with precise or presumptive time of death.
   Results: Analysis of the circadian distribution of nonlethal overdoses showed a significant peak in the afternoon to early evening. Analysis of the distribution of the hourly average amount of naloxone used to rescue patients from coma showed an opposite circadian variation, with a significant peak in the early morning. The hospitalization risk was also significantly higher from 3:00 to 8:59 am, However, in a subset of representative cases, plasma morphine concentrations did not change significantly in different hours of the day, Analysis of circadian distribution of lethal overdoses showed a significant peak in the evening hours. The death risk (calculated as the percentage of lethal events in the total number of intoxications within a given time frame) was significantly higher from 3:00 to 8:59 am.
   Conclusion: The present data provide evidence for the existence of circadian variations in the individual sensitivity to opiate overdose.

DT Article
DE mortality; accidents; immigrants
ID OCCUPATIONAL INJURY; WORKERS; RISK
AB OBJECTIVE: to examine the characteristics and mortality trends for specific type of accident in immigrants resident in Tuscany and to compare them to those observed in Italians resident in the same region.
   DESIGN: descriptive study using the data of the Regional Mortality Registry of Tuscany.
   SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 1997-2008 deaths for accidents by citizenship ("Italians" and "Immigrants" from Countries with strong migratory pressure or PFPM) in residents in Tuscany.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: number of deaths, proportional mortality and standardized (standard: European population) mortality 15-64 truncated rates per 100,000 for each specific accidental cause of death, by gender and population (PFPM and Italians), in 1997-2008, and confidence intervals at 95% (95% CI); trends in mortality standardized truncated rates for specific accidental cause in immigrants and Italians in 2002-2008.
   RESULTS: in the period 1997-2008, 315 deaths for accidents have been registered in immigrants. The comparison between immigrants and Italians did not reveal any significant difference in mortality for road and at work accidents. Suicides are significantly higher in Italian males (rate in Italians 9.3; 95% CI 8.7-10.0 vs. rate in PFPM 4.3; 95% CI 2.4-6.2), while homicides are higher in male immigrants (rate in Italians 0.6; IC95% 0.4-0.8 vs. rate in PFPM 3.2 95% CI 1.7-4.7). Deaths from other injuries are more frequent in Italians in both genders. Trends in mortality rates indicate a reducing gap between immigrants and Italians.
   CONCLUSION: in Tuscany, mortality rates for some specific accidental causes are significantly different between immigrants and Italians, nevertheless trends of the last evaluated period seem to reveal a reducing gap suggesting a progressive integration of immigrants.

AB People with mental disorders show mortality rates up to 22.2 times higher than that of the general population. In spite of progressive increase in life expectancy observed in the general population, the mortality gap of people suffering from mental health problems has gradually widened. The aim of this paper was to study mortality rates in people suffering from mental illness in a cohort of people (16,981 subjects) in the local mental health register of the province of Modena during the decade 2006-2015.
   Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs) were calculated to compare the mortality of people with mental disorders to the mortality of people living in the province of Modena and the excess of mortality was studied in relation to the following variables: gender, age group, diagnosis and causes of death. In addition, Poisson regression analysis was performed to study the association between patient characteristics and mortality.
   An overall excess mortality of 80% was found in subjects under the care of mental health services as compared to the reference population (SMR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.7-1.9). Subjects in the 15-44 year group presented the highest SMR (9.2, 95% CI 6.9-11.4). The most prevalent cause of death was cancer (28.1% of deaths). At the Poisson regression, the diagnosis "Substance abuse and dependence" showed the highest relative risk (RR) (4.00). Moreover, being male, single, unemployed and with a lower qualification was associated with higher RRs.
   Our study confirms that subjects with mental illness have higher SMR. Noteworthy, the overall higher risk of mortality was observed in the younger age group.

AB Objective
   This research sought to assess whether and to what extent the ongoing economic crisis in Italy impacted hospitalizations, in-hospital mortality and expenditures associated with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
   Methods
   The data were obtained from the hospital discharge database of the Italian Health Ministry and aggregated at the hospital level. Each hospital (n = 549) was observed for 4 years and was geographically located within a "Sistema Locale del Lavoro" (SLL, i.e., clusters of neighboring towns with a common economic structure). For each SLL, the intensity of the crisis was determined, defined as the 2012-2008 increase in the area-specific unemployment rate. A difference-in-differences (DiD) approach was employed to compare the increases in AMI-related outcomes across different quintiles of crisis intensity.
   Results
   Hospitals located in areas with the highest intensity of crisis (in the fifth quintile) had an increase of approximately 30 AMI cases annually (approximately 13%) compared with hospitals in area with lower crisis intensities (p<0.001). A significant increase in total hospital days was observed (13%, p<0.001) in addition to in-hospital mortality (17%, p<0.001). As a consequence, an increase of around (sci)350.000 was incurred in annual hospital expenditures for AMI (approximately 36%, p<0.001).
   Conclusions
   More attention should be given to the increase in health needs associated with the financial crisis. Policies aimed to contrast unemployment in the community by keeping and reintegrating workers in jobs could also have positive impacts on adverse health outcomes, especially in areas of high crisis intensity.

AB Background: We wanted to examine how the acceptance of euthanasia among the general public in Western Europe has changed in the last decades, and we wanted to look for possible explanations. Methods: We analysed data from the European Values Surveys, held in 1981, 1990, and 1999-2000 in 12 West European countries. In each country, representative samples of the general public were interviewed using the same structured questionnaire in all countries. Euthanasia was explained in the questionnaires as 'terminating the life of the incurably sick'. Results: A total of 46 199 respondents participated in the surveys. A significant increase in acceptance of euthanasia could be observed in all countries except (West) Germany. While the average increase in euthanasia acceptance was 22%, the increase was particularly obvious in Belgium, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. Although changes in several characteristics of respondents, such as decrease in religious beliefs, rising belief in the right to self-determination, and (to a lesser extent) rise in levels of education, were associated with growing acceptance of euthanasia, they could only partly explain the increase of euthanasia acceptance over the years. Conclusions: An increase of euthanasia acceptance among the general public took place over the last two decades in almost all West European countries, possibly indicating a growing support for personal autonomy regarding medical end-of-life decisions. If this trend continues, it is likely to increase the public and political debate about the (legal) regulation of euthanasia under certain conditions of careful medical practice in several West European countries.

ID OUTBREAK
AB Objective: to describe methanol poisoning exposures in Italy and to investigate a cluster of methanol-related deaths due to abuse occurred in Sicily among immigrants from East Europe.
   Design: the human methanol exposures handled by the Poison Control Centre of Milan, the major national centre for toxicological advise active in Italy were reviewed retrospectively (January 2004-September 2006) and prospectively (October 2006-October 2008).
   Setting: for each case of managed human exposure, the Poison Control Centre of Milan uses a standard format to collect patient information, substance/exposure information, clinical effects, therapy, outcomes. The database arising from that procedure was searched for all cases exposed to methanol and/or reporting selected clinical signs (i.e., metabolic acidosis with ocular effects and/or central nervous system depression and/or respiratory depression). Each case was reviewed and classified according to standard criteria.
   Main outcomes: three commercial products containing more than 70% methanol available on the market in Sicily and associated with lethal exposures due to abuse among immigrants were identified.
   Results: in the period under study, the Poison Control Centre of Milan examined 29 methanol poisoning exposures (none in 2004, 6 in 2005, 6 in 2006, 15 in 2007, and 2 in 2008). Among them, 17 occurred in Sicily, with a peak of 11 cases in 2007, and 12 in other regions. The patients included 16 men and 13 women with a median age of 49,5 years (range 1-81 years). Fifteen cases were immigrants from East Europe (14 Rumanian and one Polish). Eleven cases reported minor effects, two cases moderate effects, four cases major effects, and 12 cases died. Twelve cases were accidental exposures (5 occurred at work, 3 at home and 4 in other places), while 17 cases were intentional exposures (14 due to abuse, 2 to attempted suicide and I to misuse). Minor effects were reported in I I cases, moderate effects in two cases, major effects in four cases and death in 12 cases. The most frequently reported clinical effects included: coma (13 cases), metabolic acidosis (10 cases), mydriasis (4 cases), visual loss (3 cases), gastric pyrosis (2 cases), constriction of the visual field (2 cases), and vertigo (2 cases). Blood methanol level was reported for 15 cases ( 50 mg/dL in 2 cases; 50-99 mg/dL in 2 cases; 100-499 mg/dL in 4 cases; > 500 mg/dL in I case; positive, unknown value in 6 cases). All cases due to abuse (n. 14) and, among them, lethal (n. 12) occurred in Sicily and involved immigrants. On the other hand, all methanol poisonings occurring in the other Italian regions involved Italian citizens unintentionally exposed and with minor effects, except for one case of attempted suicide with consequent major effects. The investigations performed in Sicily lead to identifying three locally produced and marketed detergents containing more than 70% methanol improperly labelled and packaged. Furthermore, a detergent for domestic use was identified containing 25-30% methanol without any labelling information. Two of the detergents containing more than 70% methanol were withdrawn from the market in November 2007, while the other that was identified later, was withdrawn in July 2008, The detergent for domestic use, containing 25-30% methanol was Withdrawn in December 2007. Starting from July 2008, no new cases of methanol poisonings were observed.
   Conclusion: the availability in Sicily of products containing high concentrations of methanol, improperly packaged and labelled, determined a generalised risk of accidental exposures and favoured voluptuary assumption of methanol among selected groups. The observations highlight the importance of a surveillance system of toxic exposures based on the information collected by the Poison Control Centres and its ability to provide timely identification of unexpected and dangerous events and to support preventive actions.

AB Evaluation of pain perception in chronic pain patients with a concomitant mood-spectrum disorder. Design: The observational retrospective study is based on patient data collected in psychosomatic consultations held at the Gift Institute for Integrative Medicine in Pisa, Italy, from 2002 to 2014. Evoked pain stimulus threshold and tolerance were evaluated using the cold pressor test. Clinical pain intensity and Sensorial, Affective, and Evaluative dimensions were assessed using the Italian Pain Questionnaire, and Anxiety and Depressive symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale. Mood-spectrum disorders were diagnosed via the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, and affective temperament in accordance with Akiskal and Pinto's criteria (1999). Of a total of 627 chronic pain clinic patients, 381 were diagnosed with a concomitant mood-spectrum (MS) disorder, unipolar (US) in 61.41%. Pain threshold (t = 2.28; p < 0.05) was lower, and all clinical pain dimensions (t = 2.28; p < 0.05) increased, in MS patients compared to those without psychiatric disorders. Pain intensity (F = 3.5, p < 0.05) and cognitive pain component scores (F = 7.84; p < 0.0001) were higher in US and, to a lesser extent Bipolar Spectrum, than in subjects with other (n.112) or no psychiatric disorders (n. 134). Suicide ideation was highest in US (F = 37.20; p < 0.0001), although in BS major depressive episodes had more melancholic features (F = 46.73; P < 0.0001), and a longer history of psychiatric disorders before the pain onset than US (F = 20.31; p < 0.0001). Pain management should take into account pre-existing psychiatric disorders.

ID OUTCOMES; SUCCESS; CARE
AB Objective: This study, examined the outcomes of all patients who were discharged from an Italian psychiatric hospital into community residences three to four years after discharge. Methods: The total population of Antonini Mental Hospital near Milan on January 1996 (N=337) was assessed by using the expanded Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the overall social behavior and social role functioning sections of the Disability Assessment Schedule. The hospital closed in 1099, and all patients who were resettled in the community I were reassessed in September 2002. Residential stability, use of inpatient services, and mortality were also investigated. Results: Of the 337 patients, 64 died before discharge, 110 were transferred to nursing homes, and 163 were discharged to the community. The follow-up of patients who moved to the community showed no differences in psychopathology or social role functioning. In terms of overall social behavior, a significant increase was observed in the number of patients with mild or no disability, and a corresponding decrease was observed in the number with moderate disability. Most patients showed residential stability. The rate of postdischarge mortality was low, and there were no deaths due to, accident or suicide. The number of admissions to acute psychiatric wards was limited. Conclusions: A population characterized by a long history of illness and severe disability underwent-a radical change in care setting and living arrangement with favorable outcomes, as indicated. by the Absence of adverse events or clinical deterioration and by some improvement in social behavior. The results confirm that most long-stay patients can successfully leave psychiatric hospitals and live in community residences.

AB Purpose. To evaluate the intra-operative performance and clinical outcome of a new commercially available stent-graft for the treatment of thoracic aortic diseases.
   Methods and patients. From January 2003 to October 2004,45 consecutive patients received endovascular treatment with the Zenith TX1 device for diseases of the thoracic aorta at a single center in northern Italy. Indications included disease of the descending thoracic aorta in 26 cases, of the aortic arch in 17 cases and of the thoraco-abdominal aorta in two cases. We treated 38 atherosclerotic aneurysms, two post-traumatic aortic ruptures, two penetrating ulcers, two chronic dissections and one case was treated for aortic bleeding after voluntary acid ingestion for attempted suicide. General anesthesia was used in 20 cases. Combined or hybrid endovascular and open surgical repair was performed in 11 patients, Mean follow-up was 7 months (range 1-22 months).
   Results. Technical success was obtained in 44 patients (98 %). One primary type I endoleak occurred (2 %). ICU was used in 12 cases with a mean stay of I day. The mean hospital stay was 6 days (range 4-13 days). There were no hospital deaths or strokes but one transient paraplegia (2 %). A type II endolcak was observed in one case and resolved spontaneously I month later. No aneurysm enlargement, endograft migration or structural failures were observed during follow-up. Two late unrelated-deaths were observed.
   Conclusions. This stent-graft does not fulfill all the characteristics of the ideal graft, however, it proved to be safe and allowed satisfactory short term results in this group of patients treated at a single center.

AB Background: Gender differences strongly affect heroin addiction, from risk factors to patterns of consumption, access to treatments, and outcomes. Objectives: To investigate gender differences in the VEdeTTE cohort of heroin addicts. Methods: VEdeTTE is a cohort of 10,454 heroin users enrolled between 1998 and 2001 in 115 public drug treatment centres in Italy. Clinical and personal information were collected at intake through a structured interview. Treatments were recorded using a standardized form. Gender differences were explored with regard to characteristics at intake, treatments, and retention in methadone maintenance and therapeutic community. Cox Proportional models were carried out to identify risk factors for treatment abandon. Results: Compared with men, at their first access to treatment women with drug addiction were younger, more frequently married, legally separated, divorced or widow, unemployed though better educated, HIV+; more frequently they lived with their partner and sons. They reported a higher use of sedatives, but a lower use of alcohol; more frequently they had psychiatric comorbidity, including depression, self-injuries, and suicide attempts. Psychotherapy was more frequently prescribed to women, pharmacological treatments to men. Methadone maintenance was less frequently abandoned by women. Drug abuse severity factors predicted abandon of methadone among women. High methadone doses and the combination with psychotherapy improved treatment retention in both genders. Low education level and severity factors among women and young age among men predicted abandon of therapeutic community. Conclusions: Gender differences in the VEdeTTE cohort suggest the need of a gender sensitive approach to improve treatment outcomes among heroin addicts.

AB This is the synthesis of a study on admissions of migrants to hospitals in Sicily, from January 2011 to June 2014. Migrants arrived in Lampedusa were 49,000 in 2011; 4,000 in 2012; 15,000 in 2013; 6,000 in 2014; 378 patients requiring hospitalizationwere transported exclusively by the 118 Helicopter Emergency Medical Service in 6 Sicilian hospitals: 203 in 2011, 62 in 2012, 95 in 2013, 18 in 2014. The mean age was 25 years; more frequent areas of provenance were Horn of Africa, North Africa, Syria, and Nigeria. Women were hospitalised almost exclusively for obstetric-gynaecological problems, with a high prevalence of abortions (17/140 pregnancies) secondary to the long journey; men were hospitalised especially for bone fractures, burns, dehydration, infectious diseases, suicide attempts, and, recently, for CO poisoning of people locked in the holds of boats. Infectious diseases were mainly due to respiratory and intestinal distress, 20 people had tuberculosis (TB), 3 had HIV and 1 had malaria. No suspicious of Ebola virus infection was registered. The causes of hospitalisation do not depend on the nationality of patients and are constant over the years. Infectious diffusible diseases, mainly TB, are more common than in the Italian population, and consequently the best surveillance systems, aimed at identifying and treating patients immediately, should be activated. Mare Nostrum Operation helped migrants while they are in sea and allowed the reduction of serious health problems, mainly related to the hardships and duration of the journey, and also anticipating arrivals directly in Lampedusa, permitting a more efficient organisation of the relief in the sea.

AB Background and aims: In Italy there is a paucity of empirical data on practices concerning end-of-life decisions (ELDs) in geriatrics. We aimed to investigate the frequency and characteristics of ELDs made by Italian physicians and nurses in the geriatric setting. Methods: In 2009, an anonymous questionnaire was sent to 54 geriatric units, 21 hospices, and 382 nursing homes in the Veneto and Trentino Alto Adige regions, and to professionals in the area who are members of the Italian Gerontology and Geriatrics Association. Results: This paper reports the results of 552 questionnaires answered by 171 physicians, 368 nurses and 13 professionals who did not state their profession. Death was preceded by decisions to start or continue treatments likely to prolong the patients' life in 51.3% of cases. The proportion of deaths preceded by a decision to end life (DEL) was 20.8%; 18% of DELs concerned non-treatment decisions. There were 9 cases of ending of life without patient's explicit request. No cases of doctor-assisted suicide were reported, while there were 2 cases of euthanasia, one reported by a physician and one by a nurse. Conclusion: In geriatrics, DELs often precede the deaths of terminally-ill Italian patients. Nurses report making DELs more often than physicians, especially in incompetent patients. Continuous deep sedation was adopted by 39.5% of the Italian physicians for deaths not occurring suddenly and unexpectedly. Our report on physicians' and nurses' experiences of ELD making in geriatric settings can offer a valuable contribution to the current debate on end-of-life treatment, an issue that goes beyond national borders.

AB In 2017 the inauguration of the Mungsten Bridge, a most ambitious, wide-span bridge from 19th century Germany, dated back 120 years. For that reason, a designation of the bridge as a UNESCO World heritage site as part of a conglomerate together with four other European bridges, the Maria Pia Bridge and the Dom Luiz I Bridge in Porto/Portugal, the Viaduct of Garabit in France and the Ponte Michele in Northern Italy, is currently prepared. The five bridges were designed and built between 1875 and 1897, and they are all similar in terms of the technological and political ambition they were projected with. The Mungsten Bridge, at that time named "Kaiser-Wilhelm-Bridge", included numerous innovative technical features concerning the design, the material as well as the applied construction methods and until today, the bridge is attributed with various legends. One of these legends deals with an engineer, who committed suicide because of false calculations or construction details, which he had contributed to the project. As Anton v. Rieppel is believed to be the only creator and designer of the "Mungsten Bridge", there was never a reason for doubting his predominance. Recently found historical sources however, name in fact another person who was supposed to be involved in the Mungsten Bridge project and could be another protagonist. Before working for the company, responsible for the design and construction of the Mungsten Bridge, he was a known engineer in 19th century steel bridge design with a large engineering expertise among eight wide span bridges over River Rhine. He died in a natural way, shortly after completion of the bridge in 1897. These facts and the situation, that he was consistently concealed in the context of the Mungsten Bridge, point at special circumstances, which lead to the complete obliteration of his lifework in professional public.

AB Purpose: Affective temperaments, hopelessness, alexithymia, and anxiety/agitation symptoms may play a significant role in the psychopathological characteristics of bipolar disorder (BD). Here, we aimed to investigate the eventual association between the mentioned explanatory variables and anxiety/agitation symptoms in BD.Materials and methods: We recruited at the Section of Psychiatry, Department of Neuroscience, University of Genoa (Italy), 92 BD inpatients having a mean age of 52 (13.8) years. Participants were assessed using specific psychometric instruments. Anxiety/agitation symptoms have been evaluated using the 11-item of the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II).Results: Overall, 53.8% of participants presented with anxiety/agitation symptoms and 46.2% without. The two groups significantly differed about socio-economic status, lifetime psychotic symptoms, and residual depressive symptoms between episodes. Anxiety/agitation symptoms significantly correlated with irritable affective temperament (r=0.407; p=.01), hopelessness (r=0.541; p.001), difficulty identifying feelings (r=0.440; p.001), difficulty describing feelings (r=0.437; p.001), and externally oriented-thinking (r=0.393; p.001). After multivariate analyses, irritable affective temperament (OR=2.457, p.01) and less lifetime psychotic symptoms (OR=0.007, p.05) remained the only significant variables associated with anxiety/agitation symptoms.Conclusions: The generalization of the main findings is limited by the small sample size and cross-sectional study design. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the careful assessment of affective temperaments and psychotic symptoms may help to early identify BD patients suffering from anxiety/agitation symptoms and may allow to perform targeted interventions in the clinical practice.

AB Background We compared mortality inequalities by occupational class in Japan and South Korea with those in European countries, in order to determine whether patterns are similar. Methods National register-based data from Japan, South Korea and eight European countries (Finland, Denmark, England/Wales, France, Switzerland, Italy (Turin), Estonia, Lithuania) covering the period between 1990 and 2015 were collected and harmonised. We calculated age-standardised all-cause and cause-specific mortality among men aged 35-64 by occupational class and measured the magnitude of inequality with rate differences, rate ratios and the average inter-group difference. Results Clear gradients in mortality were found in all European countries throughout the study period: manual workers had 1.6-2.5 times higher mortality than upper non-manual workers. However, in the most recent time-period, upper non-manual workers had higher mortality than manual workers in Japan and South Korea. This pattern emerged as a result of a rise in mortality among the upper non-manual group in Japan during the late 1990s, and in South Korea during the late 2000s, due to rising mortality from cancer and external causes (including suicide), in addition to strong mortality declines among lower non-manual and manual workers. Conclusion Patterns of mortality by occupational class are remarkably different between European countries and Japan and South Korea. The recently observed patterns in the latter two countries may be related to a larger impact on the higher occupational classes of the economic crisis of the late 1990s and the late 2000s, respectively, and show that a high socioeconomic position does not guarantee better health.

AB The study reports the environmental, toxicological and histopathological forensic investigations applied on three victims of accidental death (father, mother and son), due to the fall in a volcanic pothole, during the touristic visit of the "Solfatara park", near Naples (Italy).
   At autopsy greenish skin discolouration was observed and all bodies showed the classical signs of asphyxial deaths, such as cyanosis and hemorrhagic pulmonary edema. Focal micro-hemorrhages were found in the brain at intracranial and subpial levels.
   The hemogasanalysis and spectrophotometric test on blood for Methemoglobin (MetHb), Carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) and Sulfhemoglobin (SHb) showed pCO(2), SHb and MetHb above the physiological levels. On biological specimens, toxicological analyses performed by GC/MS revealed high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and of thiosulfate (TS), its main metabolite.
   The monitoring of toxic gases on the death scene showed an unsafe environment, into the pothole, able to cause the sudden loss of consciousness of the victims with subsequent asphyxiation (knockdown effect). In particular, at the bottom of the hole, the maximum levels of H2S and carbon dioxide (CO2) were 2200 ppm and 98% respectively.
   For the family members, the cause of the death was assessed as acute poisoning by H2S and CO2. The fatalities, happened in quick succession as fora domino effect, were pretty similar to the asphyxial deaths by confined spaces, frequently observed in occupational setting. Fatalities secondary to accidental volcanic gases inhalation, such as H2S and CO2 in geothermal areas, have been already described but often without a forensic approach. To the best of our knowledge this is the first case that reports the accidental poisoning by volcanic gases involving three people, with different caracteristic of age and sex, allowing the correlation between toxicological and pathological results with the true levels of asphyxiating gas, measured on the death scene.

AB Background: Although a number of studies have assessed the management of mania in routine clinical practice, no studies have so far evaluated the short- and long- term management and outcome of patients affected by bipolar mania in different European countries.
   The objective of the study is to present, in the context of a large multicenter survey ( EMBLEM study), an overview of the baseline data on the acute management of a representative sample of manic bipolar patients treated in the Italian psychiatric hospital and community settings. EMBLEM is a 2- year observational longitudinal study that evaluates across 14 European countries the patterns of the drug prescribed in patients with bipolar mania, their socio- demographic and clinical features and the outcomes of the treatment.
   Methods: The study consists of a 12- week acute phase and a <= 24- month maintenance phase. Bipolar patients were included into the study as in- or out- patients, if they initiated or changed, according to the decision of their psychiatrist, oral antipsychotics, anticonvulsants and/ or lithium for the treatment of an episode of mania.
   Data concerning socio- demographic characteristics, psychiatric and medical history, severity of mania, prescribed medications, functional status and quality of life were collected at baseline and during the follow- up period.
   Results: In Italy, 563 patients were recruited in 56 sites: 376 were outpatients and 187 inpatients. The mean age was 45.8 years. The mean CGI- BP was 4.4 ( +/- 0.9) for overall score and mania, 1.9 ( +/- 1.2) for depression and 2.6 ( +/- 1.6) for hallucinations/ delusions. The YMRS showed that 14.4% had a total score < 12, 25.1% >= 12 and < 20, and 60.5% = >= 20. At entry, 75 patients ( 13.7%) were treatment- na ive, 186 ( 34.1%) were receiving a monotherapy ( of which haloperidol [ 24.2%], valproate [ 16.7%] and lithium [ 14.5%] were the most frequently prescribed) while 285 ( 52.2%) a combined therapy ( of which 8.0% were represented by haloperidol/ lithium combinations). After a switch to an oral medication, 137 patients ( 24.8%) were prescribed a monotherapy while the rest ( 415, 75.2%) received a combination of drugs.
   Conclusion: Data collected at baseline in the Italian cohort of the EMBLEM study represent a relevant source of information to start addressing the short and long- term therapeutic strategies for improving the clinical as well as the socio- economic outcomes of patients affected by bipolar mania. Although it's not an epidemiological investigation and has some limitations, the results show several interesting findings as a relatively late age of onset of bipolar disorder, a low rate of past suicide attempts, a low lifetime rate of alcohol abuse and drug addiction.

AB A key aspect of the Lake Nyos incident was the exceptionally large quantity of CO2 that was abruptly released in the incident. The exact quantity is uncertain however there is a consensus view that it amounted to between 1.0 and 1.6 million metric tons of CO2. In the context of CO2 sequestration this minimum amount of CO2 corresponds with approximately four months emissions from a 275 MW FutureGen type IGCC or over a month of CO2 captured from a large, but not atypical, 1000 MW coal fired power plant. This volume of CO2 is also equivalent to weeks or months of gas that would be transported in the largest pipelines contemplated for a future sequestration project. Given the isolation valves that would be activated the CO2 released at Lake Nyos was 2 to 3 orders of magnitude larger than the largest release plausible from CO2 pipelines.
   Carbon monoxide poisoning utilizing automobile exhaust in an enclosed space for decades was a classic suicide strategy. Since the development of catalytic convertors the carbon monoxide has been in large part converted to carbon dioxide and a nominally non-lethal level of carbon monoxide. Unfortunately suicidal acts continued unabated due to the powerful effects of mixed CO2 and CO. Although the medical teams reported no definitive evidence of cause of death, they did note that many victims had prominent skin bullae (blister like features) or has succumbed to comas, and that neither of these prominent symptoms can be related to CO2. The US medical team concluded that "doubt must remain that all the findings can be attributed to [CO2] alone". After the Lake Nyos incident, evaluation of the symptoms documented in medical studies from the foreign scientific expeditions lead to a conclusion that the Lake Nyos victims died from carbon monoxide poisoning. Although these assertions have been dismissed by geologists studying the Lake Nyos event, their reasoning appears flawed. A plausible model for the causative agents for the Nyos disaster as a combination of CO2 (quite possibly at non-lethal concentrations), reduced oxygen, and the critical deadly agent, CO. In the absence of carbon monoxide neither the gas in exhausts from catalytic convertor nor the gas at Lake Nos, would he capable of killing. This together with the magnitude and circumstances of the release has significance for risks associated with CO2 transportation by pipeline. Mixed gases are known to be deadly at concentrations at significantly lower than the lethal levels of either component alone. Perhaps the real lesson of the Lake Nyos incident for carbon capture and storage is to draw attention to the inherent clanger from mixtures of toxic gases. For example mixtures of H2S with CO2 will increase the toxic effects of H2S. The risk profile for a sequestration project changed a decision is made to inject mixed streams of gas such as CO2 + H2S rather than essentially pure CO2. A more useful analogy between natural CO2 seepage and the worst-case scenario for leakage from CO2 sequestered in deep brine reservoirs is provided by the volcanic/geothermal terrains in Italy, the Azores, and Africa. In this paper the available information and analysis of the presumed CO2 releases at these sites and the related deaths are reviewed and the implications for evaluating the risk posed by either slow or rapid leakage from CO2 sequestration are considered.

AB Propofol is a short-acting hypnotic agent that is commonly used to induce and maintain anesthesia. Propofol abuse and its involvement in suicide deaths have increased in recent years, especially among healthcare personnel. An example is the suicide of a 61-year-old nurse found with a propofol drip in his left arm. We describe the postmortem concentration of propofol in various tissues (femoral and cardiac blood, bile, urine, brain, and liver) and in the drip. The toxicological analyses were performed through two analytical methods, differing in derivatization reaction and in instrumentation: silylation for gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS), as routinely performed in our laboratory for this kind of analyses (lower limits of quantification-LLOQ-in urine and blood: 0.3 and 5 ng/ml); for liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) an innovative azo-coupling derivatization (LLOQ: 0.0004 and 0.1 ng/ml). This latter produces an azo-derivative (molecular composition: C18H22ON2; molecular weight: 282 Da) highly ionizable in electro-spray ion source, both in negative and positive ionizations. These two methods were compared to evaluate the effectiveness of this new LC-MS/MS analysis. An acidic hydrolysis (HCl 6 N, 100 degrees C, and 1 h) was performed for the biological samples (1 ml or 1 g) irrespective of the analytical method applied. The drip content was extracted adding phosphate buffer (pH 8) and a dichloromethane/ethylacetate 8: 2 (v:v) mixture. Derivatization steps were: silylation with N, O-bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) + tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) for GC-MS; regarding LC-MS/MS, azo-coupling reaction with the aryl-diazonium salt (0-5 degrees C, and 30 min). The analyses were achieved in selected-ion monitoring for GC-MS (m/z, 235,250,73 propofol''; m/z, 252,267,27 propofol-d17) and in multiple reaction monitoring ([M - H] : m/z 283 -> 241,77, azo-propofol; m/z 299 -> 251,77, azo-propofol-d17) for LC-MS/MS. Autopsy showed no significant findings. Propofol concentrations were (LC-MS/MS vs GC-MS, respectively): 15.1 vs 14.5 mg/ml, drip content; 7.11 vs 6.07 mu g/ml, cardiac blood; 9.50 vs 7.19 mu g/ml, femoral blood; 0.64 vs 1.07 mu g/ml, bile; 0.042 vs 0.051 mu g/ml urine; 4.93 vs 5.89 mu g/g, brain; and 7.88 vs 6.80 mu g/g, liver. These values are comparable with the ones described in literature for death by acute propofol intoxication; the drip content is compatible with a diluted formulation of propofol available in Italy (20 mg/ml injectable emulsion). The comparison shows an excellent fitting of the data (R-2: 0.9362). Toxicological results proved the cause of death as acute propofol intoxication. Furthermore, the new LC-MS/MS method showed an excellent effectiveness and reliability when compared to the routinely used GC-MS method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Mental health problems and risk behaviours among young people are of great public health concern. Consequently, within the VII Framework Programme, the European Commission funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted in eleven European countries, with Sweden as the coordinating centre, and was designed to identify an effective way to promote mental health and reduce suicidality and risk taking behaviours among adolescents.
   Objective: To describe the methodological and field procedures in the SEYLE RCT among adolescents, as well as to present the main characteristics of the recruited sample.
   Methods: Analyses were conducted to determine: 1) representativeness of study sites compared to respective national data; 2) response rate of schools and pupils, drop-out rates from baseline to 3 and 12 month follow-up, 3) comparability of samples among the four Intervention Arms; 4) properties of the standard scales employed: Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-II), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (Z-SAS), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), World Health Organization Well-Being Scale (WHO-5).
   Results: Participants at baseline comprised 12,395 adolescents (M/F: 5,529/6,799; mean age=14.9 +/- 0.9) from Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain. At the 3 and 12 months follow up, participation rates were 87.3% and 79.4%, respectively. Demographic characteristics of participating sites were found to be reasonably representative of their respective national population. Overall response rate of schools was 67.8%. All scales utilised in the study had good to very good internal reliability, as measured by Cronbach's alpha (BDI-II: 0.864; Z-SAS: 0.805; SDQ: 0.740; WHO-5: 0.799).
   Conclusions: SEYLE achieved its objective of recruiting a large representative sample of adolescents within participating European countries. Analysis of SEYLE data will shed light on the effectiveness of important interventions aimed at improving adolescent mental health and well-being, reducing risk-taking and self-destructive behaviour and preventing suicidality.

AB Aim. The aim of this paper was to survey the current management of the problem of smoking in our Mental Health Units, the structural characteristics of the units and how a total smoking ban would be perceived by doctors and nurses. Method. An 18 items survey about smoking habits of inpatients and department inner regulations was sent to the Head Physician and the Charge Nurse of all the Intensive Psychiatric Care General Hospital Units in Italy (228 units), in order to increase the answer rate and to investigate if the perception of the problem is eventually different between the two groups. Results. We collected 65 answers from Head Physician and 79 from Nurses. Both groups think that the smoking rates for inpatients are between 50-100%. Most of the units is locked, with or without an external space, so that a total smoking ban is considered difficult to achieve by both groups. A very high rate of units has no specific rooms for smokers. In most cases the issue management is solved by a self-regulation, based on collecting cigarettes and lighters and granting a limited number of cigarettes per day. Anyway, an institutional intervention would be appreciated especially by nurses, who seem to be even more involved in the issue management and both of groups seem to badly judge the lack of sources to face the eventual ban: particularly the possibility to offer nicotine replacement therapy, a cognitive-behavioural support and providing more staff education would all be considered useful to implement the success rate of the ban. By the way, both of groups seem skeptical about the possibility of a total smoking-free policy in Acute Psychiatric Hospital Units. Though, a difference in the problem's perception between the two groups has been noticed. Discussion. Smoking cessation remains a neglected area in psychiatry, in part due to misconceptions about smoking in the mentally ill, i.e. the idea that smoking cessation will exacerbate mental illness, aggression and suicide risk, even though these believes are not supported by evidence; in part due to the lack of institutional intervention and the structural deficiencies of the units.

   DIAGNOSIS
AB To describe antidepressant (AD) use in the Emilia-Romagna Region (Italy) and to evaluate adherence to treatment with selective serotonin receptor inhibitors or selective noradrenaline receptor inhibitors (SSRI-SNRI).
   Reimbursed prescriptions of AD were retrieved from the Emilia-Romagna Regional Health Authority Database. The overall AD consumption from the 2006-2011 period was expressed in terms of prevalence and amount of use. Adherence to treatment was assessed in a cohort of patients who received SSRI-SNRI, and was followed throughout a 6-month period from the start of each treatment episode. Adherence was considered according to three parameters: duration of treatment a parts per thousand yen 120 days, prescription coverage a parts per thousand yen 80 %, and gaps between prescriptions < 3 months. Determinants of non-adherent regimen, including sociodemographic and clinical variables, were identified by multivariate logistic regression by calculating adjusted Odds Ratio (adjOR) and the relevant 95 % confidence interval (95CI).
   From 2006 to 2011, the prevalence of use of AD increased by 5 % (from 86 to 90 per 1,000 inhabitants) and the amount of antidepressant consumption increased by 20 % (from 43 to 51 defined daily dose per thousand inhabitants per day [DDD/TID]), with a 14 % rise in the intensity of drug use (from 182 to 208 DDD per patient). Out of 347,615 SSRI-SNRI treatment episodes, only 23.8 % were adherent. Comorbidity (adjOR:0.69; 95CI:0.67-0.72) and recurrence of AD treatment in the previous year (0.91; 0.89-0.92) were associated with better adherence. Moreover, patients treated with duloxetine (0.58; 0.55-0.60), escitalopram (0.64; 0.62-0.66) or sertraline (0.65; 0.64-0.67) showed better adherence in comparison with paroxetine.
   Clinical variables resulting in improved adherence seem to identify patients with more severe disorders and who actually need a pharmacological approach, whereas differences in adherence among ADs could in part be caused by channeling and sponsorship bias. Initiatives addressed at improving cooperation between primary care and psychiatrists could decrease AD prescription for cases of sub-threshold or mild depression that easily drop out because of rapid symptom relief or side effects.

AB Objectives: To collate data from multiple obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) treatment centers across seven countries and five continents, and to report findings in relation to OCD comorbidity, age of onset of OCD and comorbid disorders, and suicidality, in a large clinical and ethnically diverse sample, with the aim of investigating cultural variation and the utility of the psychiatric diagnostic classification of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.
   Methods: Researchers in the field of OCD were invited to contribute summary statistics on current and lifetime psychiatric comorbidity, age of onset of OCD and comorbid disorders and suicidality in their patients with OCD.
   Results: Data from 3711 adult patients with primary OCD came from Brazil (n = 955), India (n = 802), Italy (n = 750), South Africa (n = 565), Japan (n = 322), Australia (n = 219), and Spain (n = 98). The most common current comorbid disorders were major depressive disorder (28.4%; n = 1055), obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (24.5%, n = 478), generalized anxiety disorder (19.3%, n = 716), specific phobia (19.2%, n = 714) and social phobia (18.5%, n = 686). Major depression was also the most commonly co-occurring lifetime diagnosis, with a rate of 50.5% (n = 1874). OCD generally had an age of onset in late adolescence (mean = 17.9 years, SD = 1.9). Social phobia, specific phobia and body dysmorphic disorder also had an early age of onset. Co-occurring major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and psychotic disorders tended to have a later age of onset than OCD. Suicidal ideation within the last month was reported by 6.4% (n = 200) of patients with OCD and 9.0% (n = 314) reported a lifetime history of suicide attempt.
   Conclusions: In this large cross-continental study, comorbidity in OCD was common. The high rates of comorbid major depression and anxiety disorders emphasize the need for clinicians to assess and monitor for these disorders. Earlier ages of onset of OCD, specific phobia and social phobia may indicate some relatedness between these disorders, but this requires further study. Although there do not appear to be significant cultural variations in rates or patterns of comorbidity and suicidality, further research using similar recruitment strategies and controlling for demographic and clinical variables may help to determine whether any sociocultural factors protect against suicidal ideation or psychiatric comorbidity in patients with OCD.

AB Data on the physical and performance characteristics of female wheelchair basketball (WB) players are scarce. In several countries female WB players train and compete with male players on mixed teams due to the limited total population of players, which would otherwise lead to large territorial spread for each team. Any differences in terms of physical characteristics and/or WB skill proficiency between male and female WB players would be relevant to team performance in mixed teams. This work examined anthropometry, body composition, and performance in a set of sport-specific field tests in a sample of 13 female WB players representing about 40% of the eligible population in Italy across a range of functional point scores (Point). Point is assigned on an ordinal scale from 1.0 (i.e., players with minimal functional potential) through to 4.5 (players with maximum functional potential). Our female sample was then compared against twice as many (n = 26) Point-matched (+/- 0.5 points) male players. The two groups were similar for age (P = 0.191; effect size [d] = 0.2), self-reported duration of injury (P = 0.144, d = 0.6), WB experience (P = 0.178, d = 0.5), and volume of training (P = 0.293, d = 0.4). The large majority of measured linear anthropometric variables (10/13) were lower in female players than males (0.001 < P <= 0.041). Skinfold-estimated percent body fat was higher (+7.6%) in females (30.7 +/- 6.0%; P < 0.001, d = 1.3). Mean performance was worse in female than in males in six out of seven sport-specific field tests, scores being significantly lower in females for the maximal pass (7.5 +/- 2.0 m for females vs. 10.4 +/- 2.8 m for males; P = 0.002, d = 1.2) and suicide tests (55.8 +/- 6.4 s for females vs. 45.4 +/- 6.7 s for males; P < 0.001, d = 1.6). When performance in subgroups of females (n = 9) chosen across a range of Point was compared with that of males assigned 1.0 or 1.5 Point less (each n = 9), performance differences between male and female WB players were partially and completely eliminated, respectively. This work contributed new data for characterizing the physique and performance of female WB players. Further, the results suggested that when male and female athletes compete together in mixed teams, a 1.5 points subtraction from female players is needed to match the real gender difference in performance.

AB Background Previous trials have shown that pridopidine might reduce motor impairment in patients with Huntington's disease. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether higher doses of pridopidine than previously tested reduce motor symptoms in a dose-dependent manner while maintaining acceptable safety and tolerability.
   Methods PRIDE-HD was a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2, dose-ranging study in adults (aged >= 21 years) with Huntington's disease at outpatient clinics in 53 sites across 12 countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA). Eligible patients had clinical onset after age 18 years, 36 or more cytosine-adenine-guanine repeats in the huntingtin gene, motor symptoms (Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score [UHDRS-TMS] >= 25 points), and reduced independence (UHDRS independence score <= 90%). Patients were randomly assigned (1: 1: 1: 1: 1) with centralised interactive-response technology to receive one of four doses of pridopidine (45, 67.5, 90, or 112.5 mg) or placebo orally twice a day for 52 weeks. Randomisation was stratified within centres by neuroleptic drug use. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in the UHDRS-TMS from baseline to 26 weeks, which was assessed in all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment (full analysis set). Participants and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2013-001888-23) and ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT02006472).
   Findings Between Feb 13, 2014, and July 5, 2016, 408 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive placebo (n=82) or pridopidine 45 mg (n=81), 67.5 mg (n=82), 90 mg (n=81), or 112.5 mg (n=82) twice daily for 26 weeks. The full analysis set included 397 patients (81 in the placebo group, 75 in the 45 mg group, 79 in the 67.5 mg group, 81 in the 90 mg group, and 81 in the 112.5 mg group). Pridopidine did not significantly change the UHDRS-TMS at 26 weeks compared with placebo at any dose. The most frequent adverse events across all groups were diarrhoea, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, falls, headache, insomnia, and anxiety. The most common treatment-related adverse events were insomnia, diarrhoea, nausea, and dizziness. Serious adverse events occurred in the pridopidine groups only and were most frequently falls (n=5), suicide attempt (n= 4), suicidal ideation (n=3), head injury (n=3), and aspiration pneumonia (n=3). No new safety or tolerability concerns emerged in this study. One death in the pridopidine 112.5 mg group due to aspiration pneumonia was considered to be possibly related to the study drug.
   Interpretation Pridopidine did not improve the UHDRS-TMS at week 26 compared with placebo and, thus, the results of secondary or tertiary analyses in previous trials were not replicated. A potentially strong placebo effect needs to be ruled out in future studies.
