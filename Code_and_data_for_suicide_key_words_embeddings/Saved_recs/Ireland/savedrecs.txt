AB In recent years suicide among older adults has been increasing internationally. The suicide rate among older adults in Ireland is no exception.
   The aim of the current study was to report the rate of suicide among older adults in Ireland and to compare these rates to those of the UK.
   Suicide rates from 1975-2005 for older adults in both Ireland and the UK were obtained and compared.
   Suicide rates among older adults in Ireland are increasing, while for that same period suicide rates among older adults in the UK are decreasing.
   The increased consumption of alcohol in Ireland compared to the UK as well as a higher prevalence of depression among older people in Ireland may account for the observed difference. Findings have implications for suicide prevention in Ireland.

AB Ireland has the 17th highest suicide rate in the EU and the 4th highest among 15-24-year-old males (WHO 2012). Suicide is the leading cause of death in this age group; death by hanging accounted for 69 % of suicides in 2010.
   This study examines youth suicide rates from 1980 to 2010 in Ireland and compares them to the rates in Northern Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales. Irish data were obtained from the Central Statistics Office and their annual reports on Vital Statistics. Northern Irish data were obtained from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency website; Scottish data were from the General Register Office for Scotland and English/Welsh data from the Office for National Statistics website.
   There has been a threefold increase in young male suicide in Ireland over the past three decades (8.9-29.7 per 100,000). In contrast, there has been approximately a threefold reduction in deaths by road traffic accidents in young men in the same period (42.7-16.2 per 100,000). Suicide rates in young men are similar in Scotland and Northern Ireland for the same period but are 50 % lower in England and Wales. Despite the rates of hanging as a method of suicide increasing in all jurisdictions, the overall rate in England and Wales has continued to decline.
   The suicide rate in Ireland remains very high and strategies to address this are urgently required. Our study indicates that national suicide prevention strategies can be effective.

AB Since the end of the 'Troubles' in Northern Ireland, there has been a rise in the number of acts of intimidation and Paramilitary Punishment Attacks (PPA). Anecdotally, some suicides have been linked to such incidents. To date, there has been a lack of research examining this association. This article details a case series study exploring how individual deaths by suicide in Northern Ireland were connected to intimidation. Data from Coroners, GP records and interviews with family members were examined to identify experiences of intimidation among a two-year cohort who died by suicide. Further case based analysis was conducted using a modified version of the psychological autopsy method. Our results indicate that in 19 male suicides there were incidents of intimidation in the twelve months prior to death. The suicides of these men are discussed in relation to the suicide model of entrapment. Our findings highlight the continuing problem of intimidation in Northern Ireland and suggest further research into the connection between these incidents and suicide is warranted.

AB Objectives: This study was designed to explore the social correlates of the country suicide rate in Ireland.
   Method: Suicide rates for Irish counties were calculated for the period 1978-1984, a seven year period centred around the 1981 Census.
   Results: The county suicide rates were positively associated with death rates and the percentage of elderly population and negatively with change in population, the birth rate and the percentage of the population under the age of 15.
   Conclusions: There is good evidence to suggest that the official suicide rate in Ireland has been underestimated in the past. This underestimation may not have been uniform across all of the counties.

AB 5 Aims. Youth and young adult suicide has increasingly appeared on international vital statistics as a rising trend of concern in age-specific mortality over the past 50 years. The reporting of suicide deaths in 5-year age bands, which has been the international convention to date, may mask a greater understanding of year-on-year factors that may accelerate or ameliorate the emergence of suicidal thoughts, acts and fatal consequences. The study objective was to identify any year-on-year period of increased risk for youth and young adult suicide in the UK and Ireland.
   Methods. Collation and examination of international epidemiological datasets on suicide (aged 18-35) for the UK and Ireland 2000-2006 (N = 11 964). Outcome measures included the age distribution of suicide mortality in international datasets from the UK and Ireland, 2000-2006.
   Results. An accelerated pattern of risk up to the age of 20 for the UK and Ireland which levels off moderately thereafter was uncovered, thus identifying a heretofore unreported age-related epidemiological transition for suicide.
   Conclusions. The current reporting of suicide in 5-year age bands may conceal age-related periods of risk for suicide. This may have implications for suicide prevention programmes for young adults under age 21.

AB Annual suicide figures are critical in identifying trends and guiding research, yet challenges arising from significant lags in reporting can delay and complicate real-time interventions. In this paper, we utilized Google Trends search volumes for behavioral forecasting of national suicide rates in Ireland between 2004 and 2015. Official suicide rates are recorded by the Central Statistics Office in Ireland. While similar investigations using Google trends data have been carried out in other jurisdictions (e.g., United Kingdom, United Stated of America), such research had not yet been completed in Ireland. We compiled a collection of suicide- and depression-related search terms suggested by Google Trends and manually sourced from the literature. Monthly search rate terms at different lags were compared with suicide occurrences to determine the degree of correlation. Following two approaches based on vector autoregression and neural network autoregression, we achieved mean absolute error values between 4.14 and 9.61 when incorporating search query data, with the highest performance for the neural network approach. The application of this process to United Kingdom suicide and search query data showed similar results, supporting the benefit of Google Trends, neural network approach, and the applied search terms to forecast suicide risk increase. Overall, the combination of societal data and online behavior provide a good indication of societal risks; building on past research, our improvements led to robust models integrating search query and unemployment data for suicide risk forecasting in Ireland.

AB Background: Many studies have examined the reliability of national suicide statistics. Aims: To examine the Irish system of certifying suicide deaths and data collected by it. Methods: Data were recorded from a police form (Form 104) completed and sent to the Irish Central Statistics Office (CSO) after all inquested deaths that occurred in Ireland in 2002. Results: Of the approximately 1,800 inquested deaths, 6% (and 4% of suicides) were not included in routine mortality statistics because of late registration. Of the 495 deaths thought by the police to be suicide, 485 (98%) were so recorded by the CSO. Information relating to medical history and contributory factors was provided in just 54% and 34% of suicides, respectively. Suicide deaths showed significant variation by weekday (excess on Mondays) and calendar month (summer peak). The peak suicide rate (35 per 100,000) was among men aged 25-34 years. Persons separated, living alone, and unemployed had significantly elevated suicide rates. Conclusions: There is a need for a better understanding of national suicide recording systems, as this study has provided for Ireland. Such systems may routinely provide data relating to socio-demographic factors but not relating to medical and psychosocial factors.

AB Objective: To calculate the costs of suicide in Ireland. Method: The paper identifies all episodes of suicide in Ireland in 2001 and 2002, and projects the economic costs arising from these episodes over subsequent years. All prices have been converted to 2001 euros. Both direct and indirect costs were calculated. Indirect costs included both the cost of lost output and human costs. Results: T'he total cost of suicide is estimated at over is an element of 906 million in 2001, and over is an element of 835 million in 2002 (in 2001 prices). This is equivalent to a little under 1 % of the gross national product in Ireland for those years. Conclusions: The results show that investment in health education and health promotion can be justified on the basis of the costs associated with suicide in Ireland. These costs fall on individuals, families, and society. The huge human cost of suffering associated with suicide can also be prevented through appropriate intervention to prevent death occurring. It is important that any suicide prevention strategy should include an evaluative framework to ensure that investment occurs in the areas most likely to generate the highest returns in term of suicides prevented and lives saved.

AB Background: The elderly population size in the U.K. and its constituent countries is increasing. Traditionally, suicide rates increase with aging.
   Methods: Time trends in elderly suicide rates and age-associated trends in suicide rates in the U.K. and its three constituent countries (England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) were examined and comparisons were made of elderly suicide rates in these three countries using data from the World Health Organization.
   Results: Elderly suicide rates in both sexes declined over the 24-year period 1979 to 2002 in the whole of the U.K., England and Wales, and Scotland, but only in females in the age-band 65-74 years in Northern Ireland. Female suicide rates increased with age while male suicide rates peaked in the age-band 25-34 years in England and Wales. In Northern Ireland and Scotland male suicide rates decreased with age and peaked in the age-band 25-34 years, and female suicide rates peaked in the age-bands 25-34, 35-44 and 45-54 years. Elderly suicide rates were lowest in Northern Ireland.
   Conclusion: The similarities and differences in elderly suicide rates, time trends for elderly suicide rates and age-associated trends in suicide rates between the three constituent countries of the U.K. offer an opportunity to examine the differential characteristics between these countries which may potentially explain these observations.

AB Introduction Suicide is criminalized in more than 100 countries around the world. A dearth of research exists into the effect of suicide legislation on suicide rates and available statistics are mixed.
   Materials and methods This study investigates 10,353 suicide deaths in Ireland that took place between 1970 and 2000. Irish 1970-2000 annual suicide data were obtained from the Central Statistics Office and modelled via a negative binomial regression approach. We examined the effect of suicide legislation on different age groups and on both sexes. We used Bonferroni correction for multiple modelling. Statistical analysis was performed using the R statistical package version 3.1.2. The coefficient for the effect of suicide act on overall suicide deaths was -9.094 (95 % confidence interval (CI) -34.086 to 15.899), statistically non-significant (p = 0.476). The coefficient for the effect suicide act on undetermined deaths was statistically significant (p < 0.001) and was estimated to be -644.4 (95 % CI -818.6 to -469.9).
   Conclusion The results of our study indicate that legalization of suicide is not associated with a significant increase in subsequent suicide deaths. However, undetermined death verdict rates have significantly dropped following legalization of suicide.

AB Coroners routinely enquire into suicide deaths and communicate with people bereaved by suicide. However, no research has been conducted into coroners' attitudes towards suicide and its prevention.
   We assessed attitudes towards suicide among Irish coroners in order to determine their understanding of suicide and its prevention.
   An internationally validated questionnaire assessing attitudes towards suicide was sent to all coroners in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
   Sixty completed questionnaires (response 62%) were analysed. Overall, the coroners' responses reflected openness towards communication about suicide and suicide prevention initiatives. Approximately, one in five favoured the attitudes that suicide is a right or that it may be a justifiable resolution. Only 23% agreed that people who die by suicide are usually mentally ill.
   Irish coroners favour communication about suicide and have a positive attitude towards its prevention but they appear to underestimate the prevalence of mental illness.

AB Trends in adolescent suicide rates (15-19 years) from 1979 to 1996 were compared with suicide trends in individuals of 20 years and over in 30 countries and with trends in rates of deaths due to undetermined causes in adolescents in 17 countries of the WHO European Region. In 21 of the 30 studied countries, male adolescent suicide rates increased during the study period (highest increases in Belarus, Kazakstan and Ireland) accompanied by far less increases or decreases in suicide rates of males of 20 years and over. Part of the observed increases in Sweden, Ireland and Greece can be attributed to improved suicide statistics, while increases in Finland, Belgium, Bulgaria and the United Kingdom can be even higher due to the rising classification of deaths as "undetermined". In Portugal, decreasing suicide trends seem to be misinterpreted by ignoring the vast increases in rates of undetermined deaths. Female adolescent suicide rates rose less markedly than in males in 18 countries, with the exception of strong increases in Norway, Ireland. Increases in female adolescent suicide rates were marginally affected by changes in classification practices and were accompanied primarily by declining suicide rates in females of 20 years and over.

   DURKHEIM; TROUBLES; PARADOX; HEALTH; SENSE
AB Durkheim's idea that war reduces suicide through greater social and political integration has been used to explain suicide trends during the Northern Ireland conflict and in the period of peace. In this article the applicability of Durkheim is critically evaluated through a case study of suicide trends by age, gender and cause of death over a 40-year period. The key finding is that the cohort of children and young people who grew up in the worst years of violence, during the 1970s, have the highest and most rapidly increasing suicide rates, and account for the steep upward trend in suicide following the 1998 Agreement. Contrary to Durkheim, the recent rise in suicide involves a complex of social and psychological factors. These include the growth in social isolation, poor mental health arising from the experience of conflict, and the greater political stability of the past decade. The transition to peace means that externalized aggression is no longer socially approved. It becomes internalized instead.

AB Suicide is a global concern hence cross-cultural research ought to be central to national suicide prevention strategies. This study sought to investigate suicide notes drawn from Northern Ireland and the United States as these countries have broadly similar suicide rates but markedly different cultures. A theoretical -conceptual analysis of sixty suicide notes drawn from these countries, matched for age and sex, was undertaken based on a thematic model of suicide developed by Leenaars (1996) across countries. The results suggested that there were more psychological commonalities than differences. Two differences emerged which suggested that aspects of the interpersonal components may be more salient in Northern Irish rather than American suicides. It is argued that more wide-ranging cross-cultural studies are required to enhance our ability to identify and predict those most at risk from suicide.

DE suicide; trends; socioeconomic change; time series; Ireland
AB This ecological study examined the association between seven socioeconomic indicators (GDP, unemployment rate, female labor force participation rate, alcohol expenditure, marriage rate, percentage of births outside of marriage, and indictable crime rate) and total, male, and female rates of suicide and suicide plus undetermined death in Ireland during the period 1968-2000. Analysis of the data expressed as absolute values showed highly significant associations between the socioeconomic indicators and the total, male, and female suicide rates. However, these associations were explained by the strongly trended data. The trended nature of the data was removed by using year-to-year differences. Analysis of the first-differenced data showed that none of the socioeconomic indicators was associated with the total, male, or female suicide rates with the exception of indictable crime, which had a significant independent effect on the female suicide rate (coefficient = 2.0, p <.01) but not on suicide plus undetermined death. This study highlights the need to use econometric methods in time-trend analyses, the lack of age-sex specific exposure data in this area, and the challenge of understanding trends in suicide in their socioeconomic context.

DE mortality statistics; suicide; external cause of death; Ireland
AB There are two sets of annual mortality statistics released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) in Ireland, one based on deaths registered in the particular year and the other based on the deaths that occurred in that year. We compared the registration and occurrence figures for suicide and for other deaths by an external cause for the years 1987-2003. The occurrence figures were, on average, 6% higher than the registration figures. There was evidence that the extent of the discrepancy increased over the study period, reaching almost 20% in recent years. The findings suggest that caution needs to be taken in the media reporting of registration figures for suicide and other external causes of death in Ireland and in the interpretation of these figures by health professionals.

AB Background: The circumstances surrounding death by suicide can give us insight into the factors affecting suicide risk in particular regions. Aims: This study examined gender and circumstances surrounding death by suicide in Northern Ireland from 2005 to 2011. Method: The study analyzed 1,671 suicides (77% male and 23% female cases) using information contained from the coroner's files on suicides and undetermined deaths. Results: Hanging was the most common method and more than one third of the deceased had prior suicide attempts. There was evidence of alcohol use in 41% of the cases. Only, 61% of cases had recorded adverse events; most had multiple and complex combinations of experiences. Relationship and interpersonal difficulties were the most common category of adverse event (40.3%). However, illness and bereavement, employment / financial crisis, and health problems were also common. One third of those who died by suicide were employed, compared with 50.3% who were not in employment. Just over half (50.1%) were known to have a mental health disorder. Conclusion: The results provide the first profile of deaths by suicide in Northern Ireland. They highlight the need to target people who have difficult life experiences in suicide prevention work, notably men, people with employment, financial and relationship crises, and those with mental disorders.

TI The 'troubles' in Northern Ireland and suicide
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB McCann and Stewin (1990) reported that the suicide rate (per 100,000 population) in the USA was positively associated over time with an index of social and political threat. Data on the number of deaths resulting from the civil unrest (The Troubles) in Northern Ireland from 1969 on are available from the CAIN Web Service (cain.ulst.ac.uk). The present analysis examined the association between the suicide rate in Northern Ireland an the number of deaths from civil unrest for the period 1965-1997 using, suicide rates from the World Health Organization (www.who.int).
   Suicide rates increased during the period (Pearson r =.66, two-tailed p < .01), while deaths from civil unrest peaked in 1972 and did not change linearly over the period (r = -.20). The suicide rate was associated with the number of deaths (r = -.51, p < .01) and in multiple regressions with deaths alone and with deaths and year taken into account (bs = -.009 and -.007, ps <.003 and .003, respectively). Thus, suicide rates were higher when deaths from the civil unrest were lower.

AB Background: Seasonal influences on suicide have been studied for many years with inconclusive and contradictory findings.
   Methods: Data on suicide in Ireland from 1980 to 2002 was examined to ascertain the contribution of season and demographic variables to suicide. Using Poisson regression modelling and sinusoidal analysis a small seasonal effect (7% from peak to trough) was identified but age, gender, marital status and residence were much larger contributors. The seasonal contribution increased in the latter half of the period under study. There was also a small seasonal effect for method of suicide. The suicide rate was highest in the 40-44 age group after controlling for confounders.
   Limitations: Because this was an ecological study, information on other possible contributors, such as mental illness was not available.
   Conclusions: These findings are discussed in light of international studies. Continuing studies are required to confirm the trend in increasing seasonality in Ireland. Since suicide is highest in those who are middle aged, preventive strategies should be directed to this group. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   IMPACT; GENDER; CRISIS; HEALTH; RATES
AB Background: Studies have identified employment as a protective factor against suicide. We examined employment status and risk of suicide in Ireland during the 11-year period 1996-2006, a period of economic boom commonly known as the Celtic Tiger. Methods: Data relating to the 5270 suicides and 789 deaths of undetermined intent registered as occurring in Ireland in 1996-2006 and relevant population data were obtained from the Irish Central Statistics Office and analysed using Poisson regression. Results: Unemployment fell from 12% in 1996 to 4% in 2000, a level at which it remained until 2006. Male and female rates of suicide and undetermined death were stable during 1996-2006 though suicide among unemployed men increased. Relative to employment, unemployment was associated with a 2-3-fold increased risk of male suicide and undetermined death but generally a 4-6-fold increased risk in women. Unemployment was associated with greater increased risk of suicide and undetermined death when its level was low (2001-06) than in the period of decreasing unemployment (1996-2000). Unemployment was a stronger risk factor in men aged 35-54 years and with increasing age in women. Retired persons aged > 55 years had a similar risk to their employed counterparts. Being a homemaker was associated with increased risk in women aged > 35 years. Conclusion: The current Irish context of rapidly increasing unemployment suggests that rates may rise again as in previous recessions. Appropriate social policy responses are required to mitigate the potential impact of unemployment on suicides.

ID MARITAL-STATUS; GENDER; MORTALITY; ENGLAND; MATTER
AB This paper provides a comparison of the socio-demographic profile of hanging suicides and suicides by other means in Ireland from January 1st 1980 to December 31st 2005. Data on 9674 suicides occurring in that time frame was provided by the Central Statistics Office of Ireland (CSO). 4031 (42%) of these deaths involved suicide by 'hanging, suffocation or strangulation' (HSS), with the remainder being suicides by other means. Binary logistic regressions were used to examine six potential risk factors for suicide across the two groups: Gender, marital status, employment in the agricultural sectors, residential location (urban/rural) and age were entered in Block 1 of the analysis, with year of death (pre 1994 vs. post 1994) added in a second block. Results indicate that those dying through hangings were statistically more likely to be male (OR = 3.1, 95% Cl = 2.8-3.5), single (OR = 1.3, 95% Cl = 1.2-1.4), rural-dwelling (OR = 1.1, 95% Cl = 1.0-1.2), agri-employed (OR = 1.3, 95% Cl = 1.1-1.4) and to have died since 1994 (OR = 2.3, 95% Cl = 2.1-2.5). The magnitude of the group effect was moderate for all but the gender and time period comparisons. Hanging suicide victims (m = 37.7, sd = 16.7) were also significantly younger than other suicide victims (mean = 42.72, sd = 16.7), although the size of the effect was small (r =.16). Overall the six variables explained 6% of the variance in the criterion variable. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB The inspiration I take from J. M. Coetzee's book Elizabeth Costello (2003) is his advocacy of imagining as an alternative to rational thought. Imagining, as I understand him, is mindwork that engages the body as an experiential and metaphorical site. I apply this notion of imagining to suicides conducted in the service of political protest: The fatal hunger strike of ten prisoners in Northern Ireland in 1981 and Jan Palach's self-immolation in Prague in 1969. Three questions direct the exploration of their trajectories: What feeds the hope for the effectiveness of protest suicides? How do they use the body as a performance site? Do such suicides call for an ethics of attentiveness?

AB Numerous studies have examined the ecological relationship between suicide and area level determinants such as deprivation and social fragmentation. In Ireland, there is considerable geographic variation in the rates of suicide. However, there is a dearth of Irish studies investigating the geographic variability of suicide.
   The Irish Central Statistics Office (CSO) provided data relating to all deaths by suicide and deaths of undetermined intent that occurred from 2009 to 2011. Negative binomial regression was used to examine the relationship between area level suicide rates and measures of deprivation, social fragmentation and population density that were taken from the 2011 National Census.
   Overall deprivation had the strongest independent effect on small-area rates of suicide, with the most deprived areas showing the greatest risk of suicide (risk ratio = 2.1; 95 % CI 1.70-2.52). Low population density (rurality) was associated with an increased risk suicide in males across both age groups and among females in the older 40-64-year age group. Conversely, a weak association between high population density (urbanicity) and increased suicide risk was found among females in the 15-39-year age group. Associations with social fragmentation only became apparent in the sub group analysis. Social fragmentation was associated with an elevated risk of suicide in the older 40-64 age group, with this effect being most pronounced among females.
   The findings of this study demonstrate marked geographical inequalities in the distribution of suicide in Ireland and highlight the importance of targeting suicide prevention resources in the most deprived areas.

ID RELIGIOUS INVOLVEMENT; MODERNIZATION; INTEGRATION
AB This paper addresses some of the generalized theories explaining rising suicide rates in Ireland. The conclusion here is that linking suicide patterns to changing beliefs and values is problematic. Church attendance as well as adherence to traditional values remain high in this country compared to European levels, and variations in beliefs and values, especially rural/urban differences, do not fit with general explanations. Moreover, attitudes to value areas fluctuate in that justification for suicide - which showed an upward trend in the 1980s - was reversed in the 1990s, and this may have resulted from increased public focus and debate. Generalized explanations are unlikely to decipher complex phenomena such as suicidal behavior. Religious belief, if protective in relation to suicide, is unlikely to act alone. Social transformations have a differential impact depending on one's socio-economic positioning, which translates ideas of a general male vulnerability to suicide into focused areas of male distress.

AB Background: The firearms climate in Ireland is rapidly changing, and there is currently no research on the risk profiles of those dying through firearms suicides. Aims: To compare the sociodemographic profile of firearms suicide deaths with hanging and drowning suicides. Methods: Analyses are based on data for 9,674 suicides that occurred between 1980 and 2005 and provided by the Central Statistics Office of Ireland (CSO). Risk factors included were gender, place of residence, employment status (agri-employed/not agri-employed), marital status, and age. Results: Those dying by shooting were twice as likely to be male than those dying by hanging (95% CI = 1.5 to 2.6) and 6.7 times more likely than those dying by drowning (95% CI = 4.9 to 9.1). They were also more likely to have resided in a rural location (hanging OR = 3.8, 95% CI = 2.8 to 5.0; drowning OR = 4.2, 95% CI = 3.1 to 5.6) and to have been agri-employed (hanging OR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.1 to 1.6; drowning OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.1 to 1.7). Firearms suicides were significantly younger (H = 458.9, p < .0005). Model fit statistics from logistic regressions are presented. Factors included in the study were limited to those recorded by the CSO. Conclusions: The findings have implications for awareness training for suicide prevention workers and for those concerned with Ireland's increasingly liberal firearms climate.

AB Background: High proportions of those who die by suicide in Northern Ireland (NI) are not known to mental health services, making it important to understand contact with the wider health services. Previous research has not examined the patterns of emergency department (ED) attendance and hospital admissions amongst those who have died by suicide in NI.
   Objectives: The study objectives are to examine the relationships between ED attendances, hospital admissions, and death by suicide.
   Methods: A case control methodology was used, drawing on routinely collected administrative data on all deaths by suicide in Northern Ireland between 1/1/2012 and 31/12/2015. Each death was matched to 5 live controls, based on age and gender (n = 6630).
   Results: Death by suicide is associated with a recent ED attendance, with the highest odds for those who attended within the past three months (odds = 3.2, 95% CI = 2.5-4.2). Death by suicide is also associated with recent hospital admission, with the highest odds of death for admission within the past three months (odds = 6.6, 95% CI = 5.2-8.3). The odds of suicide are also higher for those living in a more deprived or urban area.
   Limitations: The study is limited to administrative data.
   Conclusions: Staff in EDs and hospitals may have a role in suicide prevention. These findings again support the importance of addressing economic deprivation and other area level factors, such as contagion in suicide prevention strategies.

   TRENDS; TIME
AB Studies show marriage to be protective against suicide though with variation in the extent to which suicide rates are higher among the never married, separated or divorced and widowed. We examined suicide in Northern Ireland by marital status and examined whether the observed variation differed by sex and age.
   Data relating to all 1,398 suicide deaths (ICD-9 E950-959 and ICD-10 X60-84) registered in 1996-2005 were analysed using Poisson regression.
   The total, male and female age-standardised suicide rates were 8.4, 13.6 and 3.3 per 100,000, respectively. Never marrying increased male suicide risk and its effect increased with age (incidence rate ratio (IRR) among 20-34 year-olds = 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.19-1.84; IRR among over 55 year-olds = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.55-3.50). Never marrying was a risk factor for women only if aged 20-34 years (IRR = 3.05, 95% CI = 1.70-5.47). Among over 55 year-olds, widowhood increased risk of male suicide only (IRR = 2.47, 95% CI = 1.64-3.70) whereas divorce was associated with an almost threefold increase in male (IRR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.39-4.88) and female (IRR = 2.57, 95% CI = 0.89-7.42) suicide relative to married persons. The effect of divorce was far more pronounced in 20-34 year-old men (IRR = 5.59, 95% CI = 3.58-8.67) and women (IRR = 9.46, 95% CI = 3.81-23.37).
   In Northern Ireland, marriage protects both sexes against suicide though men more so than women. Divorced young men, in particular, are a population at high risk of suicide.

AB Background: There are an estimated one million completed suicides per year worldwide. As a response to increasing concern about suicide within Europe, the EUROSAVE (European Review of Suicide and Violence Epidemiology) study was undertaken to examine recent trends in the epidemiology of suicide and self-inflicted injury mortality in the European Union (EU). Methods: Suicide and self-inflicted injury mortality data for the 15 EU countries for the years,1984-1998 were obtained from the World Health Organisation (WHO), the European Statistical Office of the European Commission (EUROSTAT) and national statistical agencies. Data were also obtained for a second group of deaths classified as 'undetermined' or 'other violence'. Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated and examined for trends over time. Results: Finland had the highest suicide rate, while Greece had the lowest for the latest available year (1997). Age-standardized suicide rates tended to be lowest in the Mediterranean countries. Significant downward linear time trends in suicide,mortality were observed in most countries, although rates varied markedly between countries. Both Ireland and Spain displayed significant upward linear trends in suicide mortality. Portugal had the highest rate of undetermined deaths-both in 1984 and 1998 while Greece had the lowest in both 1984 and 1997. Five countries (including Ireland and Spain) showed significant downward trends in deaths due to undetermined causes whereas Belgium and Germany showed borderline significant upward linear trends in deaths due to undetermined causes. Conclusions: Although suicide rates in most countries seem to be decreasing, the validity of the data is uncertain. Misclassification may contribute to the geographical and temporal variation in suicide rates in some EU countries but it does not explain the phenomenon. More detailed research comparing suicide-recording procedures and practices across the EU is required. In the absence of adequate EU wide data on suicide epidemiology, effective prevention of this distressing phenomenon is likely to remain elusive.

AB Introduction: Emile Durkheim differentiated between two types of wars: National and Civil Wars in terms of effect on suicide mortality. This study investigates Durkheim's assertion by examining the effect of Irish Civil War on the 1882-1928 suicide rates trend.
   Method: The study is based on vital statistics data sourced from Central Statistics Office of Ireland. We used Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with Explanatory variables (ARIMAX) design adopting Bayesian approach.
   Results: The Standardized Mortality Rate SMR for death by suicide for the total Irish population during the civil war period were reduced by 0.041417 (95% Credible Interval CI: -0.2421749 to 0.15934012). The SMR for death by suicide for the total Irish population during the First World War period were reduced by 0.206202 (95% CI: -0.3776463 to -0.03475746).
   Conclusion: Evidence from this study support a significant drop in terms of the intensity of suicidal behaviour in the Irish population during World War I more so than during the Irish Civil War.

AB Objective Despite their widespread use, there is limited evidence on whether crisis lines are effective, how to identify callers at risk or the best ways of supporting callers to prevent suicide. This study compared the features of callers and call patterns in service users who had died by suicide with those who were currently alive from 2008 to 2011. Methods Using information contained on Contact's (Northern Ireland's "Lifeline" service) Client Information Management System (CIMS), 118 deaths by suicide from 2008 to 2011 were compared with a matched control group (matched on age, gender, and main presenting issue on first contact) who had not died by suicide. Results Clients who had "check-in" calls were significantly less likely to die by suicide. Those with a substance dependency or those who had made a prior suicide attempt were significantly more likely to die by suicide. Duration of service access had a negative association with suicide risk. Conclusions "Check-in" calls are an important part of the service. Information on previous suicide attempts and substance dependency may be useful in identifying callers who may benefit from proactive support and outreach. Wider interventions are needed to promote service user follow-up and to encourage longer term engagement with the service.

   DEPRIVATION; MULTILEVEL
AB Background
   Suicide rates vary markedly between areas but it is unclear whether this is due to differences in population composition or to contextual factors operating at an area level.
   Aims
   To determine if area factors are independently related to suicide risk after adjustment for individual and family characteristics.
   Method
   A 5-year record linkage study was conducted of 1 116 748 non-institutionalised individuals aged 16-74 years, enumerated at the 2001 Northern Ireland census.
   Results
   The cohort experienced 566 suicides during follow-up, Suicide risks were lowest for women and for those who were married or cohabiting. indicators of individual and household disadvantage and economic and health status at the time of the census were also strongly related to risk of suicide. The higher rates of suicide in the more deprived and socially fragmented areas disappeared after adjustment for individual and household factors. There was no significant relationship between population density and risk of suicide.
   Conclusions Differences in rates of suicide between areas are predominantly due to population characteristics rather than to area-level factors, which suggests that policies targeted at area-level factors are unlikely to significantly influence suicides rates.

TI Parasuicide and suicide in the south-west of Ireland
SO IRISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID MORTALITY
AB Background Suicidal behaviour has become recognised as a major public health problem. Aim To examine hospital-treated parasuicide and suicide in the Southern and Mid-Western Health Boards.
   Methods Parasuicide data were derived from independent data collection in general and psychiatric hospitals and prisons between 1995 and 1997. The corresponding suicide data were obtained electronically from the Central Statistics Office.
   Results Respectively, the annual person-based male, female and total European age-standardised rates were 128.9, 154.3 and 141.3 per 100,000 for parasuicide compared to 22.7, 5.5 and 14.1 per 100,000 for suicide. The parasuicide/suicide ratio varied markedly by age, gender, area and marital status. The majority of suicides were by hanging or drowning whereas drug overdose made up the vast majority of parasuicide acts. Parasuicide was largely a city phenomenon confined to the young of both genders whereas suicide was a significant problem for city and county men, especially young adult men.
   Conclusion There are striking differences between the patterns of fatal and non-fatal suicidal behaviour in Ireland, which should be considered in prevention initiatives.

AB Substance use disorders are among the most frequent psychiatric disorders found in suicides. In psychological autopsy studies between 19% and 63% of all suicides suffered from substance use disorders, mostly from alcohol use disorders. Suicide risk is highly increased in substance use disorders, particularly in alcohol use disorders, and in co-morbid alcoholism and depression. So far, some risk factors for suicide have been identified in alcoholism. Nevertheless, various questions about the relationship between substance use disorders and suicide remain open, which indicate directions for future research.

TI Antidepressant prescribing and suicide rate in Northern Ireland
SO EUROPEAN PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE suicide; antidepressants; unemployment
ID DEPRESSION; PREVENTION; TRENDS; RISK; DISORDER
AB Purpose. - Although antidepressants are the most commonly used treatment for depressive illness, there is uncertainty if their use is associated with a reduction in suicide rate. Antidepressant prescribing in Northern Ireland has increased over fivefold in the decade 1989-1999. The authors sought to explore whether this increase was associated with a reduction in suicide rate taking into account social and political factors thought also to have an influence on suicide.
   Materials and methods. - Factors that have been suggested to influence suicide were entered into a linear regression with frequency of suicide and undetermined deaths (referred to as suicide rate) as the dependent variable. The above factors were antidepressant prescribing, unemployment rate, household alcohol expenditure and persons charged with terrorist offences. The rise in younger suicides, in recent decades, suggests this analysis should be carried out separately for younger (less than 30 years) and older (30 years and above) suicides separately. The predictors in the two models are based on aggregate data for the total group.
   Result. - In the younger group there was no association between antidepressant prescribing and suicide. For the older group increased antidepressant prescribing was associated with a reduction in suicide rate over the 10 years of the study.
   Conclusion. - Increasing antidepressant prescribing appears to be an effective strategy for reducing suicide. This has been demonstrated in older individuals. (C) 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

ID CELEBRITY SUICIDE; MEDIA
AB Background: Media reporting of suicide has been associated with imitative acts. Internationally, this has led to the development of guidelines to promote responsible reporting of suicide. Aims: To examine the nature and quality of news coverage of suicidal behavior in the United Kingdom (UK) and Republic of Ireland (ROI). Method: UK and ROI press clippings relating to suicide over 12 months (N = 8,101) were coded for content and assessed for quality against existing guidelines. We examined variability in relation to key characteristics (e.g., type of publication) and compared newspaper portrayal of suicide against official statistics. Results: Reports were biased toward young, female, and relatively unusual suicides (including those involving a celebrity, more than one individual, and violent methods). Almost a third of reports had inappropriate headlines, but only a minority were of poor overall quality, and editors appear to be responsive to feed back.There was considerable variability in the quality of reports for different suicide methods. Limitations: This work cannot account for the impact of reporting on suicidal behavior. The speed of change in media trends also limits its conclusions. Conclusion: Our findings underscore the need for sustained efforts to promote responsible reporting of suicide.

AB One hundred and nine suicide survivors and 128 informants of community controls were investigated in this study to explore how Chinese suicide survivors were affected by the suicide deaths. Variables measured in the survey included demographic status, mental health status, personality, etc. Univariate and multivariate analyses were employed in data analyses to explore possible influencing factors for depression among Chinese suicide survivors. 'Lived with suicide victim' was found to be the most important influencing factor. Suicide survivors were more depressed than general populations but the characteristics of Chinese suicide survivors were still not clear. Interventions for Chinese suicide survivors are essential, but before that more research is needed to get a comprehensive understanding of Chinese suicide survivors. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB The present study investigated the genetic association of the disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISCI) gene with suicide using 398 Japanese completed suicides and 511 healthy controls. The functional Ser704Cys variant of DISCI was nominally associated with completed suicide. Enhanced evidence of association was observed in a multi-marker sliding window haplotype analysis (the lowest p=0.002). These findings warrant further studies with a larger sample size to confirm the association of DISCI with suicide. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Suicide; self-harm; economic recession; interrupted time series analysis
ID FINANCIAL CRISIS; HEALTH; INCREASE; TREND; UNEMPLOYMENT; MORTALITY;

AB Background: The recent economic recession has been associated with short-term increases in suicide in many countries. Data are lacking on the longer-term effect on suicide and on the impact on non-fatal suicidal behaviour.
   Methods: Using interrupted time series analyses, we have assessed the impact of economic recession and austerity in Ireland on national rates of suicide mortality and self-harm presentations to hospital in 2008-12.
   Results: By the end of 2012, the male suicide rate was 57% higher [+8.7 per 100 000, 95% confidence interval (CI), 4.8 to 12.5] than if the pre-recession trend continued, whereas female suicide was almost unchanged (+0.3 per 100 000, 95% CI, -1.1 to 1.8). Male and female self-harm rates were 31% higher (+74.1 per 100 000, 95% CI, -6.3 to 154.6) and 22% higher (+63.2 per 100 000, 95% CI, 4.1 to 122.2), respectively. There were 476 more male (95% CI, 274 to 678) and 85 more female (95% CI, -9 to 180) suicide deaths and 5029 more male (95% CI, 626 to 9432) and 3833 more female (95% CI, 321 to 7345) self-harm presentations to hospital in 2008-12 than if pre-recession trends had continued. Men aged 25-64 years were affected in terms of suicide and self-harm with the greatest impact observed in 25-44 year-olds. The increase in self-harm by women was among 15-24 year-olds.
   Conclusions: Five years of economic recession and austerity in Ireland have had a significant negative impact on rates of suicide in men and on self-harm in both sexes.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the nature of homicide-suicides and determine the ways in which they differ from suicides without the perpetration of homicide in terms of their demographic characteristics, suicide, medical and psychiatric history, their psychological state leading up to the suicide, and their motives for their suicidal behavior. Cases of homicide-suicide from a 20-year period were extracted from the Coroner's inquest files and were matched to suicide-only cases on the basis of age and sex. The characteristics that predominantly distinguished the homicide-suicides were based on psychological state leading up to the act and motive for the act. It is proposed that homicide-suicides may be better understood within an expressive homicide framework. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID BEREAVEMENT; SPOUSE; DEATH
AB The impact of widowhood on suicide and accident mortality in Ireland was investigated using Poisson regression analysis applied to routine data relating to all 10 561 suicidal and accidental deaths of married or widowed persons aged at least 35 years in Ireland during 1986-2005. Mortality rates were almost always higher among the widowed and often by a 2-fold, statistically significant difference. The excess mortality was equivalent to 2083 or 57.6% of all suicidal or accidental deaths of widowed persons in 1986-2005. Routine contact with recently widowed persons by public health professionals may be warranted with a view to reducing their excess mortality.

DT Editorial Material
ID PARACETAMOL; POPULATION; IRELAND; TIME
AB Ireland's suicide rate is falling, but suicide and self-harm remain substantial societal problems. It is not possible to predict suicide at the level of the individual but good primary care, good mental health care and good social care all likely reduce risk. In terms of targeted interventions, public health measures, such as paracetamol pack size regulations, have the best evidence base to support them. Despite increased public and professional discussion, much remains to be done to provide effective, coordinated support to those at risk of suicide and those bereaved. In 2016, there were up to 300 different groups providing support. Clearly, a coordinated, effective and compassionate approach is needed, linking community and state resources meaningfully with each other. Approaches rooted outside of core mental health services will be vital: addressing alcohol problems and other addictions, reducing homelessness, reforming the criminal justice system and improving social care.

AB Objective: To analyse trends in mortality from suicide over the period 1965 - 99.
   Method: Data were derived from the WHO database, including data for 47 countries.
   Results: In the European Union (EU), all age suicide mortality peaked at 16.1/100 000 in men in 1980 - 84, and declined thereafter to 14.4/ 100 000 in 1995 - 98. In females, the fall was 29% to reach 4.6/100 000. A similar pattern of trends was observed in several eastern European countries. In contrast, mortality from suicide rose substantially in the Russian Federation, from 37.7/100 000 in males in 1985 - 89 to 58.3/ 100 000 in 1995 - 98 (+ 55%), and to 9.5/100 000 (+ 12%) in females. In the USA and most other American countries providing data, no consistent pattern was evident for males, but falls were observed in females. Steady declines were registered for Japan, starting from the highest suicide rates worldwide in the late 1950s. Suicide rates were upwards in Ireland, Italy, Spain, the UK, Cuba, Australia and New Zealand. Substantial rises were observed in a few countries ( Ireland, Cuba, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand) for young males.
   Conclusion: In spite of mixed trends, suicide remains a significant public health problem worldwide.

AB AimThis study aimed to examine whether or not sexual minority youth constitute an at-risk group for nonsuicidal self-injury, suicidal ideation or suicide attempts during their emerging adult years.
   MethodsUsing data from the Challenging Times Study, a population-based study of psychopathology and suicide in Ireland, analyses were conducted to test the associations between sexual minority status and the odds of any lifetime experience of nonsuicidal self-injury, suicidal thoughts or suicide attempts among Irish youth aged 19-24 years.
   ResultsSexual minority youth had 6.6-fold (95% CI 1.7-24.7) increased risk of nonsuicidal self-injury, a 5.0-fold (95% CI 1.3-18.3) increased risk of suicidal ideation, a 7.7-fold (95% CI 1.8-32.0) increased risk of suicide intent and a 6.8-fold (95% CI 1.6-27.6) increased risk of a suicide attempt during their lifetime compared to their heterosexual peers.
   ConclusionsThis study shows that emerging adulthood is a period of risk for suicide and nonsuicidal self-injurious behaviour among sexual minority youth.

TI "A Peculiar Species of Felony": Suicide, Medicine, and the Law in
   Victorian Britain and Ireland
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL HISTORY
LA English
DT Article
ID HISTORY
AB This paper examines the relationship between suicide and insanity in the eyes of both legal and medical professionals in nineteenth century Britain and Ireland. Both jurisdictions had a similar historical legacy in relation to the treatment of suicide, punishing sane suicides, those found felo de se, by ignominious burial and forfeiture. Legal changes between 1823 and 1882 negated the need for a verdict of temporary insanity as suicide essentially became a crime without legal punishment. Nevertheless, the rise of forensic psychiatry within the legal system meant that definitions of the temporary insanity of suicides became a controversial question for medical professionals. Similarly, the retention of distinctions of sanity and insanity for religious and insurance purposes ensured that there were spiritual and practical ramifications to a verdict of felo de se even if there were no legal consequences. The debate among doctors and legal professionals suggests that the process of "medicalization" of suicide was not, as MacDonald has suggested, driven by these elite professional groups, but rather by public opinion. While legal punishments for attempted suicide remained in force and in use, by the end of the nineteenth century medicine was seen as the main actor in the fight against this "social disease.".

AB Objectives: This exploratory study was designed to explore the social correlates of suicides rates of Irish counties.
   Method: Suicide rates were calculated for Irish counties and subdivisions for the period 1988-1994 and correlated with social data for these regions obtained from the 1991 Census.
   Results: The suicide rates showed a low level of reliability for the periods 1978-1984 and 1988-1994, and the social correlates of suicide rates changed between the two periods. Whereas age structure was associated with suicide rates in 1978-1984, urbanisation was associated with suicide rates in 1988-1994.
   Conclusions: It is important to check the reliability of results of ecological studies of Irish suicide rates. Furthermore, the impact on suicide rates of the changing role of women in Ireland needs to be explored in time-series studies of the Irish suicide rate.

AB The aim of this study is to update age and sex mortality rates for suicide in Italy; to evaluate the methods of suicide; to consider the effect of under-reporting on mortality rate for suicide; to compare age-adjusted mortality rates for suicide; and to examine some possible causes for the misclassification of suicide. Temporal trends, from 1980 to 2002, were analyzed using joinpoint regression. Suicide rates decreased from 1980 to 2002 by 10.5% for men and by 44% for women. The change in suicide methods indicated an increasing use of highly lethal methods. The under-reporting of suicide seems to have no effect on temporal changes in mortality rates or on the geographical distribution. These data indicate that Italy is a country at low risk for suicide.

AB Life events and circumstances leading to death change throughout the life course. In this study, 4 age groups within those who have died by suicide are compared in terms method of suicide, sex, occupation, mental disorders, prior suicide attempts, and life events prior to death. Analyses were based on a database of deaths by suicide and undetermined intent based on data in the Northern Ireland (NI) coronial files from 2005-2011 (N=1667). Research determined that hanging is very prominent as a method of death within the under-20 age group. Women who die by suicide are more likely to have a known mental disorder than men, and the proportions increase with age group. Relationship difficulties are associated with many of these deaths and particularly for males aged under 40 years. Physical health and life events were more relevant than mental illness per se, in males aged over 61 years. For a sizeable proportion of the cases included in the current database there was no information on the life events prior to death. Understanding the factors associated with suicide across age groups is essential to informing suicide prevention strategy and programs and the development of more nuanced and effective interventions.

AB Background: Information about prescription medications prior to death by suicide may help us understand the role of medications, illness and service contact in suicide.
   Aims: Through the use of a novel dataset, this study aims to provide an improved understanding of the relationships between pain medication and mental health medication, suicide and area level deprivation.
   Methods: Data was included on all deaths by suicide in NI (Northern Ireland) between 1/1/2012 and 31/12/2015. Each death was matched to 5 live controls, based on age (the closest match within 2 years) and gender, resulting in a dataset consisting of 6630 individuals. Four data sources were linked to obtain the final dataset.
   Results: Suicide linked with and deprivation, with a heightened risk of suicide for 9 months after last prescription of pain medication and for up to two years after last prescription of mental health medication. Odds ratios for death by suicide were strongest among those with the most recent prescriptions (within 0-3 months) (OR for death by suicide = 12.20 amongst those with mental health prescription medication; OR for death by suicide = 3.69 amongst those with pain medication). These figures support the associations between suicide and pain related conditions, and physical health difficulties. Recent prescriptions are particularly important.
   Limitations: Received medication prescriptions may not have been taken as recommended.
   Conclusions: Contact with a clinician to obtain a prescription may present opportunities for intervention. Suicide assessment (and evidence-based suicide specific treatments) may be important for people who are receiving prescribed medication, particularly for a mental illness.

AB Background: Service presentation may offer an opportunity for intervention prior to suicide. The study aimed to examine the characteristics, disorders and service use profiles of those who had died by suicide in Northern Ireland (NI) from 2005 to 2011.
   Methods: An analysis of a database of deaths by suicide and undetermined intent based on data in the NI Coronial files from 2005 to 2011 (N =1667).
   Results: Males are three times as likely to die by suicide as females and suicide rates similar among those aged 20-60 years. Females have increased service use prior to suicide; males tend to disengage with services prior to death. Females are more likely to have recorded prior attempts, service use, diagnosis and referral. The most common health service used was primary care.
   Limitations: Despite the inclusion of undetermined deaths (probable suicides) a proportion of deaths by suicide remain unrecorded as such Data on marital status and mental and physical disorders were based on information recorded by police officers from relatives, other informants and medical records. The reliability of this data may therefore be questioned.
   Conclusions: Primary care has an important role in suicide prevention. Gendered patterns in service use prior to death should be considered in suicide prevention programmes. It is important to strengthen clinicians' knowledge of the manifestations of suicidal ideation in males and ways of encouraging service use in males. The NI population who were exposed to the height of the violence of the conflict appear to be at increased risk of suicide as they age. (C) 2014 Elsevier By, All rights reserved.

AB The present study examined genuine and simulated suicide notes aiming to identify the measures of content that best differentiate between the two. Thirty-three genuine and thirty-three simulated suicide notes were content-analysed and data subjected to smallest space analysis (SSA), a Multidimensional Scaling Procedure. The core of all suicide notes was discovered to be constructed with the use of three variables: expressions of love, positive construction of partner and apologies. Furthermore, four different genuine suicide note themes ('planned escape', 'negative affect and self-mitigation', 'positive affect and failed relationship', 'lack of self-acceptance') and three simulated suicide note themes ('escape', 'positive affect and self-blame', 'purposeless life') were identified revealing that authentic suicide note themes were more internally consistent and clearer to interpret.

AB Objective. Trends in suicide death rates among migrants to England and Wales 1979-2003 were examined.
   Methods. Age-standardised rates derived for eight country of birth groups.
   Results. For men born in Jamaica, suicide death rates increased in 1999-2003. There were declines in rates for men and women from India and from Scotland, men from East Africa and Northern Ireland and women from the Republic of Ireland. For both men and women born in Scotland or the Irish Republic, despite declines for some, rates remained higher than for England and Wales born. Rates among men from Pakistan were consistently lower than men born in England and Wales.
   Conclusion. These analyses indicate declining trends for most migrant groups and for England and Wales-born women, but adverse trends in death rates for some country of birth groups.

AB Cultural and regional differences on the well-known elevated suicide risk in substance use disorders have not been clarified yet. Therefore, the suicide risk associated with substance use disorders in a society of transition and in a socially and economically stable society should be identified and compared, Data from two population-based matched case-control studies were used to analyse the association between alcohol and other substance consumption and the risk of suicide. Data in Frankfurt were obtained by a semi-structured interview including the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I (SCID-I) in 163 suicides that occurred in 1999 and 2000, and data from Tallinn were collected according to DSM-IV criteria on 156 deceased persons who committed suicide in 1999 by using the psychological autopsy method and in each city in matched population-based control persons by personal interview. In both cities, substance use disorders were significantly associated with suicide. Odds ratios for suicide were higher in Tallinn than in Frankfurt. The highest risk was observed in Tallinn among men with alcohol use disorders, aged 35 to 59 years. Although substance use and, in particular, alcohol use disorders were confirmed as risk factors for suicide in Tallinn and in Frankfurt, the much higher suicide risk associated with alcoholism in Tallinn than in Frankfurt indicates the importance of cultural, socio-political, and regional impact of suicide risk in alcoholism.

In this article, we present the anomalous suicide of an adult male by strangulation with a belt and simultaneous ingestion of plaster. The specific circumstances of the case are described and relevant literature is briefly reviewed. This case vignette illustrates one example of the wide ranging methods employed in suicides and may represent the first reported case of a fatal complex suicide involving self-strangulation and plaster ingestion. Knowledge of varied and sometimes unusual suicide methods is important to the forensic investigator to prevent unnecessary criminal investigation and to reliably and confidently establish manner and cause of death.

AB Objectives: To compare the sociodemographic characteristics of firearms suicide decedents and other suicide decedents in the Republic of Ireland between 1980 and 2005.
   Study design: A cross-sectional study of sociodemographic characteristics of those who committed suicide with a firearm and those who committed suicide by an alternative method.
   Methods: Suicide data from 1980 to 2005 inclusive, provided by the Central Statistics Office of Ireland, were analysed. For the purpose of this paper, suicide method was collapsed into two group's: firearm-assisted suicide (FAS) and non-firearm-assisted suicide (n-FAS). Differences in gender, marital status (married vs not married), area of residence (urban vs rural), agri-employment (agri-employed vs not agri-employed) and age were examined between the two groups. A logistic regression is presented using suicide method (FAS vs n-FAS) as the criterion variable and individual factors as predictors.
   Results: In total, 9674 suicides were recorded from 1 January 1980 to 31 December 2005. Seven hundred and ninety-three of these were FAS and 8881 were n-FAS. For both suicide profiles, the deceased were predominantly male, living in a rural setting and not married. However, this profile was more salient in the FAS group. In comparison with the n-FAS group, a greater proportion of the FAS decedents were male [chi(2)(1) = 152.5, P <= 0.0001, odds ratio (OR) = 4.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.4-6.1], from a rural setting [chi(2)(1) = 153.5, P <= 0.0001, OR = 4.4, 95%CI 3.2-5.6) and agri-employed [chi(2)(1) = 21.3, P <= 0.0001, OR = 1.5, 95%CI 1.3-1.8). FAS decedents were significantly younger than n-FAS victims, although the size of this effect was small (z = -8.4, P < 0.0005, r = -0.1). There was no difference in marital status between the two groups.
   Conclusions: Risk factors for FAS should inform policy-making in this area, with particular attention paid to protecting young males resident in rural settings. Consideration should be given to targeting agri-employed individuals as a specific at-risk group. (C) 2010 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide, assisted suicide and euthanasia are elusive and controversial issues worldwide. To discuss such issues from only one perspective may be limiting. Therefore, this paper was written by authors from various regions, each of whom has been asked to reflect on the issues. The countries/cultures are: Australia, China, Cuba, Ireland, India, Japan, Russia, South Africa, The Netherlands, North America (Turtle Island) and United States. Historically and today, suicide is viewed differently. Assisted suicide and euthanasia are equally seen from multifarious perspectives. Highlighting development in the Netherlands, Australia's Northern Territory and Japan (ie. the famous Yamanouchi Case), the review shows growing re-examination of the right to die. There appear, however, to be no uniform legal and ethical positions. Further debate and discussion globally is needed to avoid myopic perspectives.

AB A closer analysis was made of all postmortems at the Benjamin Franklin Campus of the Institute of Forensic Medicine performed on juveniles who committed suicide at the age of 20 or below in the period from 1998 to 2003. A double suicide of a young couple, who met on the Internet and agreed on the procedure to be followed up to the act itself, which took place in Berlin, is presented as a representative case. The authors emphasise that in view of the danger of emulation, the media should exercise restraint in describing concrete details especially when reporting about suicides of juveniles.

DE aged; cognitive therapy; depression; problem solving; sex; suicide
ID PSYCHOLOGICAL AUTOPSY; COGNITIVE THERAPY; MENTAL-DISORDERS;
   NORTHERN-IRELAND; RISK-FACTORS; DEPRESSION
AB Objective: The aim was to determine if suicide note themes might inform suicide prevention strategies. Method: The themes of 42 suicide notes from the Northern Ireland Suicide Study (major psychological autopsy study) were examined. Results: The commonest themes were "apology/shame" (74%), "love for those left behind" (60%), "life too much to bear" (48%), "instructions regarding practical affairs post-mortem" (36%), "hopelessness/nothing to live for" (21%) and "advice for those left behind" (21%). Notes of suicides with major unipolar depression were more likely than notes of suicides without major unipolar depression to contain the themes "instructions regarding practical affairs post-mortem" (67% versus 19%, p = 0.005) and "hopelessness/nothing to live for" (40% versus 11%, p = 0.049). Notes of suicides with a previous history of deliberate self-harm were less likely than notes of suicides without a history of deliberate self-harm to contain the theme "apology/shame" (58% versus 87%, p = 0.04). Notes of elderly suicides were more likely than non-elderly notes to contain the theme "burden to others" (40% versus 3%, p = 0.03). Conclusions: The fact that three quarters of suicide notes contained the theme "apology/shame" suggests that the deceased may have welcomed alternative solutions for their predicaments. Scrutiny of suicide note themes in the light of previous research findings suggests that cognitive therapy techniques, especially problem solving, may have an important role to play in suicide prevention and that potential major unipolar depressive (possibly less impulsive) suicides, in particular, may provide fertile ground for therapeutic intervention (physical and psychological). Ideally all primary care doctors and mental health professionals working with (potentially) suicidal people should be familiar with basic cognitive therapy techniques, especially problem solving skills training.

AB This paper is set within the context of a growing interest in the gendered nature of rurality and of rural life, and in particular in the context of an emerging literature on rural masculinities. It focuses on rural men and in particular on the phenomenon of rising male rural suicide rates. The paper reviews existing research in order to ascertain the validity of popular claims of high and rising suicide rates among young men in rural ireland, and explores possible explanations for this phenomenon. It draws on medical and psychological literature but sets this material in a wider geographical context, focusing on processes of contemporary rural restructuring and the oft-cited masculinity crisis. The paper concludes that in order to understand the processes behind rising male suicide rates, we need to understand the struggles for power and identity that are going on in places, and the movements of people in and out of places. Therefore geography and gender studies can contribute to a greater understanding of the phenomenon, suggesting that this is an area that merits further interdisciplinary research.

AB Earlier studies have linked lipid metabolism to Suicide and impulsive-aggressive behaviors. We previously reported that suicide attempters had significantly lower leptin and cholesterol levels than controls. Since lower cholesterol levels have been related to violence alone, we decided to evaluate serum total cholesterol and leptin levels in violent and non-violent Suicide attempters. In the present study, 19 violent, 16 non-violent Suicide attempters, and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were compared for serum total cholesterol and leptin levels. Violent Suicide attempters had significantly lower total cholesterol and leptin levels compared with those with non-violent Suicide attempts. Our results Suggest that low serum cholesterol and leptin levels are related to the following two dimensions Of Suicide attempts: suicidality and violence. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB The rate of suicides in road traffic fatalities is estimated at 1-8% depending on the investigated study material. Especially single-car accidents, for which no technical reason or driving error is apparent, are considered suspicious. The elucidation of suicides in road traffic is difficult if there are no relevant clues such as the announcement of suicide plans shortly before the event or a suicide note. Individuals who intentionally kill themselves in road traffic often have a history of mental illness.
   The authors report on a suicide using a bicycle. A 71-year-old man intentionally drove into the wall of a house situated at the end of a hill road and suffered an open craniocerebral trauma and an aortic rupture. The pattern of findings and the circumstances of the case are described. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

   We report two cases of suicide that occurred in the same suburban area, three years apart. In each case, the victim was a carpenter and had a history of psychiatric disorder and/or of prior suicide attempts.

AB Associations between suicide, violent behaviour and both hypocholesterolaemia and low 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been suggested. The relationships between lipids, the serotonergic system, suicidal and aggressive behaviors are complex. We explored relationships between serum cholesterol, CSF 5-HIAA. the planning subscale of suicide intent and violence of attempted suicide method in 13 medication-free male suicide attempters and eight healthy volunteers. Serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were significantly lower in suicide attempters than in controls. HDL-C showed a significant positive correlation with the planning subscale of suicide intent in non-violent suicide attempters. A positive association was observed between CSF 5-HIAA and serum cholesterol in suicides. The role of cholesterol may be different in planned non-violent suicide attempts compared with violent suicide attempts. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID PARASUICIDE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; DEPRESSION; PREVENTION; ENGLAND
AB Background: Suicidal behaviour has increasingly become recognized as a major public health problem. This study aimed to establish the extent of hospital-treated attempted suicide in South-west Ireland. Methods: Between 1995 and 1997, routine data collection, based on the standardized methodology of the WHO/Euro Multicentre Study on Suicidal Behaviour, took place in all general and psychiatric hospitals and prisons in the Southern and Mid-western Health Boards covering one-quarter (863,709) of the Irish population. Results: The annual person-based (aged over 15 years) male and female European age-standardized attempted suicide rates were 163 and 190 per 100,000, respectively. Female rates far exceeded male rates in under 20-year-olds. The peak rates for men and women were in the age range 20-24 (374 per 100,000) and 15-19 (433 per 100,000) years, respectively. One in six (16%) made a repeat attempt within the study period. Adjusting for age, repetition was marginally less common in women. Multivariate analysis investigating the risk of repetition associated with age, method and previous attempts found no age effect for women but an increased risk of repetition among men in their thirties (OR=1.7, 95% CI: 1.2-2.4). An attempt in the preceding 12 months greatly elevated the risk of repetition, particularly for women (female OR=13.7, 95% CI: 9.3-20.4; male OR=5.6, 95% CI: 4.1-7.8). Conclusion: Attempted suicide is a significant public health problem in Ireland. Rates are higher in women and highest among the young. An attempt in the past year greatly increases the risk of repetition, especially in women.

AB This research examines empirically the determinants of suicides in Denmark over the period 1970-2006. To our knowledge, there exist no previous study that estimates a dynamic econometric model of suicides on the basis of time series data and cointegration framework at disaggregate level. Our results indicate that suicide is associated with a range of socio-economic factors but the strength of the association can differ by gender. In particular, we find that a rise in real per capita income and fertility rate decreases suicides for males and females. Divorce is positively associated with suicides and this effect seems to be stronger for men. A fall in unemployment rates seems to lower significantly suicides in males and females. Policy implications of suicides are discussed with some appropriate recommendations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide attempts are one of the risk factors of suicide. Possible mechanisms by which Toxoplasma gondii may affect human behavior and it may also cause humans to attempt suicide. The aim of this study is to find out whether or not T. gondii is one of the reasons in suicide attempts. We investigated the seropositivity level for anti-Toxoplasma IgG and IgM antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in subjects who have attempted to suicide to find out whether there is a probable relationship between T. gondii and suicide attempts. In our study, we selected 200 cases of suicide attempts and 200 healthy volunteers. The sero-positivity level for anti-Toxoplasma IgG antibodies among suicide attempts (41%) was significantly higher than the control group (28%). This signifies that there might be a causal relationship between toxoplasmosis and the etiology of suicide attempt. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The study examined whether having a family history of suicidal behavior is associated with an earlier age of first attempting suicide. Interviews were conducted with 545 patients who had attempted suicide about their family history of suicidal behavior and about their age of first suicide attempt. The results showed that attempters with a family history of suicidal behavior. particularly attempters; with two or more such family members, had first attempted suicide at an earlier age than attempters who did not have a family history of suicidal behavior. These results suggest that a family history of suicide. which is known to increase the risk of suicidal behavior, may also be associated with an earlier age of first attempting suicide.

AB Background: International research consistently shows evidence for an association between sensationalised and detailed media reporting, and suicidal behaviour.
   Aim: This study examined the quality of media reporting of suicide and adherence to media guidelines in Ireland.
   Methods: In accordance with the criteria outlined in the media guidelines for reporting suicide, 243 media articles were screened and analysed for quality of reporting of two high-profile cases of suicide and two cases of suicide that became high profile following a period of intense media coverage that occurred between September 2009 and December 2012.
   Results: A minority of articles breached the media guidelines in relation to sensationalised language (11.8%), placement of reports on the front page of the newspaper (9.5%), publishing of inappropriate photographs (4.2%) and mention of location of suicide (2.4%), while no articles disclosed the contents of a suicide note. However, in the majority of articles analysed, journalists did not refer to appropriate support services for people vulnerable to, and at risk of suicide (75.8%) or mention wider issues that are related to suicidal behaviour (53.8%). Overemphasis of community grief (48.3%) was also common. Nearly all articles (99.2%) breached at least one guideline and 58.9% of articles breached three or more guidelines.
   Conclusion: Overall, adherence to media guidelines on reporting suicide in Ireland improved in certain key areas from September 2009 until December 2012. Nonetheless, important challenges remain. Increased monitoring by media monitoring agencies, regulators and government departments is required. Implementation should be conducted using a pro-active approach and form part of the curriculum of journalists and editors. The inclusion of guidelines for the reporting of suicidal behaviour in press codes of conduct for journalists warrants consideration.

AB Despite several proatherogenic characteristics distinguish subjects who commit suicide, it remains unclear whether or not the incidence of suicide and cardiovascular disease are related. Between 1979 and 2005, a total of 3,364,908 deaths were reported from suicide, ischemic heart disease, or stroke of individuals who were 40 years or older. The incidence of deaths from suicide was positively correlated with those from ischemic heart disease (r = 0.95; p<0.0001) and stroke (r = 0.92; p<0.0001). No such correlation was found between suicides and deaths from other non-cardiovascular or non-atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. This study calls attention for the existence of an association between suicide behavior and cardiovascular risk. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: No recent cross-country examinations for youth suicide trends and methods for Europe were found.
   Aim: The aim of the study is to specify differences in suicide rates, trends and methods used among 15-24 years olds by gender across 15 European countries.
   Method: Data for 14,738 suicide cases in the age group 15-24 in 2000-2004/5 were obtained and analysed.
   Results: Suicide rates ranged 5.5-35.1 for males and 1.3-8.5 for females. Statistically significant decline since 2000 was observed in Germany, Scotland, Spain, and England for males and in Ireland for females. Hanging was most frequently used for both genders, followed by jumping and use of a moving object for males and jumping and poisoning by drugs for females. Male Suicides had a higher risk than females of using firearms and hanging and lower risk of poisoning by drugs and jumping. There were large differences between single Countries.
   Limitations: The limitations of the study are the small numbers of specific suicide methods in some countries as well as the recategorisation of ICD-9 codes into ICD-10 in England, Ireland and Portugal. Further, the use of suicides (X60-X84) without events of undetermined deaths (Y10-Y34) continues to be problematic considering the possibility of "hidden suicides".
   Conclusions: The present Study shows that suicide rates among young males are decreasing since 2000 in several European countries. Analysis of suicide methods confirms that there is a very high proportion of hanging in youths, which is extremely difficult to restrict. However, besides hanging there are also high rates of preventable suicide methods and reducing the availability of means should be one of the goals of suicide prevention.

AB In complex suicides, two or more methods are applied either simultaneously or one after the other. The purpose of the present study was. to distinguish such complex suicides in the proper sense from "complicated suicides", which are characterized by an unintentional secondary traumatization following the original Suicide method. The study material comprises 1217 Suicides investigated at the Budapest Institute of Forensic Medicine in the period from 2004 to 2006. Among these, 4.43% (n = 54) accounted for planned or unplanned complex suicides, whereas 0.49% (n = 6) were categorized as "complicated suicides". The latter group included four fatalities due to unintended falls from a height (for instance after breaking of the hanging noose), one death from electrocution and one case of drowning. The succession of a failed suicidal act and a secondary ("unforeseen" and therefore "accidental") trauma with fatal outcome may cause problems in determining the manner and cause of death.

DE Suicide; Bathtub
AB We reviewed five autopsy cases of suspected bathtub suicide. The immediate cause of death in all cases was determined to be drowning on the basis of macropathological findings such as frothy fluid in the airways or overinflation of the lungs as well as histological findings obtained at autopsy. We suspected that the manner of death in those cases was suicide based on comprehensive postmortem investigations of statements from witnesses, the presence of a farewell letter, the fact that clothes had been worn, additional means to ensure suicide, and results of drug tests, as well as autopsy findings. Cases of bathtub suicide should be investigated carefully to distinguish them from accidental or natural death. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Following a 2-3-month period of publicity, anaesthetists were invited to participate in an online survey that was administered by a third party company on behalf of the Association of Anaesthetists and ran between 3 September and 31 October 2018. Anaesthetists working in the UK or Ireland were asked about the presence or absence of welfare/support structures or resources in their workplace in the case of mental illness, addiction and/or suicide. Anaesthetists working anywhere in the world were also asked for their experiences of a colleague's suicide, defined as a colleague's taking his or her own life - whether intentional or not - while practising as an anaesthetist in the UK or Ireland, in the same department and at the same time as the respondent. Respondents were also asked about experiences of other suicides not meeting this definition. A total of 3638 responses were received. Most respondents were unaware of the existence of policies/guidance on mental illness, addiction or suicide, or of welfare leads, within their Trust or department. A total of 1916 cases of suicide meeting the survey's definition were reported by 1397 respondents, although the actual number of discrete cases is unknown because of likely multiple reporting of the same cases. A third of respondents who reported a suicide had experience of more than one case. Most reports were of suicide in the last 10 years, and most reported cases involved anaesthetic drugs. Deficiencies were noted in the support available and in the way the deaths were handled, although examples of good support were also described. A further 1715 respondents reported suicides that did not meet the primary definition. Overall, 92% of respondents reporting suicide experienced it through work, and 41% outside of work (total > 100% as some reported both). Although unable to provide estimates of suicide rates, or numerical associations between the features of the deaths, this survey highlights the considerable emotional and mental burden of suicide on anaesthetists.

AB In cases of suicide at the wheel mostly velocity is used to cause death by a single occupant vehicle crash against a fixed roadside object or collision with other vehicles. A further well known mode of death is e.g. carbon monoxide poisoning. In the recent years several cases of vehicle assisted ligature strangulation resulting even in decapitation have been reported. However, cars are also used in rare cases just as places for a suicide by hanging or ligature strangulation. Not only forensic pathologists but also police officers have to be aware of this rare type of suicide to avoid unnecessary investigations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Alcohol misuse and alcohol consumption are significant risk factors for suicidal behavior. Aims: This study sought to identify factors associated with alcohol consumption in cases of suicide and nonfatal self-harm presentations. Method: Suicide cases in Cork, Ireland, from September 2008 to June 2012 were identified through the Suicide Support and Information System. Emergency department presentations of self-harm in the years 2007-2013 were obtained from the National Self-Harm Registry Ireland. Results: Alcohol consumption was detected in the toxicology of 44% out of 307 suicide cases. Only younger age was significantly associated with having consumed alcohol among suicides. Alcohol consumption was noted in the case notes in 21% out of 8,145 self-harm presentations. Logistic regression analyses indicated that variables associated with having consumed alcohol in a self-harm presentation included male gender, older age, overdose as a method, not being admitted to a psychiatric ward, and presenting out-of-hours. Limitations: Data was limited to routinely collected variables by the two different monitoring systems. Conclusion: Alcohol consumption commonly precedes suicidal behavior, and several factors differentiated alcohol-related suicidal acts. Self-harm cases, in particular, differ in profile when alcohol is consumed and may require a tailored clinical approach to minimize risk of further nonfatal or fatal self-harm.

AB Military suicide has escalated in recent years, however almost no research has used military surveillance data to examine suicide risk factors. The aims of the current study were to compare suicide risk factors among US Soldiers who died by suicide, attempted suicide, and controls using a prospective case-control design. Controls were 247 Soldiers completing standard post-deployment assessment procedures. Cases were 276 suicide decedents (n=85) or suicide attempters (n=191), drawn from the Department of Defense Suicide Event Report.
   Compared to controls, suicide attempters and decedents had greater odds of failed intimate relationships, legal problems, and substance abuse problems in the past 90 days. Suicide attempters and decedents also had greater odds of a history of a mood disorder and prior suicide attempt compared to controls. Suicide decedents had greater odds of exposure to legal problems in the past 90 days and lower odds of ever having an anxiety disorder, compared to suicide attempters. Vigilance toward early detection of modifiable suicide risk factors such as relationship dissolution, mood disorders, substance abuse, and legal problems may help reduce suicide risk among US Soldiers.

TI Biochemical toxicology and suicide in Ireland: a laboratory study
SO IRISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE

DT Article
DE Biochemical toxicology; Blood immunoassays; Urine screens; Suicides
AB Biochemical toxicology in suicides provides a template to improve preventive interventions in cases of suicide. The menu for biochemical toxicological analysis in coroners' cases is not prescriptive in Ireland or in the United Kingdom. The aim of the study was to confirm that reliance on the results of an immunoassay screen for drugs of abuse and common analgesics in order to select samples for compound confirmation by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry is likely to understate the potential role of drugs in suicide. Blood and urine samples were analyzed using enzyme immunoassay, alcohols by gas chromatography and urines were screened by Bio-Rad's Rapid Emergency Drug Identification (REMEDi) system. Laboratory data from analysis of 132 cases of suicide, including 101 cases of hanging revealed that 83 % were male confirming suicide as a male epidemic. Overall, alcohol was a factor in 57 %, benzodiazepines in 26 %, cannabinoids in 11 %, opioids in 19.7 %, sympathomimetics in 7.5 %, cocaine in 4.5 %, antidepressants 22 %, antipsychotics in 10 %, hypnotics in 5 %, and antihistamines in 4 % of these cases. Screening compounds in cases of hanging and other suicides should extend beyond the narrow focus of alcohol and illicit drugs to include a wide spectrum of psychoactive and other compounds as a standard procedure. The wide range of licit and illicit compounds found in these cases reflects current experience and dictates the necessity for chromatographic screening with mass spectroscopy confirmation in all cases as best practice.

First, individual differences in suicidal behaviour in relation to heritability are presented followed by a brief discussion of genetic methods currently used to investigate candidate genes for the completed suicide. Further along the polygenetic, multi-factorial model of genetic proneness to suicidal behaviour is presented as interplay of genes and environment. Finally, the future implications in this quickly blossoming field of research are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives Research focussing on the impact of suicide bereavement on family members' physical and psychological health is scarce. The aim of this study was to examine how family members have been physically and psychologically affected following suicide bereavement. A secondary objective of the study was to describe the needs of family members bereaved by suicide.
   Design A mixed-methods study was conducted, using qualitative semistructured interviews and additional quantitative self-report measures of depression, anxiety and stress (DASS-21).
   Setting Consecutive suicide cases and next-of-kin were identified by examining coroner's records in Cork City and County, Ireland from October 2014 to May 2016.
   Participants Eighteen family members bereaved by suicide took part in a qualitative interview. They were recruited from the Suicide Support and Information System: A Case-Control Study (SSIS-ACE), where family members bereaved by suicide (n=33) completed structured measures of their well-being.
   Results Qualitative findings indicated three superordinate themes in relation to experiences following suicide bereavement: (1) co-occurrence of grief and health reactions; (2) disparity in supports after suicide and (3) reconstructing life after deceased's suicide. Initial feelings of guilt, blame, shame and anger often manifested in enduring physical, psychological and psychosomatic difficulties. Support needs were diverse and were often related to the availability or absence of informal support by family or friends. Quantitative results indicated that the proportion of respondents above the DASS-21 cut-offs respectively were 24% for depression, 18% for anxiety and 27% for stress.
   Conclusions Healthcare professionals' awareness of the adverse physical and psychosomatic health difficulties experienced by family members bereaved by suicide is essential. Proactively facilitating support for this group could help to reduce the negative health sequelae. The effects of suicide bereavement are wide-ranging, including high levels of stress, depression, anxiety and physical health difficulties.

DT Article
DE Abortion; dignity; Ireland; regulation; risk to life; suicide
ID LAW; HEALTH
AB Abortion is an issue that exposes deep divisions in Irish society and this was apparent during the debates on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013. This introduced a framework regulating abortion into Irish law for the first time, but maintained the existing position where abortion is only available where the life of the woman is at risk. This article focuses on the centrality of suicide within the Irish discourse on abortion and the impact this had on the shape of the legislation ultimately introduced, in particular the inclusion of a more onerous process, which a woman must engage with before she can obtain an abortion where the risk to her life is from suicide. It highlights the practical consequences of this for the small number of very vulnerable women in Ireland who will be required to engage with the new statutory process which is deeply damaging. The 2013 Act reinforces the two-tier approach to healthcare that exists in Ireland in the specific context of reproductive healthcare as those with sufficient resources will be able to bypass the difficult and undignified statutory procedure and those who lack the socioeconomic capital will be compelled to remain.

AB Multifaceted evidence (family. twin, adoption, molecular genetic, geographic, and surname studies of suicide) suggests genetic risk factors for suicide. The migrant study design is also informative in this context, but underused. In particular, immigrant studies of suicide with a continental European host country are unavailable. The correspondence of suicide prevalence among 22 immigrant groups in Austria (1970-2006) with those of the homelands during the same period was analyzed. Immigrant and homeland suicide rates were significantly positively associated. Controls for age of suicide victim, immigrant group size, national pride, and quality of life in the homelands left the finding essentially unchanged. This correspondence of immigrant and country-of-birth suicide rates is consistent with the assumption of population differences in the prevalence of genetic risk factors for suicide, for which there is emerging evidence.

AB Injuries caused by chain saws are mostly seen due to accidents. Suicides by chain saws are rare, but some cases have already been described. We present the case of homicide on a child by a chain saw followed by the suicide of his father. For the homicide and the suicide chain saws of different sizes were used. Fatal injuries in the homicide and suicide were located on the neck. Cause of death in both cases was fatal haemorrhage with blood aspiration respectively decapitation. Normally, in suicide by use of chain saws individuals suffering from schizophrenia, major depression and alcohol or drug dependence are concerned. In the presented case, the background was a litigation of a divorced couple for child custody. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

   beliefs, experiences, and actions
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE

DE euthanasia; general practitioner attitudes; patient attitudes
ID ASSISTED SUICIDE; ATTITUDES; REQUESTS; DOCTORS; DEATH; CARE
AB Background There has been much recent interest in the press and among the profession on the subject of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. The BMA recently conducted a 'consensus conference' over the internet to collect views on physician-assisted suicide. Any surveys to date have addressed a variety of specialties; however, no recent surveys have looked at general practitioner (GP) attitudes and experiences.
   Aim. To explore the attitudes of GPs in Northern Ireland towards the issue of patient requests for euthanasia, their nature, and doctors' experiences of such requests.
   Method An anonymous, confidential postal survey of all (1053) GP principals in Northern ireland.
   Results. Seventy per cent of responders believe that passive euthanasia is both morally and ethically acceptable. Fewer (49%) would be prepared to take part in passive euthanasia. However, over 70% of physicians responding consider physician-assisted suicide and voluntary active euthanasia to be wrong. Thirty per cent of responders have received requests from patients far euthanasia in the past five years. One hundred and seven doctors gave information about these requests. Thirty-nine out of 54 patient requests for passive euthanasia had been complied with, as had one of 19 requests for physician-assisted suicide and four out of 38 patient requests for active euthanasia. Doctors perceived the main reasons why patients sought euthanasia was because of fear of loss of dignify and fear of being a burden to others.
   Conclusions: While the majority of GPs support passive euthanasia, they, in common with those who approve of assisted suicide and active euthanasia, often express a reluctance to take part in such actions This may reflect the moral, legal, and emotional dilemmas doctors encounter when facing end-of-life decisions.

AB Apart from collisions with road or rail vehicles and falls from height, self inflicted blunt force is a rare suicide method and mainly seen in psychiatric patients. The paper presents a rare case of suicide by active blunt force. A 68-year-old man committed suicide by repeatedly hitting his head with a stone. He sustained a craniocerebral trauma and finally died from hypothermia due to the low outdoor temperature. According to the relatives, the man was not diagnosed with a mental disorder or suicidal tendencies. Uncommon manners of self-harm are challenging for those involved in the investigation, and a differentiation between suicide, accident and homicide can only be made in synopsis of all findings.

AB Objectives: To review the most recent information on completed suicide for the general adult psychiatrist.
   Methods: Literature review.
   Results: Suicide is the result of a complex interaction of multiple variables. Prediction is highly dependent on clinical evaluation. Predictive factors identify groups better than individuals. Prevention has both clinical and political implications.
   Conclusions: Reduced access to lethal methods (historically, from barbiturates to modified vehicle exhaust systems and paracetamol), attention to social factors (such as alcohol availability and employment levels) and clinical vigilance, coupled with adequate treatment of psychiatric disorders and close follow-up, should help to reduce suicide rates. Wider cultural issues leg. religion) are poorly understood and require further research.

AB The purpose of the present study was to re-examine the monthly distribution of suicide death rates and the change of the suicide seasonality in Taiwan during 1991-2008. The monthly suicide death rates of the total, male and female populations during January 1991-December 2008 were obtained from a population-based database. There was an upward trend. The means of the monthly suicide rates after adjusting the calendar effect and the upward trend were compared. The suicide data were further analysed in three 6-year periods to explore the change of seasonality. During 1991-2008 in Taiwan, suicide rates had significant peaks in April and May, and nadirs in January and December. The monthly distributions varied during 1991-1996,1997-2002 and 2003-2008 in the patterns and the statistical significance. There was no linear trend for the change of the seasonality of suicide death rate. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Most prospective studies of HPA axis have found that non-suppressors in the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) are more likely to commit suicide during the follow-up. Attempted suicide is a strong clinical predictor of suicide. The aim of this study was to assess the predictive value of DST for suicide in a group of depressed inpatients with and without an index suicide attempt. Historical cohort of 382 psychiatric inpatients with mood disorder admitted to the department of Psychiatry at the Karolinska University Hospital between 1980 and 2000 were submitted to the DST and followed up for causes of death. During the follow-up (mean 18 years), 36 suicides (9.4%) occurred, 20 of these were non-suppressors and 16 were suppressors. There was no statistically significant difference in suicide risk between the suppressors and non-suppressors for the sample as a whole. An index suicide attempt predicted suicide. In suicide attempters with mood disorder, the non-suppressor status was significantly associated with suicide indicating that HPA axis hyperactivity is a risk factor for suicide in this group. The dexamethasone suppression test may be a useful predictor within this population. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To compare suicide registration in eight European countries and provide recommendations for quality improvement.
   Method: Qualitative data were collected from country experts using a structured questionnaire.
   Results: Suicide registration was based on the medico-legal system in six countries and the coronial system in two. Differences not only between, but also within these two systems emerged. Several elements crucial to the consistency of suicide registration were identified.
   Conclusion: A precise model for recording suicides should include: an accurate legal inquiry and clarification of suicidal intent; obligatory forensic autopsy for injury deaths; reciprocal communication among authorities; electronic data transmission; final decision-makers' access to information; trained coders.

Using country-specific data, this study describes and compares the incidence and patterns of homicide-suicide as well as the relationship between homicide-suicide, homicide, suicide and domestic homicide in the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United States. The results indicate that cross-nationally, homicide-suicides are more likely than other types of lethal violence to involve a female victim, multiple victims, take place in a residential setting and to be committed by a firearm. Although homicide-suicides display many similarities across the different countries, differences exist regarding age and the use of firearms in the offence. This study indicates that homicides followed by suicides differ from both homicides and suicides in similar ways internationally. Cross-national differences in the availability of firearms may explain the international variation of homicide-suicide rates and patterns. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective
   Information on factors associated with suicide among young individuals in Ireland is limited. The aim of this study was to identify socio-demographic characteristics and circumstances of death associated with age among individuals who died by suicide.
   Methods
   The study examined 121 consecutive suicides (2007-2012) occurring in the southern eastern part of Ireland (Cork city and county). Data were obtained from coroners, family informants, and health care professionals. A comparison was made between 15-24-year-old and 25-34-year-old individuals. Socio-demographic characteristics of the deceased, methods of suicide, history of alcohol and drug abuse, and findings from toxicological analysis of blood and urine samples taken at post mortem were included. Pearson's chi(2) tests and binary logistic regression analysis were performed.
   Results
   Alcohol and/or drugs were detected through toxicological analysis for the majority of the total sample (79.5%), which did not differentiate between 15-24-year-old and 25-34-year-old individuals (74.1% and 86.2% respectively). Compared to 25-34-year-old individuals, 15-24-year-old individuals were more likely to engage in suicide by hanging (88.5%). Younger individuals were less likely to die by intentional drug overdose and carbon monoxide poisoning compared to older individuals. Younger individuals who died between Saturday and Monday were more likely to have had alcohol before dying. Substance abuse histories were similar in the two age groups.
   Conclusion
   Based on this research it is recommended that strategies to reduce substance abuse be applied among 25-34-year-old individuals at risk of suicide. The wide use of hanging in young people should be taken into consideration for future means restriction strategies.

AB Schizotypy has been linked to suicide risk, but it is not known whether established suicide-related risk factors mediate this relation. The aim of this study was to assess the mediating effects of depressive symptoms, social anxiety, self-esteem, and intimate disclosure in peer relationships in the relation between interpersonal schizotypy and suicide ideation or lifetime suicide attempts. This aim was tested in 590 young adults using a nonparametric bootstrapping procedure. After inclusion of the mediators, interpersonal schizotypy was no longer directly associated with either suicide ideation or lifetime suicide attempts. Depression and self-esteem mediated the relation between interpersonal schizotypy and suicide ideation. No variables mediated the relation between interpersonal schizotypy and lifetime suicide attempts, and there were no significant direct relations when mediators were included. Schizotypy appears to be a distal risk factor for suicidal behavior; assessing depressive symptoms and self-esteem may provide more proximal information about suicide risk, and may be targets for mitigating suicide risk in individuals with schizotypy.

AB In order to best tailor suicide prevention initiatives and programs, it is critical to gain an understanding of how service members' suicide risk factors may differ by gender. We aimed to better understand gender differences in suicide and suicide attempts among soldiers, including demographic, military, mental health, and other risk factors. We also examined risk factors uniquely associated with suicide and suicide attempts. We conducted a retrospective study of 1857 US Army soldiers who died by suicide or attempted suicide between 2008 and 2010 and had a Department of Defense Suicide Event Report. Female and male soldiers had more similarities than differences when examining risk factors associated with suicide. The only gender difference approaching significance was workplace difficulties, which was more strongly associated with suicide for female soldiers, compared to their male counterparts. Among suicide decedents, the most common risk factor was having a failed intimate relationship in the 90 days prior to suicide. Among those who attempted suicide, the most common risk factor was a major psychiatric diagnosis. Better understanding both gender differences and risk factors uniquely associated with suicide has critical prevention and public health implications as we work to better understand preventable mortality in our youngest generation of service members.

AB The aim of the present study was to test whether the seasonal distribution of suicides differed between atopic and non-atopic Suicide victims. A cross-sectional comparison of the semi-annual and seasonal distribution of suicides was made by using a 13-year database of all suicides (1296 males, 289 females) committed during the years 1988-2000 in the province of Oulu in Northern Finland. During the first half of the year, the proportion of suicides among atopic patients was significantly higher than that linked with non-atopic patients. Of all atopic patients, 72% committed suicide during the first and 28% during the second half of the year. Suicides among victims without any atopic disorders followed a uniform seasonal distribution throughout the year (50 vs. 50%). The exacerbation of an atopic disorder may increase the risk of suicide in spring; something that should be taken note of in clinical work. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Military sexual trauma is a strong predictor of psychiatric disorders and negative health outcomes among military personnel and veterans, but little is known about its relationship with suicide risk. The current study investigates the association of military sexual trauma with suicide risk among 464 U.S. military personnel and veterans enrolled in college classes. Results indicate that premilitary sexual assault was associated with significantly increased risk for later suicide ideation, plans, and attempts during military service. Unwanted sexual experiences occurring during military service was associated with significantly increased risk for suicide ideation and suicide plans for male participants. When considered simultaneously, premilitary sexual trauma showed relatively stronger associations with suicide risk among women whereas military sexual trauma showed relatively stronger associations with suicide risk among men. Results suggest differences in the relation of sexual trauma to suicide risk among male and female military personnel and veterans. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Foreign body ingestion frequently occurs accidentally in the paediatric population as well as intentionally in prisoners to achieve hospitalisation, but is relatively uncommon in forensic cases and extremely rare as a method of inducing death in complex suicide. The reasons for this infrequency are many, not least the slowness of action and the lack of effectiveness in terms of lethality, regardless of the object used.
   In this article, we show an unplanned complex suicide carried out by ingestion of four plastic knives before hanging. Other complex suicides involving foreign body ingestion reported in the forensic literature are reviewed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Among the few cases of suicidal self-incineration primary or secondary complex suicides are a rarity. Accordingly the number of reports on this subject in the forensic literature is small. In a retrospective analysis of the Freiburg and Berlin autopsy material, four cases were found within an observation period of I I years. These are described together with seven other cases reported in the literature. Altogether most of these suicides are primary combinations, especially with falls from a height. Other combinations include hanging or the infliction of stabs, cuts or gunshot injuries. The sex and age distribution is similar to that found for suicide by self-incineration alone.

AB Suicide by self-poisoning is rather common around the world. This paper presents an exceptional complex suicide in which nicotine was applied in the form of self-made patches soaked with an extraction from fine-cut tobacco. In addition, the 51-year-old suicide victim took a lethal dose of diphenhydramine. Toxicological analysis also revealed the presence of tetrazepam in subtherapeutic concentrations. The scene of death suggested an autoerotic accident at first, as the body was tied with tapes, cables and handcuffs. As a result of the entire investigations, the fatality had to be classified as a suicidal intoxication by nicotine and diphenhydramine. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In order to identify clues to forensic pathologist's classification of suicide, the forensic files of 100 consecutive cases of suicide, and 22 cases of undetermined manner of death, were analysed. Some specific causes of death, suicidal communication and other circumstantial evidence Suggesting suicidal intent explained all but three classifications. Problematic cases concerned death by poisoning and by submersion, alcohol-dependent persons and subjects with positive blood alcohol concentration at autopsy. Guidelines to support the police investigation as well as the medico-legal examination can probably reduce the number of undetermined cases in cases of possible suicide.

A survey (N=120) demonstrated that fear of death is associated with stronger negative attitudes toward BPD patients, after controlling for attitudes toward suicide. Our findings emphasize the importance of psychiatrists' awareness to their fear of death as a relevant factor for their emotions toward BPD patients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Previous studies have found that rates of suicide have a distinct annual rhythm with a peak in spring. Two recent European studies, however, have found that the amplitude of this rhythm has decreased over time. The purpose of this study was to examine whether such effects are found in Australia. Australian Bureau of Statistics data on all suicides in Australia 1970-1999 were analysed by spectral analysis. We found that suicide, violent suicide and suicide by males are seasonal and that the seasonal amplitude has increased over time. Males who use violent methods determine the seasonal effect. These results support previous findings that suicide and particularly violent suicide have a characteristic seasonal rhythm. However, the progressive increase in the amplitude of this rhythm over time in Australia is in direct contrast to other European findings. We suggest that this may be related to differences in patterns of anti-depressant use and also the effect of migration on the number of seasonally vulnerable individuals in Australia.

AB Understanding the spatial distribution of suicide can inform the planning, implementation and evaluation of suicide prevention actions. No previous study has assessed spatial clustering of the different methods of suicide in Quebec. The aim of this study was to assess spatial clustering of suicide in Quebec between 2004 and 2007 and neighborhood level predictors of the clusters. Scan statistics was applied to detect clusters of suicides by method and by sex. Smoothed standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for suicide for each neighborhood were also estimated and their association with neighborhood characteristics was investigated using the Bayesian hierarchical spatial model. The pattern of suicide rate was different among men and women; men showed higher standardized mortality rates. The most likely clusters of suicide were found in remote rural areas. However, some neighborhoods in urban areas also had noticeable suicide clusters. Firearms suicide was most likely found in remote rural areas while poisoning and hanging suicide methods clustered in urban areas. These findings suggest that it is important to take geographical variations into account in national policy and health services planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The number of suicides in South Korea totaled 4840 in 1995 and 8569 in 1998; in Japan, suicides totaled 21,420 in 1995 and 31,755 in 1998. Suicide prevention is an important issue for both South Korea and Japan. In South Korea, factors related to the increase in suicides must be clarified, and specific suicide prevention measures must be promptly discussed in order to decrease the number of suicides. Therefore, this report examined suicide and unemployment rates and increased rates of mining and industrial production and of money supply in South Korea from 1990 to 2002. This report also discusses the relationships between suicide and unemployment rates and increased rates of mining and industrial production and increased rates of money supply during the same period.
   During the period studied, annual suicide rates ranged from 7.1 to 18.3 per 100,000 populations. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the suicide rate was clearly related to the unemployment rate, but the suicide rate was not related to increased rates of mining and industrial production and increased rates of money supply. Thus, when unemployment rates increase, relevant organizations and the community should pay close attention to the increase in suicide rates. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is emerging evidence that asthma and atopy may be associated with a higher risk of suicide. We investigated the association of asthma and atopy with mortality from suicide (n=32) in the Glasgow Alumni cohort, adjusting for the key confounders of socioeconomic position and smoking. We found no evidence of an association in our a priori atopy phenotypes with suicide, and there were insufficient suicides in the asthma phenotypes to draw any conclusions. In additional analyses, individuals reporting both eczema-urticaria and hay fever and those with family history of atopy were at higher risk of suicide. As these were secondary analyses and based on small numbers of events we cannot rule out chance findings. The lack of evidence in our main hypothesis may be due to the small number of suicides or reported associations between asthma and atopy may be confounded. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB Cigarette smoking is associated with a higher risk for suicide. The present study was conducted on the hypothesis that suicide smokers show higher nicotine and cotinine levels in blood and urine than non-suicide smokers. We determined nicotine and cotinine levels in blood and urine of 87 deceased individuals (18 suicides and 69 non-suicides) by gas chromatography. The smoking rate was 77.8% for individuals who committed suicide and 42.0% for those who did not commit suicide. Average nicotine and cotinine levels in blood were significantly higher in the suicide smokers than in the non-suicide smokers (nicotine: 93.2 +/- 46.6 ng/ml versus 25.8 +/- 14.4 ng/ml, p < 0.0001 and cotinine: 378 +/- 235 ng/ml versus 201 +/- 137 ng/ml, p < 0.005). Average levels of urinary nicotine and cotinine were also significantly higher in the suicide smokers than in the non-suicide smokers (nicotine: 1980 +/- 2210 ng/ml versus 394 +/- 376 ng/ml, p < 0.005 and cotinine: 1170 +/- 1330 ng/ml versus 414 290 ng/ml, p < 0.05). Twenty-six decedents were intoxicated with alcohol, and they included 7 suicides (7 smokers) and 19 non-suicides (15 smokers). Our data suggest that cigarette smokers who commit suicide smoke more heavily than other cigarette smokers. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide is a complex behaviour. Genetic and environmental factors are implicated in suicide. Both factors require genes to exert their effects. One gene hypothesized to be involved in the pathophysiology of suicide is cholecystokinin. Alterations in cholecystokinin receptor binding have been reported to be significant in young suicide victims as compared to matched controls in the frontal and cingulate cortex. In this study we report the Cholecystokinin-B gene expression using RT-PCR, between suicide completers [(N = 10); mean age 37.2 +/- 12 years] and control subjects [(N = 10); mean age 37.6 +/- 11.9 years]. Cholecystokinin-B gene expression was significantly higher in the cerebellum (P = 0.006), cingulate gyrus (P = 0.024) and pre-frontal cortex (P = 0.017) of suicide completers when compared to their age and sex-matched controls.

AB Suicide preceded by homicide is a rare but tragic event that often shocks the whole community. Annual rates show considerable variation, though not as great as the incidence of homicides. Within the industrialized nations, Finland's prevalence rates for homicide-suicide have been mid-range. The National Suicide Prevention Project recorded and carefully analysed all suicides committed in Finland during a 12-month period. In this material of almost 1400 suicides, 10 verified homicide-suicide cases were found. The perpetrator was male in all but one case, and all the victims were family, 9/10 being spouses and/or children. The most typical homicide-suicide seemed to be a man shooting a family member during a separation process. No perpetrator was found suffering from a psychotic disorder but three had major depression. The homicide-suicides were compared with the suicides and statistically significant differences emerged in two variables: shooting was more often the method used in the homicide-suicide cases, which, furthermore, were more likely to involve a divorce or recent rupture in another long-term intimate relationship. Sharing few common variables with either homicide or suicide, homicide-suicide appears to be a distinct phenomenon whose prevention would seem to be extremely difficult on the individual level. Since shooting is the most common method of homicide-suicide, firearm licenses should be more restricted. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In 2006, 67 persons were killed in aircraft accidents in Germany and involving German aircrafts abroad. In spite of extensive investigation of each aircraft accident, there are no reliable data as to the number of suicides by aircraft. We report on a 50-year-old man who committed suicide by willfully crashing his Beech "Sierra" aircraft minutes after take off from an airport close to the town of Rendsburg, Germany. Before killing himself, the intoxicated pilot had sent an SMS announcing his suicide plans to a friend. The findings of the medico-legal investigation and the results of a review of aircraft accident reports by the German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Investigation (BFU) regarding suicidal plane crashes are presented.

AB Homicide-suicides, the murder of one or several individuals followed by the suicide of the perpetrator, are rare but have devastating effects on families and communities. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing perpetrators of homicide-suicides with perpetrators of simple homicides and suicides and examined the proportion of firearm use and its correlation with firearm availability. We searched Medline and Embase from inception to July 2012 and identified 27 eligible studies. Perpetrators of homicide-suicides were older and more likely to be male and married to or separated from their victims than perpetrator of simple homicides or suicides. Influence of alcohol and a history of domestic violence or unemployment were less prevalent in homicide-suicides than in homicides. The proportion of firearm use in homicide-suicides varied across countries and was highest in the USA, Switzerland and South Africa, followed by Australia, Canada, The Netherlands and England and Wales, with a strong correlation between the use of firearms and the level of civilian gun ownership in the country. Our results indicate that homicide-suicides represent a distinct entity, with characteristics distinguishing them both from homicides and suicides. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Few studies have investigated suicide risk characteristics associated with interrupted and aborted suicide attempts. The present study aimed to empirically examine whether assessing a history of interrupted and aborted suicide attempts is valuable when assessing suicide risk, given the relative lack of literature in this area to date. To inform this question, the current study examined differences in risk factors for suicidal behavior among individuals who have carried out a suicide attempt, individuals who report having a history of only interrupted and/or aborted suicide attempts, and non-attempter controls. Approximately 447 undergraduates (M=21.10 years; SD=4.16; 77.6% female) completed measures of carried out suicide attempts, interrupted suicide attempts, aborted suicide attempts, acquired capability for suicide, suicide likelihood, depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and non -suicidal self-injury. Results suggest that a faction of individuals endorse interrupted and/or aborted suicide attempts (8.7%), but do not endorse carried out suicide attempts, even in non -clinical samples. Furthermore, results suggest that there are few clinically meaningful differences between those with a history of carried out suicide attempts and interrupted/aborted suicide attempts, suggesting that individuals with a history of these lesser studied suicidal behaviors are an important group to target for suicide risk intervention.

AB Although suicide in cancer patients is a burdening public health problem with ethical, medical and psychiatric implications, it still has to be clarified why cancer patients commit suicide and how cancer suicides differ from others. Therefore, a review of the literature on suicide and suicidal ideation in cancer patients was conducted, starting from an overview of these issues in the general population. Evidence suggests that suicidality in the general population can be explained according to a genetic and psychological vulnerability to stress. The psychological and physical stressors found to be associated with suicide in cancer patients corroborate this model. Nevertheless, based on the well-described immunological disturbances due to cancer, we propose that suicide is not just a secondary reaction to cancer but is linked to an intrinsic bio-psychological vulnerability to distress. Upcoming studies should better characterize the neurobiology of suicidality in cancer, opening new avenues for treatment and prevention. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Two studies have shown that increasing the consultation of the word "suicide" in the Google search engine was associated with a subsequent increase in the prevalence of suicide attempts. The main goal of this article was to explore the trends generated by a key-word search associated with suicide, depression and bipolarity in an attempt to identify general trends (disorders epidemics in the population/"real events" vs newsworthy advertisement/"media event"). Based on previous studies, the frequency of the search words "how to suicide" and "commit suicide" were analyzed for suicide, as well as "depression" (for depressive disorders) and "bipolar disorder". Together, these analyses suggest that the search for the words "how to suicide" or "commit suicide" on the Google search engine may be a good indicator for suicide prevention policies. However, the tool is not developed enough to date to be used as a real time dynamic indicator of suicide epidemics. The frequency of the search for the word "suicide" was associated with those for "depression" but not for "bipolar disorder", but searches for psychiatric conditions seem to be influenced by media events more than by real events in the general population.

AB Analyzing data from the Institute of Forensic Medicine (IFM) in Rijeka, a total of 853 suicides were recorded in a 15 years period (1986-2000). Quantitative and qualitative features of suicides were analyzed in three intervals: pre-wartime, wartime and post-wartime. In the wartime period (1991-1995), the suicide rate increased by 20.9% in comparison with the pre-war period. In the post-wartime period, the suicide rate dropped by 26.2% in comparison with the war period. The results show a significant increase in suicide rates in the wartime. During the wartime period, a large number of suicide victims under the age of forty increased-45.3% in comparison with the pre-war period and 56.6% in comparison with the post-war period. The use of firearms as a means of committing suicide quadrupled during the war in comparison with the pre-war period. The level of alcohol intoxication of perpetrators at the moment of suicide significantly increased in the wartime period. War had a direct impact on quantitative and qualitative characteristics of suicides in Croatia. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Childhood physical abuse (CPA) has numerous short and long-term negative effects. One of the most serious consequences of CPA is an increased risk for suicide attempts. Clarifying the mechanisms by which CPA increases risk for suicidal behavior may enhance preventive interventions. One potential mechanism is a tendency toward aggression. In a sample of 266 criminal offenders, ages 18-62, we examined the relationships among CPA, lifetime aggression, and suicide attempts and tested lifetime history of aggression as a mediator of the relationship between CPA and suicide attempts. Results indicated that CPA and aggression were associated with suicide attempts. Consistent with our hypothesis, lifetime aggression mediated the CPA and suicide attempts relationship. Findings suggest that aggression may be an important mediator of the relationship between CPA and suicide attempts among criminal offenders, and are consistent with the possibility that treating aggression may reduce risk for suicide attempts.

AB Since Durkheim pioneering study, official suicide statistics have been suspected of underreporting the true suicide rate. A majority of researchers asserts that mistakes are minimal and not systematic while a minority claims that suicide statistics are systematically biased. Lingering uncertainties about suicide rate accuracy call into question the claims of scholarship and the efficacy of prevention programs. From the perspective of the sociology of professions, the critique of suicide accuracy challenges the professional authority of death investigators. Ethnographic observations show that medical examiners tend to underclassify suicides because the suicide classification requires positive proof of suicidal intent and because false negatives do not challenge the authority of medical examiners as much as false positives. Sufficient proof for suicide results from medical examiners' privileging of pathological evidence, the legal threshold to interpret evidence, and close relationships with law enforcement and clinicians. The same professional characteristics that safeguard forensic authority result in suicide underreporting: medical examiners protect their authority by determining suicide conservatively. Relatives acting to avoid the stigma of suicide and public health officials concerned with underreporting have a marginal influence on suicide determinations. This article contributes to the sociology of professions literature by analyzing how a professional group maintains authority in spite of profound criticism from outside parties.

ID SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; GENDER; ACCESS
AB Objectives: In keeping with international public health policy development, suicide prevention in Australia has received increasing attention. The mid to late 1990s saw the introduction of a range of co-ordinated national prevention programmes. Since 1997. suicides have decreased, but the comparative rates of decline for males and females have not been well studied at the national level.
   Methods: Standardised suicide rates were calculated for males and females, using data from 1997 to 2005. Linear models (ordinary least squares) were used to calculate rates of decline, with trends compared for males and females.
   Results: Male suicides appear to have fallen more rapidly than female suicides.
   Conclusions: Australian males, an 'at risk' demographic. appear to be experiencing benefits from the existence of current national suicide prevention strategies and related social changes. It is recommended that greater consideration be given to researching risk factors such as intimate partner violence, sexual abuse, and substance dependence, for Australian female suicide.

SO IRISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective: The aim of this exploratory study was to investigate the extent of suicide ideation, psychological maladjustment and views of mental health service support in a sample of secondary school pupils.
   Method: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on a purposive sample of participants (n=93) recruited from a secondary school located in the south east of Ireland. Participants completed a Background Information Questionnaire (BIQ); the Suicide Ideation Questionnaire (SIQ); and the Reynolds Adolescence Adjustment Screening Inventory (RAASI).
   Results: Approximately ten percent of participants displayed high levels of suicide ideation whilst one third reported having previously had suicidal thoughts; one quarter reported psychological adjustment difficulties, although these varied by age and sex. Participants' drug use and their levels of parental closeness were both individual factors that significantly predicted both suicide ideation and psychological adjustment. Females reported higher levels of parental closeness than males. Forty percent of respondents rated mental health support services as insufficient to meet their needs.
   Conclusion: The findings raise serious concerns about the extent of suicidal thoughts amongst young people in Ireland; they also highlight a potentially important role for parents in this regard. Further research should ascertain national prevalence rates whilst appropriate school-based mental health education/promotion and support services should also be implemented.

AB To understand medication use prior to suicide in relation to patterns, polypharmacy, and adherence. A total of 1,371 suicide cases were coded and latent class analysis used to identify combinations of medications prescribed prior to death. Two thirds had been prescribed medication with 30.7% prescribed 3 or more. Latent class analysis revealed three classes: Mixed medication use, primarily mental medication use, and baseline/low medication use. There are potentially high rates of medication non-adherence. Not only medication use but also non-adherence rates were high in this sample of individuals who died by suicide. Potential implications and areas for future research are discussed.

AB Estrogen is thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of depression and suicidal behaviors. We studied gene variants of estrogen receptor alpha (rs827421, rs1913474, rs1801132, rs722207, rs974276 and rs910416) in 167 German suicide attempters (affective spectrum n=107, schizophrenia spectrum n=35, borderline personality disorder n=25), 92 German individuals who committed suicide and 312 German healthy subjects. Single markers and haplotype analysis in relation to suicidal behaviors (suicide attempters/completers) did not reveal any significant association. These were also not associated with related features, such as violence or impulsivity of suicide attempt, State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI) and Questionnaire for Measuring Factors of Aggression (FAF) scores. In conclusion, our study does not support the hypothesis that estrogen receptor alpha gene variants are major contributors to suicide or to anger- or aggression-related behaviors.

AB The phenomenon of suicide represents a complex problem, the specific aspects of which should be examined by a multifactorial analysis, particularly in the elderly subjects. Although the research on risk factors continues to grow, only a limited knowledge is available on the biological changes increasing the risk for suicide. Similarly, limited information is at our disposal about the contributing psychosocial processes extending beyond the demographic factors. Although the best explored population is the elderly using primary care services, no proven interventions are known for the time being, although some efforts to test certain approaches reaching these older adults are under way. Apparently even more, continued efforts are needed to change the attitudes toward the mental illnesses and their treatments in general, in order to reach the older adults who are still outside of the health care services.

AB The aim of the study was to further describe the characteristics of drug-dependent patients who attempt suicide. Thus, 449 drug-dependent patients were interviewed about whether or not they had ever attempted suicide and about their family history of suicidal behavior. Patients completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, and were interviewed with the Addiction Severity Index (ASI). It was found that patients who had attempted suicide (N= 175) were significantly younger than patients who had never attempted suicide (N= 274). Significantly more of the patients who had attempted suicide were female; had a family history of suicide; and had a lifetime history of major depression, of having received antidepressant medication, and of alcoholism. Also, patients who had attempted suicide had significantly higher scores for childhood trauma, psychoticism, neuroticism and introversion, as well as higher ASI psychiatric composite scores. These results suggest that social, personality, family. developmental and psychiatric risk factors may predispose to suicidal behavior in drug-dependent individuals. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Complex suicide is usually defined as the application of more than one killing mechanism to ensure a fatal outcome. Herein we report an unusual case of a planned complex suicide of a 20 year old-male combining gunshot with coincidental intentional vehicular crash. The case was initially assumed to be a simple traffic accident until a rimfire pistol was found in close proximity to the deceased as well as gunshot wound of the head. This paper demonstrates the importance of careful inspection of the death scene, as well as the complex performance of autopsy examination to explain the manner of death and distinguish accidental deaths from suicides in such cases. Nevertheless, this assessment might by very difficult or even impossible. It has to be assumed that a high number of suicides in road traffic remain undetected. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB This study investigates recent (one-month) and lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts, and factors associated with one-month suicide attempts among heroin users (n = 488) seeking treatment at a methadone maintenance programme in Taiwan. Data were collected by structured interview on demographics, use of heroin and other substances, criminal convictions, depression, social networks, and history of suicide attempt (lifetime suicide attempt, and suicide attempt and suicide ideation in the previous month). Prevalence of recent (one-month) suicide attempt was 10.9% and lifetime prevalence was 17.8%. The finding that so many heroin users had made a suicide attempt in the very recent past is both disturbing and little researched. Recent suicidal attempts were associated with severity of heroin dependence, needle sharing, higher educational level, increased levels of depression, and number of stressful life events. It is suggested that methadone maintenance programmes should routinely screen at intake for previous suicidal behaviour and especially for recent suicidal attempts. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Substantial evidence from family, twin, and adoption studies corroborates implication of genetic and environmental factors, as well as their interactions, on suicidal behavior and alcoholism risk. Serotonergic disfunction seems to be involved in the pathophysiology of substance abuse, and has also an important role in suicidal behavior. Recent studies of the tryptophan hydroxylase 2 showed mild or no association with suicide and alcohol-related suicide. We performed SNP and alcohol analysis on 388 suicide victims and 227 controls. The results showed association between suicide (P(chi(2)) = 0.043) and alcohol-related suicide (P(chi(2)) = 0.021) for SNP Rs1843809. A tendency for association was determined also for polymorphism Rs1386493 (P(chi(2)) = 0.055) and alcohol-related suicide. Data acquired from psychological autopsies in a subsample of suicide victims (n = 79) determined more impulsive behavior (P(chi(2)) = 0.016) and verbal aggressive behavior (P(chi(2)) = 0.025) in the subgroup with alcohol misuse or dependency. In conclusion, our results suggest implication of polymorphisms in suicide and alcohol-related suicide, but further studies are needed to clarify the interplay among serotonergic system disfunction, suicide, alcohol dependence, impulsivity and the role of TPH2 enzyme.

AB Despite rapid increase of suicide by charcoal burning within 5 years, little is known about the characteristics of charcoal burning suicide in Korea. This study aimed to examine the trends and risk factors in the spread of suicide using this method. We identified an association between media reporting of suicide by charcoal burning and its incidence. Data on suicide from 2007 to 2011 were obtained from the Korean National Statistical Office. Cross-correlation analysis was used. Increasing incidence of suicide by charcoal burning was correlated with higher education levels, male sex, and the latter half of the year. Victims of charcoal burning suicide were more likely to be young, male, single, highly educated, professional, urban-based, and to die between October and December. Internet reports of suicide via charcoal burning tended to precede the increased incidence of suicide using this method, but only during the early period of the suicide epidemic. Our findings suggest that one episode of heavy media coverage of a novel method, such as charcoal burning, is sufficient to increase the prevalence of suicide by that method even after media coverage decreases. These findings are expected to contribute to the prevention of increasing rates of suicide by charcoal burning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Research to date would suggest the possible involvement of the serotonin (5-HT) system in the pathophysiology of suicide. With this study, we aimed to investigate the platelet 5-HT transporter, by means of the specific binding of tritiated paroxetine ([H-3]Par), in a sample of 20 suicide attempters recruited at a first-aid service, as compared with healthy control subjects and psychiatric patients with no current or previous history of suicide attempt. The results, showing a decreased number of [H-3]Par binding sites in suicide attempters, would suggest the involvement of the presynaptic 5-HT transporter in self-aggressive behavior.

AB This study compared demographical and clinical variables between first and multiple suicide attempters and investigated risk and protective factors predicting multiple attempts. 228 patients visiting emergency department after attempting suicide were divided into two groups: first attempter (n=148, 64.9%) and multiple attempter (n=80, 35.1%). Demographic variables, clinical characteristics, factors related with suicide behavior, and psychiatric resources between two groups were compared. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate risk and protective factors predicting multiple attempts. The results showed that multiple attempters were younger, not married, more severe in psychopathology (e.g., psychiatric disorder, personality disorder, lower function, and suicide family history) and suicidality (e.g., repetitive/severe/continuous suicide ideation), and lower in psychiatric resources (e.g., interpersonal stress/conflict, conflicting interpersonal relationship, socially isolated, lower personal achievement, and lower ability to control emotion) than first attempters. Suicide ideation severity and conflicting interpersonal relationships predicted multiple suicide attempts, whereas past year's highest global functioning score and age over 45 protected against multiple suicide attempts. This study demonstrated that multiple suicide attempters have more severe clinical profile than first suicide attempters. Moreover, decreasing severity of suicide ideation, improving interpersonal relationships, and enhancing functioning level of suicide attempters might be important in preventing them from re-attempting suicide.

AB Background In order to achieve the national target of 20% reduction in suicide in the UK, many primary care trusts have developed local suicide prevention action plans. However, there is concern about a lack of a whole-system approach in some localities. Suicide surveys are a necessary component of any suicide reduction strategy.
   Methods All deaths by suicides and open verdicts of a multi-ethnic, socio-economically diverse London Borough's residents between February 2005 and February 2008 were identified (n = 54). Health records of the identified subjects were analysed by two researchers.
   Results The annual rate of suicide in the study period was 6.8 per 100 000 inhabitants. Of the 54 cases of suicide in the study period, 45% had a psychiatric diagnosis and 18% were in current contact with mental health services. Hanging was the most frequent mode of suicide. Twenty-four per cent were not registered with a GP, most of whom were immigrants. Twenty-five per cent had seen their GP within a month of suicide. The rate of suicide in those born in Ireland was 17.7 per 100 000.
   Conclusions Suicide survey is a feasible method of monitoring suicide, sharing data between key stakeholders and learning from the trends uncovered.

AB A 68-year-old non-diabetic physician with a known psychiatric history was found dead in his home. The death scene investigation revealed three used insulin syringes on the coffee table next to the body. The autopsy and the consecutive chemical-toxicological investigation revealed that the deceased committed suicide by injecting an overdose of insulin in combination with a high therapeutic oral bolus application of a beta-blocker (Metoprolol). A surprising morphological finding was a terminal pulmonary thrombembolism in the right pulmonary artery. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The purpose of the present study was to compare clinical characteristics of suicide attempters with or without personality disorders.
   Method: A systematic sample (n = 114) of patients from consecutive cases of attempted suicide referred to general hospitals in Helsinki was interviewed and diagnosed according to DSM-III-R. Forty-six subjects with DSM-III-R personality disorders were identified and divided into clusters A (n = 4), B (n = 34) and C (n = 8). These subjects were compared with 65 suicide attempters without personality disorders in terms of clinical characteristics and treatment received.
   Results: Suicide attempters with personality disorders more often had a history of previous suicide attempts and lifetime psychiatric treatment than comparison subjects. However, suicide attempts did not differ in terms of suicide intent, hopelessness, lethality or impulsiveness between subjects with or without personality disorders.
   Conclusion: Although suicidal behaviour is a more persistent feature among those with personality disorders, their clinical characteristics at the time of a suicide attempt may not differ from those without personality disorders'.

AB This article provides a brief overview of the rationales, possible mechanisms and epidemiological data on the association of smoking, smoking cessation and cessation medications with suicide. Current smoking is reliably associated with suicide both in case-control and cohort studies. The three most plausible (but relatively untested) explanations for the association are that smokers have pre-existing conditions that increase their risk for suicide, smoking causes painful and debilitating conditions that might lead to suicide, and smoking decreases serotonin and monoamine oxidase levels. Stopping smoking appears to lead to major depression in some smokers; thus, it could induce Suicide; however, smoking cessation has not been associated with suicide in the few studies available. Regulatory agencies have stated bupropion, rimonabant and varenicline appear to be associated with suicide; however, the data for these statements have not been presented in sufficient detail to assess their validity. Most prior data have come from post hoc analyses. Studies that a priori focus on understanding smoking and suicide are now needed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Homicide-suicide is an event in which the murderer commits suicide after the homicide. There are at least 14 epidemiological studies on the topic, and all have found that homicide-suicide is more common among family members. The murderers are most often males and the victims females. There is no recent research on this phenomenon in Italy. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the incidence of homicide-suicide in Italy over a period of 24 yrs and to compare Italian data with published international data. We used information gathered by press agencies and from the four major Italian newspapers. Between 1985 and 2008, 662 cases of homicide-suicide were identified, with 1776 deaths. The murderer was male in 84.6% of the cases, typically using a firearm. The most common motivation was romantic jealousy, followed by socio-economic stress. The rate of homicide-suicide was 0.04%. Comparison with international studies is not always possible due to the lack of information for certain categories. The common factors identified may be helpful for prevention.

AB Epigenetics involves functional modifications of genes. The aim of this paper is to explore if an association exists between epigenetics and depression and/or suicide. MedLine/PubMed searches were performed using both Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) and Non-MeSH terms. Based on pre-specified terms and inclusion criteria, sixteen studies met inclusion criteria by the 3 independent reviewers. Epigenetic changes seem to be important in both depression and suicide. All of the studies reviewed herein found significant epigenetic changes associated with depression and suicide except for two. Several studies showed that hypermethylation of BDNF is involved in suicide. TrkB hypermethylation was also shown to be associated with suicide by several studies, specifically in Brodmann's Areas (BA) 8 and 9. Future research is needed in a larger sample to further characterize these changes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Suicides in prisons are common. There is a pressing need to understand more about the causes and prevention of prisoner suicides. A particularly informative approach is through studying survivors of near-lethal suicide attempts. However, the extent to which this approach is a good proxy for completed suicide requires verification. In this article we aimed to assess (1) the extent to which male and female prisoners who made near-lethal suicide attempts in prison are similar to prisoners who die by suicide; (2) the suicidal intent of those making near-lethal suicide attempts; and (3) the applicability of the Suicide Intent Scale in prisons. Survivors of near-lethal suicide attempts and prisoners who died by suicide were compared on sociodemographic and criminological characteristics. The suicidal intent of prisoners engaging in near-lethal self-harm was assessed using Beck's Suicide Intent Scale. There were no significant differences when the sociodemographic and criminological profiles of prisoners who made near-lethal suicide attempts and those who died by suicide were compared, except that male prisoners who made near-lethal suicide attempts were somewhat younger. Most prisoners carrying out near-lethal acts had high suicidal intent. However, some questions in the Suicide Intent Scale were inappropriate for assessing intent in prisoners. Prisoners who survive near-lethal self-harm would appear to be a valid proxy for those who die by suicide in prison. The Suicide Intent Scale requires some modifications for use in prisons.

AB The proportion of suicide attempts ending up in the death of the attempter was used in past studies as an index of suicide lethality, or case fatality. This study aimed at investigating whether case fatality of suicide has decreased in Italy over the latest 25 years using available data, as an alternative hypothesis to the proposed general decrease in suicidal behavior resulting from better identification and treatment of people with mental disorders. The official data on completed and attempted suicides by males and females in Italy, from 1983 to 2007, were analyzed with joinpoint regression analysis, to identify the points (i.e., "join-points") where linear trends changed significantly in direction or magnitude. It should be noted that only the most severe suicide attempts are recorded in Italian official statistics. Suicide rates decreased in both sexes, particularly from 1990 onward. Attempted suicide rates increased progressively in males, while in females they reached their peak in 1996-1998 and then decreased. In both sexes suicide case fatalities significantly decreased from 1990 onward. Improved survival after a suicide act is probably the main reason behind this favorable trend. The spreading of emergency services may prevent suicide. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aimed to determine the suicide mortality within 1 year after discharge from psychiatric inpatient care and identify the risk factors for suicide completion during this period. A total of 8403 patients were admitted to general hospitals in Seoul, Korea, for psychiatric disorders from January 1989 to December 2006. The suicide mortality risk of these patients within 1 year of discharge was compared with that of gender- and age-matched subjects from the general population of Korea. The standardized mortality ratios (SMR) for suicide in the year following discharge were 49.7 for males and 45.5 for females. Patients aged 15-24 years had the highest risk for suicide. Among the different diagnostic groups, patients with personality disorders, schizophrenia, or affective disorders had the highest risk for suicide completion. Suicidal ideation at admission and inpatient stay more than 1 month were also associated with increased risk of suicide. In Korean psychiatric patients, the SMR is much higher in young female patients, a high percentage of patients commit suicide by jumping, and there is a stronger association of long duration of hospitalization and suicide. These factors should be considered in the development and implementation of suicide prevention strategies for Korean psychiatric patients. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Background Suicide has profound effects on families and communities, but is a statistically rare event. Psychological autopsies using a case-control design allow researchers to examine risk factors for suicide, using a variety of sources to detail the psychological and social characteristics of decedents and to compare them to controls. The Suicide Support and Information System Case Control study (SSIS-ACE) aimed to compare psychosocial, psychiatric and work-related risk factors across three groups of subjects: suicide decedents, patients presenting to hospital with a high-risk self-harm episode, and general practice controls. Methods The study design includes two inter-related studies; one main case-control study: comparing suicide cases to general practice (GP) controls, and one comparative study: comparing suicide cases to patients presenting with high-risk self-harm. Consecutive cases of suicide and probable suicide are identified through coroners' registration of deaths in the defined region (Cork City and County, Ireland) and are frequency-matched for age group and gender with GP patient controls recruited from the same GP practice as the deceased. Data sources for suicide cases include coroners' records, interviews with health care professionals and proxy informants; data sources for GP controls and for high-risk self-harm controls include interviews with control, with proxy informants and with health care professionals. Interviews are semi-structured and consist of quantitative and qualitative parts. The quantitative parts include a range of validated questionnaires addressing psychiatric, psychosocial and occupational factors. The study adopts several methodological innovations, including accessing multiple data sources for suicide cases and controls simultaneously, recruiting proxy informants to examine consistency across sources. Conclusions The study allows for the investigation of consistency across different data sources and contributes to the methodological advancement of psychological autopsy research. The study will also inform clinical and public health practice. The comparison between suicide cases and controls will allow investigation of risk and protective factors for suicide more generally, while the comparison with high-risk self-harm patients will help to identify the factors associated specifically with a fatal outcome to a self-harm episode. A further enhancement is the particular focus on specific work-related risk factors for suicide.

TI Substance misuse in life and death in a 2-year cohort of suicides
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID NORTHERN-IRELAND; USE DISORDERS; ALCOHOL-USE; TOXICOLOGY; OVERDOSE;
   BEHAVIOR; ADULTS; HEALTH
AB Background
   Although substance misuse is a key risk factor in suicide, relatively little is known about the relationship between lifetime misuse and misuse at the time of suicide.
   Aims
   To examine the relationship between substance misuse and subsequent suicide.
   Method
   Linkage of coroners' reports to primary care records for 403 suicides occurring over 2 years.
   Results
   With alcohol misuse, 67% of the cohort had previously sought help for alcohol problems and 39% were intoxicated at the time of suicide. Regarding misuse of other substances, 54% of the cohort was tested. Almost one in four (38%) tested positive, defined as an excess of drugs over the prescribed therapeutic dosage and/or detection of illicit substances. Those tested were more likely to be young and have a history of drug misuse.
   Conclusions
   A deeper understanding of the relationship between substance misuse and suicide could contribute to prevention initiatives. Furthermore, standardised toxicology screening processes would avoid diminishing the importance of psychosocial factors involved in suicide as a 'cause of death'.

AB Little attention has been paid to whether temperature is associated with suicide and to whether suicide seasonality appears in Asian countries as shown in Western countries, even though suicide rates in Korea have increased steadily. The goal of the present study was to examine the association between daily temperature and daily suicide rate in Korea, taking gender, age, and education level into account. Data were analyzed using a generalized additive model, adjusting for confounding factors such as sunshine, relative humidity, holidays, and long-term trends. Suicide rates were higher in spring and summer than other seasons. We observed a 1.4% increase (95% confidence interval = 1.0-1.7%) in suicide with each 1 degrees C-increase in daily mean temperature. The suicide risks related to the temperature for males, elderly people, and those with less education were higher than for females, younger people, and those with more education, respectively. These findings have confirmed that temperature is associated with suicide in Korea and further our understanding of more susceptible groups, the effects of gender, age, and education level. Therefore, temperature, one of the meteorological factors, is an important risk factor on suicide. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To determine the effects of psychiatric disorders on attempted suicide among adolescents with substance use disorders (SUD). Methods: Age of onset for psychiatric disorders, age of first suicide attempt, and the relationship of psychiatric disorder with attempted suicide were investigated in a sample of 503 adolescents with DSM-IV defined SUD (age range: 12.2-19.0 years). Results: Males who attempted suicide had a significantly earlier onset of alcohol use disorders (AUD) and significantly more mood, AUD, and disruptive behavior disorder symptoms compared to non-attempting males. Females who attempted suicide had a significantly earlier onset and higher counts of mood disorders and SUD symptoms compared to non-attempting females. Hazard analysis revealed that mood disorders represent the highest psychiatric risk for attempted suicide in both the genders. Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) increased the risk for attempted suicide among males. The interaction of mood disorder and AUD increased the risk for attempted suicide among females. Conclusions: Clinicians should closely monitor SUD adolescents for suicide risk and be aware of gender differences for suicidal behavior based on course and severity of psychiatric disorder in this population.

AB Research has demonstrated an inconsistent relationship between suicide ideation and personality traits. This is the first study to empirically examine the relationship of the Five Factor Model of personality with current, past and no suicide ideation, and with the two interpersonal risk factors of suicide: thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness (Joiner, T., 2005. Why people die by suicide. Cambridge, MA, US: Harvard University Press). Results indicate that high neuroticism was associated with both current ideation and a history of suicide ideation and extraversion was associated with current ideation. Neuroticism was positively related to thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, while extraversion was negatively related to these interpersonal predictors of suicide. Agreeableness was negatively related to thwarted belongingness but not perceived burdensomeness, indicating differentiated patterns of relationships between this personality domain and the two suicide constructs. Furthermore, these personality domains predicted 23.82% of variance for thwarted belongingness and 15.07% of the variance for perceived burdensomeness, above and beyond demographic variables associated with suicide ideation. This study, which was conducted with a college sample, demonstrates the potential benefit of identifying predispositional risk factors for suicide ideation and interpersonal predictors of suicide. This may have implications for the development of upstream preventative measures against suicide. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Greenland is the most extreme of human habitats in regard to annual changes in natural light. From being very low, the rate of suicides in Greenland has increased during the past few decades to be among the highest in the world. Several studies have shown seasonality in suicides with spring or summer peaks, but this has not been previously shown in Greenland. Official data from 1968 to 1995 from West Greenland were pooled. A significant seasonality in the 833 suicides was found using Rayleigh's test, a peak in June and a trough in the winter. Suicides increased during the period, and reached high rates in most age groups, up to 577 per 100,000 person-years in men aged 15-24 years in 1990, and up to 147 per 100,000 person-years in women aged 15-24 years in 1995. Violent methods of suicide were used by 93%. Depression has been reported uncommonly. High alcohol intake and extended periods of light in the summer may contribute to impulsive-aggressive summer suicides. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MENTAL-HEALTH; PRIMARY-CARE
AB Background: Contact with primary care and psychiatric services prior to suicide may be considerable, presenting opportunities for intervention. However, there is scant knowledge on the frequency, nature and determinants of contact.
   Method: Retrospective cohort study-an analysis of deaths recorded as suicide by the Northern Ireland Coroner's Office linked with data from General Practice patient records over a 2 year period
   Results: Eighty-seven per cent of suicides were in contact with General Practice services in the 12 months before suicide. The frequency of contact with services was considerable, particularly among patients with a common mental disorder or substance misuse problems. A diagnosis of psychiatric problems was absent in 40 % of suicides. Excluding suicide attempts, the main predictors of a noted general practitioner concern for patient suicidality are male gender, frequency of consultations, diagnosis of mental illness and substance misuse.
   Conclusions: Despite widespread and frequent contact, a substantial proportion of suicidal people were undiagnosed and untreated for mental health problems. General Practitioner alertness to suicidality may be too narrowly focused.

AB Background: The Northern Ireland Registry of Deliberate Self-Harm was established as an outcome of the Northern Ireland Suicide Prevention Strategy and Action Plan Protect Life, beginning in the Western Health and Social Care Trust area. Aims: The study aimed to establish the incidence of hospital-treated deliberate self-harm in the Western Area of Northern Ireland, and to explore the profile of such presentations. Method: Deliberate self-harm presentations made to the three hospital emergency departments operating in the area during the period 2007-2012 were recorded. Results: There were 8,175 deliberate self-harm presentations by 4,733 individuals. Respectively, the total, male, and female age-standardized incidence rate was 342, 320, and 366 per 100,000 population. City council residents had a far higher self-harm rate. The peak rate for women was among 15-19-year-olds (837 per 100,000) and for men was among 20-24-year-olds (809 per 100,000). Risk of repetition was higher in 35-44-year-old patients if self-cutting was involved, but was most strongly associated with the number of previous self-harm presentations. Conclusion: The incidence of hospital-treated self-harm in Northern Ireland is far higher than in the Republic of Ireland and more comparable to that in England.

AB Elderly suicide rates are the highest of any age group. Greece is among the countries with the highest proportion of elderly people in the European Union (EU). Elderly suicide victims seem to possess different characteristics. Aim of our study was to elucidate the different characteristics of elderly suicide victims. Data was collected from a two-year psychological autopsy study, conducted at the Athens' Department of Forensic Medicine, the largest in Greece. Elderly suicide victims represented 35% of total suicides. The majority (69.5%) were males. Only 12.4% had previous psychiatric hospitalization but more than half (65.2%) had psychiatric history (81% of them had history of depression). As expected, there was a high incidence of physical illness (81.6%). The majority (82%) of the elderly suicide victims made a suicide attempt for the first time and it was unfortunately successful. When the elderly suicide victims were divided in two categories ("young-old" and "old-old") the differences between the two groups were: elderly over 75 years had more physical problems and more frequently positive psychiatric history without ever been hospitalized for psychiatric problems. Late life suicides seem to encapsulate population groups with different characteristics. Their differences can be a useful guide aiming to formulate specific suicide prevention strategies. This is of great importance, given the very high frequency of completed suicides in this age group. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Studies of the association between parental separation in childhood and suicide thoughts and attempts are scarce. The aim of this study is to investigate associations between parental separation/divorce during childhood, and ever having had suicide thoughts and ever having made suicide attempt, adjusting for social capital and other covariates. In 2012 a cross-sectional public health survey was conducted in Scania, southern Sweden, with a postal questionnaire with 28,029 participants aged 18-80. Associations between parental separation/divorce during childhood and ever having considered suicide or having made suicide attempt were analysed by logistic regression. Overall, 12.1% of the men and 15.5% of the women had experienced suicide thoughts, and 3.2% of the men and 53% of the women had ever tried committing suicide. Among men, 20.4% had experienced parental separation during childhood until age 18, and among women 22.3%. Parental separation/divorce in childhood was with few exceptions significantly associated with ever having had suicide thoughts with the highest odds ratios for those who had experienced parental separation during ages 0-4 years. Parental separation/divorce in childhood was significantly associated with suicide attempts among men who had experienced parental separation/divorce at ages 0-4 and 15-18, and among women at any age 0-18.

AB Low cholesterol levels have commonly been associated with various suicide measures. We sought to examine suicide attempts in a prospective sample of depressed patients that on prior analysis demonstrated an association between low cholesterol and subsequent suicide completions. Seventy-four inpatients with Research Diagnostic Criteria unipolar major depression, bipolar depression or schizoaffective depression entered a prospective follow-up study from 1978 to 1981. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression were utilized to elucidate the relationship between cholesterol levels and subsequent severe suicide attempts as well as all suicide attempts regardless of severity. Attempts preceding index hospitalization and other lifetime attempts were evaluated cross-sectionally. Low serum cholesterol levels did not predict subsequent suicide attempts. Contrary to our hypothesis, the high cholesterol group was associated with increased risk of suicide attempts on survival analysis in those less than median age. Nonetheless, in cross-sectional analysis, the low cholesterol group had more suicide attempts preceding index hospitalization and more remote lifetime attempts. The results from this prospective dataset do not support an association between low cholesterol and subsequent suicide attempts despite replicating the retrospective findings of previous case-control and cross-sectional studies.

AB Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has been strongly associated with suicidality. Despite the growing evidence suggesting that suicidality is heightened by the presence of an elaborated suicide schema, investigations of suicide schemas are sparse. Using novel methodologies, this study aimed to compare the suicide schema of PTSD individuals with and without suicidal ideation in the past year. Fifty-six participants with a diagnosis of PTSD (confirmed via the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale) completed questionnaires to assess suicidality, depressive severity and hopelessness. A series of direct and indirect cognitive tasks were used to assess suicide schemas. The pathfinder technique was employed to construct graphical representations of the groups' suicide schemas. The suicidal group reported significantly more severe PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, hopelessness and suicidality. The suicide schema of the suicidal group was significantly more extensive compared to the non-suicidal group even after taking into account in the analyses group differences in clinical measures. Moreover, the suicide schemas of the two groups were qualitatively distinct from each other. These findings provide support for contemporary theories of suicide which view suicide schemas as an important indicator of suicide risk. The investigation of schema constructs opens a new avenue of research for understanding suicide. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide is a leading cause of death in individuals 15-34 years of age in China. Highly lethal pesticides are a common method used for suicide in Chinese rural areas. This case-control study aimed to test hypotheses concerning the suicide risks associated with pesticide access. Subjects included 370 rural completed suicides aged 15-34 years and 370 living controls matched on age, gender and residence (rural/urban location). Data were collected by a psychological autopsy design with proxy respondents. Pesticide access was a significant risk factor for suicide even after controlling for other known risk factors in social and psychiatric domains, such as education level, living situation, marital status, family annual income and mental disorder. Increased risk was accounted for by access to insecticide rather than other types of pesticides. Suicide intervention in China should focus on restricting access to pesticides, especially highly toxic insecticide, improving the resuscitation skills of rural primary-care health providers, promoting psychological and social support networks in rural areas and educating the general public about the suicide risk of having pesticides stored at the households.

AB Research has shown that there are different seasonal effects in suicide. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that the decrease in suicide rate at the end of the year is extended over the last weeks of the year and represents a specific type of seasonal effect. Suicide data were extracted firom individual records of the Swiss mortality statistics, 1969-2003. The data were aggregated to daily frequencies of suicide across the year. Specifically, the period October-February was examined using time-series analysis, i.e., the Box-Jenkins approach with intervention models. The time series models require a step function to account for the gradual drop in suicide frequencies in December. The decrease in suicide frequencies includes the whole Advent and is accentuated at Christmas. After the New Year, there is a sharp recovery in men's suicide rate but not in women's. The reduction in the suicide rate during the last weeks of the year exceeds the well-recognised effect of reduced rates on major public holidays. It involves valuable challenges for suicide prevention such as timing of campaigns and enhancement of social networks. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Symptoms of internalizing disorders (depression, anxiety, somatic, trauma) are the major risk factors for suicide. Atypical suicide risk is characterized by people with few or no symptoms of internalizing disorders.
   Objective: In persons screened at intake to alcohol or other drug (AOD) treatment, this research examined whether person fit statistics would support an atypical subtype at high risk for suicide that did not present with typical depression and other internalizing disorders.
   Methods: Symptom profiles of the prototypical, typical, and atypical persons, as defined using fit statistics, were tested on 7408 persons entering AOD treatment using the Global Appraisal of individual Needs (GAIN; Dennis et al., 2003a,b).
   Results: Of those with suicide symptoms, the findings were as expected with the atypical group being higher on suicide and lower on symptoms of internalizing disorders. In addition, the atypical group was similar or lower on substance problems, symptoms of externalizing disorders, and crime and violence.
   Conclusions: Person fit statistics were useful in identifying persons with atypical suicide profiles and in enlightening aspects of existing theory concerning atypical suicidal ideation. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dysfunction of the central serotonergic system has been related to a spectrum of psychiatric disorders, including suicidal behavior. Tryptophan hydroxylase isoform 2 (TPH2) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of serotonin, being expressed in serotonergic neurons of raphe nuclei. We investigated genetic variation in TPH2 gene in two samples of male subjects: 288 suicide completers and 327 volunteers, in order to reveal any associations between 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms and completed suicide. No associations were revealed neither on allelic nor haplotype level. Our finding does not support the hypothesis of TPH2 being a susceptibility factor for completed suicide in males of Estonian origin. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although suicide rates among prisoners are high and vary between countries, it is uncertain whether this reflects the importation of risk from the general population or is associated with incarceration rates.
   We collected data on suicides and undetermined deaths in 12 countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, England and Wales, Finland, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, and Sweden) directly from their prison administrations for 2003-2007. These were compared with rates of suicides in the general population separately by gender using Pearson's correlations. In addition, they were compared with rates of incarceration. Linear regression was used to examine any association after adjustment for rates of incarceration.
   Data were collected on 861 suicides in prison, of which 810 were in men. In the men, crude relative rates of suicide were at least three times higher than the general population. Western European countries had similar rates of prisoner suicide which were mostly higher than those in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. There was no association between rates of suicide in prisoners and general population rates or rates of incarceration. In the women, inmate suicide rates varied widely and were mostly raised compared with rates in the general population. In addition, these rates did not appear to be associated with general population rates of suicide.
   Rates of prison suicide do not reflect general population suicide rates, suggesting that variations in prison suicide rates reflect differences in criminal justice systems including, possibly, the provision of psychiatric care in prison.

AB Despite significant investment in mental health and suicide intervention strategies in Australia, the extent of change in suicide rates over the last decade is unclear. This paper analyses sex and age trajectories in suicide rates over the last decade in Australia. Age Standardized Suicide Rates from 2004 to 2013 were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and reflect rates of suicide per 100,000 within age and sex cohorts. Age-related suicide rates were consistent over the last decade. For both males and females, there were increases in mid-life suicide rates before declining around 55-65 years of age. However, rates of suicide in men increased in late-life with rates for those aged 70-79 comparable with those in mid-life. Rates amongst men aged 85+ were consistently the highest rates over the decade. Positively, there was decline in suicide rates among younger men aged 20-34 years. However, more consistently, for both sexes across most age cohorts, there were either increases or no change in suicide rate. Apart from declines in younger-adult males, analysis of age-standardized suicide rates indicate no improvement in suicide rates. High suicide rates amongst middle-aged and older males remain a significant public health issue that needs to be addressed. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Background. The purpose of the study was to estimate the proportion of alcohol abuse and dependence (AAD) among Suicides and controls. and to compare the incidence of AAD documented by clinicians with diagnoses derived from a research protocol.
   Method. AAD according to DSM-IV was diagnosed on the basis of interviews with relatives of people who committed Suicide and with controls. A total of 427 people who committed suicide during one year were paired by region, gender. age and nationality with controls randomly selected front general practitioners' lists.
   Results. Alcohol abuse was found in 10% and alcohol dependence in 51% of suicide cases. The corresponding figures for controls were 7% and 14% respectively. AAD was a statistically significant predictor of completed suicides, while abstinence was a significant predictor for female suicides and former use a significant predictor for older male suicides. AAD was diagnosed in 68% of male and 29% of female suicides. Middle-aged (35-59 years) males who committed Suicide had the highest risk of alcohol dependence. Among suicide cases only 29% had received a lifetime diagnosis of AAD, against 23% of controls.
   Conclusions. AAD was significantly more prevalent among suicides than controls. Overall. the proportion of male suicides affected by alcohol was the same in the present psychological autopsy study as in our previous findings for Estonia on the aggregate level. while the share of female suicides with an AAD diagnosis was dramatically higher on the individual level. AAD is markedly underdiagnosed by general practitioners and clinicians.

AB The case of a suicide of a 32-year-old female using an electric circular saw is herein described. The decedent was suffering from depression and was found dead in her room, Beside her right hand was lying a circular saw, which was not running. The autopsy revealed a large gaping wound measuring 15.5 cm in length on the right side of her neck. The right external carotid artery, the right internal jugular vein, and the right internal carotid artery were cut and the injury reached to the cervical vertebra, Therefore, the cause of death was exsanguination. An individual who commits suicide with an electric saw, such as a chain saw, band saw, and circular saw is rare: in particular females rarely select this method as the means of suicide. However, we herein report the case of a female patient with a psychiatric disease who successfully committed suicide with a circular saw. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved,

AB Suicides by self-poisoning are common in all parts of the world. Among these intoxications, gases are rarely used, especially carbon dioxide (CO2). Very few cases of self-inflicted and deliberate carbon dioxide poisonings have been reported. This paper presents two uncommon suicides by carbon dioxide intoxication. In one case, a 53-year-old man tightly sealed a small bathroom and locked himself in it likely with dry ice. Warning notices were tagged to the door. In another case, a 48-year-old man working in a restaurant committed suicide by closing himself in a walk-in refrigerator and opening the stored carbon dioxide containers intended for the beverage dispensing equipment. The limited possibilities of proving lethal CO2 intoxications post-mortem necessitate a close cooperation of the involved parties during investigation. Only the synopsis of all findings permits a sound assessment regarding the manner and cause of death. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Abrupt changes in the alcohol consumption level and the suicide rate associated with the anti-alcohol campaign of 1985-1991 and the market reforms of 1992. Methods: Epidemiological investigation of total Russian suicide rate and per capita alcohol consumption utilizing the Box-Jenkins technique and regression analysis. Results: The decrease of per capita consumption from 14.2 to 10.51 in 1985-1987 and the growth of this index after 1987 (14.61 in 1994) saw a respective decline and increase of suicides per litre of alcohol: eight males and one female per 100,000 of the corresponding population (13 or 6% of male or female suicides and 12% total suicides). The maximum suicide rate was reached in 1994 (41.8 per 100,000 population, in 1981-1994 r = 0.91). In 1984-1986 and 1991-1994 the distribution of suicides' age was close to that of the age distribution from fatal alcohol poisoning. Changes in the level of BAC-positive suicides are closely correlated with changes in the alcohol consumption level (r = 0.98), whereas changes in the number of BAC-negative suicides were not related to changes in consumption. Conclusion: Alcohol consumption level plays a considerable role in the suicide rate, especially for male suicides. The rate of alcohol-related suicides is very high in Russia, owing to the very high alcohol consumption rate in the country. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Suicide; Reterritorialization; Deterritorialization
AB It has escaped many people's attention that, just as the 1998 GFA rescinded the claim of the Irish state on the 6 counties, it also gave up any territorial claim by that state on the rest of the island. It is fair to say that the fake exhilaration of the Celtic tiger years and the genuine relief of many in the North of Ireland finally having a life pushed consideration of this down the list of priorities.
   Yet it is perhaps no coincidence that this deterritorialization emerged simultaneously with an Irish deep state, with banks, universities and indeed private music rights agencies made exempt from the rule of law. Moreover, deterritorialization was a hallmark of the Clinton presidency and the risks of alienation, predicted by Deleuze as he authored the concept, were seen as perhaps balanced by "peace, prosperity, and progress". As of 2015, more Irish citizens had committed suicide in the republic since the 2008 crash than the total number of deaths in the troubles. While this can indeed be attributed to anomie/alienation, it is worth noting that in his classic paper on the subject Durkheim pointed out the vanishingly low rate of suicide in his contemporary Ireland. The status quo seems untenable, and international human rights lawyer Hassan Ahmed demonstrated in our 2016 conference that the 1998 GFA coupled with the 2004 referendum means Ireland is in breach of international law in not granting nationality to all born on the island.
   Yet deterritorialization has had the paradoxical result of making Gaelic culture more portable than ever, and to increase its following by orders of magnitude. What this paper proposes is reterritorializing Ireland by providing a Mecca for the tens of millions who value this culture. Here we look at ways of reterritorializing Ireland from reinstating the claim on the whole island to explicitly repudiating it for a 26 or 30 county state with East of the Bann left in the non-EU UK.

AB Background: Suicide accounts for over 58,000 deaths in Europe per annum, where suicide attempts are estimated to be 20 times higher. Males have been found to have a disproportionately lower rate of suicide attempts and an excessively higher rate of suicides compared to females. The gender difference in suicide intent is postulated to contribute towards this gender imbalance. The aim of this study is to explore gender differences in suicide intent in a cross-national study of suicide attempts. The secondary aims are to investigate the gender differences in suicide attempt across age and country.
   Methods: Data on suicide attempts (acquired from the EU-funded OSPI-Europe project) was obtained from eight regions in Germany, Hungary, Ireland and Portugal. Suicide intent data was categorized into 'Non-habitual Deliberate Self-Harm' (DSH), 'Parasuicidal Pause' (SP), 'Parasuicidal Gesture' (SG), and 'Serious Suicide Attempt' (SSA), applying the Feuerlein scale. Gender differences in intent were explored for significance by using X-2-tests, odds ratios, and regression analyses.
   Results: Suicide intent data from 5212 participants was included in the analysis. A significant association between suicide intent and gender was found, where 'Serious Suicide Attempts' (SSA) were rated significantly more frequently in males than females (p < .001). There was a statistically significant gender difference in intent and age groups (p < .001) and between countries (p < .001). Furthermore, within the most utilised method, intentional drug overdose, 'Serious Suicide Attempt' (SSA) was rated significantly more often for males than females (p < .005).
   Conclusions: Considering the differences in suicidal intent between males and females highlighted by the current study, gender targeted prevention and intervention strategies would be recommended.

TI Impact of Patient Suicide on Front-Line Staff in Ireland

AB Research and anecdotal evidence suggests that coming to terms with the suicide of a patient can be extremely distressing for front-line professionals. Some research also suggests that exposure to such situations can undermine professionals' functioning and feelings of competence, cause them to question their professional standing and ultimately contribute to burnout. A survey of 447 front-line professionals' experiences of patient suicide was undertaken to further explore these issues. Thematic analysis of open-ended questionnaire items revealed that concerns for the bereaved family, feelings of responsibility for the death and having a close therapeutic relationship with the client are key factors that influence the adjustment and coping of a health professional in the aftermath of the death of a client by suicide. The results are discussed with a focus on the impact of suicide on front-line staff, the need for ongoing support and training and the development of specific post-suicide protocols.

DE Suicide; Electric saw; Neck injury
AB The case of a suicide of a 32-year-old female using an electric circular saw is herein described. The decedent was suffering from depression and was found dead in her room. Beside her right hand was lying a circular saw, which was not running. The autopsy revealed a large gaping wound measuring 15.5 cm in length on the right side of her neck. The right external carotid artery, the right internal jugular vein, and the right internal carotid artery were cut and the injury reached to the cervical vertebra. Therefore, the cause of death was exsanguination. An individual who commits suicide with an electric saw, such as a chain saw, band saw, and circular saw is rare; in particular females rarely select this method as the means of suicide. However, we herein report the case of a female patient with a psychiatric disease who successfully committed suicide with a circular saw. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We aimed to determine the number and characteristics of psychiatric patients receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) who had subsequently died by suicide. Data were collected on an 8-year (1999-2006) sample of suicide cases in England who had been in recent contact with mental health services. Of 9752 suicides, 71 (1%) were being treated with ECT at the time of death. Although the number of patients who received ECT had fallen substantially over time, the rate of suicide in these individuals showed no clear decrease and averaged 9 deaths per year, or a rate of 10.8 per 10,000 patients treated. These suicide cases were typically older, with high rates of affective disorder and previous self-harm. They were more likely to be an in-patient at the time of death than other suicide cases. Nearly half of the community cases who had received ECT had died within 3 months of discharge. Our results demonstrated that the fall in the use of ECT has not affected suicide rates in patients receiving this treatment. Services appear to acknowledge the high risk of suicide in those receiving ECT. Improvements in care of these severely ill patients may include careful discharge planning and improved observation of in-patients in receipt of ECT. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Numerous studies have mentioned to the high percentage of violent deaths in prison psychiatric hospitals, with suicide being the principal cause. The aim of this study was to analyze the circumstances related with the deaths recorded in a high security institution. Postmortem reports on all the deaths at the Alicante Psychiatric Prison between 1984 and 1997 were studied (36 cases of unnatural death and 28 of natural death). Of the violent deaths recorded 34 (94.4%) were suicides. Demographic, clinical and interpersonal variables factors were registered. In the cases of suicides, the method used, the place of death, season, month and time of suicide were analyzed. In our study, 64.7% of suicides were schizophrenic and 32.4% had inflicted self-harm previously. We found a statistically significant association between the cause of death (natural, suicide or homicide) and age, 47.1% of suicides being between the ages of 18 and 30 and 29.4% between the ages of 30 and 45. Natural causes predominated in older subjects. The prison population studied showed grave negative traits, mental illness and criminal behavior having forced them to the very edge of society. Our results were compared with the death and suicide rates of the general Spanish population. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background. Deaths from suicide, as recorded within the Northern Ireland Coroner's Office for the years 2005-2011 inclusive, were analysed in terms of standardised mortality ratios (SMRs), within Wards and Local Government Districts (LGDs). The aim of the study is to examine factors relating to the ecological context of the area within which the person resided at time of death. Area deprivation, religious composition and age structure are examined in terms of SMRs, while controlling for the number of individuals living within a designated area.
   Methods. Random-intercept Poisson regression models were used in conjunction with empirical Bayes prediction to examine area effects.
   Results. Considerable variation occurs between the numbers of recorded deaths within each area. A strong association is shown between deprivation and the number of deaths by suicide within an area. There was considerable variation at the LGD level in terms of the number of deaths, but once the nested nature of Wards was taken into account and adjusted for level of deprivation, the variation between LGD was no longer statistically significant. When adjusted for the number of individuals within each age group, the number of deaths in the younger and middle-aged groups did not show a statistical difference (0.05 level), nor did the religious composition of the area in terms of the number of recorded deaths.
   Conclusions. Based on SMRs, using empirical Bayes prediction, area effects were shown to be substantial, especially in urban locations where there are high rates of deprivation.

The current study aimed to describe the demographic details of users of this nurse led service, and to evaluate subsequent care pathways following this intervention. Methods This study was conducted using a retrospective file review with a cross-sectional observational design investigating demographic details of service users and care pathways in a Suicide Crisis Assessment Nurse service within a defined catchment area of Ireland between June 2015 and May 2017. Results The majority of referrals were managed in Primary Care following Suicide Crisis Assessment Nurse intervention. There was an increase in Primary Care management pathway in the second year of the service which was independent of age and gender. Conclusion There was an increase in referrals to the service over time, and the majority of presentations were managed in primary care following Suicide Crisis Assessment Nurse intervention. The study suggests that primary care interventions for suicidal crises merit further research.

AB It has been suggested that Black people show lower suicidality than White people. The few conflicting studies estimating lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts in Caribbean populations were mainly carried out in the UK and the USA. Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts among the French Caribbean general population still living in the West Indies. As part of an international epidemiological multicenter study under the authority of the World Health Organization French Collaborating Centre, we interviewed 887 individuals selected from the general population in the Caribbean island of Martinique, using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Among the interviewed individuals, 4.4% (N=39) reported having attempted suicide. Younger age, lifetime diagnoses of major mood disorder, panic disorder and alcohol dependence were all associated with a lifetime history of suicide attempts. Lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts among the French Caribbean general population was almost half as much as that measured in continental France. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB We present a surprising case of suicide by self-immolation. A surveillance camera filmed the victim's agony. We were able to ascertain that he survived 13 min after ignition. This case was the starting point for a review of the literature of the forensic elements required to correctly analyze cases of suicide by self-immolation and to establish the causal link between the burn lesions and death. The authors will focus on the forensic and medical aspects in favor of suicide by self-immolation and on the forensic aspects required to understand the ignition process, the circumstances surrounding the fire with a particular emphasis on determining whether an accelerant was doused on the victim before ignition.

AB Suicide is the single major cause of death among patients with schizophrenia. Despite great efforts in the prevention of such deaths, suicide rates have remained alarming, pointing to the need for a better understanding of the phenomenon. The present sample comprised 20 male patients with schizophrenia who committed suicide and who were investigated retrospectively for a large number of characteristics. Controls were 20 living patients with schizophrenia. The results suggest that suicide attempts, hopelessness and self-devaluation were the three variables most strongly associated with completed suicide. However, a number of variables were identified which may constitute risk factors, some of which have not been identified in the past: agitation and motor restlessness (OR=3.66; 95%CI=0.95/14.02), self-devaluation (OR=28.49; 95%CI=3.15/257.40), hopelessness (OR=51.00, 95% CI=7.56-343.72), insomnia (OR=12.66; 95%CI=0.95/14.02), mental disintegration (OR=3.66; 95%CI=0.95/14.02), and suicide attempt (OR=3.66; 95%CI=1.40/114.41). Poor adherence to medications was also predictive of completed suicide in Our sample of schizophrenia patients, primarily because the suicide victims showed very low adherence.

AB The current study sought to develop and validate a new measure of chronic suicide risk (the S_Chron) from the Personality Assessment Inventory in a mixed sample of psychiatric inpatients and outpatients. In an initial development sample (N=397), hierarchical logistic regression identified six PAI variables uniquely associated with multiple versus single/no prior suicide attempts after controlling for sample demographics: Negative Impression Management, Situational Stress, Mania Grandiosity, Borderline Negative Relationships, Borderline Self-Harm, and Antisocial Behaviors. These indicators were then aggregated into a single index (S_Chron) and evaluated in terms of validity in an independent clinical sample (N=398). Results indicated the S_Chron effectively differentiated between groups with multiple versus single/no prior suicide attempts, even after controlling for the effects of the PAI Suicidal Ideation (SUI) and Suicide Potential (SPI) indices, with moderate to large effect sizes observed (range of Cohen's d's=0.30-0.91). Further, the S_Chron incremented all other PAI indices and SUI in predicting multiple suicide attempts. The potential clinical application and ways in which the S_Chron may augment other existing measures of suicide risk are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As suicides of children, adolescents and young adults occur very seldom and only few case reports and more comprehensive studies are available in forensic literature, the autopsy records of the Bonn Institute of Forensic Medicine and the database of the Bonn police authorities from 1989 to 1998 were retrospectively analysed for this phenomenon. This search revealed 37 respective suicides involving 23 male (62%) and 14 female (38%) victims. The ages ranged from 10 to 21 years with the prevalence sharply increasing in adolescents and young adults. Independent from sex, the victims almost unexceptionally applied hard suicide methods like hanging, running over by a train or jump from the height. As for the psychological background, current conflicts with a sweetheart, within the family or at school on the background of mental illness or chronically disturbed family structures were encountered as prevailing factors.

AB Self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts are well represented behaviours in the general population of both developed and developing countries. These behaviours are indicative of underlying risk factors that show a strong interdependent correlation. In this study we attempted to define correlates for and prevalence of self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts among Turkish college students. This 2006 study included 636 students from two Turkish state universities. Our results showed that the lifetime prevalence of self-harm was 15.4%, the prevalence of suicidal ideation was 11.4%, and the prevalence of suicide attempts was 7.1%. We uncovered correlates for self-harm, including low income, unsatisfying familial relationships, smoking, and alcohol, inhalant, and tranquilizer abuse. Tranquilizer abuse shared a dual role as a correlate for suicide ideation and as a means to attempt suicide. Additionally, we found that drug abusers and adolescents who practise self-harm presented the highest suicide risk. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives and methods: Aim of the study was to identify and estimate psychiatric axis I disorders as risk factors for suicide in different age groups using a psychological autopsy study with case-control design. 163 suicides and 396 population-based control persons were assessed with a standardized semi-structured interview including SCID-I (for DSM-IV). Results: Logistic regression analyses revealed significantly elevated odds ratios for alcohol-related disorders in men aged 31 to 45,46 to 60, and 61 to 75 years (OR = 9.0, OR = 7.5, and OR = 10.7, respectively) and for Major Depression, single episode, in men and women aged 61 to 75 years (OR= 42.7 and OR= 15.9). In males aged 31 to 45 years polysubstance-related disorders (OR= 9.5) and in females aged 61 to 75 years cognitive and mental disorders due to a general medical condition (OR = 12.2) were significantly and independently associated with suicide. Conclusions: Alcohol-related disorders and Major Depression differently contribute to male and female suicide risk in special age groups. These findings imply differentiated prevention strategies.

AB Objective: Suicide is a major public health concern. This study aimed to determine the predictors of repeated suicide attempts, focusing on whether lethality level of the suicidal method predicts the risk of subsequent suicide attempts.
   Methods: All consecutive individuals (N=2,070) with an episode of nonfatal self-harm registered in a surveillance database provided by the Department of Health of Keelung City Government in Taiwan from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2010 were enrolled and followed up until the end of 2011. The earliest attempt recorded in the database was defined as the index attempt. Subjects were classified according to suicide method into low-lethal and high-lethal groups. Data on time of and methods chosen for subsequent suicide attempts during the follow-up period were analyzed.
   Results: Of the total people screened for the study, 18.1% made a repeated suicide attempt. Subjects in the high-lethal group were more likely to be male; aged 35-64 years; and single, divorced, or widowed. Compared to other time intervals, most subsequent suicide attempts occurred within 6 months from the index attempt. The independent predictors for repeated suicide attempts were the use of low-lethal methods in the index attempt and being 35-49 years old. Using high-lethal methods and being older than 50 years were associated with changing suicide method for the second attempt.
   Conclusion: Lethality level of former suicidal method could predict repeated suicide attempts and changing of suicide methods. Further clarification is needed on whether a higher risk of repeat attempts is associated with higher rates of suicide mortality.

AB Suicide as a public health problem is studied worldwide and association of psychiatric and genetic risk factors for suicidal behavior are the point of discussion in studies across different ethnic groups. The present study is aimed at evaluating psychiatric and genetic traits among primary relatives of suicide completer families in an urban Indian population. Bi-variate analysis shows significant increase in major depression (PHQ and Hamilton), stress, panic disorder, somatoform disorder and suicide attemptamong primary compared to other relatives. Sib pair correlations also reveal significant results for major depression (Hamilton), stress, suicide attempt, intensity of suicide ideation and other anxiety syndrome. 5-HTTLPR, 5-HTT (Stin2) and COMT risk alleles are higher among primary relatives, though statistically insignificant. Backward conditional logistic regression analysis show only independent variable, Depression (Hamilton) made a unique statistically significant contribution to the model in primary relatives.

AB When compared to German rates, train suicides in the Netherlands have made up a larger proportion of the total number of suicides. This study examines whether this difference is attributable to railway parameters, familiarity with rail transport, or population density.
   Dutch and German train suicide rates from 2000 to 2007 were compared by means of Poisson regression analyses. Train suicide rate ratios were calculated and related to the railway parameters or population density in a Poisson regression model. The Dutch-German general suicide rate ratio was 0.72. In contrast, the train suicide rate in the Netherlands exceeded the German rate by 1.23. In the Poisson regression analyses, where suicide rate was related to railway density or passenger traffic intensity, the Dutch-German train suicide rate ratios became 1.49 and 1.20 respectively. When related to train traffic intensity or population density, however, rate ratios turned into 0.74 and 0.59 respectively. Train traffic intensity contributes to train suicide frequency. Population density also contributes, whereas railway density and familiarity with rail transport do not. In a cross-national comparison the availability hypothesis regarding the number of trains passing was confirmed, which leads to the recommendation of limiting access to the railway tracks.

AB The objectives of this study were to (a) determine whether two factors that are established components of the risk for substance use disorder (SUD) also impact on the risk for suicide; and (2) evaluate whether SUD manifest by early adulthood predicts suicide propensity. Neurobehavior disinhibition assessed in 227 boys at ages 10-12 and 16 and parental history of SUD were prospectively evaluated to determine their association with the risk for SUD and suicide propensity between ages 16 and 19. The results indicated that neurobehavior disinhibition at age 16 predicts suicide propensity between ages 16 and 19 (p =.04). A trend was observed (p =.08) for SUD manifest between ages 16 and 19 to predict suicide propensity during the same period. Maternal SUD is directly associated with son's SUD risk but not suicide propensity. Paternal SUD predicts son's neurobehavior disinhibition that, in turn, predisposes to SUD. A direct relation between paternal SUD and son's suicide propensity was not observed. These findings suggest that neurobehavior disinhibition, a component of the liability of SUD, is also associated with suicide risk. These results are discussed within a neurobehavioral framework in which prefrontal cortex dysfunction is hypothesized to underlie the risk for these two outcomes. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB An unequal distribution of suicides over months and seasons has been a consistent finding in epidemiological surveys on suicide. Jails and prisons are a high-risk setting for suicide all over the world. The high prevalence of both outward and self-directed violence in prison populations indicates dysfunctional central serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission and, therefore, could account for an unequal distribution of suicides over months and seasons due to underlying bioclimatic factors. Within a total survey of suicides in the Austrian penitentiary system, the weekly, monthly and seasonal distribution of custodial suicides between 1947 and 1999 was studied. After an explorative comparison of suicide distribution over weekdays, months and seasons of the year by chi(2)-tests, a harmonic Poisson regression model was per-formed to detect seasonality of suicides. No unequal distribution of suicides was evident over the 53-year period. A limitation of this study was its sample size of 412, a low number compared with population-based samples, where a spring suicide peak was consistently found. An explanation for lacking seasonality could be that bioclimatic factors are less relevant in urban, industrialized areas, where jails and prisons usually are located. One of the core characteristics of penal institutions is the limited possibility for communication and social interaction. This social isolation is independent of seasonal changes. If the individual's possibilities for social interactions are limited, the influence of seasonal changes in social activities may be less relevant. This could explain the absence of seasonal changes in custodial suicide incidence. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study analysed suicide rates among first-generation immigrants in Australia from 1974 to 2006, and compared their suicide risks against the Australian-born population. It also examined the associations between the suicide rates of immigrants from 23 selected countries of birth during 2001-2006, and in their home countries.
   Age-standardised suicide rates (15+ years) and rate ratios, with a 95 % confidence interval, during 1974-2006 were calculated for country of birth (COB) groups. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was calculated between COB-specific immigrant suicide rates during 2001-2006 in Australia and in their homelands.
   Suicide rates showed a decreasing time-trend among all COB groups for both genders in Australia. The lowest suicide rates were found during 2004-2006, compared to other year groups. Throughout the study period, males born in Eastern, Northern and Western Europe and New Zealand had the highest suicide rates in Australia. For females, the highest rates were among those born in Western Europe and the UK (including Ireland). Male and female migrants born in North Africa and the Middle East, Southern and Central Asia and South East Asia showed the lowest suicide rates. There was a significant correlation between male immigrant suicide rates by COB and the rates of their home countries.
   The patterns of suicide rates in immigrants were influenced by the social and cultural norms of their COB. The overall decrease in suicide risk among immigrants was particularly evident in males.

AB This study aimed at estimating the protective effect of suicide precautions and clinical risk factors for inpatient suicides. A standardized precaution system was implemented in a large psychiatric center on January 1, 1996. A consecutive series of 33,121 admissions from 1998 to 2008 constituted the post-implementation cohort and 13,515 admissions from 1985 to 1995 constituted the pre-implementation cohort as comparison group. Inpatient suicides were identified via record linkage with national mortality database. For each of 41 inpatient suicides, four controls were randomly selected based on a nested case-control study. A standardized chart review process was employed to collate clinical information for each study subject. Risk and protective factors for inpatient suicides was estimated by conditional logistic regression. The findings showed that, among subjects with shorter lengths of stay, those admitted in post-implementation era had a significantly lower adjusted risk ratio (0.157, p=0.048) for inpatient suicides. Three depression-related symptoms elevated the risk for inpatient suicides: depressed mood (adjusted risk ratio=2.11, P=0.002), loss of energy (adjusted risk ratio=1.99, P=0.018), and psychomotor retardation (adjusted risk ratio = 1.67, P=0.066; with marginal statistical significance). Suicide precautions have protective effect against inpatient suicides. A better assessment and prevention efforts is needed, particularly for those with depression-related symptoms.

AB Objective: Patients who commit suicide have often seen their GP shortly before the suicide. This study explored the emotional effect of patients' suicides on GPs, and whether this effect was linked to the GPs' propensity to explore suicide risk.
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 14 GPs sampled purposively aiming at maximum variation. Analysis by Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis.
   Results: Patients' suicides had a substantial emotional effect on all GPs. Some developed a feeling of guilt and of having failed. If patients had contacted the GP about physical symptoms and the suicide ideation had not been diagnosed, this led to considerable self-scrutiny. GPs differed in their propensity to explore suicide ideation, but all were emotionally shaken and struck by guilt, failure, and self-scrutiny if a patient committed suicide.
   Conclusion: A patient's suicide can be experienced as a 'critical case' that greatly affects all GPs irrespective of other differences among the GPs. The feeling of insufficiency was linked to not having realized during the visit that the patient may have had suicidal thoughts.
   Practice implications: GPs' need for support in emotionally stressful situations should be investigated, and training should be directed towards discovering suicide ideation masked by vague physical symptoms. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To prevent suicidal behaviour, it is important to better understand those personality traits associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. A sample of 394 consecutive major depressed outpatients admitted to Bonn University Hospital was subdivided into three groups: Lifetime suicide attempters (N=32; 8.1%), suicide ideators (N = 133) and patients without Suicide ideation (N = 229). Psychodiagnostic measures embraced the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), the Symptom Checklist-90-R and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Suicide attempters and ideators showed higher scores on emotional distress and depression. Analysis of covariance (covariates: age, gender, depression) revealed that suicide attempters score higher on the temperament dimension harm avoidance compared with non-attempters. Suicide ideators could be distinguished from non-ideators by character dimensions in terms of lower self-directedness and higher self-transcendence. Our findings suggest that high harm avoidance is a personality trait associated with suicide attempt in major depression. whereas low self-directedness and high self-transcendence are related to suicidal ideation. As temperament dimensions represent the "emotional core" and character dimensions the "cognitive core" of personality, we discuss whether Cloninger's psychobiological model might be helpful to distinguish between non-suicide ideators, patients who do think about suicide, and patients initiating suicidal behaviour.

AB Objective: To empirically assess the impact of firearm regulation on male suicides.
   Method: A negative binomial regression model was applied by using a panel of state level data for the years 1995-2004. The model was used to identify the association between several firearm regulations and male suicide rates.
   Results: Our empirical analysis suggest that firearms regulations which function to reduce overall gun availability have a significant deterrent effect on male suicide, while regulations that seek to prohibit high risk individuals from owning firearms have a lesser effect.
   Conclusions: Restricting access to lethal means has been identified as an effective approach to suicide prevention, and firearms regulations are one way to reduce gun availability. The analysis suggests that gun control measures such as permit and licensing requirements have a negative effect on suicide rates among males. Since there is considerable heterogeneity among states with regard to gun control, these results suggest that there are opportunities for many states to reduce suicide by expanding their firearms regulations.

AB This study aimed to describe the frequency of firearm ownership in veterans entering residential treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and examine the association of firearm ownership with suicide ideation and suicide attempt history, combat exposure, and PTSD symptom severity. Two samples of veterans entering residential PTSD treatment were assessed at intake using self-report measures. Approximately one third of participants endorsed firearm ownership across the two samples. Analyses with a sample predominantly comprised of Vietnam Veterans found that those who endorsed both suicide ideation and prior suicide attempts were less likely to own a firearm compared to suicide ideators and non-suicidal participants. In addition, more frequent combat exposure, but not PTSD symptom severity, was associated with firearm ownership in both samples and most participants endorsed using safe storage practices. These lower rates of firearm ownership generally, and in those with suicide ideation and prior attempts in particular, may reflect an increased focused on means restriction in treatment for combat-related PTSD. Means restriction counseling among PTSD treatment seeking veterans should target those with combat exposure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is a lack of psychological autopsy studies assessing the influence of axis I disorders on axis II disorders as risk factors for suicide. Therefore, we investigated the association between personality disorders, axis I disorders, and suicide. Psychiatric disorders were evaluated by a semi-structured interview including the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I (SCID-I) and Personality Disorders (SCID-II) in 163 completed suicides (mean age 49.6 +/- 19.3 years; 64.4% men) and by personal interview in 396 population-based control persons (mean age 51.6 +/- 17.0 years; 55.8% men). In both genders, suicides significantly more often had personality disorders of all clusters than controls, also after adjustment for axis I disorders (p < 0.001, each). In addition, alcohol-related disorders, major depression, and co-occurrence of personality disorders of more than one cluster (men: OR = 16.13; women: OR = 20.43) remained independent predictors for suicide in both genders, "pure" cluster B personality disorders only in women and "pure" cluster C personality disorders only in men. In both genders, co-occurrence of personality disorders of more than one cluster contributed to risk of completed suicide after control for axis I psychiatric disorders and has to be considered as an independent risk factor for suicide.

AB Psychological autopsy is one of the most valuable tools of research on completed suicide. The method involves collecting all available information on the deceased via structured interviews of family members, relatives or friends as well as attending health care personnel. In addition, information is collected from available health care and psychiatric records, other documents, and forensic examination. Thus a psychological autopsy synthesizes the information from multiple informants and records. The early generation of psychological autopsies established that more than 90% of completed suicides have suffered from usually co-morbid mental disorders, most of them mood disorders and/or substance use disorders. Furthermore, they revealed the remarkable undertreatment of these mental disorders, often despite contact with psychiatric or other health care services. More recent psychological autopsy studies have mostly used case-control designs, thus having been better able to estimate the role of various risk factors for suicide. The future psychological autopsy studies may be more focused on interactions between risk factors or risk factor domains, focused on some specific suicide populations of major interest for suicide prevention, or combined psychological autopsy methodology with biological measurements.

AB Suicidal behavior among U.S. military personnel persists as a significant public health issue. Previous research indicates the primary motive for suicide attempts among military personnel is the desire to reduce or alleviate emotional distress, a finding that converges with studies in nonmilitary samples. Much less is understood about the consequences of a first suicide attempt that could influence the occurrence of additional suicide attempts. In order to identify these contingencies, 134 active duty Soldiers who had attempted suicide (n=69 first-time attempters, n=65 multiple attempters) participated in structured interviews focused on their experiences immediately following their first attempt. Soldiers were more likely to have made multiple suicide attempts if they were younger at the time of their first attempt, were not admitted to a hospital or treatment program after their first attempt, or experienced emotional and psychological relief immediately afterwards. Results suggest that Soldiers who experience emotional and/or psychological relief immediately after their first suicide attempt or do not receive treatment are more likely to make additional suicide attempts.

AB Background and objective: Suicide is a worldwide health problem and climatological characteristics have been associated with suicide behavior. However, approaches such as the Knowledge Discovery in Database are not frequently used to search for an association between climatological characteristics and suicide. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between weather data and suicide in a Mexican population.
   Methods: We used the information of 1357 patients who completed suicide from 2005 to 2012. Alternatively, weather data were provided by the National Water Commission. We used the Knowledge Discovery in Database approach with an Apriori algorithm and the data analyses were performed with the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis software. One hundred rules of association were generated with a confidence of 0.86 and support of 1.
   Results: We found an association between environmental temperature and suicide: days with no rain and temperatures between 30 degrees C and 40 degrees C (86-104 degrees F) were related to males completing suicide by hanging.
   Conclusions: In the prevention of suicidal behavior, the Knowledge Discovery in Database could be used to establish climatological characteristics and their association with suicide. This approach must be considered in future prevention strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The lifetime risk of suicide in patients with schizophrenia is estimated to be 4.9-13%. While there are many known risk factors for suicide in schizophrenia, the relationship between cognitive function and suicide risk is unclear, particularly in non-Caucasian populations. In our cross-sectional study, we administered the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) to 316 Han Chinese chronic inpatients with schizophrenia and compared the performance of those who had attempted suicide (n=25) to non-attempters (n=291). The lifetime suicide attempt data were collected from medical records and interviews with patients and their family members. We found a lifetime suicide attempt rate of 7.9%. Suicide attempters were more likely to be single, but showed no significant differences in other demographic factors such as age, gender, or living arrangements. Contrary to our hypothesis, there was no significant relationship between performance on the RBANS test and lifetime risk of suicide attempts in Han Chinese inpatients with schizophrenia. The literature remains mixed on this topic. Culturally influenced differences in suicidal behavior may have affected the outcome of this study and further investigation of this topic is necessary.

AB The article reports the alcohol-related findings of a qualitative study that examined health beliefs and behaviours among Irish people in London. The findings elicited though key informant and lay focus groups and semi-structured interviews, illuminated the social and socioeconomic background to excessive alcohol use among middle-aged Irish men who left Ireland in the 1960s and 1970s. The findings describe the economic role of the pub and alcohol for men in the construction industry as well protecting them from homesickness, isolation and alienation in an unwelcoming and hostile environment. They illustrate the use of alcohol later in life to cope with physical and psychological pain, social stress and the symptoms of mental illness. The use of alcohol as a culturally sanctioned coping strategy is considered, exploring the ambivalent culture of alcohol in Ireland and in particular the tolerance of excessive consumption among men. The article explores the possibility that tolerant attitudes to alcohol in Ireland persist on migration to Britain and are then confounded by a culture of binge drinking among young people in general. The conclusion argues for further research and for culturally sensitive healthcare and health promotion strategies that take account of cultural and structural factors impacting on young Irish men in Britain. Current NHS policies on equality, alcohol and suicide offer timely opportunities to address alcohol misuse in order to improve physical and mental health and reduce the incidence of suicide among Irish men in Britain.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate variables associated with suicide attempts in schizophrenia before and after the first episode. We evaluated history of past sucide attempts, clinical symptoms, level of functioning and cognitive performances of 172 patients with first-episode schizophrenia at first admission. Information was collected regarding clinical symptom severity, treatment compliance, and suicide attempts during the follow-up. We found that 16.5% of the patients attempted suicide before admission, and 6.2% of them attempted suicide during the follow-up. The patients who had attempted suicide before admission were mostly women, and more likely to be hospitalized in first year of follow up. BPRS-depression subscale score at admission and alcohol/substance use appeared as independent variables that found associated with suicide attempts prior to admission in logistic regression analysis. The patients who attempted suicide during the follow-up had significantly higher BPRS-depression subcale scores at sixth months of follow-up. Treatment compliance during the first 6 months and duration of remission was lower in this group. Our findings suggest that longer duration of first hospital treatment, the presence of depressive symptoms, and nonadherence to treatment in early phases of follow up after FES are predictors of suicide attempts. On the other hand, keeping remission during the follow-up protects against suicide attempts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reviews the research literature on gunshot suicide in the United Kingdom and the international literature with reference to strategies aimed at preventing gunshot suicides. Trends in gun ownership and changes in firearm legislation in the UK over the past 20 years are described.
   Most UK gunshot suicides are male, middle-aged and living with a partner and involve, the use of shotguns. They are less likely to have current or past mental health problems, or a previous act of self-harm, than people who commit suicide by other methods, and their suicide is more likely to have been precipitated by a relationship dispute. Where alcohol is consumed the amount tends to be large.
   The international literature provides evidence of a strong association between rates of gun ownership and gunshot suicide, and some evidence of a reduction in firearm suicide rates following the introduction of restrictive firearm legislation. Over the past 20 years the number of gunshot suicides in the UK has declined by over 50% to a little over a hundred deaths per annum. At the same time, firearm legislation has become progressively more restrictive and rates of gun ownership have declined. Measures, which might further reduce the prevalence of gunshot suicides in the UK, are discussed.

AB Adolescents with a history of suicidal behavior are especially vulnerable for future suicide attempts, particularly following discharge from an inpatient psychiatric admission. This study is the first to test whether adolescents' tendency to generate stress, or report more dependent events to which they contributed, was predictive of prospective suicide events. Ninety adolescent psychiatric inpatients who were admitted for recent suicide risk, completed diagnostic interviews, assessments of history of suicidal behavior, and a self-report questionnaire of major life events at baseline. Participants were followed over the subsequent 6 months after discharge to assess stability vs. onset of suicide events. Cox proportional hazard regressions were used to predict adolescents' time to suicide events. Results supported hypothesis, such that only recent greater dependent events, not independent or overall events, predicted risk for prospective suicide events. This effect was specific to adolescent girls. Importantly, dependent events maintained statistical significance as a predictor of future suicide events after co-varying for the effects of several established risk factors and psychopathology. Results suggest that the tendency to generate dependent events may contribute unique additional prediction for adolescent girls' prospective suicide risk, and highlight the need for future work in this area.

AB Attempted suicide is a strong risk factor for subsequent suicidal behavior. In recent years, a particular interest has been given to follow-up interventions as a potential effective strategy in preventing recurrent suicidal behavior. We developed a follow-up intervention program called OSTA (organization of a suitable monitoring for suicide attempters) aimed at addressing this issue and tested its effectiveness in a 1-year randomized controlled trial. Individuals who attempted suicide and were admitted to the emergency department (ED) of Bicetre Hospital (n=320) were randomly allocated to receive either the OSTA program or a control treatment. On an intention to treat basis, the proportion of patients who reattempted suicide did not differ significantly between the interventional group (IG) 14.5% (22/152) and the control group (CG) 14% (21/150). There were also no significant differences, between the two arms, in the number of suicide attempts. Although no significant difference has been found between the OSTA program and the control treatment concerning the rate of suicide reattempts, we believe that further studies should be conducted to test the effectiveness of more standardized follow-up studies in suicide prevention.

TI Suicide in Ireland: The Influence of Alcohol and Unemployment
SO ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID TIME-SERIES; UNIT-ROOT; MORTALITY; PRICE; TAX
AB We model the behaviour of the Irish suicide rate over the period 1968-2009 using the unemployment rate and the level of alcohol consumption as the principal explanatory variables. We find that alcohol consumption is a significant influence on the suicide rate among younger males. Its influence on the female suicide rate is not well-established, although there is some evidence that it plays a role in the 15-24 age group. The unemployment rate is also a significant influence on the male suicide rate in the younger age groups but evidence of its influence on the female suicide rate is lacking. The behaviour of suicide rates among males aged 55 and over and females aged 25 and over is unaccounted for by our model. The findings suggest that higher alcohol consumption played a significant role in the very rapid increase in suicide mortality among young Irish males between the late 1980s and the end of the century. In the early twenty first century a combination of falling alcohol consumption and low unemployment led to a marked reduction in suicide rates. The recent rise in suicide rates may be attributed to the sharp rise in unemployment, especially among males, but it has been moderated by the continuing fall in alcohol consumption. Finally, we discuss some policy implications of our findings.

AB Suicide rates vary among racel- and age-defined groups, yet little is known about how Suicide risk factors differentially impact individual groups. This study assessed differential associations of socioeconomic status among age- and race-defined groups Of suicide victims. A database containing demographic information on declared suicides in Fulton County, GA, from 1 January 1988 through 31 December 2003 was combined with annual per capita income by zip code in Atlanta, GA. Analyses were performed to evaluate differential associations of socioeconomic status among age- and race-defined groups Of Suicide victims. Compared with the respective ethnic Populations of Fulton County, white Suicide victims lived in areas with lower per capita income ($51,232 vs. $35,893); African American suicide victims did not (S 17,384 vs. S 18,179). Elderly Suicide victims (>= 65 years) were more likely to live in the lowest per capita income areas compared with other age groups (OR 1.80, 95% C.I. 1.14, 2.84). Cox proportional hazards models showed increasing income increased the instantaneous risk of suicide among adolescents (HR 2.76; 95% C.I. 2.15, 3.53), particularly African American adolescents (FIR 4.22; 95% C.I. 2.19, 8.11), and decreased risk among the elderly (HR 0.58; 95% C.I. 0.50, 0.68). Socioeconomic status had differential associations among age- and race-defined groups of suicide victims. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Two biomarkers of suicide risk; non-suppression in the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) and low 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been reported to be predictors of suicide in mood disorders. The interrelation of the two systems seems to be different in suicide attempters compared with depressed inpatients who have not made a suicide attempt, indicating that the two biomarkers may be seen as independent. This investigation examined the interrelation of low CSF 5-HIAA and DST non-suppression in suicide victims with mood disorder. Fifty-eight mood disorder inpatients not receiving any treatment with antidepressants underwent lumbar puncture and the DST. Plasma cortisol levels at 8:00 a.m., 4:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. were analysed in relation to CSF 5-HIAA. All patients were followed up for causes of death and suicides were verified with death certificates. During follow-up (mean 21 years), 11 (19%) patients had committed suicide. In male suicide victims (n=6), the serum cortisol level at 4:00 p.m. showed a significant positive con-elation with CSF 5-HIAA. Low CSF 5-HIAA predicted all early suicides (within I year), whereas all males who committed suicide after 1 year were DST non-suppressors. In female suicide victims (n=5), the post-DST serum cortisol did not correlate with CSF 5-HIAA. Low CSF 5-HIAA and DST non-suppression are orthogonal biologic risk factors for suicide in male mood disorder inpatients. CSF 5-HIAA is associated with short-term suicide risk; dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis seems to be a long-term suicide predictor. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Relationships between serum cholesterol and suicidal behavior have been reported. As suicidal behavior is common in cocaine dependence, we looked for a relationship with serum cholesterol. To do this, we compared 57 cocaine-dependent patients who had attempted suicide with 111 cocaine-dependent patients who had never attempted suicide for their admission total serum cholesterol levels. We found that there were no significant differences between cocaine-dependent patients who had or had not attempted suicide in their total serum cholesterol levels. Also, there were no significant correlations between total serum cholesterol levels and scores on the Barratt Impulsivity Scale. Thus, admission total serum cholesterol does not appear to be clinically useful in the assessment of suicidal behavior in cocaine-dependent patients.

AB Background: When a person with alcohol use disorder commits suicide, do the immediate family members (parents, spouses, and children) react differently from the relatives of non-alcohol-related suicides?
   Methods: From a series of 427 psychological autopsies conducted in Estonia we selected 261 cases of suicide where the key informants were close relatives. Of the 261 suicides, 148 met the DSM-IV criteria for alcohol use disorder (alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence), while 113 did not. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate the association in terms of emotions.
   Results: The spouses of alcohol misusing suicides were significantly more likely to react with anger than those when alcohol did not complicate the picture (adjusted OR = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.4-0.4). The children of persons with alcohol use disorder, who committed suicide were less likely to feel guilty (adjusted OR = 0.2, 95% CI = 0.1-0.8) or abandoned (adjusted OR = 0.2, 95% Cl = 0.1-0.7) than children of non-alcohol-related suicide victims. There were no statistically significant differences in surviving parents' emotions.
   Conclusions: Alcohol use disorder before suicide changes affective responses in spouses and children who are left behind. Bereavement counsellors should be alert for complex grief and mourning responses among this group of suicide survivors. (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Suicide is a leading cause of death and is significantly elevated among those with substance use disorders (SUDs). However, specific mechanisms of suicide in this population have been relatively understudied. The depression-distress amplification model posits that one pathway to increased suicide risk is through the intensification of depressive symptoms by anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns. However, this model has not been tested in populations with SUDs. The current study tested the depression-distress amplification model of suicide risk and examined the relation of anxiety sensitivity to suicide risk in a sample of men in residential SUD treatment. Consistent with prior work, anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns were significantly associated with suicide risk. Moreover, and consistent with the depression distress amplification model, anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns related to elevated suicide risk among those with a current major depressive episode specifically, above and beyond insomnia (another risk factor for suicide) and relevant covariates. The results of this study corroborate the relevance of anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns and the depression-distress amplification model to suicide risk in an at-risk clinical sample of SUD patients. Findings suggest the importance of assessing anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns and targeting this vulnerability through brief interventions to reduce suicide risk. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Our study aimed to examine the interplay between clinical and social predictors of future suicide attempt and the transition from suicidal ideation to suicide attempt in depressive disorders. Sixty-six Malaysian inpatients with a depressive disorder were assessed at index admission and within 1 year for suicide attempt, suicidal ideation, depression severity, life event changes, treatment history and relevant clinical and sodo-demographic factors. One-fifth of suicidal ideators transitioned to a future suicide attempt. All future attempters (12/66) had prior ideation and 83% of attempters had a prior attempt. The highest risk for transitioning from ideation to attempt was 5 months post-discharge. Single predictor models showed that previous psychiatric hospitalization and ideation severity were shared predictors of future attempt and ideation to attempt transition. Substance use disorders (especially alcohol) predicted future attempt and approached significance for the transition process. Low socio-economic status predicted the transition process while major personal injury/illness predicted future suicide attempt. Past suicide attempt, subjective depression severity and medication compliance predicted only future suicide attempt. The absence of prior suicide attempt did not eliminate the risk of future attempt. Given the limited sample, future larger studies on mechanisms underlying the interactions of such predictors are needed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB On a day in November, the body of a 31-year-old man was found near a swimming lake with two open and partly emptied fish tins lying next to him. Further investigations showed that the man had been allergic to fish protein and suffered from severe depression and drug psychosis. Already some days before the suicide, he had repeatedly asked for fish to kill himself. Although the results of the chemical and toxicological examinations were negative, the autopsy findings and histological tests suggest that death was caused by an anaphylactic reaction.

LA English
DT Review
DE Gender; Suicide; Deliberate selfharm; Parasuicide; Social
   constructionism
AB In developed Western societies, it is well known that more men than women commit suicide each year, whereas women are more likely to be involved in suicide attempts. Despite these differences, public policies in the West have tended to treat gender as a descriptive, rather than causal, factor in suicidal behaviours. However, differences between socially constructed masculinities and femininities may impact on suicide-related behaviours and help explain gender differences in both behaviours and outcome. This literature review considers suicide through the lens of gender, drawing on a social constructionist perspective to explain differences between women and men in suicidal behaviour. In particular it focuses on individual and life history factors, social and community variables and living and working conditions. It will be argued that suicide-related behaviours, like health-behaviours more generally, are influenced by (and influence) demonstrations of masculinities and femininities. Finally, it will explore how a gendered view of suicidal behaviour will be of potential benefit to public health policies aimed at reducing gender differences in suicidal behaviour.

AB Considerable evidence supports the view that depressive illness and suicidal behaviour stem from perturbations of neuroplasticity. Presently, we assessed whether depressed individuals who died by suicide displayed brain region-specific changes in brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and whether such effects varied by gender. Using postmortem samples from non-psychiatric controls and depressed individuals who died by suicide, BDNF protein levels were assessed within the hippocampus and frontopolar prefrontal cortex using Western blot. As expected, BDNF levels were reduced within the frontopolar prefrontal cortex among female depressed suicides; however, males showed no such effect. Contrastingly, within the hippocampus, depressed male but not female suicides displayed significant reductions of BDNF protein levels. Although the mechanisms driving the gender and brain region specific BDNF changes are unclear, our data do support the notion that complex alterations of neuroplasticity may be fundamentally involved in the illness.

AB Disturbances in serotonin neuroregulation and in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity are both likely, and possibly independent, factors in the genesis of suicidal behavior. This analysis considers whether clinically accessible measures of these two disturbances have additive value in the estimation of risk for suicide. Seventy-four inpatients with RDC major or schizoaffective depressive disorders entered a prospective follow-up study from 1978-1981, underwent a dexamethasone suppression test (DST) and had fasting serum cholesterol levels available in the medical record. As reported earlier, patients who had had an abnormal DST result were significantly more likely to commit suicide during follow-up. Serum cholesterol concentrations did not differ by DST result and low cholesterol values were associated with subsequent suicide when age was included as a covariate. These results indicate that, with the use of age-appropriate thresholds, serum cholesterol concentrations may be combined with DST results to provide a clinically useful estimate of suicide risk.

AB Serotonergic dysfunction has been implicated in mood disorders and in the pathophysiology of suicidality. A functional polymorphism (a 44-base pair insertion (L)/deletion (S)) in the promoter of the gene encoding the serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR), associated with mood disorders, has been inconsistently associated with suicidality. To add to this debate, we designed a case-control study involving 62 suicide victims and 72 controls matched for age, gender and ethnicity. All subjects underwent forensic investigation. No association could be detected between the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and suicide. This result is consistent with the proposal that different genes are involved in hopelessness and suicidal behavior or in depressive illness. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background. Psychiatric co-morbidity is thought to be an important problem in suicide, but it has been little investigated. This study aims to investigate patterns of co-morbidity in a group of male suicide completers.
   Method. One hundred and fifteen male suicide completers from the Greater Montreal Area and 82 matched community controls were assessed using proxy-based diagnostic interviews. Patterns of co-morbidity were investigated using latent class analysis.
   Results. Three subgroups of male suicide completers were identified (L-2=171.62, df=2012, P<0.05), they differed significantly in the amount of co-morbidity (Kruskal-Wallis chi(2)=71.227, df=2, P < 0.000) and exhibited different diagnostic profiles. Co-morbidity was particularly found in subjects with disorders characterized by impulsive and impulsive-aggressive traits, whereas subjects without those traits had levels of co-morbidity which were not significantly different from those of controls (chi(2)=8.17, df=4, P=0.086).
   Conclusions. Suicide completers can be divided into at least three subgroups according to comorbidity: a low co-morbidity group, a substance-dependent group and a group exhibiting childhood onset of psychopathology.

AB Aims: Tobacco dependence and suicidal behaviors have been repeatedly associated in several studies but their relationship is still unclear. We aim to investigate, specifically, the association between the level of tobacco dependence and the severity of suicidal outcomes among suicide attempters, as well as the relationship of impulsivity with both conditions.
   Methods: We examined a cross-sectional sample of 542 adult suicide attempters to compare the characteristics of the attempts depending on the level of tobacco dependence, which was assessed with the Fagerstrom test.
   Results: Smokers with heavy dependence (Fagerstrom >= 7) made more attempts and reached higher medical lethality compared to non-smokers. Smokers with moderate dependence were not associated with features of severity in the suicide attempts. The combination of high impulsivity and heavy tobacco dependence showed an additive effect on the number of suicide attempts.
   Conclusions: A high or very high level of tobacco dependence could indicate a specific vulnerability leading to more severe suicide attempts. Impulsive attempters with heavy tobacco dependence were particularly at risk. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated retrospectively the forensic autopsy cases of suicide by self-immolation in Berlin from 1990 to 2000. There were 46 cases (35 men and 11 women), corresponding to 0.76% of all known suicides committed in Berlin during this period. The most common reasons for self-immolation were separation from a partner or financial problems. Two individuals had political reasons. There was a history of mental disturbances in 65% of these suicide cases. The location of the self-immolation was outdoors in 65%, the rest were indoors, except for three victims, who committed suicide in their cars. In nearly all cases, the individuals had doused themselves with art inflammable fluid, usually petrol. One-third of the victims died from burn shock, about 20% from a combination of severe burns and inhalation trauma. The median body surface area burnt was 78% for all cases. The blood had a mean 21% carboxyhemoglobin concentration and 0.07 mug/ml of cyanide. Suicide by self-immolation was committed under the influence of drugs in nine cases and of alcohol in 11 cases.

ID REASONS PEOPLE; PARASUICIDE; MOTIVATION; SCALE
AB The association between motives for deliberate self-harm (DSH), level of suicide intent, and history of DSH is poorly understood. As part of the WHO/ EURO Multicentre Study on Suicidal Behavior, the Suicide Intent Scale, and the Motives for Parasuicide Questionnaire were administered to 146 patients presenting with DSH in the Cork region in Ireland. DSH patients reporting high suicide intent were more motivated to escape from their problem (M = 3.15, p <.00 1) compared to those with low suicide intent, who were more motivated to appeal to others (M = 1. 6 1, p <. 00 1) and to get a temporary break from their problem (M = 2.47, p <.00 1). Repeaters more often reported motives aimed at escape (M = 2.98, p <.0 1), revenge (M =.60, p <.005), and appeal (M = 1.43, p = <.05). Selfharming patients are characterized by ambivalence and struggle with aversive thoughts and situations. Therapeutic approaches should include distress management and coping strategies.

AB Although attempted suicide and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) differ in several important ways, a significant number of individuals report histories of both behaviors. The current study further examined the relations between NSSI and attempted suicide among psychiatric inpatients. Self-report questionnaires were administered to 117 psychiatric inpatients at a general hospital (M=39.45 years old, S.D. = 12.84 years, range = 17-73 years). We found that presence and number of NSSI episodes were significantly related to presence and number of suicide attempts. Supporting the importance of NSSI assessment, patients' history of NSSI (presence and frequency) was more strongly associated with history of suicide attempts than were patients' depressive symptoms, hopelessness, and symptoms of borderline personality disorder, and as strongly associated with suicide attempt history as current levels of suicidal ideation. Finally, among patients with a history of suicide attempts, those with an NSSI history reported significantly greater lethal intent for their most severe attempt, and patients' number of prior NSSI episodes was positively correlated with the level of lethal intent associated with their most severe suicide attempt.

The age range of suicides is 22-96 years, mean 58.8 years. In 16 cases the age was upper 65. Scene of death was at home in 27 cases (of which 6 on bed), in a car in 2 cases and in an open place in 4 cases. Uncertain cases happened during hunting. The implements used in suicides were shotgun in 14 cases, rifles in 7, handguns in I I and a humane veterinary killer in 1. In suicides single entrance wounds were found, apart I case with two entrance wounds. A script manifesting suicidal intent was present in 6 cases. Homicides showed both single and multiple entrance wounds: in the cases of multiple entrance wounds, no sign of contact/near contact injuries were seen. In 4 cases, bodies were hidden.

AB This study aims to highlight the factors associated with suicide method among psychiatric patients in a general hospital in Korea. In a sample of 467 suicides by patients who had received mental health care in a general hospital in Korea, the relationship between suicide method and time of death as well as clinical characteristics, including psychiatric adiagnosis, was examined using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Compared with the general population, psychiatric patients, regardless of disorder, committed suicide by jumping from heights more often than by hanging (OR=2.35-8.64). In particular, patients with psychotic disorders and female patients were more likely to use jumping from a height than hanging to kill themselves (OR=2.98 and 1.83, respectively). Patients were more likely to use suicide methods other than hanging (e.g., OR=6.7 for jumping, 53 for drowning, and 2.7 for self-poisoning) between midnight and dawn. Possible suicide-prevention strategies suggested by this study include limiting access to or fencing off tall structures in close proximity to psychiatric institutions and residential care homes. At night, limiting access to or instituting heightened supervision of tall structures is specifically indicated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In order to examine suicidality and its correlates in type 1 diabetics 412 African-American type 1 diabetics and 404 African-American controls underwent a semi-structured interview that asked if they had ever attempted suicide. Patients completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Hostility and Direction of Hostility Questionnaire (HDHQ), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Diabetics and controls were compared for their rate of suicide attempt. Diabetic patients who had or had never attempted suicide were compared on socio-demographic and clinical data. It was found that diabetics were 3 to 4 times more likely to attempt suicide than controls (13.3% vs 3.5%, respectively, P<0.001.) Diabetic attempters were significantly more likely to be female, depressed and hostile, and to report a history of childhood trauma, smoking, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse than diabetic non-attempters. Multivariate analyses showed that female sex, severity of childhood abuse, history of alcohol abuse, and depression were significantly and independently associated with having attempted suicide. These results suggest that African-Americans with type 1 diabetes have a raised risk of attempting suicide. Suicide risk in diabetics appears to be multifactorial and includes gender, developmental, personality, psychiatric, and substance abuse determinants. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Background: The mortality risk is high among individuals dependent on heroin, and suicide is a severe consequence of long-term heroin use. We estimated the incidence of suicide mortality and its risk factors in a large Asian cohort with heroin dependence.
   Methods: A consecutive series of 2750 inpatients dependent on heroin admitted to a psychiatric center in northern Taiwan between 1990 and 2010 were retrospectively enrolled as the study cohort. These patients were linked to the Taiwan National Mortality Database to obtain each mortality event. We determined the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) for each cause of death. Among the deceased, 69 deaths were due to suicide (cases); 138 controls were randomly selected using risk-set density sampling based on a nested case-control design. We collected clinical information from subjects' medical records. Multivariate conditional logistic regression was employed to explore the correlates of suicide mortality.
   Results: The findings showed a 7.9-fold SMR for all-cause mortality among heroin users compared to the general population while the SMR for suicide mortality was 16.2. Multivariate analysis showed that suicide attempt as the reason for the index admission (adjusted risk ratio [RR] = 4.29, p = 0.035) and depressive syndrome anytime during life (adjusted RR = 2.61, p = 0.019) were associated with the risk of suicide mortality.
   Conclusions: Individuals dependent on heroin are more likely to die of suicide compared to the general population. We recommend that clinical psychiatric staff carefully gather information related to the identified risk factors to prevent suicide among heroin users. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Substance use is a risk factor for suicide, suicide attempts, and fatal and non-fatal overdose, but to date, little has been done to integrate the research on suicidal behavior and overdose among substance users. This study reviews the literature on suicide and overdose among substance users with the goal of illuminating the similarities and differences between these two events. A structured review resulted in 15 articles (describing 14 unique studies) published between 1990 and 2010 that examined both overdose and suicide in samples of substance users. There is some evidence that substance users who attempt suicide are more likely to report an overdose and vice versa. This relationship may be partially explained by the fact that overdose is a common method of suicide. The results of the literature review also indicate that substance users with a history of both events may represent a group with particularly poor psychological and social functioning and severe drug-related problems. Further research is needed to understand the overlap of, and differences between, suicide and accidental overdose among individuals who misuse substances, particularly individuals who primarily use substances other than heroin. An improved understanding of the interrelationships between suicide and unintentional overdose among individuals who use alcohol or drugs is necessary to guide the development of effective prevention and intervention approaches.

AB There have been no detailed descriptions of psychiatric patients who have died by suicide pact. We examined the social and clinical characteristics of pact cases in England and Wales using a national clinical survey sample of people who died by suicide pact and who had been in recent (< 12 months) contact with mental health services. Over the study period (1996-2005), there were 278 cases of suicide who had died in a pact, 77 (28%) of whom had been in recent service contact. The most common cause of death overall was by carbon monoxide poisoning, but those in contact with services were more likely to use more violent methods compared with other pact victims. Nearly half (47%) had affective disorder and 68% had previously self-harmed. Over a quarter (29%) had died within 3 months of discharge from psychiatric care and 36% had missed their last service appointment. Pact cases were more likely than solitary suicide cases to have experienced recent adverse life events, typically family problems. Measures that may prevent suicide pacts in the mentally ill include the effective treatment of depression and closer supervision in both in-patient and community settings. Awareness of the family environment may contribute to reduced risk. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All fights reserved.

AB In recent years, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and sequence variations within and near the BDNF gene have been studied for associations with various psychiatric disorders, including suicidal behavior. Since our previous work on completed suicide in Slavic population showed an association of the functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6265 in the BDNF gene, we decided to extend the investigation and test additional SNPs in the BDNF gene, rs7124442, rs10767664, rs962369, rs12273363, rs908867, rs1491850, and rs1491851, for association with completed suicide. Our study subjects were Caucasians, and included 486 suicide completers and 289 controls. The case/control comparisons of allele, genotype and haplotype frequency distributions were performed by means of Pearson's X-2 tests. Analyses of allele and genotype frequency distributions of the sudied SNPs did not reveal any significant differences between the controls and suicide completers. Haplotype analysis (rs7124442-rs10767664-rs962369-rs12273363-rs908867) showed an association of the haplotype C-A-T-C-C (p(corr)= 0.038) with completed suicide, indicating that these SNPs on a haplotype level may play a role in completed suicide phenotype in our study sample.

AB Introduction: We have conducted an ecological study to assess the association between antidepressant prescribing and suicide rates using the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) health data, making this the largest ecological study in recent times.
   Method: Data were derived for the years 19952008 from the OECD health data set. The residuals for all variables were adjusted for country and year within each country. These were then analysed to identify predictors of suicide rate. Pearson's rank correlation coefficient and linear regression model were employed to assess associations and identify significant predictors of suicide rate.
   Results: Suicide rate has significant positive correlations with antidepressant rates (p=0.031) and unemployment (p=0.028). It also has a significant negative correlation with inpatient psychiatric beds (p=0.039). The actual coefficients are less than +/-0.16, indicating weak relationships. After adjusting for other variables, the only variable that is a statistically significant predictor of suicide rate is antidepressant prescribing (p=0.005, r(2)=0.09).
   Discussion: Our analysis using this large data set suggests a statistically significant, albeit weak positive, association between antidepressant prescribing and suicide rates.

AB Background: The number of female veterans is increasing. Veterans Administration (VA) enrollment increased over 40% from past eras. However, little research has focused on their mental health. We reviewed literature to examine associations of substance use with suicide in female veterans, identify research gaps, and inform future studies.
   Methods: Google Scholar, Pub Med, and PsychINFO were searched using: substance use, female veteran, and suicide. Exclusion criteria (e.g., not discussing U.S. veterans) left 17 articles.
   Results: Nine studies examined completed suicide among veterans. In most recent years, rates of deaths were greater for veterans than nonveterans, including females. Completed suicide was associated with past trauma, young age, and a mental disorder. Studies have often not addressed substance use. Three studies examined completed suicide among VA treated veterans without examining substance use as an associated factor. Rates of completed suicides were also higher among veterans than nonveterans, including females. A large proportion of females also had a mental diagnosis. Five studies examined substance use and attempted or completed suicide among VA treated veterans. Veterans in poor mental health had increased odds of suicide mortality; women with a substance use disorder (SUD) had a higher hazard ratio for completed suicide than men with a SUD. Engagement in substance abuse treatment decreased odds of suicide attempt among veterans.
   Conclusion: Available data suggest that suicide rates are higher among female veterans than women in the general population. Substance use may increase the likelihood of suicidal behaviors among female veterans, particularly those with a mental diagnosis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Suicidal behavior often accompanies both borderline personality disorder (BPD) and severe mood disorders, and comorbidity between the two appears to further increase suicide risk. The current study aims to quantify the risk of suicidality conferred by comorbid BPD diagnosis or features in three affective disorders: major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BP) and schizoaffective disorder. One hundred forty-nine (149) psychiatric inpatients were assessed by SCID I and II, and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Logistic regression analyses investigated the associations between previous suicide attempt and BPD diagnosis or features in patients with MDD, BP, and schizoaffective disorder, as well as a history of manic or major depressive episodes, and psychotic symptoms. Comorbid BPD diagnosis significantly increased suicide risk in the whole sample, and in those with MDD, BP, and history of depressive episode or psychotic symptoms. Each additional borderline feature also increased risk of past suicide attempt in these same groups (excepting BP) and in those with a previous manic episode. Of the BPD criteria, only unstable relationships and impulsivity independently predicted past suicide attempt. Overall, among patients with severe mood disorders, the presence of comorbid BPD features or disorder appears to substantially increase the risk of suicide attempts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Background: The extensive literature on the area-level association between socioeconomic characteristics and suicide indicates that the more deprived and socially fragmented an area, the higher its suicide rate. Relatively few studies have examined the association between the incidence of non-fatal suicidal behaviour and area characteristics.
   Aim: This study investigated the area-level association between hospital-treated deliberate self-harm, deprivation and social fragmentation in Ireland.
   Methods: During 2002-2004, the Irish National Registry of Deliberate Self Harm collected data on self-harm presentations to 38 of Ireland's 40 hospital accident and emergency (A&E) departments, using a standardised methodology that included geocoding patient addresses to small-area level. Annual deliberate self-harm incidence rates and levels of deprivation and social fragmentation were examined nationally and by geographic area. Negative binomial regression was used to investigate the small-area association between deliberate self-harm, deprivation and social fragmentation.
   Results: During 2002-2004, an estimated 32 777 deliberate self-harm presentations to A&E departments were made by 25 797 individuals. The total, male and female annual incidence rates were 204, 172 and 237 per 100 000, respectively. There were striking geographic differences in deliberate self-harm presentation rates which were largely explained by the distribution of deprivation, fragmentation, age and gender, and interactions between these factors. Deprivation, rather than fragmentation, had the stronger independent effect on small-area rates of self-harm.
   Conclusions: The highest rates of hospital-treated deliberate self-harm in Ireland are in deprived urban areas. Priority should be given to these areas when implementing community-based interventions aimed at reducing suicidal behaviour.

AB The present study explored both socioeconomic and climatic factors to obtain a more comprehensive view of the asymmetric regional suicide death rate during 1998-2006 in Taiwan. The annual suicide death rate, population and meteorological data from 19 cities/counties in Taiwan were analysed by multiple regression. Five socioeconomic (sex ratio, no spouse, aged, unemployment and low income) and three climatic (temperature, rainfall and sunshine) factors were identified as significant, explaining 59.0% of the variance in the total suicide death rate. 'Without spouse' and 'aged' were associated with the highest risk, while low income with financial aids' was strongly protective. The most influential climatic factor was 'temperature,' which was negatively correlated with suicide. 'Sunshine' was positively associated with suicide. The socioeconomic and climatic factors contributed 52.7% and 6.8%, respectively, to the variance of the total suicide death rate. Limitations of the study included the fact that no individual events were considered, the study was of relatively short duration and it was confined to the territory of Taiwan. Socioeconomic factors outweighed climatic factors in explaining regional differences in the suicide death rate in Taiwan. Temperature weighed more than sunshine. 'Thermotherapy' seems more clinically relevant than the popular light therapy, at least in Taiwan. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study is to analyze the fatalities due to suicide in the period of 1991-2000. The autopsy reports of 719 suicide cases during that period of the Department of Forensic Medicine, University of Szeged were reviewed retrospectively. The victim's age, sex, way of commitment, place of death, the presence of alcohol and drug influence and survival time were recorded.
   Five hundred and one of the (69.6%) total 719 suicide fatalities were men and 218 (30.4%) were women. The largest age groups were 41-50 in men, in women we experienced a 'double-peak' of age groups 41-50 and 71-80.
   The most frequent way of committal was hanging (46%). The results revealed that 38.8% of the 474 victims whose blood and/or urine alcohol concentration measurement were carried out consumed alcohol prior to the act.
   The presence of licit drugs in 12% of not drug-related cases were experienced. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents. Self-harm is the most important risk factor for suicide, yet the majority of self-harm does not come to the attention of health services. The purpose of this study was to establish the relative incidence of adolescent suicide, hospital-treated self-harm and self-harm in the community.
   Annual suicide rates were calculated for 15-17 year-old in the Cork and Kerry region in Ireland based on data from the Central Statistics Office. Rates of hospital-treated self-harm were collected by the Irish National Registry of Deliberate Self-Harm. Rates of self-harm in the community were assessed using a survey of 3,881 adolescents, the Child and Adolescent Self-harm in Europe study.
   The annual suicide rate was 10/100,000. Suicide was six times more common among boys than girls. The annual incidence rate of hospital-treated self-harm was approximately 344/100,000, with the female rate almost twice the male rate. The rate of self-harm in the community was 5,551/100,000, and girls were almost four times more likely to report self-harm. For every boy who died by suicide, 16 presented to hospital with self-harm and 146 reported self-harm in the community. For every female suicide, 162 girls presented to hospital with self-harm and 3,296 reported self-harm.
   Gender differences in relative rates of self-harm and suicide are very large, with boys who have harmed themselves at particularly high risk of suicide. Knowledge of the relative incidence of self-harm and suicide in adolescents can inform prevention programmes and services.

AB This study aimed at validating two new assessment tools, the Stigma of Suicide Attempt (STOSA) scale and the Stigma of Suicide and Suicide Survivor (STOSASS) scale. The Devaluation-Discrimination scale of Link et al. was translated into Italian and adapted to measure stigma towards suicidal behavior. Both scales were administered to a mixed sample including members of the general population (n=282), patients with a mental disorder (n=113), suicide attempters (n=57) and people who had lost a significant other to suicide (n=75). Reliability of the scales was good in terms of both internal coherence and test-retest stability. Factor analysis produced an acceptable solution for the STOSA-scale. Items were distributed into two factors, one grouping items to measure supportive, respectful and caring attitudes, the other factor grouping items oriented towards stigmatizing attitudes and beliefs. The clinical populations were more inclined towards stigmatization of suicide than were people from the general population, who might be less aware of the stigma attached to suicide.
   The two scales may be helpful to quantify stigma at individual level in order to provide targeted supportive interventions, and at population level to measure changes in the beliefs and attitudes of the general population. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
ID RISK-FACTORS; MORTALITY; PREVENTION; TRENDS
AB Background Deliberate self-harm (DSH) is the strongest risk factor for future suicide. Up-to-date information on the extent of risk is lacking.
   Aims To investigate the risk of suicide after DSH during a long follow-up period.
   Method A mortality follow-up study to 2000 was conducted on 11583 patients who presented to hospital after DSH between 1978 and 1997. Data were obtained from a general hospital DSH register in Oxford and the Off ice for National Statistics, and from equivalent mortality registers in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
   Results Three hundred patients had died by suicide or probable suicide. The risk in the first year of follow-up was 0.7% (95% Cl 0.6-0.9%), which was 66 (95% Cl 52-82) times the annual risk of suicide in the general population. The risk after 5 years was 1.7%, at 10 years 2.4% and at 15 years 3.0%. The risk was far higher in men than in women (hazard ratio 2.8,95% Cl 2.2-3.6). In both genders it increased markedly with age at initial presentation.
   Conclusions Following DSH there is a significant and persistent risk of suicide, which varies markedly between genders and age groups. Reduction in the risk of suicide following DSH must be a key element in national suicide prevention strategies.

AB A range of executive function (EF) deficits have been associated with Borderline Personality (BPD), a disorder characterized by high rates of suicide. However, the role of EF and suicide risk in BPD has not been examined. This exploratory study compared working memory, Stroop interference, motor inhibition (SSRT) and Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) decision making performance in 42 women with BPD and 41 healthy controls. The sensitivity of EF to suicidal risk as assessed by the Suicide Behaviour Questionnaire-R (Osman etal., 2001) was also tested. Women with BPD performed similar to controls on all EF except decision making. Weaker Stroop interference control, however, was the only significant EF contributor to suicide risk, demonstrating near equivalent contributions to that of depression. EF and depression collectively explained 34% of the adjusted variance in total suicide risk. Contrary to expectations, IGT decision making and motor inhibition were not associated with overall suicide risk. Only Stroop interference control contributed significantly to lifetime suicide intent/attempt beyond depression or BPD severity. As prior suicide attempt remains the strongest predictor of future attempt (Soloff et al., 2003), the sensitivity of stroop performance to suicidal risk may be clinically important. Interference control may represent a "diathesis" for suicide that is independent of psychiatric diagnoses. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cigarette smoking has been associated with an increased risk of suicide. Patients with psychosis are more likely to smoke cigarettes and are also at an increased risk of suicide. The aim of this study was to compare risk for suicidal behavior among patients with psychosis who were current smokers, previous smokers and nonsmokers. We studied 1812 of the 1825 participants who took part in the Australian Survey of High Impact Psychosis (SHIP) for whom smoking data was available. We identified predictors for lifetime suicide attempts using univariate logistic regression analysis. These variables were retained for the multiple logistic regression models if they were a significant predictor of lifetime suicide attempts. A series of multiple logistic regressions were then conducted to predict lifetime suicide attempts using current smoking status and lifetime smoking status as independent variables, respectively, while controlling for the retained predictor variables. Current smoking and lifetime smoking were statistically significant predictors of lifetime suicide attempts. However adding the covariates to a logistic regression model reduced this association to non-significance. The strongest predictors were self-harm in the past 12 months, the presence of lifetime depressive symptoms and a diagnosis of psychotic depression. Identification of suicide risk factors is essential for successful suicide prevention. While previous research highlights the importance of cigarette smoking as an important risk factor for suicidal behaviors including in patients with psychosis, these results must be interpreted within the context of methodological issues.

AB Help-seeking behaviour for suicidality is low and the reasons for this have not systematically been examined. The aim of the current study was to examine the relationship between suicide stigma, suicide literacy and help-seeking attitudes and intentions. One thousand two hundred seventy-four Australian adults recruited via Facebook completed an online survey assessing a range of mental health outcomes. High suicide literacy and low suicide stigma were significantly associated with more positive help-seeking attitudes and, among a subsample of 534, greater intentions to seek help. Attribution of suicide to isolation was associated with more positive attitudes toward help-seeking and greater intentions to seek help, while respondents experiencing suicidal ideation had more negative attitudes toward help-seeking and lower intentions to seek help. Lower depressive symptoms, older age and female gender were associated with more positive help-seeking attitudes and higher help-seeking intentions. However, there were differential associations of specific suicide knowledge items and specific stigmatising attitudes with help-seeking outcomes; suggesting a nuanced approach may be required to promote help seeking for suicidality. Suicide knowledge and attitudes play an important role in the help-seeking process for suicide and should be carefully considered in the development of public awareness campaigns.

AB Suicidality in patients with schizophrenia is high. To clarify the characteristics of suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia, we investigated suicide attempters with schizophrenia spectrum disorders in comparison with patients with mood disorders. One hundred patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and 155 patients with mood disorders admitted to an emergency department after a suicide attempt were interviewed in detail on items concerning 1) demographic characteristics, 2) previous suicidal behavior, and 3) index suicidal behavior. Differences between the two groups were subsequently analyzed. Patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders showed a lower incidence of previous deliberate self-harm, and a higher incidence of a subsequent suicide attempt more than 1 year after the previous suicide attempt as well as a higher lethality of index suicide attempt compared to patients with mood disorders. Furthermore, the most common motive for making a suicide attempt in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders was having a mental problem. This study revealed the factors associated with suicide attempts among Japanese patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and the nature of these factors makes it difficult to predict future attempts. This makes clear the importance of continuous long-term follow-up with careful attention to the mental symptoms and psychological burden for such patients. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB The present study examined the association between history of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and history of suicide attempts (SA) among 292 Iraq/Afghanistan veterans, half of whom carried a lifetime diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Consistent with hypotheses, veterans who reported a history of NSSI were significantly more likely to report a history of SA than veterans without a history of NSSI. In addition, logistic regression demonstrated that NSSI remained a significant predictor of SA even after a wide range of covariates (i.e., combat exposure, traumatic brain injury, PTSD, depression, alcohol dependence) were considered. Taken together, these findings suggest that clinicians working with veterans should include NSSI history as part of their standard risk assessment battery. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI The role of tyrosine hydroxylase gene variants in suicide attempt in
   schizophrenia
SO NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Tyrosine hydroxylase gene; Suicide attempt; Schizophrenia; Clinical risk
   factors
AB Evidence has shown that attempted suicide in psychiatric disorders is a complex interplay of genes and environment. Noradrenergic dysfunction due to abnormalities in the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene has been implicated in the pathogenesis of suicidal behavior in mood disorders. However, suicide is a leading cause of mortality in schizophrenia too. Recent evidence suggests that TH gene variants may also increase the risk of suicide attempts in schizophrenia patients, although the interaction with established clinical risk factors is unclear. This study aimed to identify TH gene variants conferring risk for suicide attempt in schizophrenia while accounting for the interaction between this gene and clinical risk factors. We performed analysis on four TH SNPs (rs11564717, rs11042950, rs2070762, rs689) and the common TCAT repeat (UniSTS:240639) for 234 schizophrenia patients (51 suicide attempters and 183 non-attempters). Clinical risk factors and ethnic stratification were included as covariates. Single marker analysis identified the SNP rs11564717 (p = 0.042) and the TCAT((6)) (p = 0.004) as risk variants for suicide attempt. We also identified the haplotype A-A-A-G as a risk factor for suicide attempt (p = 0.0025). In conclusion, our findings suggest that TH polymorphisms may contribute to the risk of attempted suicide in schizophrenia even after accounting for established clinical risk factors and ethnic stratification. Further larger scale studies are needed to confirm these findings and to understand the mechanisms underlying the role of TH gene variants in suicide attempt in schizophrenia.

AB Studying gender differences in Suicidal behaviour is important in developing specific need-based service provisions. We aimed to identify gender-specific characteristics associated with attempted suicide in a general hospital sample in south India. Two hundred and three patients admitted to medical wards following suicide attempts were assessed using a detailed clinical interview, measures of suicide intent (Suicide Intent Scale), lethality (Risk Rescue Rating), depression (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and recent stress (Presumptive Stressful Life Events Scale). The majority of men attempting suicide were single. Men were more likely to use organophosphate poisons in their attempt to kill themselves and had higher rates of mental illness than women. As compared with men, women were more likely to conic from rural areas, had a lower educational status, and had lower rates of employment outside the home. In women, the most common method of suicide attempt was by using plant poisons. Suicide attempt by self-immolation was significantly higher among women. Men had higher suicidal intent than women, although lethality, depression and stress were comparable between the genders. Rural women were more disadvantaged in education; however, in urban areas. men had higher psychiatric morbidity. Our results emphasise the need for a gender-specific approach among people who have attempted suicide. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Factors associated with suicide among African American adult men: a

SO JOURNAL OF MENS HEALTH
LA English
DT Review
DE Suicide; Factors; African American/Black; Men/males
AB The suicide prevalence rate among African American men continues to be lower than Caucasian men, yet an increasing rate of suicide completions among African American men is evident. If the current upward trend persists, the suicide rates among African American men will rival that of Caucasian men. Central to suicide prevention in African American men is an increased examination and understanding of risk and protective factors. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to systematically and critically review the existing literature regarding factors associated with completed suicide among African American adult men.
   Using the Garrard matrix method, 266 potential articles were identified through the search of 14 electronic databases and numerous reference lists. Quality assessment criteria were devised to evaluate the studies' merit and credibility. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, nine empirical studies specifying suicide risk and protective factors were identified. Within these nine studies, nine overarching factors were identified as being associated with suicide among African American adult men. The majority of factors identified were risk factors, with education and economic structure most frequently listed. Age was the only protective factor identified. The quality assessment indicated that published studies were quantitative, with the majority referencing Durkheim's theory on suicide, utilizing national data, and employing regression analyses.

AB Background The suicide rate is a macro indicator of the population's psychosocial wellbeing and an evaluation criterion of the effectiveness of suicide prevention strategies. A high level of injury deaths of undetermined intent (UD) is usually discussed in connection with the validity of suicide statistics. An effort is made to develop a criterion to characterise the quality of suicide statistics.
   Methods Standardised rates of suicides (X60-X84) and UD (Y10-Y34) by the International Classification of Disease version 10 as an average for the past five available years were taken from the WHO European mortality database. Rate ratios were computed by dividing rates of UD by suicide rates.
   Results There is considerable variation in suicide and UD rates among countries. The highest overall rates of UD were registered in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, and the lowest in Greece, Spain and Italy. The EU-15 average UD rate of 1.97 and the rate ratio of 0.194 UD to suicides were combined into a '2-20 benchmark', in which the primary indicator is 2.0 UD cases per 100 000 and the secondary indicator is the proportion of UD to suicides 0.20 (20%), which enables countries to be clustered according to the quality of suicide statistics. The following countries satisfied the benchmark: Greece, Norway, Spain, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Austria, Italy, Romania, Hungary, Ireland and Finland.
   Conclusion This study used the developed '2-20 benchmark' in Europe to assess suicide registration quality in a particular country, to compare the relative position of countries, and to set a target for those European countries that have not yet achieved the benchmark.

ID STATISTICS; RATES; AUTOPSIES; IRELAND; MANNER; US
AB Objective: Valid mortality statistics are important for healthcare planning and research. Suicides and accidents often present a challenge in the classification of the manner of death. The aim of this study was to analyse the reliability of the national suicide statistics by comparing the classification of suicide in the Scandinavian cause of death registers with a reclassification by 8 persons with different medical expertise (psychiatry, forensic pathology and public health) from each of the 3 Scandinavian countries.
   Methods: The cause of death registers in Norway, Sweden and Denmark retrieved available information on a sample of 600 deaths in 2008 from each country. 200 were classified in the registers as suicides, 200 as accidents or undetermined and 200 as natural deaths. The reclassification comprised an assessment of the manner and cause of death as well as the level of certainty.
   Results: In total, 81%, 88% and 90% of deaths registered as suicide in the official mortality statistics were confirmed by experts using the Swedish, Norwegian and Danish data sets, respectively. About 3% of deaths classified as accidents or natural deaths in the cause of death registers were reclassified as suicides. However, after a second reclassification based on additional information, 9% of the natural deaths and accidents were reclassified as suicides in the Norwegian data set, and 21% of the undetermined deaths were reclassified as suicides in the Swedish data set. In total, the levels of certainty of the experts were 87% of suicides in the Norwegian data set, 77% in the Swedish data set and 92% in Danish data set; the uncertainty was highest in poisoning suicides.
   Conclusions: A high percentage of reported suicides were confirmed as being suicides. Few accidents and natural deaths were reclassified as suicides. Hence, reclassification did not increase the overall official suicide statistics of the 3 Scandinavian countries.

AB In order to determine patterns and correlates of attempted suicide amongst heroin users across 3 years, a cohort of 387 heroin users (134 entering maintenance treatment, 134 entering detoxification, 81 entering residential rehabilitation and 38 not entering treatment) were interviewed about suicide attempts at baseline, 12, 24 and 36 months. Across the follow-up period, 11.6% attempted suicide. There were declines in the proportion who attempted suicide each year amongst both males and females and significant declines in Major Depression, suicidal ideation and current suicide plans. Despite this, levels of attempted suicide, suicidal ideation and Major Depression in the cohort remained higher than in the general population. Those who had made a previous suicide attempt were five times more likely to make an attempt across follow-up and there was a strong association between an attempt in any I year and increased probability of an attempt in the subsequent year. A quarter of those who reported suicidal ideation at baseline made an attempt across follow-up. At each interview point, current suicidal ideation was strongly associated with increased risk of a suicide attempt in the following year. Independent predictors of a suicide attempt across follow-up were a lifetime suicide history, baseline suicidal ideation, social isolation and the extent of baseline polydrug use. Given the strong predictive value of suicidal ideation and previous attempts, regular brief screening would appear warranted to identify those at greatest risk. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Converging evidence suggests that acute states of overarousal are common prior to suicidal behavior. Yet, there has been very little theory-driven research of these phenomena. We consider two competing theoretical perspectives. The first is consistent with the interpersonal theory of suicide, which suggests that the prospect of engaging in lethal suicidal behavior should elicit some degree of arousal; however, the effect of arousal will be particularly relevant when considered in the context of an individual's capability for suicide. The second perspective draws from escape-based models, which would suggest that arousal alone should result in increased suicide risk, given the distress associated with high arousal states. Results indicated that the interaction of overarousal and capability for suicide was associated with suicidal symptoms. As overarousal increased, suicidal symptoms increased among high capability individuals and decreased among low capability individuals. These effects were observed beyond the effects of depression, anxiety, age, gender, and marital status. There was no significant main effect of overarousal. Results support a perspective in line with the interpersonal theory, suggesting that overarousal states may be particularly dangerous for individuals who have developed the capability for suicide.

DE Depression; Suicide in Elderly; Cumulative illness rating scale (CIRS)
ID RATING-SCALE; VALIDATION
AB There is little data on suicide among elderly depressed patients seeking psychiatric help. Recent studies have demonstrated that physical illness may increase this risk. We aimed to assess, retrospectively, the association between suicide and physical illness among depressed elderly psychiatric patients. All medical records of patients admitted during a 10-year period to an acute psychiatric ward, after having attempted suicide, were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were: age > 65 years, diagnosis of a depressive disorder and intact cognition. The comparison group consisted of previous or subsequent admissions, closest (by date), of elderly patients, matching the inclusion criteria, but without previous record of attempting suicide, into the same ward. The cumulative illness rating scale (CIRS) score was calculated for each patient. 78 admissions of elderly depressed patients, who had attempted suicide before hospitalization, were examined. The comparison group (n = 87) consisted of the subsequent admission of a similar but not suicidal pre-admission patient. The CIRS total score was significantly higher among suicidal patients (10.2 vs. 8.0; p = 0.0008). Suicidal patients scored higher in the vascular and the respiratory sections of CIRS. Our results support reported findings of higher rates of illness among suicidal elderly patients. The CIRS may be considered an additional tool in assessing risk for suicide in elderly psychiatric subjects. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anxiety sensitivity (AS) has recently been linked to suicidality. Specifically, AS cognitive concerns has been implicated as a risk factor, and AS physical concerns as a protective factor, for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. However, no studies have used structural equation modeling (SEM) to address issues of skewed suicide variables and bifactor modeling of AS to address the high degree of overlap between the lower-order dimensions of AS that limit interpretation of these past findings. AS, suicidal ideation, past suicide attempts, and depression were assessed in a clinical sample of 267 individuals (M age=35.45 years, SD=16.53; 52.1% female). The global AS and AS cognitive concerns factors were positively, significantly associated with suicidal ideation, though these effects were nonsignificant controlling for depression. The global AS factor was positively, significantly associated with suicide attempts, controlling for depression. The current study demonstrated that the relations between AS and suicidal ideation are not maintained when accounting for depression, suggesting that the relation between AS and suicidal ideation may be mediated by depression. The positive relation between global AS and suicide attempts is consistent with theories positing suicide attempts as a consequence of an inability to cope with intolerable distress.

AB Background: Hospital-treated deliberate self harm and suicide among older adults have rarely been examined at a national level.
   Methods: The Irish Central Statistics Office provided suicide and undetermined death data for 1980-2006. The National Registry of Deliberate Self Harm collected data relating to deliberate self harm presentations made in 2006-2008 to all 40 Irish hospital emergency departments.
   Results: Rates of female suicide among older adults (over 55 years) were relatively stable in Ireland during 1980-2006 whereas male rates increased in the 1980s and decreased in more recent decades. Respectively, the annual male and female suicide and undetermined death rate was 22.1 and 7.6 per 100,000 in 1997-2006. Male and female deliberate self harm was 3.0 and 11.0 times higher at 67.4 and 83.4 per 100,000, respectively. Deliberate self harm and suicide decreased in incidence with increasing age. Deliberate self harm generally involved drug overdose (male: 72%; female 85%) or self-cutting (male: 15%; female 9%). The most common methods of suicide were hanging (41%) and drowning (29%) for men and drowning (39%) and drug overdose (24%) for women. City and urban district populations had the highest rates of hospital-treated self harm. The highest suicide rates were in urban districts.
   Conclusions: Older Irish adults have high rates of hospital-treated deliberate self harm but below average rates of suicide. Drowning was relatively common as a method of suicide. Restricting availability of specific medications may reduce both forms of suicidal behavior.

AB Background: Suicide attempts and non-fatal overdoses are both associated with substance use. The aim of the present study was to examine correlates of suicide attempts and non-fatal overdoses simultaneously among individuals seeking addictions treatment.
   Methods: A large U.S. national sample of individuals entering addictions treatment participated in a cross-sectional survey (n = 5892). Multinomial logistic regression modeling tested the adjusted associations of violence, injection drug use, specific substances, and depressive symptoms with a four-category outcome variable based on prior histories of suicide attempt and non-fatal overdose (neither, suicide attempt only, overdose only, both), adjusting for demographic and treatment characteristics.
   Results: Sexual and physical victimization was associated with suicide attempts with or without overdoses (ORs 1.25-2.84), while perpetrating violence was associated with having experienced either or both outcomes (ORs 1.25-1.56). Depressive symptoms had a stronger association with suicide attempts (OR = 3.05) than overdoses (OR = 1.29). Injection drug use was associated with overdoses with or without suicide attempts (ORs 2.65-3.22). Individuals seeking treatment for marijuana use were less likely have overdosed or attempted suicide (ORs 0.39-0.67), while individuals seeking treatment for heroin use were more likely to have overdosed (OR = 1.46). Seeking treatment for use of more than one substance was associated with overdose and overdose and suicide attempt (ORs 1.58-2.51), but not suicide attempt alone.
   Conclusions: The present findings indicate that suicide and overdose are connected yet distinct problems. Individuals who have had a history of both may be a group with particularly poor psychological functioning as well as more severe drug-related problems. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB While linkages between some macroeconomic phenomena and suicides in some countries have been explored, only two studies, hitherto, have established a causal relationship between fiscal austerity and suicide, albeit in a single country. The aim of this study is to provide the first systematic multiple -country evidence of a causal relationship of fiscal austerity on time-, gender-, and age-specific suicide mortality across five Eurozone peripheral countries, namely Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain over the period 1968-2012, while controlling for various socioeconomic differences. The impact of fiscal adjustments is found to be gender-, age- and time-specific. Specifically, fiscal austerity has short-, medium- and long-run suicide increasing effects on the male population in the 65-89 age group. A 1% reduction in government spending is associated with a 138%, 2.42% and 3.32% increase in the short, medium- and long-run, respectively, of male suicides rates in the 65-89 age group in the Eurozone periphery. These results are highly robust to alternative measures of fiscal austerity. Improved labour market institutions help mitigate the negative effects of fiscal austerity on suicide mortality.

AB Serotonergic system dysfunction has been implicated in the etiology of suicide. A large number of genetic studies have focused on the potential involvement of genes coding for components of serotonergic system in suicidal behavior. However, other genes belonging to this system remain to be investigated or have been poorly studied, as is the case of the 5-HT6 receptor (5-HTR6) gene. In this study, we investigated the potential association between the 5-HTR6 gene 267C/T SNP and suicide in a Portuguese population. Blood samples were collected from 179 suicide victims and 189 controls. Genotypes for the 5-HTR6 gene 267C/T SNP were obtained with the restriction enzyme Rsa I. A tendency was found for genotype association between this polymorphism and suicide, but the differences were not statistically significant (chi(2) = 5.37 df = 2, p = 0.068). However, a gender-specific association was detected when comparing the genotype. distribution between mate suicide victims and male controls (chi(2) = 6.988, df = 2, p = 0.030), suggesting that this SNP might have a role in the etiology of suicide in male subjects in the Portuguese population.

AB Nearly all mental disorders increase suicide risk; however, some better predict ideation versus attempts. The interpersonal theory of suicide provides a framework to understand these relationships, via the constructs of thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and acquired capability. The current study examined the relationships between various mental disorders and theory constructs among 997 adult outpatients, controlling for sex and age. Disorders generally symptomatically associated with social withdrawal or potential liability to others (i.e., depressive and bipolar disorders, social phobia, borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, certain drug dependence) were uniquely positively associated with thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness. Disorders associated with potential exposure to painful and provocative events (i.e., posttraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, certain drug use) were associated with increased acquired capability. Notably, alcohol use disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder subtypes, and panic/agoraphobia were negatively associated with thwarted belongingness or perceived burdensomeness; avoidant personality disorder, and certain anxiety disorders and drug use disorders, were associated with decreased acquired capability. Importantly, disorders associated with both thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness may place individuals at greatest risk for suicide if acquired capability develops. Implications for comorbidity and suicide risk assessment and treatment are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The goal of the study was to determine social and diagnostic characteristics of persons who end their lives by jumping from heights and to compare the characteristics of those who jump from bridges with those jumping from other sites. Data on suicide in Switzerland between 1990 and 2003 were collected from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office and from local authorities. Persons who jumped from heights in general were more likely to suffer from schizophrenia than those who used other methods. Persons who jumped from bridges were younger than those committing suicide by other methods. Compared with those who jumped from other sites, subjects were on average 14.3 years younger and more often male. Individuals who jumped from bridges close to psychiatric hospitals were more likely to suffer from psychiatric illness. Individuals who jump from bridges differ in certain characteristics from those who jump from other sites. For future classification it may be helpful to distinguish suicides from bridges from suicides from other heights. For prevention of suicide from bridges, attention should be paid to characteristics of young persons at risk. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of the study was to describe the deaths by suicides that occurred in an area of Southern Italy in the period 1998-2002. Data were obtained from death records, and population estimates for each year were provided by the National Institute of Statistics. A total of 367 suicides were retrieved. The number of suicides was stable for the 5 years recorded, with the highest value for 1998, ranging from 1.4% for ages 0 to 14 to 25.1 % for ages 25 to 44 years. Age-specific rates of suicide showed that the highest rates were in those 75 to 84 years old. Rates are always higher in males, with a tendency to stability or decrease in all age groups in the years observed, except for males in the 45- to 64-year-old age range, in whom an increase from 5.71 to 7.28 was observed. The suicides increased proportionally with age, in those with the lowest level of education (53.3%) and among retirees (46.5%). Hanging/suffocation (44.1%) and jumping from high places (23.2%) were the most frequently used methods of suicide. Males had higher standardized suicide rates ranging from 5.4 per 100,000 in 1999 to 7.7 in 1998, whereas in females the range was 1.4 per 100,000 in 2001 to 2.4 in 1998. The study shows that suicide rates in Southern Italy are lower compared with national trends. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent research suggests that firefighters experience elevated rates of suicidal ideation and behaviors. The interpersonal theory of suicide may shed light on this finding. This theory postulates that suicidal desire is strongest among individuals experiencing perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, and that the combination of suicide desire and acquired capability for suicide is necessary for the development of suicidal behaviors. We tested the propositions of the interpersonal theory in a large sample of current United States firefighters (N=863). Participants completed self-report measures of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, fearlessness about death (FAD; a component of acquired capability), and career suicidal ideation and suicide attempt history. Regression models were used to examine the association between interpersonal theory constructs, career suicidal ideation severity, and the presence of career suicide attempts. In line with theory predictions, the three-way interaction between perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, and FAD was significantly associated with career suicide attempts, beyond participant sex. However, findings were no longer significant after accounting for years of firefighter service or age. Contrary to predictions, the two-way interaction between perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness was not significantly related to career suicidal ideation severity. Applications of the theory to firefighters and future research are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide is a major public health problem and the leading cause of premature death in patients with schizophrenia. Information about the patient's personality is helpful for assessing the risk of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation. The sample consisted of 120 outpatients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, 29 of whom had previously attempted suicide. We used the Temperament and Character Inventory to assess personality differences between patients who had previously attempted and had not previously attempted suicide and between patients who had and did not have current suicidal ideation. Current suicidal ideation was assessed using the four-point severity scale, which is item nine from the Beck Depression Inventory. The character dimension Self-transcendence was shown by logistic regression to be a predictor of lifetime suicide attempts. Low Self-directedness was shown to be a predictor of current suicidal ideation. To prevent suicidal behaviour, it is important to better understand the personality traits associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Suicide attempts and suicidal ideation in schizophrenia may not represent the same phenomenon ranging on a single continuum. The importance of these results suggests that further study is needed.

AB The 2008 financial crisis has been seen as providing an opportunity for core eurozone members to push neoliberal policies onto the periphery in order to construct a European consolidation state. We adapt a policy transfer model to examine the extent to which the Troika transferred neoliberal policy onto Greece and Ireland. The size of the ideological gap between Troika policies and those embedded in the peripheral country was crucial when explaining why the Troika's policies were more brutal, intrusive and long-lasting in Greece than in Ireland, and why Greece proved more resilient to attempts to transfer policy than Ireland.

TI GWAS analysis of suicide attempt in schizophrenia: Main genetic effect
   and interaction with early life trauma
SO NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Suicide; Schizophrenia; Genetics; GWAS; CTQ
ID RISK
AB Objectives: Suicide attempt in schizophrenia is an important clinical issue. We performed a genome-wide association study to identify genetic markers, which increase the risk for suicide attempt in schizophrenia.
   Methods: Suicide attempt lifetime was assessed in 121 schizophrenia patients and defined by the means of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale and the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation. Genotype distribution of 1,205,383 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in patients with suicide attempt lifetime (n = 53) was compared to that in patients without any suicide attempt lifetime (n=68). The same SNPs were analyzed in interaction with childhood trauma.
   Results: None of the variants reached genome-wide significance after multiple test correction. However, the most nominally significant SNP in the in the main genetic model was rs12895203 (p = 0.00001) and the top SNP interacting with Childhood Trauma Questionnaire was the marker rs7897059 (p = 0.00005). The odds-ratio of the top SNP in the main-genetic effect model was 3.91 and in the gene-early trauma interaction model was 1.13.
   Conclusions: Although our data need to be interpreted carefully owing to the small numbers in this cohort and because the results reached just the nominal significance, they suggest that a combination of genetic markers and early life stress might indeed be used to identify patients at risk for suicide attempt.

AB Biobehavioral dispositions can serve as valuable referents for biologically oriented research on core processes with relevance to many psychiatric conditions. The present study examined two such dispositional variables weak response inhibition (or disinhibition; INH-) and threat sensitivity (or fearfulness; THT+) as predictors of the serious transdiagnostic problem of suicide risk in two samples: male and female outpatients from a U.S. clinic (N=1078), and a population-based male military cohort from Finland (N=3855). INH- and THT+ were operationalized through scores on scale measures of disinhibition and fear/fearlessness, known to be related to DSM-defined clinical conditions and brain biomarkers. Suicide risk was assessed by clinician ratings (clinic sample) and questionnaires (both samples). Across samples and alternative suicide indices, INH- and THT+ each contributed uniquely to prediction of suicide risk beyond internalizing and externalizing problems in the case of the clinic sample where diagnostic data were available. Further, in both samples, INH- and THT+ interactively predicted suicide risk, with individuals scoring concurrently high on both dispositions exhibiting markedly augmented risk. Findings demonstrate that dispositional constructs of INH- and THT+ are predictive of suicide risk, and hold potential as referents for biological research on suicidal behavior.

AB Though some preliminary research within the framework of the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide (IPTS; Joiner, 2005) has postulated that restrictive eating may contribute to increased risk for suicide through its effect on the acquired capability for suicide (ACS; i.e., increased fearlessness about death and heightened physical pain tolerance), existing studies have not conducted direct tests of this relationship. To enhance understanding of this relationship, we compared undergraduates who endorsed one form of restrictive eating, fasting, (n=99) to controls endorsing no forms of eating pathology over the lifetime (n=94). We hypothesized that the fasting group would have higher ACS and higher likelihood of suicide attempt history. Contrary to hypotheses, no differences emerged between groups on ACS, and frequency of fasting within the fasting group was not significantly associated with ACS. Consistent with hypotheses, the fasting group was more likely to have suicide attempt history. Though results were not entirely consistent with hypotheses, the current study represents the first attempt at isolating and examining one form of restrictive eating (i.e., fasting) within the context of the IPTS. Results suggest that, in isolation, fasting may not be directly contributing to increases in ACS. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide gene therapy is based on the introduction into tumor cells of a viral or a bacterial gene, which allows the conversion of a non-toxic compound into a lethal drug. Although suicide gene therapy has been successfully used in a large number of in vitro and in vivo studies, its application to cancer patients has not reached the desirable clinical significance. However, recent reports on pre-clinical cancer models demonstrate the huge potential of this strategy when used in combination with new therapeutic approaches. In this review, we summarize the different suicide gene systems and gene delivery vectors addressed to cancer, with particular emphasis on recently developed systems and associated bystander effects. In addition, we review the different strategies that have been used in combination with suicide gene therapy and provide some insights into the future directions of this approach, particularly towards cancer stem cell eradication.

AB Limited research has examined differences in well-established suicide correlates between individuals with various histories of suicidality within the ideation to action framework. We hypothesized that individuals without a history of elevated suicidality would exhibit lowest levels of suicide correlates (perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, emotion dysregulation, depressive symptoms), and group differences would not be present between those with a history of suicidal ideation relative to those with a history of suicide attempts on variables not theorized to contribute to the capability for suicide. Lastly, we hypothesized that those with a prior history of suicide attempt(s) would exhibit higher levels of lifetime painful and provocative events and fearlessness about death relative to those with a history of ideation only. A community sample of adults (N=378) recruited in part on the basis of a history of suicidality completed self-report questionnaires online. The results were largely consistent with our hypotheses. However, there were no differences in fearlessness about death between those with a history of suicidal ideation and those with a history of attempts. Many variables considered robust correlates of suicide may only directly relate to suicidal ideation rather than suicide attempts, thereby limiting their utility in understanding the transition from ideation to action.

AB Many previous studies have suggested that low or lowered serum cholesterol levels may increase the risk of mortality not due to somatic disease: principally, suicide and violent death. Because violent death is rare, some studies have investigated afterwards the relation between cholesterol levels and either suicide attempts in psychiatric populations or violence in criminally violent populations. However, none of these studies have compared cholesterol levels in violent and non-violent suicide attempters. The blood of 25 consecutive drug-free patients following a violent suicide attempt and of 27 patients following a non-violent suicide attempt by drug overdose was drawn in the 24 h following admission. Patients with a diagnosis of alcohol abuse and with cholesterol-lowering therapy were excluded. Age, sex, body mass index, psychiatric diagnosis and the physical conditions of the suicide attempt were investigated. Thirty-two healthy subjects were used as a control group. There were no differences between the groups in age, frequency of psychiatric diagnoses or body mass index. There was more women in the group of non-violent suicide attempters than in that of violent suicide attempters (P < 0.001). In analyses controlling for sex and age, the serum cholesterol concentration was 30% lower (F-2,F-82 = 15.8; P < 0.0001) in the group of violent suicide attempters (147 +/- 54 mg/dl) than in the group of non-violent suicide attempters (209 +/- 38 mg/dl) or control subjects (213 +/- 46 mg/dl). Our results showed that low serum cholesterol level is associated with the violence of the suicide attempt and net with the suicide attempt itself. Further investigations are necessary to determine the usefulness of this easily accessible parameter as a potential risk indicator for violent acts such as violent suicidal behavior in susceptible individuals.

AB To study different aspects of regional pre-synaptic brain I-123-beta-CIT uptake on serotonin and dopamine re-uptake sites in drug-free suicide attempters; in comparison with age- and sex matched control subjects, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) measurements were analysed for regional serotonin re-uptake (5HTT) and dopamine re-uptake (DAT) capacity (binding potential, BP*) after i.v. I-123-beta-CIT administration. All suicide attempters were examined concerning seriousness of the attempt, and DSM-IV diagnosis. Both suicide attempters and control subjects were tested for psychotropic drugs, and completed the Marke-Nyman Temperament (MNT) test, including solidity (level of impulsiveness/initiative) and validity (level of mental energy). We found no significant difference between suicide attempters and control subjects concerning the regional levels of 5HTT BP* or DAT BP*. However, in suicide attempters, but not controls, we found significant regional correlations between MNT variables and SPECT results. We interpret the discrepant findings in suicide attempters and control subjects to be due to a disability of the suicide attempters to regulate their serotonin and dopamine levels, e.g. in response to external stress.

AB Recent findings indicate a relationship between anxiety sensitivity (AS) and suicide in a variety of populations in the United States. However, the link between AS and suicide has not been evaluated in other cultures. Suicide rates in Russia are among the highest worldwide making it an excellent choice to evaluate the cross-cultural robustness of these findings. The current investigation sought to replicate and extend the investigation of AS subfactors (i.e., cognitive, physical, and their interaction) in relation to suicidality in a sample of Russian adults. Participants were 390 adults recruited from Moscow using a geographic sampling method. Findings from the current study indicate that the interaction of AS cognitive concerns and AS physical concerns are associated with elevated rates of suicidality and previous suicide attempt, above and beyond negative affectivity and hazardous alcohol use. Clinicians may benefit from implementing AS reduction strategies with individuals who endorse elevated suicide risk as well as elevated AS cognitive concerns and low AS physical concerns.

AB Despite their impact on interpersonal relationships and health resources, suicide threats are not often studied in those with borderline personality disorder (BPD). The primary aim of this study was to examine clinically relevant predictors of suicide threats in this patient group. Two-hundred and ninety inpatients meeting Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines (DIB-R) and DSM-III-R criteria for BPD were assessed during their index admission using a series of semistructured interviews and a self-report measure. These subjects were then reassessed using the same instruments every 2 years for 16 years. All variables in the bivariate analyses were found to be significant In multivariate analyses, four predictors were found to be significant: feeling abandoned and hopeless, and being demanding and manipulative. The results of this study suggest that suicide threats are often related to emotions connected with interpersonal relationships. Suicide threats may function, albeit maladaptively, to regulate these emotions aroused by interpersonal relationships and bring needed support (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Given the high rate of suicide worldwide, it is imperative to find factors that can confer resiliency to suicide. The goal of the present study was to examine the search for and the presence of meaning in life as possible resilience factors. We hypothesized that the presence of, but not the search for, meaning in life would predict decreased suicidal ideation over an eight-week time period and decreased lifetime odds of a suicide attempt. We also examined a subsidiary hypothesis that the presence of, but not the search for, meaning in life would mediate the relationship between the two variables associated with the interpersonal psychological theory of suicide (i.e., perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness) and suicidal ideation. Our results were generally in support of our hypothesis: presence of meaning in life predicted decreased suicidal ideation over time and lower lifetime odds of a suicide attempt. Surprisingly, search for meaning in life also predicted decreased suicidal ideation over time. Finally, the search for, but not presence of, meaning in life mediated the relationship between the interpersonal psychological theory variables and suicidal ideation. These findings suggest that interventions that target meaning in life may be useful to attenuate suicide risk in individuals. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article examined suicide attempt rates at first psychiatric hospitalization and risk factors for subsequent suicide attempts over the early course of schizophrenia in national population-based data. Data were extracted from the National Psychiatric Hospitalization Case Registry of the State of Israel that contains all first psychiatric admissions with schizophrenia 1989-1992 and were followed up to 1996 (N = 2293). Attempted suicide rates were: 8.5% (n = 196) at the time of first psychiatric hospitalization and 6.6% (n = 151) over the follow-up period of 4 to 7 years. Of those with a suicide attempt at first admission, 31.6% (n = 62) made a subsequent suicide attempt during the follow-up period (OR = 10.44, 95% CIs = 7.22 to 15.09). Risk profiles were derived using recursive partitioning to predict sub-groups at risk of a subsequent suicide attempt. Those characterized by an attempt at the time of first admission were college educated, female and not married (45.9% (17/37), OR = 13.46, 95% CIs = 6.89 to 26.3). The risk profiles together correctly classified 90.7% (137/151) of subsequent suicide attempts. Suicide attempts at first admission and premorbid years of education have long-term prognostic utility and risk profiles are available. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide has been reported as the second or third most common cause of death in children and adolescents worldwide. In this study, cases of under the age of 19 years submitted to the Institute of Forensic Medicine, First Specialization Board between 1996 and 2000 as suicides by the Board were evaluated retrospectively. The cases included in this study were the cases bearing locally questionable components, so had been submitted to the evaluations by the Board in order to eradicate the doubts. A total of 43 cases were investigated regarding age, gender, cause of death, manner of death, place. of death, time of death, and the risk factors.
   Of the 43 cases evaluated, 31 cases were female and 12 cases were male. The notable suicide method was found to be firearms. Although it was clear that that not all of the suicide cases in this age group had been submitted to the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the most striking result of this study, nevertheless, was that girls constituted the 72% of suicidal deaths in this age group.

AB Over-consumption of alcohol and/or abuse of other drugs are closely linked to attempted or completed suicides. In this retrospective 10-year study (2001-2010), we compared the toxicology findings in hanging suicides (n = 4551) with drug poisoning (intoxication) suicides (n = 2468). The mean age of hanging deaths was 49 +/- 19 y (+/- SD) and 80% were male, compared with a mean age of 52 +/- 17 y and 47% males for the intoxication deaths. Poly-drug use was more common in poisoning suicides with an average of 3.6 drugs/case compared with 1.8 drugs/case in hangings. Moreover, 31% of hangings were negative for alcohol and/or drugs. Alcohol was detected (>0.20 g/L) in femoral blood in 30% of hanging suicides (mean 1.39 g/L) and 36% of drug poisonings (mean 1.39 g/L). The median BACs did not depend on the person's age or gender (p > 0.05). Ethanol, paracetamol, citalopram, diazepam, propiomazine, alimemazine and zopiclone were amongst the top-ten drugs detected in both methods of suicide. With the exception of ethanol, the concentrations of drugs in blood were considerably higher in the poisoning deaths, as might be expected. Regardless of the method of suicide, antidepressants and/or antipsychotics were common findings, which could implicate mental health as a significant suicide risk factor.

AB Suicide and self-harm are major public health issues worldwide. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death worldwide and self-harm is strongly associated with suicide risk. Although the literature on the epidemiology and aetiology of suicide consistently report mental illness to be a key contributory factor to suicide risk, it is also recognized that mental illness alone does not account for all the risk associated with suicidal behaviour. As such, this chapter brings together the international literature on the factors associated with suicide and self-harm from different disciplines, including psychology, sociology, biology, and psychiatry. We describe the rates, characteristics, and indicators of risk for suicide and self-harm, including demographic factors (e.g., sex, age), socio-economic and cultural factors (e.g., marital status, ethnicity, religion, migration, unemployment, political regime), temporal factors (e.g., seasonality, significant dates), psychological factors (e.g., personality traits), biological factors (e.g., genetics), and psychiatric factors (e.g., mental illness). Further, we discuss the relationship between suicide and self-harm, in addition to current perspectives on the management of self-harm. Although there is a large literature on suicide and self-harm, there are still considerable gaps in our knowledge about the factors associated with suicidal behaviour. First, there is substantial variation in the depth of understanding of factors associated with suicidal behaviour. Second, the literature is not truly international, with comparatively little research from developing, low-income and non-Western countries. Future work should contextualize the rates and risk factors associated with suicide and suicidal behaviour in different countries.

TI Risk factors for suicide in Hungary: a case-control study

DT Article

   NORTHERN-IRELAND; YOUNG-PEOPLE; DISORDERS; PREVENTION; UNEMPLOYMENT;
   POPULATION; PREVALENCE
AB Background: Hungary previously had one of the highest suicide rates in the world, but experienced major social and economic changes from 1990 onwards. We aimed to investigate the antecedents of suicide in Hungary. We hypothesised that suicide in Hungary would be associated with both risk factors for suicide as identified in Western studies, and experiences related to social and economic restructuring.
   Methods: We carried out a controlled psychological autopsy study. Informants for 194 cases (suicide deaths in Budapest and Pest County 2002-2004) and 194 controls were interviewed by clinicians using a detailed schedule.
   Results: Many of the demographic and clinical risk factors associated with suicide in other settings were also associated with suicide in Hungary; for example, being unmarried or having no current relationship, lack of other social contacts, low educational attainment, history of self-harm, current diagnosis of affective disorder (including bipolar disorder) or personality disorder, and experiencing a recent major adverse life event. A number of variables reflecting experiences since economic restructuring were also associated with suicide; for example, unemployment, concern over work propects, changes in living standards, practising religion. Just 20% of cases with evidence of depression at the time of death had received antidepressants.
   Conclusion: Suicide rates in Hungary are falling. Our study identified a number of risk factors related to individual-level demographic and clinical characteristics, and possibly recent societal change. Improved management of psychiatric disorder and self-harm may result in further reductions in suicide rates.

TI Experiences of suicide bereavement: a qualitative study exploring the
   role of the GP
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
DE bereavement; family practice; general practitioners; grief; qualitative
   research; suicide
ID HELP-SEEKING; STIGMA; IMPACT
AB Background
   Suicide is a major public health issue. GPs are often on the front line in responding to a suicide. They are called on to support individuals and families in the aftermath of suicide yet there is a dearth of research, particularly from patients' perspectives, on how to provide optimal care for those grieving a suicide in the primary care setting.
   Aim
   To improve GP management of suicide bereavement by exploring the lived experiences of affected individuals, focusing on the GP's involvement in the grief process.
   Design and setting
   A qualitative approach was adopted using focus group interviews with individuals from suicide bereavement support groups at three locations across Ireland.
   Method
   Support groups were contacted by letter. Fifteen interested participants formed three focus groups. Interviews were audiorecorded and transcripts were analysed thematically using the framework method.
   Results
   Three major themes dominated: the need for acknowledgement - of the loss and of the lived life of the deceased; the role of stigma in the aftermath of the loss; and the need for proactive provision of direction and support during the grief journey. The GP was identified as ideally positioned in the community to cater for the needs of the bereaved.
   Conclusion
   Suicide can result in prolonged, complex grief generating specific patient needs. Stigma may function as a barrier to help seeking. The GP should consider initiating contact with the bereaved. Recommendations have been made to support GPs in their care of the suicide bereaved.

AB Suicide is a complex trait resulting from the interaction of several predisposing factors, among which genes seem to play an important role. Alterations in the noradrenergic system have been observed in postmortem brain studies of suicide victims when compared to controls. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that genetic variants of the alpha(2A) adrenergic receptor gene are implicated in suicide and/or have a modulatory effect on personality traits that are believed to mediate suicidal behavior. We studied a sample of suicides (N = 110) and control subjects (N = 130) for genetic variation at four loci, including three in the promoter region (g-1800t, c-1291 g and the g-261a) of the alpha(2A) adrenergic receptor gene, and a potentially functional locus, N251K, which leads to an amino acid change (asparagine to lysine). No significant differences were observed at the promoter loci in terms of allelic or genotypic distribution between suicides and controls. However, analysis of the functional polymorphism N251K revealed that the 251 K allele was only present among suicides, though only three suicide cases had this allele, two of which were homozygous. These results are preliminary. If confirmed, they suggest that variation at the alpha(2A) adrenergic receptor gene may play a role in a small proportion of suicide cases.

AB Suicides with chain saws and circular saws are extreme exceptions, in particular with regard to females and concerning the neck region. We report two of such rare cases involving young women. A 30-year-old female with a known schizoaffective psychosis killed herself with an electric chain saw. The autopsy revealed a deep saw cut of the neck and shoulder with partial transection of the cervical spine. Several tentative saw cuts were present on the right lower jaw. A 29-year-old woman suffering from depression committed suicide by use of a circular saw. She inflicted herself fatal neck injuries with at least three separate cutting procedures. Our cases were characterized by the following features: female sex, young adulthood, no occupational experience with saws, psychiatric disorders, absence of alcohol or drugs, use of an aggressive method of suicide, focus of saw injuries on the right side of the neck, detection of tentative saw cuts or several trials, identical causes of death (exsanguination and blood aspiration).

AB There have been several forensic pathological studies on the distinction between falls from height and homicidal blows in blunt head trauma, but few studies have focused on suicidal blows. Self-inflicted blunt head trauma is usually a part of a complex suicide with more than one suicidal method applied. Actually, no reports on suicide indicate blunt head trauma to be the singular cause of death in recent publications. Cases with self-inflicted blunt trauma are often challenging for those involved in the investigation because they are confronted with findings that are also found in homicides. A refined guideline to differentiate suicidal blows from homicidal blows in blunt head trauma allows for a more accurate representation of the events surrounding death.
   This paper presents two cases of suicide by self-inflicted blunt head trauma in which blunt head trauma from repeatedly hitting the decedent's head with a hammer was considered to be the only cause of death. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Several studies have investigated a connection between diabetes and major depressive disorder (MDD). Whether these associations are mediated by changes in insulin is not known. Insulin seems to play a role in violent behaviour. To further elucidate the role of insulin in MDD and violent, aggressive, or impulsive behaviour, we measured insulin in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 74 patients with a recent suicide attempt. Patients were divided into those with and without MDD, and they were also subgrouped by whether the suicide attempt was considered to be violent or not. It was found that patients with a violent suicide attempt had significantly higher CSF-insulin (5.9+/-1.0 pmol/l) than those with a nonviolent attempt (5.3+/-0.7 pmol/l). In contrast, there were no significant differences in CSF-insulin between patients with MDD and patients without. Our findings support the hypothesis that CSF-insulin is involved in violent behaviour, but not connected to MDD as such. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A number of differences exist between the seasonality of suicide and suicidal behaviour. Case fatality is one index of the relationship between these phenomena. The purpose of this study was to use contemporaneous data to examine the impact of case fatality on the seasonality of suicidal behaviour. All deliberate self-harm (ICD9 E950-58) hospitalisations (DSH) and deaths (suicide) for 1984-93 were extracted from the Western Australia case register (N=22 883). Case fatality was calculated by method of suicide. Data were arranged in time series by standardised month according to case fatality; sex and age and analysed using spectral analysis. We found that DSH involving low case fatal methods is seasonal with a spring peak (95% confidence interval). The explained variance of the seasonal rhythm increases with age. Suicide involving high case fatal methods is not seasonal. The increase in DSH seasonality with age may be related to a parallel increase in case fatality.

AB The present study used validated clinical interviews to assess the effect of comorbid PTSD-depression on suicidal behavior over the course of 12 months in 309 Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans. Logistic regression models demonstrated that comorbid PTSD-depression was a statistically significant predictor of suicide attempts at the 12-month follow-up in both the total sample and in the subset of veterans with PTSD/depression (n=98). In contrast, gender, age, race, sexual orientation, and baseline history of suicide attempts did not have significant effects. These findings suggest that comorbid PTSD-depression may be a significant risk factor for future suicidal behavior in veterans. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI Patterns of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior in Northern Ireland and
   Associations with Conflict Related Trauma
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SELF-HARM; HEALTH
AB In this study, data from the World Mental Health Survey's Northern Ireland (NI) Study of Health and Stress (NISHS) was used to assess the associations between conflict- and non-conflict-related traumatic events and suicidal behaviour, controlling for age and gender and the effects of mental disorders in NI. DSM mental disorders and suicidal ideation, plans and attempts were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) in a multi-stage, clustered area probability household sample (N = 4,340, response rate 68.4%). The traumatic event categories were based on event types listed in the PTSD section of the CIDI. Suicidal ideation and attempts were more common in women than men, however, rates of suicide plans were similar for both genders. People with mood, anxiety and substance disorders were significantly more likely than those without to endorse suicidal ideation, plan or attempt. The highest odds ratios for all suicidal behaviors were for people with any mental disorder. However, the odds of seriously considering suicide were significantly higher for people with conflict and non-conflict-related traumatic events compared with people who had not experienced a traumatic event. The odds of having a suicide plan remain significantly higher for people with conflict- related traumatic events compared to those with only non-conflict-related events and no traumatic events. Finally, the odds of suicide attempt were significantly higher for people who have only non-conflict-related traumatic events compared with the other two categories. The results suggest that traumatic events associated with the NI conflict may be associated with suicidal ideation and plans, and this effect appears to be in addition to that explained by the presence of mental disorders. The reduced rates of suicide attempts among people who have had a conflict-related traumatic event may reflect a higher rate of single, fatal suicide attempts in this population.

AB Objectives: Previous research has suggested that medical marijuana policies lead to reductions in suicide rates. In this study, we further investigate the association between these policies and within-state changes in suicide risk.
   Methods: Data on suicide deaths (n = 662,993) from the National Vital Statistics System Multiple Cause of Death files were combined with living population data. Fixed-effects regression methods were employed to control for state differences in suicide rates and national and state secular trends. Analyses extended prior research that suggested a protective effect of medical marijuana policies by incorporating newer data and additional covariates.
   Results: After adjustment for race/ethnicity, tobacco control policies, and other covariates, we found no association between medical marijuana policy and suicide risk in the population ages 15 and older (OR= 1.000; 95% CI: 0.956,1.045; p = 0.98), among men overall (OR= 0.996; 95% CI: 0.951, 1.043; p = 0.87) or for any other age-by-sex groups.
   Conclusion: We find no statistically significant association between medical marijuana policy and suicide risk. These results contradict prior analyses which did not control for race/ethnicity and certain state characteristics such as tobacco control policies. Failure to control for these factors in future analyses would likely bias estimates of the associations between medical marijuana policy and health outcomes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Identification of biological indicators of suicide risk is important given advantages of biomarker-based models. Decreased high frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV) may be a biomarker of suicide risk. The aim of this research was to determine whether HF HRV differs between suicide attempters and non-attempters. Using the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), we compared HF HRV between females with and without a history of suicide attempt, all with a lifetime diagnosis of a mood disorder. To investigate a potential mechanism explaining association between HF HRV and suicide, we examined the association between self-reported anger and HF HRV. Results of an Area under the Curve (AUC) analysis showed attempters had a lower cumulative HF HRV during the TSST than non-attempters. In addition, while there was no difference in self-reported anger at baseline, the increase in anger was greater in at tempters, and negatively associated with HF HRV. Results suggest that suicide attempters have a reduced capacity to regulate their response to stress, and that reduced capacity to regulate anger may be a mechanism through which decreased HF HRV can lead to an increase in suicide risk. Our results have implications for the prevention of suicidal behavior in at-risk populations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Subpopulations of patients with adjustment disorder are at increased risk for suicide. The current study investigated whether personality traits, including alexithymia, temperament, and character, are associated with an increased risk of suicide in individuals with adjustment disorder. Age- and sex-matched patients meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria for adjustment disorder with (n=92) and without (n=92) a history of suicide attempts were recruited for the present study. Ninety-two healthy individuals who did not meet diagnostic criteria for Axis I or II diagnoses were used as controls. The Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20) and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) were used to assess personality traits. Significantly higher total and subscale scores on the TAS-20, including on the difficulty-identifying-feelings (DIF) and difficulty-describing-feelings (DDF) subscales, and lower scores on the TCI cooperativeness subscale were noted in adjustment-disorder patients with previous suicide attempt.. In the multivariate regression analysis, high DDF and DIF and low cooperativeness increased the risk of suicide attempts in adjustment-disorder patients. A subsequent path analysis revealed that high DDF had a direct effect on suicide attempts, whereas high DIF had an indirect effect on suicide attempts via low cooperativeness.

AB All suicides and related prior attempts occurring in Northern Ireland over two years were analyzed, focusing on number and timing of attempts, method, and mental health diagnoses. Cases were derived from coroner's records, with 90% subsequently linked to associated general practice records. Of those included, 45% recorded at least one prior attempt (with 59% switching from less to more lethal methods between attempt and suicide). Compared with those recording one attempt, those with 2+ attempts were more likely to have used less lethal methods at the suicide (OR=2.77: 95% CI=1.06, 7.23); and those using less lethal methods at the attempts were more likely to persist with these into the suicide (OR=3.21: 0.79, 13.07). Finally, those with preexisting mental problems were more likely to use less lethal methods in the suicide: severe mental illness (OR=7.88: 1.58, 39.43); common mental problems (OR=3.68: 0.83, 16.30); and alcohol/drugs related (OR=2.02: 0.41, 9.95). This analysis uses readily available data to highlight the persisting use of less lethal methods by visible and vulnerable attempters who eventually complete their suicide. Further analysis of such conditions could allow more effective prevention strategies to be developed.

AB The relationship between physical abuse in childhood and Suicide attempts in adulthood has long been known. However, the phenomenon has not been examined in patients who are undergoing treatment for alcoholism. In this Study we seek an answer to the questions of whether exposure to physical abuse in childhood predisposes to violence, which in turn increases the likelihood of suicidal behavior in adulthood. The sample studied comprised 172 patients with alcohol dependence and with data for childhood physical abuse, trait aggression and lifetime suicide attempts. The measuring instruments used for the investigation were the European Addiction Severity Index, the Buss and Perry Aggression Questionnaire and the Janus Questionnaire. Generalized Linear Model analysis revealed a significant gender-dependent association between physical abuse by the parents suffered in childhood and later suicide attempts. In females, childhood victimization by parents increased the likelihood of suicide attempts by approximately 15 times; in males, the increase was about two fold. Association of suicide attempts with the overall level of trait aggression also significantly interacted with gender. In females, the increase in the level of total scores of the trait aggression from 0 to 50 points (approximately the mean level in the study population) elevated the likelihood of the suicide attempts by almost ninefold, whereas the analogous increase in males was about threefold. The results draw attention to the importance of preventing suicide in clinical populations of alcohol-dependent patients. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Religion and the risk of suicide: longitudinal study of over 1 million
   people
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY

DT Article
ID NORTHERN-IRELAND; MORTALITY; SECULARIZATION; DEPRESSION; ALCOHOL; RATES
AB Background
   Durkheim's seminal historical study demonstrated that religious affiliation reduces suicide risk, but it is unclear whether this protective effect persists in modern, more secular societies.
   Aims
   To examine suicide risk according to Christian religious affiliation and by inference to examine underlying mechanisms for suicide risk. If church attendance is important, risk should be lowest for Roman Catholics and highest for those with no religion; if religiosity is important, then 'conservative' Christians should fare best.
   Method
   A 9-year study followed 1 106 104 people aged 16-74 years at the 2001 UK census, using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for census-based cohort attributes.
   Results
   In fully adjusted models analysing 1119 cases of suicide, Roman Catholics, Protestants and those professing no religion recorded similar risks. The risk associated with conservative Christians was lower than that for Catholics (HR=0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.97).
   Conclusions
   The relationship between religious affiliation and suicide established by Durkheim may not pertain in societies where suicide rates are highest at younger ages. Risks are similar for those with and without a religious affiliation, and Catholics (who traditionally are characterised by higher levels of church attendance) do not demonstrate lower risk of suicide. However, religious affiliation is a poor measure of religiosity, except for a small group of conservative Christians, although their lower risk of suicide may be attributable to factors such as lower risk behaviour and alcohol consumption.

ID SUICIDE HOTSPOTS; INTERVENTIONS; FATALITIES
AB Background: Traumatic deaths, and more particularly suicides, during international travel receive a disproportionately low level of attention in the travel medicine literature. We describe the demographic profile of international travellers whose death occurred at the Cliffs of Moher along the Atlantic seaboard in Ireland.
   Methods: Coroners' files for the 25 years between 1993 and 2017 were interrogated. All cases of death on or at the cliffs were examined, and demographic data were extracted, including date of death, gender, age, nationality, whether the victims were alone at the cliffs prior to their death, whether the fall was witnessed, prevailing weather conditions, post-mortem examinations, toxicology reports and inquest verdicts.
   Results: Overall, 66 deaths occurred on or at the base of the Cliffs of Moher during the period 1993 through August 2017. In total, 18 (27.3%) of the victims were international visitors to Ireland, including 11 males (61.1%). The mean age of travellers (n = 17) was 34.2 years. Victims were nationals of 12 different countries, with 13 being European nationals. Most deaths occurred in summer (n = 7) or spring (n = 6), with eight deaths (44%) reported at weekends. In total, 15 victims (83.3%) had walked along the cliff path alone. A jump or fall from the cliffs was witnessed in only two cases (11.1%). Post-mortem examinations revealed multiple traumatic injuries consistent with a fall from a height. Four cases had evidence of alcohol intoxication. Suicide or open verdicts were returned in 50% (n = 9) of the cases.
   Conclusions: Travelling alone to the site, purchasing one-way tickets, or depositing belongings on the clifftop support the possibility of suicidal intent, while being intoxicated could be a co-factor in suicidal jumps or support the possibility of an accidental fall. This knowledge could help to identify travellers at the greatest risk of death at cliffs.

AB Previous research has found associations between non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs), yet the nature of this relationship remains equivocal. The goal of the present study was to examine how lifetime NSSI frequency and individual NSSI functions relate to a history of suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt. Data were collected via a large (N=13,396) web-based survey of university students between the ages of 18 and 29. After demographics and psychiatric conditions were controlled for, we found a positive curvilinear relationship between NSSI frequency and each of the suicide outcomes. When examined among those with STBs, bipolar disorder and problematic substance use remained positively associated with risk for suicide attempt, but not NSSI. Analyses of individual NSSI functions showed differential associations with STBs of varying severity. Specifically, nearly every NSSI function was significantly related to suicide attempt, with functions related to avoiding committing suicide, coping with self-hatred, and feeling generation (anti-dissociation) showing the strongest risks for suicide attempt. From both clinical and research perspectives, these findings suggest the importance of assessing multiple reasons for engaging in self-injury. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: As one of the leading causes of death around the world, suicide is a global public health threat. Due to the paucity of systematic studies, there exist vast variations in suicide ideation, attempts and suicide rates between various regions of Chinese aging communities.
   Objectives: Our systematic study aims to (1) identify studies describing the epidemiology of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and behaviors among global Chinese communities; (2) conduct systematic review of suicide prevalence; (3) provide cross-cultural insights on this public health issue in the diverse Chinese elderly in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Asian societies and Western countries. Data sources: Using the PRISMA statement, we performed systematic review including studies describing suicidal ideation, attempts, and behavior among Chinese older adults in different communities. Literature searches were conducted by using both medical and social science data bases in English and Chinese.
   Results: Forty-nine studies met inclusion criteria. Whereas suicide in Chinese aging population is a multifaceted issue, culturally appropriate and inter-disciplinary approach to improve the quality of life for the Chinese older adults is critical.
   Conclusions: Future research is needed to explore the risk and protective factors associated with suicidal thoughts, attempts and behaviors in representative Chinese aging populations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aims: To determine the lifetime and recent histories of attempted suicide among entrants to treatment for heroin dependence in three treatment modalities and a non-treatment comparison group; and to ascertain factors associated with a recent history of attempted suicide. Design: Cross-sectional structured interview. Setting: Sydney, Australia. Participants: Six hundred and fifteen current heroin users: 201 entering methadone/buprenorphine maintenance (MT), 201 entering detoxification (DTX), 133 entering drug free residential rehabilitation (RR) and 80 not in treatment (NT). Findings: A lifetime history of attempted suicide was reported by 34% of subjects, 13% had attempted suicide in the preceding year and 5% had done so in the preceding month. Females were more likely to have lifetime (44% versus 28%) and 12 month (21% versus 9%) suicide attempt histories. The 12 month prevalence of attempted suicide among treatment groups ranged between 11% (MT, NT) and 17% (RR). Factors associated with recent suicide attempts were: being an RR entrant, female gender, younger age, less education, more extensive polydrug use, benzodiazepine use, recent heroin overdose, Major Depression, current suicidal ideation, Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Conclusions: Recent suicidal behaviour is a major clinical problem for heroin users, and for females and RR entrants in particular. An essential adjunct to treatment for heroin dependence is routine screening for depression and suicidal ideation, with the provision of appropriate treatment where needed.

AB individuals with a first episode of psychotic illness are known to be at high risk of suicide, yet little is understood about the timing of risk in this critical period. The present study aimed to examine the temporal pattern of suicide risk in patients with early psychosis (EP) and to determine whether discrete periods of significantly elevated risk can be identified up to 24 months after commencing treatment. Suicidality ratings collected each month as part of patient routine assessment at the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre (EPPIC) were retrieved from the service database for patients treated between December 2002 and December 2005 (N = 696). Time-series analysis was performed on suicide risk estimated from the aggregated data of 94 individuals who met the study inclusion criteria. Suicide risk was highest in the first month of treatment, decreasing rapidly over the next 6 months and declining slightly thereafter. A power function adequately described this curvilinear trend. Fluctuations around the trend were unpredictable, except for a mild tendency to reverse from month to month, and did not reach statistical significance. The findings suggest limited scope for preventative interventions driven by chronology alone. Intensive routine suicide screening across the course of treatment may facilitate identification and early management of EP patients at suicide risk. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB In order to assess the potential benefit in human lives if all geographical regions in the US (Northeast, South, Midwest, and West) achieved the lowest suicide and homicide rates observed within these regions, age-, race- and gender-adjusted suicide and homicide rates for each of the four regions were calculated based on data retrieved using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention database for 1999-2004. Data on known risk factors were retrieved from online sources. Overall suicide rates (10.42 per 100,000) exceeded homicide rates (6.97 per 100,000). Almost 27% (12,942 lives per year) of the 288,222 suicide and homicide deaths during the study period might have been avoided if all US regions achieved the mortality rate reported by the Northeast. A firearm was used in 55% of all suicides and 66% of all homicides. In the total estimate of avoidable deaths, firearm suicides (90%) and firearm homicides (75%) were overrepresented. The Northeast had the lowest access to firearms (20%) contrasted to almost double in the other regions, whereas greater firearms availability was related to unrestricted firearm legislation. Measures to restrict firearms availability should be highly prioritized in the public health agenda in order to achieve an impressive benefit in human lives. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

ID IRELAND; ANTIDEPRESSANTS; PREVENTION; STATISTICS
AB Objectives: This study examines the backgrounds of 100 people who died by suicide and whose cases were adjudicated on consecutively over a five-year period, by the two Cork City coroners.
   Method: Five main sources of information were used: coroners, relatives, investigating police, general practitioners and hospital records. The cases were examined under the headings of age and gender differences; methods used; social circumstances; illness; treatment prior to death and previous attempts. Certain information may have been missed because peers were not interviewed. There were 72 males and 28 females.
   Results: In the 15-44 age group, the male female ratio was 4:1; in those over 45 the ratio was almost equal. Men were more likely to be unmarried even when age differences were taken into account. All the women and all but seven of the men had a psychiatric diagnosis, but women were more than more likely to have received medical treatment in the year before their suicide than men (OR = 6.6). Thirty-seven had made at least one previous suicide attempt.
   Conclusions: The study confirms that suicide, particularly for men is becoming more a young person's problem. Psychiatric illness is the single commonest association. Over a third of suicides had made a previous attempt. These findings point to the need to improve recognition of psychological distress and find effective methods to reduce parasuicide.

AB Background: This study examined (1) whether pain diagnoses were risk factors for non-fatal suicide attempts before and after inpatient hospitalizations in alcohol-dependent veterans, and (2) the characteristics of pain patients who attempted suicide.
   Method: Administrative data from the Veterans Health Administration were used to identify veterans with an alcohol use disorder who had an inpatient hospitalization during fiscal year 2011 (n=13,047). Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the associations of suicide attempts before and after hospitalizations with pain diagnoses, demographics, medical comorbidity, and psychiatric comorbidity.
   Results: Bivariate analyses and analyses controlling for demographics and medical comorbidity, indicated that pain diagnoses were significantly associated with suicide attempts in the 365 days before hospitalization (Odds Ratio (Adjusted) [OR] = 1.22). This effect was not significant after controlling for psychiatric disorders. Pain diagnoses were not identified as risk factors of suicide attempts in the 365 days following discharge. Subgroup analyses among only those with a pain diagnosis revealed that being younger (OR = 2.64), being female (OR = 2.28), and having an attempt in the year prior to hospitalization (OR = 4.11) were risk factors of suicide attempts in the year following hospitalization. Additionally, younger age (OR = 2.13) and depression (OR = 3.53) were associated with attempts in the year prior to the hospitalization.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that psychiatric disorders account for the relationship between pain diagnoses and past suicide attempts among hospitalized alcohol-dependent veterans. Pain-specific suicide prevention efforts may be better targeted at less intensive levels of care. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI Attitudes towards abortion in graduate and non-graduate entrants to
   medical school in Ireland
SO JOURNAL OF FAMILY PLANNING AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE
LA English
DT Article
ID GENERAL-PRACTITIONERS; STUDENTS ATTITUDES; TERMINATION; PREGNANCY
AB Background Recent legislation has sought to clarify abortion law in Ireland, allowing abortion where pregnancy endangers a woman's life, including through risk of suicide. Previous studies have shown that medical students' attitudes towards abortion can predict their likelihood to provide abortion care services in the future.
   Aim To survey graduate-entry (GEM) and undergraduate-entry (i.e. school-leaver; DEM) medical students in Ireland on their attitudes to abortion, in light of recent changes in legislation.
   Methods Irish medical students completed an 18-item anonymous questionnaire, measuring knowledge and attitudes regarding abortion, and current Irish abortion law.
   Results Of 525 respondents (response rate 52.9%), 92% indicated that abortion was justified in specific circumstances. Over 80% stated that abortion was justified in cases of risk to the life of the mother (including risk of suicide) or where the fetus would not survive until term. 58.2% believed abortion was justified in the case of certain fetal developmental and genetic defects. 56.6% expressed a willingness to perform a legal abortion in their future practice. GEM students were more likely than DEM students to support availability of abortion services across each of the clinical scenarios. This effect was largely mediated by differences in religious adherence and continent-of-origin across both cohorts.
   Conclusions The majority of students, regardless of mode of entry, believed abortion was justified where there was a real risk to the life of the mother (including risk of suicide) or in cases of fetal non-viability. The most significant determinant of students' beliefs was religious adherence.

AB The Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS) has been supported by recent research. However, the nature of the models' three major constructs - perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness and acquired capability - requires further investigation. In this paper, we test a number of hypotheses about the predictors and correlates of the IPTS constructs. Participants aged 32-38 from an Australian population-based longitudinal cohort study (n=1167) were assessed. IPTS constructs were measured by items from the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ) and Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale (ACSS), alongside demographic and additional measures, measured concurrently or approximately 8 years earlier. Cross-sectional analyses evaluating the IPTS supported earlier work. Mental health was significantly related to all three IPTS constructs, but depression and anxiety caseness were associated only with perceived burdensomeness. Various social support measures were differentially associated with the three constructs. Stressful events and lifetime traumas had robust independent associations with acquired capability for suicide only. The IPTS model provides a useful framework for conceptualising suicide risk. The findings highlight the importance of perceived social support in suicide risk, identify the importance of personality and other factors as new avenues of research, and provide some validation for the independence of the constructs.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the impact of two risk factors working together on a measure of suicide probability in a highly vulnerable group who were male prisoners identified as being at risk of self harm. The first risk factor was psychiatric symptoms, including general psychiatric symptoms and symptoms of personality disorder. The second risk factor was psychological precursors of suicidal thoughts and behaviours which were defeat, entrapment, and hopelessness. Sixty-five male prisoners from a high secure prison in NW England, UK, were recruited, all of whom were considered at risk of suicide by prison staff. General psychiatric symptoms and symptoms of personality disorders predicted the probability of suicide. Hopelessness amplified the strength of the positive relationship between general psychiatric symptoms and suicide probability. These amplification effects acted most strongly on suicidal ideation as opposed to negative self evaluations or hostility. In contrast, defeat, entrapment and hopelessness did not affect the relationship between personality disorders and suicide probability. Clinical assessments of highly vulnerable individuals, as exemplified by prisoners, should include measures of a range of general psychiatric symptoms, together with measures of psychological components, in particular perceptions of hopelessness.

AB A retrospective study was carried out on 132 fatalities due to gunshot wounds secondary to long firearms. One group of suicide (n = 72) and one group of homicide (n = 60) were statistically compared regarding age and sex of the victim, number of shots, range of fire, direction of the projectile(s), anatomical distribution of entrance sites, weapon and ammunition types and the nature of eventual associated traumatic lesions. The frequency of suicide was higher when the victim's age increased. Females constituted about 43% of the homicide victims and about 8% of the suicide victims. 51.5% of the homicide victims and about 10% of the suicide victims had sustained more than one gunshot wound. Close range was respectively found in 53.5% of the homicide cases and in all suicide cases. Most of the suicide cases (85% of the cases) showed typical entrance sites. Entrance sites in the limbs and lateral or posterior wall of the chest were only encountered in homicide cases. Associated traumatic lesions were found in about 23% of the homicide cases and in 18% of the suicide cases. In case of suicidal gunshots to the left chest, both upwards and downwards directions, and also both right-to-left and left-to-right directions can occur. From 22 suicide cases showing entrance wound in the mouth, a downwards direction was found in only one. This study underlines the importance but also the limits of the autopsy findings (including direction of the projectile(s) related to the entrance site) for giving an indication of the manner of death (homicide vs. suicide).

AB Self-inflicted stab injury to the skull, particularly in the neurocranium, is a rare method used to commit suicide. Herein is presented a case of a 26-year old woman with a temporal wound found by her partner in their home. No weapon was found in the approximate environment and the victim said that she fell. A CT scan performed at admission to the emergency room was interpreted as being compatible with injury from falls. A second CT scan in a neurosurgical unit suggested a cranio-cerebral injury from a sharp object; aggression was suspected. The discording elements led to an interview with a psychiatrist and diagnosis of attempted suicide through the action of a knife in the context of severe depression. This is a rare case that implicates a depressive woman and stabbing directly to the neurocranium. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Firearm-assisted suicide: Legislative, policing and clinical concerns
SO JOURNAL OF FORENSIC AND LEGAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Firearms; Handguns; Suicide; Mental illness; Parasuicide
AB Until recent years the Republic of Ireland had one of the most restrictive regimes on firearms access with the Irish police (An Garda Siochana) consistently refusing to grant certificates for a wide range of guns including handguns, high calibre rifles and shotguns capable of holding more than three cartridges. In 2004 the High Court ruled that this policy was without legislative backing and since then the police began to issue certificates for firearms where the applicant is not disentitled under law from possessing a gun. Set against this backdrop, this paper explores the consequences of liberal gun regimes in the context of access to firearms by those suffering from mental illness and who pose a threat of parasuicide or suicide. Consideration is given to experiences in other jurisdictions and international research on firearm suicide prevention. Finally some recommendations for changes in legislation, policy and protocol in the Irish context are presented. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Convergent evidence indicates that HPA-axis hyperactivity is a risk factor for suicide in major depressive disorder, and seven independent reports have shown that patients with abnormal dexamethasone suppression test (DST) results have significantly higher rates of eventual suicide. The identification of interactions between DST results and other clinical predictors would enhance risk assessment, but modest sample sizes have limited such analyses in earlier cohorts. Subjects with major depressive disorder who participated in research protocols at the University of Michigan between 1980 and 1991, who had fully structured diagnostic interviews, and who underwent a 1-mg DST while actively depressed were screened with the National Death Index for a mean (S.D.) follow-up period of 18.0 (5.5) years. Of 334 subjects, 69 (20.7%) were identified as having died. Of these, 13 (18.8%) had died by suicide and 32 (46.4%) from cardiovascular causes. Baseline DST results did not significantly predict death from suicide or from cardiovascular disease for the sample as a whole. Significant relationships between DST results and later suicide did exist for inpatients, for patients with manifest suicidality and, in particular, for inpatients with manifest suicidality. Because nearly all previous reports of DST results and suicide described depressed inpatients, it is possible that the DST is a useful predictor only within this population.

AB The study aimed to examine the association of impulsivity and screening positively for borderline personality disorder (BPD+) as risk factors for suicide attempts among opioid-dependent individuals. The study used a case-control design with 775 opioid-dependent cases and 306 non-opioid-dependent controls. Cases were more likely than controls to screen BPD+ and to be classed as highly impulsive. Significant risk for lifetime suicide attempt was associated with screening BPD+ and also with high impulsivity. A number of risk factors were identified for suicide attempts among those with either high impulsivity or among those who screened BPD+: being female, a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder and a diagnosis of illicit drug dependence (other than opioid dependence). Opioid dependence was not a unique risk factor for suicide attempts among either the BPD+ group or the high impulsivity group. Although opioid dependence was not a unique risk factor for suicide attempts among those who screened BPD+, cases presented with multiple risk factors at substantially higher rates than controls. This research also highlights the importance of assessing impulsivity, in both clinical settings and research, particularly among those with a history of suicidal behaviour.

ID RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL
AB Several post-suicide prevention strategies such as sending postcards or making phone calls have been used to keep in contact with suicide attempters. The continuity of care has been beneficial to the prevention of post-acute suicidal behaviors. The aim of the study was to evaluate the technical feasibility and acceptability of text messaging outreach in post-acute suicide attempters. Eighteen post-suicidal patients were included in a prospective, monocentric, open-label, 2 months pilot study. The text messages were sent from the intranet program that we specially developed for the study. Technical feasibility of this text message intervention was evaluated by the analysis of text message reports. Acceptability of such intervention was evaluated by a standardized phone interview. Our study showed that receiving text messages sent from an intranet program after a suicide attempt is technically possible. This post-crisis outreach program was accepted by the patients who found it to have a positive preventive impact. Text messaging outreach offers several advantages such as lower cost, and easier utilization compared to current post-acute care strategies. We suggest further randomized controlled trials in a large sample of suicidal patients to assess the efficacy of this novel outreach tool for prevention of post-acute suicide.

AB Anxiety sensitivity (AS) cognitive concerns, which reflects fears of mental incapacitation, have been previously associated with suicidal ideation and behavior. The first study aim was to replicate and extend upon previous research by investigating whether AS cognitive concerns can discriminate between those at low risk versus high risk for suicidal behavior. Secondly, we aimed to test the incremental predictive power of AS cognitive concerns above and beyond known suicide risk factors (i.e., thwarted belongingness and insomnia). The sample consisted of 106 individuals (75% meeting current criteria for an Axis I disorder) recruited from the community. Results revealed that AS cognitive concerns were a robust predictor of elevated suicide risk after covarying for negative affect, whereas AS social and physical concerns were not. Those with high, relative to low, AS cognitive scores were 3.67 times more likely to be in the high suicide risk group. Moreover, AS cognitive concerns significantly predicted elevated suicide risk above and beyond relevant suicide risk factors. Results of this study add to a growing body of the literature demonstrating a relationship between AS cognitive concerns and increased suicidality. Incorporating AS cognitive concerns amelioration protocols into existing interventions for suicidal behavior may be beneficial. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The terms "dyadic death'' or "murder-suicide'' refer to an incident where an individual commits homicide and then takes his or her own life. These events are generally committed by men within the family network, using firearms or sharp force instruments, and make up a relatively small proportion of homicides overall. Herein, we present the application of post-mortem multislice computed tomography (CT) and micro-CT analysis to an unusual case of dyadic death, where a 38-year-old man fired a single gunshot to his own right temple, killing himself and his 50-year-old wife, lying on the bed beside him.
   The integration of radiological, autoptic and histological data allowed us to reconstruct the trajectory of the gunshot, the most probable dynamics of the event, and to classify the incident as a "suicide-homicide'', because the female victim died a few minutes later than her husband and murderer.

AB The authors report on a combined suicide of a 71-year-old farmer who fired a shot to his forehead with a livestock stunner before burning himself. As the fire was fueled by a pile of firewood it burnt for many hours, thus, causing subtotal incineration of the body. The remaining bones were calcined and reduced to a residual mass of only 3 kg. In spite of the extreme destruction, a circular bone defect corresponding to the site where the captive-bolt bad entered the skull could be identified in the frontal squama. The example of this suicide is used to illustrate the problems of distinguishing between mechanical and thermal fractures. As expected, the attempted isolation and amplification of both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA for the purpose of identification was not successful. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB The current study tests whether perceptions of defeat and entrapment are the psychological mechanisms underlying the link between positive psychotic symptoms and suicidal ideation in schizophrenia. A sample of 78 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders completed self-report measures and a clinical interview. Of this sample, 21.8% reported a single past suicide attempt and 50% reported multiple past attempts. It was found that perceptions of defeat and entrapment, conceptualised as a single variable, accounted for a large proportion (31%) of the variance in suicidal ideation and behaviour. Defeat and entrapment also mediated the relationship between positive symptom severity and suicidal ideation. This result held whilst controlling for levels of hopelessness and depression. Secondary analyses suggested that suspiciousness in particular was linked to suicidal ideation. The results support a socio-cognitive model (The Schematic Appraisals Model of Suicide: SAMS) of suicide in psychosis. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Among males, there was no significant reduction in attempted suicide (8.7% versus 8.1%). Among females, however, the proportion reporting an attempt declined significantly from 19.7 to 9.8%. Of those who reported suicidal ideation at baseline, 22.8% made an attempt over the follow-up period, as did 19.0% of those who had major depression. Large, and significant, declines in suicidal ideation (23.1% versus 6.9%) and major depression (25.5% versus 10.9%) occurred over the study period. Independent predictors of a suicide attempt over the follow-up period were: social isolation, having made an attempt in the preceding 12 months, suicidal ideation at baseline, a greater number of treatment episodes and higher levels of baseline polydrug use.

AB Aims: To investigate cases of suicide in which there was no healthcare contact, by looking at history of help-seeking and evidence of previous mental health vulnerability. To identify any life events associated with suicide for which individuals did not seek help. Background: Previous research has suggested that non-consultation is the main barrier to suicide prevention among men. Estimates suggest approximately 22% of men who die by suicide have not consulted their GP in the year before their death. Little is known about the lifetime pattern of engagement with services among these individuals and whether or not this may influence their help-seeking behaviour before death. Methods: Coroner records of suicide deaths in Northern Ireland over 2 years were linked to general practice (GP) records. This identified 63 individuals who had not attended health services in the 12 months before death. Coroner's data were used to categorise life events associated with the male deaths. Lifetime mental health help-seeking at the GP was assessed. Findings: The vast majority of individuals who did not seek help were males (n = 60, 15% of all suicide deaths). Lack of consultation in the year before suicide was consistent with behaviour over the lifespan; over two-thirds had no previous consultations for mental health. In Coroner's records, suicides with no prior consultation were primarily linked to relationship breakdown and job loss. These findings highlight the limitations of primary care in suicide prevention as most had never attended GP for mental health issues and there was a high rate of supported consultation among those who had previously sought help. Public health campaigns that promote service use among vulnerable groups at times of crisis might usefully be targeted at those likely to be experiencing financial and relationship issues.

AB Previous studies have shown that suicide attempts are strongly associated with major depressive disorder (MDD), and MDD patients who attempt suicide have a high risk of death by suicide throughout their lifetimes. We aimed to explore the differences in resting-state brain activity in MDD patients with and without histories of suicide attempt. We accomplished this using an approach named amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF). ALFF reflects the local properties of specific brain regions and provides direct information about impaired regions. This approach differs from functional connectivity. In this study, we compared three groups: MDD patients with and without histories of suicide attempt, and normal controls (NC). The main result is that suicide attempters had increased ALFF in the right superior temporal gyrus (r-STG) relative to both non-suicidal patients (NSU) and NC. In addition, NSU had increased ALFF in the right ventral medial frontal gyrus (r-vMFG) relative to both suicide attempters (SU) and NC. Finally, both NSU and SU had increased ALFF in the left anterior cingulated cortex (l-ACC) and right parahippocampal gyrus (r-PG) and decreased ALFF in the left middle occipital gyrus (l-MOG) and left angular gyms (l-AG) relative to NC.

AB The objective of this study was to determine the impact of work-related factors on risk for completed suicide. Psychiatric disorders and socio-demographic factors including work-related factors were assessed by a semi-structured interview using the psychological autopsy method in 163 completed suicide cases and by personal interview in 396 living population-based control persons. Unemployment (in particular, for more than six months), (early) retirement, or homemaker status were associated with highly significantly increased suicide risk, independently of categorized psychiatric diagnosis. In addition, adverse psychosocial working conditions, such as monotonous work, increased responsibility and pronounced mental strain due to contact with work clients, significantly increased suicide risk as well, again independently of categorized psychiatric diagnosis. These findings demonstrate that negative consequences of unemployment, homemaker status with no outside occupation, or (early) retirement, as well as adverse psychosocial working conditions, present relevant risk factors contributing to suicidal behavior, independently of diagnosed psychiatric disorders. Employment and a positive modification of working conditions, may possibly be preventive to important adverse mental health outcomes, including suicidality. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Lifetime and recent rates of attempted suicide and suicidal ideation amongst the Australian Treatment Outcome Study cohort of heroin users at 11-year follow-up were examined. The mean elapsed time since heroin initiation was 20.4 years. At 11-year follow-up, 42.2% of the cohort reported ever having made a suicide attempt, 11.1% having made a first attempt subsequent to baseline. In the year preceding 11-year follow-up, 1.6% had made an attempt, suicidal ideation was reported by 10.4%, and 42% had a current suicide plan. After controlling for other variables, past 12 month attempts, current ideation or plans were independently associated with a current diagnosis of Major Depression (odds ratios (OR) 1.67) and more extensive polydrug use (OR 1.39), while each standard deviation higher on the SF12 physical health scale (reflecting better health) was associated with reduced odds (OR 0.66). Suicide and suicidal ideation remained a significant clinical issue for heroin users, some 20 years after their heroin use commenced. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Numerous existing measures assess attitudes toward suicide yet fail to account for contextual factors. The Trinity Inventory of Precursors to Suicide (TIPS) is presented as an alternative, with implications for the development of prevention programs. Having previously reported exploratory analysis of the TIPS; confirmatory factor analysis and predictive validity are examined. Two-hundred-nineteen males and 454 females aged 15 to 19 years (M = 16.69 yrs; SD =.739 yrs) from 11 post-primary schools in Ireland completed a questionnaire consisting of the Beck Hopelessness Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and TIPS. Confirmatory analysis revealed an oblique model with good fit for the data. Initial psychometric properties and the original factor structure were replicated. The authors propose that the context-based information provided by TIPS may be used in the development of problem-focused emotional health promotion within the wider school setting.

AB Attempted suicide may be a different phenomenon in adolescents than in adults. To our knowledge, direct comparisons between these two populations are very scarce. The aim of this study is to analyze the differences between adolescents and adults in methods of attempted suicide, accompanying certainty of death, and intentionality. All cases admitted to one adult (n=173) and one adolescent (n = 104) inpatient unit who attempted suicide in the period from January 2003 through October 2005 were included in a prospective, common, national register, with data on methods, circumstances, and intentionality. The methodology followed that of the WHO/Euro Multicenter Study on Parasuicide. A stratified analysis was performed using the Mantel-Haenszel procedure in order to control for the effects of gender and diagnosis. Adolescents used significantly more over-the-counter medicines. Adults were significantly more certain of the possible fatal outcome of their attempt and had a significantly more severe intention when harming themselves. Individuals appear to use the methods that are available to them to attempt suicide. Adolescents may display more impulsive and less lethal directed behavior than adults or, alternatively, they are more frequently admitted for less severe attempts. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Aims: This study aimed to determine the role of acute alcohol use among suicide decedents based on their blood alcohol concentrations (BAC), and identify sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with the differences in BAC.
   Methods: Data were collected from nationwide autopsies conducted between May 2015 and November 2015 in South Korea. A total of 683 suicide decedents were classified into three groups according to the BAC at the time of autopsy: no alcohol (NA) group (BAC < 0.01%), no intoxication (NI) group (0.01 <= BAC < 0.08%), and intoxication (I) group (BAC >= 0.08%). Sociodemographic data and clinical factors related to suicide among the three groups were analyzed using a multinomial logistic regression analysis.
   Results: Among the suicide decedents (N = 683), the NA group was 55.6% (N = 380), NI group was 15.7% (N = 107), and I group was 28.7% (N = 196). History of suicide attempts (odds ratio [OR]: 1.798, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.073-3.012) and absence of medical illness (OR: 1.633, CI: 1.038-2.571) were higher in the I group compared to the NA group. Psychiatric and medical illness triggers of suicide were significantly lower in the I group than the NA group (OR: 0.325, CI: 0.118-0.892). Being male (OR: 2.494, CI: 1.363-4.565) and financial problems as triggers of suicide (OR: 3.234, CI: 1.636-6.393) were higher in the NI group than in the NA group. Being male and having financial problems were associated with no intoxication (0.01 <= BAC < 0.08%), whereas the history of suicide attempts and absence of medical and/or psychiatric illness were associated with acute alcohol intoxication (BAC >= 0.08%) in the suicide decedents.
   Conclusions: Suicide decedents had different characteristics based on different BACs identified in the autopsy. The differences in acute alcohol intoxication and no intoxication in suicide decedents may have implications for the targeted prevention of suicides related to alcohol.

AB A case of suicide, a male shot in the abdomen using a homemade weapon, is described herein. Postmortem examination revealed bleeding into the thoracic and abdominal cavities, a collapsed liver and other organs with numerous pellets. The contact-shot wound was not noticed during the initial investigation at the scene, but it was elucidated during autopsy. A simple launcher had been assembled from pipes of a clothes rack frame made for home use. The deceased had once owned a shotgun, but his firearm license had been relinquished 5 years prior. A shotgun shell that he had kept was used. Presumably, the injuries from the homemade weapon were not noticed initially because of strict gun control rules in Japan.

DT Article
DE Extended suicide; Stud gun; Powder drains; Specific findings; Pattern of
   injuries
AB Suicides with stud guns are uncommon, but are well documented in the literature. On rare occasions, stud guns are also used as a homicide weapon. This case report describes an extended suicide in which a husband killed his wife and their two dogs, which lived on the property. The husband then committed suicide with a shot from the stud gun into his skull. He was a 70-year-old pensioner, a retired butcher, who was found by his son. He was lying in a supine position on a carpet in the living room, with the stud gun stuck in his skull. During autopsy, high concentrations of an antihistamine were found in the blood of each corpse; this drug is used as a soporific.
   In contrast to the literature, which mainly describes powder deposits due to the use of conventional stud guns, in this case a stud gun was used in which the expanding gases and powder escaped together with the central bolt at the front of the device; powder drains were not involved. Detailed findings of the autopsy are given with reference to this type of stud gun. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Our aims were, to clarify the blood lipid differences [Total serum cholesterol (TC), High-density lipoprotein (HDL), Low density lipoprotein (LDL), Triglyceride (TG)] between female patients who had attempted suicide and controls and to determine whether we could use the patients' initial lipid profiles to predict suicide re-attempt within the subsequent year. A total of 284 participants (110 cases and 174 controls) were recruited, with no differences in body mass index, age, blood sampling time and gender. Blood samples were collected from all participants for serum lipid profiles and assayed in an auto-analyzer. We divided the suicide re-attempter group into suicide attempters in the subsequent year (SSY) and suicide attempters after the subsequent year (SASY). The TC, LDL, and TG levels were significantly lower in the suicidal group than in the control group. HDL was significantly higher in the suicidal group than in the control group. Low TG ( < 70 mg/dL) (OR (odds ratio) = 12.8; 95% CI (confidence interval)= 5.4-30.5; p < 0.0001)and low LDL/HDL ( < 1.8) (OR=4.1; 95% CI= 1.8-93; p= 0.001) were significantly associated with a current suicide attempt. HDL levels in the SSY (41.5 +/- 4.5 mg/dL) were lower than in the non-suicide attempters group (NSA) (50.9 +/- 10.3 mg/dL) and SASY (58.7 +/- 12.8 mg/dL)(d.f.=2, F=5.2, p=0.007). Serum HDL level may be a potential candidate predictor for the future risk of suicidality. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In a medicolegal study the postmortem serotonin (5-HT) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations were determined in routine autopsies using a high performance liquid chromatographic procedure with electrochemical detection. There was no correlation between 5-HT concentrations and age, sex or blood alcohol concentration using a postmortem delay <3 days. In suicides the suboccipital CSF concentrations were significantly decreased compared to the levels measured in the control group (8.55 +/- 5.99 ng/ml versus 20.15 +/- 13.56 ng/ml). Additionally, a decrease of 5-HT was found in the suboccipital CSF of opiate fatalities (15.56 +/- 13.52 ng/ml). The results support the hypothesis that decreased 5-HT concentrations in the CSF are characteristic in suicides. However, due to a rather broad overlapping of values between suicides and controls the results failed to define a possible cut-off level in the 5-HT CSF concentration to distinguish between a suicidal and a non-suicidal incident.

AB Background: The present study was designed to examine the influence of suicidality on relapse in alcohol-dependent patients. Specifically. a lifetime suicide attempt at baseline was used to predict relapse in the year after treatment. Also, the unique contribution of impulsive suicide attempts was examined.
   Methods: A total of 154 patients with alcohol dependence, consecutively admitted to four addiction treatment facilities in Warsaw, Poland participated in the study. Of the 154 eligible patients. 118 (76.6%) completed a standardized follow-up assessment at 12 months.
   Results: Previous suicide attempts were common in adults treated for alcohol dependence with 43% patients in the present sample reporting an attempt at some point during their lifetime. Additionally, more than 62% of those with a lifetime suicide attempt reported making an impulsive attempt. Lifetime suicide attempts were not associated with post-treatment relapse (chi-square = 2.37, d.f. = 1, p = 0.124). However, impulsive suicide attempts strongly predicted relapse (OR = 2.81. 95% CI = 1.13-6.95, p = 0.026) and time to relapse (OR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.18-3.74, p = 0.012) even after adjusting for other measures of baseline psychopathology, depression, impulsivity, hopelessness and alcohol use severity.
   Conclusions: This study is the first to document the relationship between pre-treatment impulsive suicide attempts and higher likelihood of post-treatment relapse in alcohol-dependent patents. Clinicians should routinely conduct an assessment for previous suicide attempts in patients with alcohol use disorders. and when impulsive suicidality is reported. they should recognize the increased risk for relapse and formulate their patients' treatment plans accordingly with the goals of reducing both alcoholic relapse and suicide rates.

DE ligature strangulation; homicide; suicide; forensic pathology
AB Suicides by ligature strangulation are rare events. In Berlin (3.5 million inhabitants; ca. 500 suicides per year) approximately one case per year occurs. Here, we present the main findings of 19 cases investigated between 1978 and 1998, compared to 47 cases of homicidal ligature strangulation. Two of the 19 suicidal victims had single fractures of the upper thyroid horns and one victim a: fracture of a: lower thyroid horn; other types of laryngohyoid injuries were not observed. In the homicidal series, the laryngohyoid structures were unaffected in 26 cases (12 of these victims were children or adolescents), single thyroid horn fractures were present in three cases and more significant injuries in 18 cases. Macroscopic bleedings of the laryngeal muscles were found in 12 victims of the homicidal group and in none of the suicidal. Bleedings in the neck muscles seldom occurred in suicides. According to these findings, the laryngohyoid injuries can be helpful in the differentiation of suicide from homicide, if more than a single thyroid horn fracture or a laryngeal soft tissue trauma is present.

   COMORBIDITY; INVENTORY; BEHAVIOR; SCALE
AB Objective: The authors compared the characteristics of suicide attempters with and without comorbid psychiatric and personality disorders to identify factors that explain the high suicide risk associated with psychiatric comorbidity.
   Method: A representative group of 111 patients who had attempted suicide (72 female and 39 male) was assessed for psychiatric and personality disorders according to ICD-10 criteria. The characteristics of patients with both types of disorder were compared with those of patients without comorbid disorders. A semistructured interview schedule and standardized questionnaires were used to investigate patients' background characteristics, the circumstances of the suicide attempts, psychological characteristics, and outcome after 12-20 months.
   Results: Comorbidity of psychiatric and personality disorders was present in 49 patients (44%). More patients with comorbid disorders had made previous suicide attempts (N=41 [84%] versus N=28 [45%]) and repeated attempts during the follow-up period (N=25 [51%] versus N=9 [15%]). Differences in precipitants and motives for the index episode were also found: patients with comorbid disorders were more depressed and hopeless, reported more episodes of aggression, were more impulsive, and had lower self-esteem and poorer problem-solving skills. Differences in self-esteem and problem-solving skills distinguished between the groups in a stepwise discriminant function analysis. More of the patients with comorbid disorders reported not being loved by their parents and parental suicidal behavior.
   Conclusions: Suicide attempters with comorbid psychiatric and personality disorders show marked differences from those without both of these disorders. Comorbidity may contribute to greater suicide risk. Some of the characteristics of patients with comorbid disorders pose major clinical challenges that should be addressed in an effort to reduce suicide risk.

ID FATALITIES
AB The Statistical Office of Berlin recorded a total of 5488 suicides within the 10-year period 1990-1999 (3550 males, 1938 females). Firearms were used in 238 cases (218 males, 20 females). An autopsy was performed in 19 of the 20 female cases. The women's ages ranged from 21 to 88 years. Their marital Status was single (n = 6), married (n = 5), divorced (n = 5) and widowed (n = 3). Eight of the women had one or more children. A suicide note was found in eight cases, six women had a history of psychiatric illness, and six had previously attempted suicide. Predominant among the suicide motives were mental (n = 5) and organic (n = 4) disorders as well as relationship problems (n = 3) and financial difficulties (n = 2). Most of the women (n = 16) committed suicide in their own apartment. mainly in the bedroom. The weapons used were pistol (n = 10), revolver (n = 6), rifle (n = 2) and a blank cartridge gun (n = 1). In 16 cases we found a contact discharge at point blank range. Six of the dead women were found with the weapon still in their hands. The site of bullet-entry was the right temple (n = 11), high-parietal (n = 2). mouth (n = 3), neck (n = 1), and chest (n = 2). A comparison of our results with the data of other authors for male or predominantly male collectives did not indicate any sex-specific differences regarding the type of weapon, location of the entry wound or the scene. However, alcohol was detected at a lower frequency compared with male gunshot suicides. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Childhood physical abuse (CPA), non-suicidal self-harm and attempted suicide are all highly prevalent amongst injecting drug users (IDU). This paper reported on the association of CPA with self-harm and attempted suicide.
   Methods: Cross-sectional study, with 300 IDU administered a structured interview examining the prevalence of CPA, non-suicidal self-harm and suicide attempts.
   Results: CPA was reported by 74.3%, and severe CPA by 40.3%. A history of non-suicidal self-harm was reported by 23.7%, and 25.7% had attempted suicide. Non-suicidal self-harm preceded the suicide attempt in 833% of cases where both had occurred. Independent correlates of non-suicidal self-harm were: female gender (OR 3.62), avoided home due to conflict (OR 2.28) and more extensive polydrug use (OR 1.32). Independent correlates of attempted suicide were: severe CPA (OR 3.18), frequent CPA (OR 2.54), avoided home due to conflict (OR 3.95), female gender (OR 2.99), a positive screen for Conduct Disorder (OR 3.53), and more extensive polydrug use (OR 1.52).
   Conclusions: Those presenting to treatment agencies are highly likely to have a history of CPA, that may still influence their behaviours. Screening for histories of CPA and non-suicidal self-harm appears warranted when determining suicide risk for this population. At the population level, reductions in the rate of CPA, could possibly reduce the rate of subsequent suicidality. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Studying community residing youths originally recruited for an intervention trial upon entry into first grade, this project sought to estimate risk of suicide ideation and attempts to young adulthood, with focus on those who used drugs before age 16, as compared to youths who used later in development or not at all. Standardized interview assessments in 1989-1994 were completed with 2311 youths age 8-15. Roughly 15 years after recruitment, our study team reassessed 1695, nearly 75% of the survivors (mean age = 21), finding 155 to have made suicide attempts (SA) and 218 with onset of depression-related suicide ideation (SI), We estimate relative risk (RR), from survival analysis and logistic regression models, to study early use of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, and inhalants, with covariate adjustments for age, sex, race-ethnicity, and other pertinent covariates. Early-onset of cannabis use and inhalant use for females, but not for males, signaled modestly excess risk of suicide attempt (cannabis-associated RR = 1.9; p = 0.04; inhalant-associated RR = 2.2; p = 0.05). Early-onset of cannabis use by females (but not for males) signaled excess risk for suicide ideation (RR = 2.9; p = 0.006). Early-onset alcohol and tobacco use were not associated with later risk of SA or SI. In light of the relatively modest strength of association, the evidence may well reflect an underlying common diathesis or unmeasured prior confounding influences that link early-onset illegal drug use with later risk of these suicide-related events, rather than an influence of early-onset drug use per se.

AB How differences in drinking patterns may affect the impact of alcohol consumption on deliberate self-harm among adolescents is explored in this international comparative study. Schools in Australia, Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Norway (N=30,532) were surveyed. In all countries the risk of deliberate self-harm was significantly elevated among adolescents who reported some or numerous episodes of intoxication, controlling for confounding factors. The results support the assumption that intoxication is significantly related to the association between alcohol consumption and deliberate self-harm in adolescents.

AB A retrospective, comparative study was carried out on 118 sharp force fatalities, including 70 homicides and 48 suicides, and covering a 22-year period from 1986 to 2008. The objective was to identify relevant parameters that may be used to distinguish between these two manners of death.
   The following parameters were analysed: age, gender, number of wounds, type of wounds, anatomical sites of the wounds, presence of wounds affecting bones or cartilage, the longitudinal axis of stab wounds located at the anterior part of the trunk, Injury Severity Score (ISS) and associated traumatic injuries.
   Our statistical analyses revealed several relevant parameters that may help differentiate the two manners of death. Homicide victims were younger than those who had committed suicide. Homicide cases showed associated stab and cut wounds, whereas suicide cases predominantly showed isolated cut wounds. Wounds located at the head, limbs, hands, nape of the neck, or back were predictive of a homicide, whereas wounds located solely at the anterior parts of the trunk, neck, or forearms were predictive of a suicide. The presence of bone or cartilage wounds was predictive of a homicide and their absence was predictive of a suicide. A vertical longitudinal axis of stab wounds located at the anterior part of the trunk was predictive of a homicide whereas a horizontal axis was predictive of a suicide. ISS was found to be significantly higher in homicide cases than in suicide cases. The presence of defensive or violence-associated traumatic wounds was predictive of a homicide whereas the presence of hesitation-associated wounds or the absence of associated traumatic wounds was predictive of a suicide.

AB Background Pesticide self-poisoning accounts for 14-20% of suicides worldwide. Regulation aimed at restricting access to pesticides or banning highly hazardous pesticides is one approach to reducing these deaths. We systematically reviewed the evidence of the effectiveness of pesticide regulation in reducing the incidence of pesticide suicides and overall suicides.
   Methods We did a systematic review of the international evidence. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase for studies published between Jan 1, 1960, and Dec 31, 2016, which investigated the effect of national or regional bans, and sales or import restrictions, on the availability of one or more pesticides and the incidence of suicide in different countries. We excluded other interventions aimed at limiting community access to pesticides. We extracted data from studies presenting pesticide suicide data and overall suicide data from before and after national sales restrictions. Two reviewers independently assessed papers for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We undertook a narrative synthesis of the data in each report, and where data were available for the years before and after a ban, we pooled data for the 3 years before and the 3 years after to obtain a crude estimate of the effect of the ban. This study is registered through PROSPERO, number CRD42017053329.
   Findings We identified 27 studies undertaken in 16 countries-five low-income or middle-income countries (Bangladesh, Colombia, India, Jordan and Sri Lanka), and 11 high-income countries (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, UK, and USA). Assessments largely focused on national bans of specific pesticides (12 studies of bans in six countries-Jordan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Greece [ Crete], South Korea, and Taiwan) or sales restrictions (eight studies of restrictions in five countries-India, Denmark, Ireland, the UK and the USA). Only five studies used optimum analytical methods. National bans on commonly ingested pesticides in five of the six countries studied, including four studies using optimum analytical methods, were followed by reductions in pesticide suicides and, in three of these countries, falls in overall suicide mortality. Greece was the only country studied that did not show a decrease in pesticide suicide following a ban. There were no high-quality studies of restricting sales to people for occupational uses; four of the seven studies (in three of the five countries studied-India, Denmark, and the USA) showed sales restrictions were followed by decreases in pesticide suicides; one of the two studies investigating trends in overall suicide mortality reported a fall in deaths in Denmark, but there were also decreases in suicide deaths from other methods.
   Interpretation National bans on highly hazardous pesticides, which are commonly ingested in acts of self-poisoning, seem to be effective in reducing pesticide-specific and overall suicide rates. Evidence is less consistent for sales restrictions. A worldwide ban on the use of highly hazardous pesticides is likely to prevent tens of thousands of deaths every year. Copyright (C) The Author(s).

AB How to allocate resources between somatic maintenance and reproduction in a manner that maximizes inclusive fitness is a fundamental challenge for all organisms. Life history theory predicts that effort put into somatic maintenance (health) should vary with sex, mating and parenting status because men and women have different costs of reproduction, and because life transitions such as family formation alter the fitness payoffs from investing in current versus future reproduction. However, few tests of how such life history parameters influence behaviours closely linked to survival exist. Here we examine whether specific forms of preventable death (accidents/suicides, alcohol-related causes, and other preventable diseases) are predicted by marital status and dependent offspring in a modem developed context; that of Northern Ireland. We predict that men, non-partnered individuals and individuals who do not have dependent offspring will be at higher risk of preventable death. Running survival analyses on the entire adult population (aged 16-59, n = 927,134) controlling for socioeconomic position (SEP) and other potential confounds, we find that being single (compared to cohabiting/married) increases risk of accidental/suicide death for men (but not for women), whereas having dependent children is associated with lower risk of preventable mortality for women but less so for men. We also find that the protective effect of partners is larger for men with low SEP than for high SEP men. Findings support life history predictions and suggest that individuals respond to variation in fitness costs linked to their mating and parenting status. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB The purpose of the study was to investigate the association between suicide and demographic and socioeconomic measures in Tuscany. Data on standardized rates of suicide from 1997 to 2005 in addition to census-derived variables, income and abstention were derived from the Mortality register, the 2001 Census, the Tax Agency and the Regional Electoral Office databases. Pearson's correlation and stepwise multiple regression analyses (unweighted and weighted by population) were used to analyze the association between suicide rates and demographic and socio-economic measures for the 34 health districts for both males and females. The correlation analyses showed that suicide was significantly associated with many variables in men, but only with old age in women. The multiple regression analyses showed that the best predictors in men were education, single person households and isolated houses (only education and single person households in the weighted model). For women, the best predictors were-the proportion of elderly people and income (this was also true for the weighted model, but in the opposite order). An ecological correlation between suicide and measures of economic deprivation and social fragmentation was found in both men and women. Among the best predictors, isolated houses may act as a marker for remoteness and isolation on a small scale. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Disadvantageous decision-making has been reported in patients who had attempted suicide and may represent a cognitive risk factor for suicide. Making decisions necessitates both implicit/associative and explicit/analytic processes. Here, we explored explicit mechanisms, and hypothesized that suicide attempters fail to use explicit understanding to make favorable choices. The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) was used to assess decision-making in 151 non-depressed patients with a history of mood disorder and suicidal act, 81 nondepressed patients with a history of mood disorders but no suicidal act, and 144 healthy individuals. After performing the task, we assessed the explicit understanding of the participants of the contingencies in the task, i.e. which options yielded higher gain or loss. Correct explicit understanding was reported less often in suicide attempters and affective controls than in healthy controls (45.7% and 42.0% vs. 66.0%). Moreover, understanding was associated with better performance in healthy and affective controls, but not in suicide attempters, with no between-group difference among those who did not reach understanding. Patients with histories of suicide attempt, therefore, show a disconnection between what they "know" and what they "do", possibly reflecting underlying impairments in implicit associative processes. These cognitive alterations should be addressed in preventative interventions targeting suicide. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite a general decline in late life suicide rates over the last 30 years, older people have the highest rates of suicide in most countries. In contrast, non-fatal suicidal behaviour declines with age and more closely resembles suicide than in younger age groups. There are difficulties in the detection and determination of pathological suicidal ideation in older people. Multiple factors increase suicide risk ranging from distal early and mid-life issues such as child abuse, parental death, substance misuse and traumatic life experiences to proximal precipitants in late life such as social isolation and health-related concerns. Clinical depression is the most frequently identified proximal mental health concern and in many cases is a first episode of major depression. Recent studies have identified changes on neuroimaging and neurocognitive factors that might distinguish suicidal from non-suicidal depression in older people. Strategies for suicide prevention need to be 'whole of life' and, as no single prevention strategy is likely to be successful alone, a multi-faceted, multi-layered approach is required. This should include optimal detection and management of depression and of high risk individuals as available evidence indicates that this can reduce suicidal behaviour. How best to improve the quality of depression management in primary and secondary care requires further research. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We aimed to examine association between disordered eating attitudes (DEAs), alexithymia and suicide probability among adolescent females and to explore potential link between alexithymia and suicide probability in subjects with DEAs. 381 female students completed Eating Attitude Test (EAT-26), Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and Suicide Probability Scale (SPS). It was found that 13.2% (n=52) of the subjects have DEAs. Results indicated that total TAS-20 score and scores of Difficulty in Identifying Feelings (DIF) and Difficulty in Describing Feelings (DDF) subscales were significantly higher in DEAs group than in those non DEAs group (p<0.05). Additionally, total SPS score (p<0.001), Hopelessness (p=0.001), Suicide Ideation (p<0.001) and Hostility (p=0.003) subscales scores of SPS were significantly higher in the alexithymic DEAs than the non-alexithymic DEAs group. In order to control potential effect of depression, SPS subscales were used as covariate factors in ANCOVA. Negative Self-Evaluation subscale yielded a statistically significant difference between groups, other subscales did not. Results point out these; DEAs are relatively frequent phenomenon among female students in Turkey and presence of alexithymia was associated with an increased suicide probability in adolescents with DEAs. The results should be evaluated taking into account that depressive symptomatology was not assessed using a depression scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This report is about the findings in association with the extended suicides of nine victims killed by sharp force. All victims were killed by sharp force. The perpetrators were predominantly the parents, the victims their children. Regarding the criteria for differentiating self-inflicted injuries from injuries inflicted by another person, the victims' injuries presented patterns usually found solely in suicides. Thus eight of nine cases presented tentative and hesitation injuries, in three of five cases areas of injury covered by clothing had been exposed beforehand. Despite extremely narrow intercostal spaces in children, injuries to the bones in thoracic stabbing were avoided more often than not (four of seven cases). Only the criterion "defence injury" occurred nearly as often as in homicide victims (three of nine cases). The psychopathology of extended suicide can explain this pattern. The perpetrator's motive is characterised by his pseudoaltruistic belief to save the loved ones from a world that is in his opinion unacceptable. A fusion or integration of the victim into the perpetrator's own self is based on an identity problem. Physical interrelation of forces between perpetrator and victim restricts the victim in his defence and presents an important prerequisite for acquiring the patterns of described injuries.

AB The objective of this research was to classify the deaths of 98 victims of suicide in Tel Aviv, Israel between the years 2007 and 2010. This was done by examining background features and clinical characteristics among suicide completers with histories of a prior psychiatric hospitalization using logistic regression modeling. 34% of the sample (33/98) was given at least one psychiatric diagnosis upon discharge from a prior psychiatric hospitalization. Throughout their lifetime, those with psychiatric diagnoses were significantly more likely to have histories of mental health treatment (psychotherapy and psychotropic medication), psychopathology and suicidality among family members, prior suicide attempts and familial or emotional crisis as compared with those without a psychiatric diagnosis. During their last life phase, those with prior psychiatric diagnoses were also significantly more likely to have received psychotherapeutic treatment, expressed a lack of desire to live and presented with affective symptoms (e.g. depression, anxiety, adaptation difficulty and nervousness) as compared with those without such histories. Thus, focusing on high risk populations, such as those with psychiatric illnesses and deciphering the role of mental health treatment, familial predisposition, prior suicide attempt and sub-clinical symptoms in relation to suicide can inform future prevention practices.

AB Individuals with first episode psychosis (FEP) experience high rates of premature mortality, in particular due to suicide. The study aims were to: a) Estimate the rate of sudden death among young people with FEP during an 8-10 year period following commencement of treatment; b) Examine and describe the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics associated with sudden death; and c) Examine the timing of death in relation to psychiatric treatment. This was a cohort study. The sample comprised 661 patients accepted into treatment at the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre between 1/1/1998 and 31/12/2000. Demographic and clinical data were collected by examination of the medical files. Mortality data were collected via a search of the National Coroners Information System; the Victorian State Coroner's office and clinical files. Nineteen patients died and just over two thirds of deaths were classified as intentional self-harm or suicide. Death was associated with male gender, previous suicide attempt and greater symptom severity at last contact. People with FEP are at increased risk of premature death, in particular suicide. A previous suicide attempt was very common amongst those who died, suggesting that future research could focus upon the development of interventions for young people with FEP who engage in suicidal behaviour.

AB The binding parameters of 5-HT2A and levels of its second messenger, 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), were simultaneously studied in frontal cortex and hippocampus from the brains of 18 control subjects and 18 depressed suicide victims. All suicides met DSM-III-R criteria for depressive symptoms, suffered a violent death and had not taken any antidepressant drugs for at least 6 months prior to death. A significant decrease in the number of 5-HT2A binding sites (154 +/- 22 vs. 254 +/- 36 fmol/mg), together with a significantly lower apparent affinity constant (1.02 +/- 0.08 vs. 1.36 +/- 0.09 nM), was detected in hippocampus but not in frontal cortex from the depressed suicides compared to the control subjects. Furthermore, IP3 concentrations were significantly increased in hippocampus (3.2 +/- 0.3 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.3 pmol/g) but not in frontal cortex (1.3 +/- 0.3 vs. 2.7 +/- 0.5 pmol/g) from the suicide victims. The reported results may indicate a significant hypersensitivity of the 5-HT2A postsynaptic receptor located in the hippocampus from depressed suicide victims, giving rise to an enhancement of its intracellular signaling system with higher IP3 production.

AB Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), the enzyme controlling serotonin synthesis, is considered to be a potential contributor to the biological substrate of suicide. The association of the promoter (-7065CT) and intron 7 (218AC) polymorphisms, and the related haplotype, of the Tph1 gene with suicidal behavior was investigated in a sample of 160 victims of violent suicide and 284 healthy controls. All individuals were males of Croatian (Slavic) origin. Allele frequencies of both polymorphisms in Croatian controls were similar to control values reported for other European populations. Alleles at the two loci demonstrated highly significant linkage disequilibrium. No differences between controls and victims for the Tph1 genetic variation, either at single loci, or at a haplotypic level, were demonstrated, albeit there was a tendency, not reaching statistical significance, towards an increase of the intron 7CC genotype in the suicide group. Negative association results on the individual Tph1 loci, in accordance with the majority of previous reports, confirmed the lack of their major effect also in the Slavic ethnicity. Haplotypic results, on the other hand, opposing the previous positive finding, point to the possible influence of ethnicity (or gender) on the association between the Tph1 gene polymorphism and suicide.

AB An 88-year-old woman committed suicide by drinking a toxic amount of highly concentrated alcohol and setting two rooms of her flat on fire. As there was not enough oxygen, the fire went out, however. At autopsy, no thermal lesions were found on the body, but soot depositions in the airways and a COHb value of 14% pointed to the inhalation of fire fumes. The ethanol concentration in femoral blood was 6.62 per mille. The gastric mucosa was fixed by the ingested alcohol and showed hardly any autolytic changes despite a post-mortem interval of five days. Congener analysis of the gastric contents and the femoral blood indicated the uptake of a fruit distillate or its foreshot. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ecological Momentary Assessment has been used to investigate a wide range of behaviors and psychiatric conditions. Previous investigations have consistently obtained promising results with high acceptance and compliance rates, and with only minor reactive effects for specific variables. Despite the promise of this methodology for the study of severe psychiatric populations, little is known about its feasibility in samples at risk for suicide. In the present study, four samples at varying risk for suicide completed an Ecological Momentary Assessment study by responding to five electronic assessments per day over a one-week period. Samples included healthy controls (n=13), affective controls (n=21), past suicide attempters (n=20), and recent suicide attempters (n= 42). The results demonstrate satisfactory participation rates and high compliance with daily life repeated assessments across all groups. Importantly, negative thoughts or suicidal ideation were not reactive to the duration of the study, indicating that the repeated assessment of such cognitions in daily life have little or no effect on their frequency. The findings provide support for the use of Ecological Momentary Assessment in the study of suicidal ideation and suggest that mobile technologies represent new opportunities for the assessment of high-risk cognitive states experienced by patients in daily life.

AB Injuries by handcrafted firearms are uncommon, and those by handcrafted shotguns are very rare. We present an unusual case of suicide using a handcrafted shotgun and slug. A 73-year-old male, who was a glass-grinding artisan, was found dead at a workshop on the premises of his residence. Autopsy showed a contact shotgun wound to the forehead, which perforated the cranium and caused extensive damage to the brain. The handcrafted shotgun was found in the proximity of the body. The shotgun consisted of metal pipes fixed to the vise and did not take the form of a conventional gun. The recovered slug was also found to be manufactured manually. It appeared that the handcrafted shotgun was only intended for committing suicide using his ballistics knowledge, skills, and resources. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study sought to compare the serum cholesterol levels of psychiatric in-patients, with and without recent suicidal behavior. The hypothesis was that the temperament dimension novelty seeking (NS) would be an intermediary variable, correlated with both serum cholesterol level and suicidal behavior. The study included 155 psychiatric inpatients, 21.9% (n=34) of whom had recently attempted suicide. Their cholesterol level was compared to that of patients with no suicide attempt. The NS dimension was explored with the aid of Cloninger's Temperament and Character Inventory. Significantly lower average cholesterol levels were found in women who had attempted suicide before hospitalization than for the others (4.71 mmol/l +/- 0.83 vs. 5.52 mmol/l +/- 1.36). Similar results were not found for men. However, the average NS scores did not differ according to suicide attempts in women or in men, and the scores of NS were not correlated with cholesterol level. This study confirms an association between low cholesterol and suicidal behavior in women only, but this association seems independent from the NS personality dimension. The absence of a correlation between serum cholesterol levels and suicidal behavior in men could be linked to the small number of men included in the study. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

The first case was a 46-year-old man, who had taken some antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs before cutting his right wrist and ingesting a large amount of concentrated hydrochloric acid. In the second case, a 34-year-old man was found dead in his home, hanging by his neck, with a suicidal stab wound on the left side of the chest. In the third case, a 22-year-old woman was found dead, hanging by her neck from a ceiling beam of her grandmother's a storage room, after taking of a solid rodenticide. The histories revealed psychiatric problems in all cases. The investigation of scene, the method employed, the autopsy findings and the interview with their relatives altogether pointed toward a suicidal etiology. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Though research indicates that individuals with social anxiety disorder may experience elevated levels of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, two interpersonal risk factors critical for the development of suicidal desire, it remains unclear why. The current investigation considered how shame and depression may help to explain the relationship between social anxiety and interpersonal suicide risk factors. Participants (N=259), recruited using Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk, completed measures of social anxiety, interpersonal suicide risk factors, shame, and depression. Social anxiety was associated with greater thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness. In addition, shame partially explained the association between social anxiety and thwarted belongingness, though the indirect effect was no longer significant after considering depression as a moderator. As predicted, shame was found to fully explain the association between social anxiety and perceived burdensomeness and this indirect effect was most pronounced among individuals with high comorbid depression. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The risk of suicide is disproportionately high among people diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizo-phreniform disorder. Brain imaging studies have shown a few relationships between neuroanatomy and suicide. This study examines the relationship between alterations in brain white matter (WM) and suicidal behavior in people with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder. The study participants were 56 patients with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder, with (n=15) and without (n=41) a history of suicide attempts. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values were compared between suicide attempters and non-attempters using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). Attempters showed significantly higher FA values than non-attempters in the left corona radiata, the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the posterior limb and retrolenticular part of the internal capsule, the external capsule, the insula, the posterior thalamic radiation, the cerebral peduncle, the sagittal stratum, and temporal lobe WM. Scores of the picture arrangement test showed a significant positive correlation with FA values of the right corona radiata, the right superior longitudinal fasciculus, the body of the corpus callosum, and the left corona radiata in attempters but not in non-attempters. These findings suggest that fronto-temporo-limbic circuits can be associated mainly with suicidal behavior in people with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Gunshot residue (GSR) is a valuable form of forensic trace evidence in the investigation of firearms-related suicide and crime. In order to ensure that such evidence is given appropriate evidential weighting when it comes to case investigations, the dynamics of the deposition and distribution of GSR must be understood. As the activity of the subject after firing is a major factor in the retention of GSR, cases of suicide involving a firearm provide an opportunity to assess GSR distribution where post-shooting activity is not an issue, assuming the subject had not been moved. Seventy-one cases of suicide by gunshot in South Australia between 1998 and 2014 were examined to collect data on firearm type, calibre, and gunshot residue test results. Overall, 47% of cases were found to produce GSR results that were not of high probative value, even though it was known that the shooter had fired a firearm. Of particular interest were cases involving 0.22 rimfire ammunition, for which characteristic particles are not expected due to lack of antimony present in the primer. Despite this, 64% of these cases resulted in the detection of antimony-containing, three-component particles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS) proposes that suicide ideation is caused by the interaction of perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, in which each predictor amplifies the harm of the other. Though several studies support this synergy hypothesis, research has not considered potential quadratic effects of perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, which can distort the sign, size, and significance of interactions, if mistakenly neglected in a model. This investigation examined the synergy hypothesis in samples of university undergraduates and psychiatric inpatients, this time controlling for quadratic effects. Despite adequate power, results showed no interaction between perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness in either sample, regardless of the presence of quadratic effects. Additionally, no quadratic effects were observed. The lower-order, linear perceived burdensomeness term was positively associated with suicide ideation in both samples, but the thwarted belongingness term was not associated with suicide ideation in either sample. The discussion considers implications of current findings for the IPTS, highlighting a need to formally test the impact of sample characteristics on the estimation of theory parameters. Recommendations for systematic evaluation of such sample and theory parameters are offered and their clinical implications are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In biological suicide research. low cerebrospinal fluid-5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (CSF-5HIAA) concentrations have been associated with suicidality, aggression and impulsivity. However, it frequently appears that the interpretation of existing study results is flawed. The analysis of various published findings suggests that contaminating factors like impulsivity or depressive symptoms in suicide attempters are often not taken into consideration at the time of suicide. The seemingly 'robust' association of low CSF-5HIAA concentration with 'suicidality' and 'aggression' is in fact rather weak. Reported associations of subgroups of suicidal behavior (e.g. violent suicide attempts) with low CSF-5HIAA concentrations are likely to represent somewhat premature translations of findings from studies that have flaws in methodology. Furthermore, the perception of 'suicidal behavior' as autoaggressive behavior or inwardly directed aggression in the view of the authors may not be useful in biological suicide research. The construct of aggressivity is insufficiently defined, resulting in difficulties to interpret empirical data. Some evidence exists, however, that reduced CSF-5HIAA concentrations might be related to certain depressive symptoms and changes in impulsivity. More carefully designed studies are required to overcome the existing methodological shortcomings. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We present a general kinetic analysis of enzyme catalyzed reactions evolving according to a Michaelis-Menten mechanism, in which an uncompetitive, reversible inhibitor acts. Simultaneously, enzyme inactivation is induced by an unstable suicide substrate, i.e. it is a Michaelis-Menten mechanism with double inhibition: one originating from the substrate and another originating from the reversible inhibitor. Rapid equilibrium of the reversible reaction steps involved is assumed and the time course equations for the reaction product have been derived under the assumption of limiting enzyme. The goodness of the analytical solutions has been tested by comparison with simulated curves obtained by numerical integration. A kinetic data analysis to determine the corresponding kinetic parameters from the time progress curve of the product is suggested. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cerbera odollam is a tree belonging to the poisonous Apocynaceae family, which includes the yellow and common oleanders. The seeds are excessively toxic, containing cerberin as the main active cardenolide. Cerbera venenifera, a related species found in Madagascar, has a long history as an ordeal poison, and was responsible for the death of 3000 people per year in previous centuries.
   The odollam tree is responsible for about 50% of the plant poisoning cases and 10% of the total poisoning cases in Kerala, India. It is used both for suicide and homicide. The aim of this retrospective study is to call attention to a powerful toxic plant that is currently completely ignored by western physicians, chemists, analysts and even coroners and forensic toxicologists.

AB A case of a combined suicide by oxydemeton-methyl (Metasystox (R)) ingestion and hanging is reported. Dimethyl phosphate (DMP) proved to be a stable product of oxydemeton-methyl; for its determination a gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric procedure was performed. DMP levels were quantified in several liquids and tissue samples: measured concentrations were 103.31 mu g/ml DMP in gastric contents, 0.10 mu g/ml in blood, 1.40 mu g/g in liver, 2.87 mu g/ml in bile and 0.80 mu g/g in kidney. No DMP was found in either urine or cerebrum. On the basis of the distribution of the poison in the organism, and particularly due to the fact that no DMP could be detected in the urine and that also an amount of DMP was found in the gastric contents, it can be assumed that there was a close temporal connection between ingestion of poison and hanging. Therefore, it is a case of a primary combined suicide. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: This paper reports the impact of two first- and second-grade classroom based universal preventive interventions on the risk of Suicide Ideation (SI) and Suicide Attempts (SA) by young adulthood. The Good Behavior Game (GBG) was directed at socializing children for the student role and reducing aggressive, disruptive behavior. Mastery Learning (ML) was aimed at improving academic achievement. Both were implemented by the teacher.
   Methods: The design was epidemiologically based, with randomization at the school and classroom levels and balancing of children across classrooms. The trial involved a cohort of first-grade children in 19 schools and 41 classrooms with intervention at first and second grades. A replication was implemented with the next cohort of first grade children with the same teachers but with little mentoring or monitoring.
   Results: In the first cohort, there was consistent and robust GBG-associated reduction of risk for suicide ideation by age 19-21 years compared to youths in standard setting (control) classrooms regardless of any type of covariate adjustment. A GBG-associated reduced risk for suicide attempt was found, though in some covariate-adjusted models the effect was not statistically robust. No statistically significant impact on these outcomes was found for ML. The impact of the GBG on suicide ideation and attempts was greatly reduced in the replication trial involving the second cohort.
   Conclusions: A universal preventive intervention directed at socializing children and classroom behavior management to reduce aggressive, disruptive behavior may delay or prevent onset of suicide ideation and attempts. The GBG must be implemented with precision and continuing support of teachers. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As one of the more specific and distinctive problems of human beings, suicide has been investigated with increasing attention all over the world. Several risk factors have been described as well as limitations arising from their study. The World Health Organization estimates that this scourge affects one million people annually, which corresponds to one death every 40 s worldwide. According to recent studies, Portugal, despite the good rates (10 suicide deaths per 100,000 inhabitants), had shown an increasing trend among younger people.
   This work aims to characterize the evolution of the suicidal profile autopsied at the Forensic Pathology Department of the Centre Branch of the National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences of Portugal, analyzing several variables: age, gender, marital status, employment status, suicidal methodology, toxicological analysis and some conditions/behaviors regarding personal history (alcoholism, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, physical illness, psychiatric disorder). All the autopsies from the 1 January, 2003 to 31 December, 2009 were analyzed.
   The suicide profile achieved corresponded to a man (77%), aged between 65 and 74 years old (20.4%), married (54.5%), employed, who committed suicide by hanging, in September, May or February. Clinical records include an organic health problem or psychiatric one, in addition to risk behaviors such as alcoholism, suicidal thoughts or suicide attempts.
   The number of suicides autopsied at the Centre Branch has increased, resembling the profile to the result of many other authors. However, new medical and social developments place hanging as the favorite suicide method in our study. Many barriers remain to overthrow but several prevention programs begin to be designed and implemented. Future evaluations and interventions at the social and medical level, including the death certification process, will be fundamental to a better realistic understanding of this phenomenon.

AB The smuggling of illicit drugs by means of body packing has become a common problem at European airports. Europe is considered to be the fastest growing market for cocaine worldwide, and the air route is the most frequently used method of trafficking cocaine. Smuggling illicit drugs by use of body packing is considered to be a high toxicological hazard because of the risk of leakage or a package bursting. We report about the first case of suicide of a body packer by re-ingesting the content of excreted cocaine packages. The consequence of this case is that the death scene investigation and autopsy assessments in case of a body packer's death should always consider the possibility of re-ingested packages.:Detention personnel should be instructed by forensic and criminalistic experts to take preventive measures.

AB Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) usually begins during adolescence, but its clinical features have received little investigation in this age group. Two hundred individuals with BDD (36 adolescents; 164 adults) completed interviewer-administered and self-report measures. Adolescents were preoccupied with numerous aspects of their appearance, most often their skin, hair, and stomach. Among the adolescents, 94.3% reported moderate, severe, or extreme distress due to BDD, 80.6% had a history of suicidal ideation, and 44.4% had attempted suicide. Adolescents experienced high rates and levels of impairment in school, work, and other aspects of psychosocial functioning. Adolescents and adults were comparable on most variables, although adolescents had significantly more delusional BDD beliefs and a higher lifetime rate of suicide attempts. Thus, adolescents with BDD have high levels of distress and rates of functional impairment, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts. BDD's clinical features in adolescents appear largely similar to those in adults. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The goals of the study were (1) to determine the association between parental and offspring suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among adult offspring in a general community sample, and (2) to examine the extent to which this association can be explained by mediating processes of mental disorders. Data were drawn from the National Comorbidity Survey (n = 8098), a representative household sample of adults aged 15-54 in the United States. The relationships between suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among adult offspring and suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in their parents, compared with those in parents not characterized by suicidal ideation or suicide attempts, were calculated using multiple logistic regression analyses. Analyses were adjusted for differences in sociodemographic characteristics and for mental disorders. Results showed that parental suicidal ideation was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of suicidal ideation [OR = 1.7 (1.2, 2.5)] and suicide attempt [OR = 1.4 (0.9, 2.1)] among offspring. Parental suicide attempt was associated with increased odds of suicidal ideation [OR = 2.0 (1.4, 2.9)] and suicide attempt [OR = 2.2 (1.4, 3.4)] among offspring. Comorbid mental disorders contributed to the strength of these associations, but with the exception of the link between parental suicidal ideation and offspring suicide attempt, all remained statistically significant even after adjustment. These data provide initial evidence of familial linkages (parent-offspring) of suicidal ideation and behavior among a sample of adults representative of the US population. The data suggest that comorbid mental disorders contribute to these associations but do not completely account for them. The findings are consistent with and extend results from family, clinical, and high-risk studies suggesting that a familial risk of suicidal ideation and suicide behavior occurs in the general population. Implications for prevention and future research are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The number of head wounds due to firearms remains low in France because these cases are primarily linked to suicide (or attempted suicide) and, to a lesser extent, to attacks or hunting accidents [1]. Characterized by the impact of a projectile, which in most cases is made of metal, at high levels of kinetic energy, such acts generally result in severe trans-cerebral lesions with significant levels of morbidity/mortality [2].
   Seldom are cases reported in the literature that give a detailed study of intracranial foreign bodies made of bone in such situations [3].
   Here we report on the case of two suicides resulting from a transcranial gunshot wounds caused by weapons and ammunition issued by the French police force. Each case helped distinguish a characteristic bone fragment, in the form of a "patch'', equivalent in size to the caliber of the bullet. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The research literature provides evidence on the possible link between single-car accident drivers and suicidal intent, and some scholars have stressed the role of unconscious suicidal motivations in some single-car accidents. This paper review relevant literature on the topic and sheds light on neglected factors that may play a central role in reducing the number of deaths due to car accidents. We performed careful PubMed, and PsycInfo searches to identify all papers and book chapters in English during the period 1955-2011. Our overview of the literature indicates that above 2% of the traffic accidents are suicide behaviors. However, the phenomenon may be underreported, considering that suicides by car accidents may be reported as accidental in the national statistics. On the other hand, the association between accident-pronesses and unconscious self-destructive impulses is an issue that is difficult to solve. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Photodynamic therapy (PDT) of tumors is associated with induction of hypoxia that results in activation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Several observations indicate that increased HIFs transcriptional activity in tumor cells is associated with cytoprotective responses that limit cytotoxic effectiveness of PDT. Therefore, we decided to examine whether this cytoprotective mechanism could be intentionally used for designing more efficient tumor cell cytotoxicity. To this end we transfected tumor cells with a plasmid vector carrying a suicide cytosine deaminase gene driven by a promoter containing hypoxia response elements (HRE). The presence of such a genetic molecular beacon rendered tumor cells sensitive to cytotoxic effects of a non-toxic prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC). The results of this study provides a proof of concept that inducible cytoprotective mechanisms can be exploited to render tumor cells more susceptible to cytotoxic effects of prodrugs activated by products of suicide genes.

AB The aims of this study were to investigate risk factors for suicide attempts and propose a model explaining the associations among life events and suicide status. We assessed 263 subjects admitted following a suicide attempt to the Division of Psychiatry of the Department of Neurosciences of the University of Parma and compared them with 263 non-attempter clinical control subjects. Attempters reported significantly more adverse life events both in the last 6 months, and between the ages of 0-15 years than non-attempters. A multinomial logistic regression analysis with stepwise forward entry indicated that the best model to explain suicide status was one which included life events in the last 6 months, life events during age 0-15 years, and their interaction. First-time attempter status (vs. non-attempters) was more likely to be linked to life events in the last 6 months, the interaction between life events in the last 6 months and life events during age 0-15 years, and low social support. Those attempters with one or more prior attempts (repeat attempters) were more likely than non-attempters to be linked to the interaction between life events in the last 6 months and life events during age 0-15 years, and to higher rates of psychopharmacological treatment before the index admission. Guided by these findings, monitoring the impact of early-life and recent events in vulnerable individuals should be part of risk assessment and treatment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Background: Methamphetamine (MA) use is a growing public health concern in many settings around the world. While some physical and mental health effects associated with injection MA use have been well described, little is known about the relationship between injecting MA and suicidal behavior. We sought to determine whether MA injection was associated with an increased risk of attempting suicide among a prospective cohort of injection drug users (IDUs) in Vancouver, Canada.
   Methods: Between 2001 and 2008, eligible participants enrolled in the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study (VIDUS) completed semi-annual questionnaires that elicited information regarding sociodemographics, drug use patterns, and mental health problems including suicidal behavior. We used Cox proportional hazards models with time-dependent covariates to determine whether self-reported MA injection was an independent predictor of attempting suicide at subsequent time points.
   Results: Of 1873 eligible participants, 149 (8.0%) reported a suicide attempt, resulting in an incidence density of 2.5 per 100 person-years. Participants who attempted suicide were more likely to be younger (median: 35 vs. 40, p < 0.01), female (48.3% vs. 35.1%, p < 0.01), and of Aboriginal ancestry (43.6% vs. 31.3%, p < 0.01). In a Cox proportional hazards model, MA injection was associated with an 80% increase in the risk of attempting suicide (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.08-2.99, p = 0.02).
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that IDUs who inject MA should be monitored for suicidal behavior. Improved integration of mental health and suicide prevention interventions within harm reduction and drug treatment programs may be fruitful. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: This study compared the profile of intentional drug overdoses (IDOs) presenting to emergency departments in Ireland and in the Western Trust Area of Northern Ireland between 2007 and 2012. Specifically the study aimed to compare characteristics of the patients involved, to explore the factors associated with repeated IDO and to report the prescription rates of common drug types in the population.
   Methods: We utilised data from two comparable registries which monitor the incidence of hospital-treated self-harm, recording data from deliberate self-harm presentations involving an IDO to all hospital emergency departments for the period 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2012.
   Results: Between 2007 and 2012 the registries recorded 56 494 self-harm presentations involving an IDO. The study showed that hospital-treated IDO was almost twice as common in Northern Ireland than in Ireland (278 vs 156/100 000, respectively).
   Conclusions: Despite the overall difference in the rates of IDO, the profile of such presentations was remarkably similar in both countries. Minor tranquillisers were the drugs most commonly involved in IDOs. National campaigns are required to address the availability and misuse of minor tranquillisers, both prescribed and non-prescribed.

AB Suicide is a public health problem all around the world. Family studies showed a strong heritability but, to date, few genetic data are available. Thus, in the present study we investigated whether a panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in neuronal cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM) 1 was associated with suicidal behaviour as well as specific traits related to suicide. A total of two hundred and fifty-nine individuals with a positive history of suicidal behaviour and 312 healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. Rs2301228, rs1884, rs1245113, rs1369816, rs2196456 and rs584427 in NCAM1 were genotyped. No marker was significantly associated with suicidal behaviour vs. controls or with sub-types of attempted vs. completed, violent vs. nonviolent, impulsive vs. non-impulsive suicide. Nonetheless rs1884 and rs2196456 SNPs were both marginally associated with the trait "inhibition of aggressiveness" in suicide attempters. Even though the investigated SNPs in NCAM1 do not seem to be directly associated with suicidal behaviour, our results could suggest that SNP variants in NCAM1 may impact on related traits, particularly by mediating inhibition of aggressiveness. However, independent studies are needed to validate these results. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID NONSUICIDAL SELF-INJURY; INTERPERSONAL-PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY; BORDERLINE
   PERSONALITY-DISORDER; BEHAVIOR
AB Joiner's (2005) (2005) interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide hypothesizes that painful and provocative events increase pain tolerance. The theory further proposes that increased pain tolerance represents one component of increased suicidal capability. Although initial studies have been consistent with this model, several key aspects remain untested. In 67 undergraduates, we investigated associations among painful and provocative events, nonsuicidal self-injury, acquired capability for suicide, and pain tolerance, threshold, and perceived intensity. Results were highly consistent with the interpersonal-psychological theory: a multiple mediation model specified that pain tolerance - but not other pain variables - accounted for significant variance within the association between painful and provocative events and acquired capability for suicide. These results held even when the pain tolerance item was removed from the suicidal capability questionnaire. Results also supported the interpersonal-psychological theory hypothesis that nonsuicidal self-injury represents an important painful and provocative event that increases suicidal capability. Specifically, participants with a history of nonsuicidal self-injury displayed increased suicidal capability and decreased pain perception. Overall, these results indicate that pain tolerance plays an important and specific role in suicidal capability. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: This study examined warning signs for suicide observed in the final day(s) of life in Veteran decedents who received healthcare from Veterans Health Administration (VHA) (N=381), using data obtained from detailed chart reviews.
   Methods: Veterans who died within a week (7 days) of healthcare contact (18%) were compared to those who died later (82%). Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine differences in suicidal thoughts, psychiatric symptoms, and somatic symptoms as documented at the last visit, after controlling for demographic variables. A second multivariate regression examined whether the identified warning signs were also risk factors for suicide within a month (30 days) of contact.
   Results: Documented suicidal ideation, OR (95% CI)=3.46 (1.15-10.38), and psychotic symptoms, OR (95% CI)=2.67 (1.11-6.42), at the last visit increased the likelihood of suicide within a week of healthcare contact. Both variables also increased the odds of suicide within a month of contact.
   Conclusions: The assessment of suicidal ideation is critical to identify Veterans at immediate risk. However, recognition of psychotic symptoms may also improve identification. In addition to indicating immediate risk, some warning signs may also suggest on-going risk. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Research has shown that both suicidal and Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) behaviors are co-morbid phenomena that are present in BPD patients, considered phenomenologically distinct, and associated with different methods, motives, frequency, and severity of psychopathology. This study is aimed at extending previous research by examining differences in demographical, clinical and psychological characteristics of BPD patients with or without a history of Suicide Attempts (SAs) and/or NSSI behaviors. Our sample included 89 outpatients with a BPD diagnosis assessed through clinical, structured interviews, and self-reports. The major findings showed that patients with a history of suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-injury were characterized by major number of lifetime suicide attempts and more severe feelings of hopelessness than patients with NSSI. Additionally, more violent thoughts towards others were observed in patients with NSSI. These results support a relatively more severe profile inherent in patients with SA and NSSI and allow us to differentiate NSSI from suicide attempts, highlighting the importance of evaluating and treating hopelessness and exploring the tendency to have violent thoughts towards others in this clinical population.

AB Male rates of suicide are significantly higher than female rates in Ireland and other Western countries, yet the process and detail of men's suicidal action is relatively unknown. This is partly due to prevailing theoretical and methodological approaches. In this area of study, macro-level, quantitative approaches predominate; and theoretical frameworks tend to adopt unitary notions of men, as well as binary, oppositional, concepts of masculinity and femininity. This inquiry, based on in-depth interviews with 52 young Irish men who made a suicide attempt, examines suicidal behaviour at the individual level. The findings demonstrate that these men experienced high levels of emotional pain but had problems identifying symptoms and disclosing distress and this, along with the coping mechanisms used, was linked to a form of masculinity prevalent in their social environment. Dominant or hegemonic masculinity norms discouraged disclosure of emotional vulnerability, and participants used alcohol and drugs to cope which exacerbated and prolonged their distress. Over time this led to a situation where they felt their options had narrowed, and suicidal action represented a way out of their difficulties. These men experienced significant, long-lasting, emotional pain but, in the context of lives lived in environments where prevailing constructions of masculinity constrained its expression, they opted for suicide rather than disclose distress and seek help. Underpinning this study is a presumption that binary notions of male and female emotions lack substance, but that the expression of emotions is gender-specific and constrained in some social localities.

AB Zaleplon ("Sonata(R)") is a pyrazolopyrimidine derivative approved for use in the United States for the treatment of insomnia. To date, there has been little data in the toxicological literature where zaleplon has been implicated as causing a fatal intoxication, either alone or in combination with other drugs. This report documents a case where zaleplon was identified in a suicide by multiple drug ingestion. The following zaleplon concentrations were found: heart blood 2.2 mg/l; bile 8.6 mg/l and urine 1.4 mg/l. Zaleplon was also detected but not quantitated in the kidney and liver.

AB Surgeons frequently treat the consequences of self-harm. Self-harm is a common problem and presentations to Irish hospitals are increasing. It increases the risk of suicide and is associated with long term morbidity. Appropriate management can improve the prognosis. Surgeons require a number of skills to appropriately manage patients who self-harm. In this review we outline those skills including diagnosis, communication, capacity and risk assessment.

AB The efficacy of serotonin reuptake inhibitors in depression and anxiety disorders suggests the gene coding for the serotonin transporter (5-HTT), SLC6A4, as a candidate of importance for these conditions. Positive findings regarding associations between polymorphisms in SLC6A4 have been reported, indicating that these polymorphisms may influence anxiety-related personality traits, as well as the risk of developing depression and suicidality. Serotonin 5-HTT availability was assessed with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), using I-123-beta-CIT as ligand, in a population of unmedicated male suicide attempters (n=9) and in matched controls (n=9). Two polymorphisms in SLC6A4 were assessed, including the 5-HTTLPR located in the promoter region and a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism in intron 2 (STin2). In suicide attempters, but not in controls, low 5-HTT availability was associated with the S allele of 5-HTTLPR and with the 12 repeat allele of STin2. Data suggest that polymorphisms in SLC6A4 may influence the expression of the brain serotonin transporter in suicide attempters. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MOTOR-VEHICLE EXHAUST
AB In the period 1995-1999 there were 388 car exhaust-gas suicides in Denmark. Of these 343 (88.4%) were men and 45 (11.6%) were women, the average age being 47 years. The car exhaust-gas suicides made up 9.3% of all suicides in Denmark in the period. The corresponding rate was 11.7% for men and 3.7% for women. In rural areas a larger part of all suicides were committed with car exhaust-gas compared to the more densely populated areas. Mental disease was diagnosed in 124 (32.0%) cases. A suicide note was found in 165 (42.5%) cases. A hose was fitted to the exhaust pipe in 334 (86.1%) cases. Of these the 234 (60.3%) occurred outside, typically in a forest area, while 76 (19.6%) occurred in a closed garage. All the 54 (13.9%) cases with no hose fitted to the exhaust pipe occurred in a garage. Seven (1.8%) victims were found in a burning or burnt-out car, where the following investigation revealed that it was actually a car exhaust-gas suicide. Carboxyhemoglobin was measured in 26 (6.7%) victims. In two of these victims no carboxyhemoglobin was found, as they had survived for some time after the poisoning. The average saturation of the remaining victims was 67%, the lowest saturation being 20% and the highest being 84%.
   In the period 1969-1987 the number of car exhaust-gas suicides in Denmark increased from 50 to similar to 190 per year and the rate of car exhaust-gas suicides compared to all suicides increased from similar to 5% to similar to 13%. In 1987-1999 these figures decreased from similar to 190 to 63 per year and from 13% to similar to 8%. During these 30 years the number of passenger cars in Denmark doubled, which explains the increase in car exhaust-gas suicides during 1969-1987. A possible explanation for the decrease in 1987-1999 is the introduction of the catalytic converter, which was made mandatory in 1990. We anticipate that car exhaust-gas suicides will continue to decrease in numbers, as more cars are equipped with catalytic converters. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aim: The objective of the study was to examine the toxicological characteristics of suicide attempts by deliberate self-poisoning in children and adolescents.
   Method: From the Toxicological Information Centre's database, the inquiries due to the suicide attempts in children (9-13 years old) and adolescents (14-18 years old) were evaluated.
   Results and conclusions: From 10,492 calls concerning suicide attempts, 2393 concerned children and adolescents. Most suicide attempts were attempted in spring (31.3%). Among the toxic agents, drugs were used in 97.8% cases. The most frequent ingestions appeared using drugs affecting the nervous system and anti-inflammatory non-steroids. The dose was evaluated as toxic in 73.4%, severely toxic in 3.0% and unknown in 11.2% cases. Only one in 10 children used a non-toxic dose. Girls, more frequently than boys (13.2% vs. 8.9%), used non-toxic doses. The symptoms of moderate and severe intoxications were present in 10.5% of the cases. Poison centre consultation was accessed within the first hour after the ingestion in one-fifth of the patients. In both age groups, the severity of the intoxication was greater among elder males who reached the medical facilities later than 4 h after the poisoning. The combinations of three or more drugs affecting central nervous system were present in the most severe cases. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Knowledge of the epidemiology of suicide is a necessary prerequisite for developing prevention programs. The aim of this study was to analyze the risk of completed suicide among individuals with alcohol use disorders (AUD), and to assess the role of other psychiatric disorders in this association. A prospective cohort study was used, containing three updated sets of lifestyle covariates and 26 years follow-up of 18,146 individuals between 20 and 93 years of age from the Copenhagen City Heart Study in Denmark. The study population was linked to four different registers in order to detect: Completed suicide, AUD, Psychotic disorders, Anxiety disorders, Mood disorders, Personality disorders, Drug abuse, and Other psychiatric disorders. Individuals registered with AUD were at significantly increased risk of committing suicide, with a crude hazard ratio (FIR) of 7.98 [Confidence interval (CI): 5.27-12.07] compared to individuals without AUD. Adjusting for all psychiatric disorders the risk fell to 3.23 (CI: 1.96-5.33). In the stratified sub-sample of individuals without psychiatric disorders, the risk of completed suicide was 9.69 (CI: 4.88-19.25) among individuals with AUD. The results indicate that individuals registered with AUD are at highly increased risk of completed suicide, and that registered co-morbid psychiatric disorders are neither sufficient nor necessary causes in this association.

AB Mounting evidence supports the association between a polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene promoter region (5-HTTLPR) and suicidal behaviour. Recently, a novel variant of the 5-HTTLPR L allele was identified. The previously unknown L-G allele produced similar levels of gene expression to the S allele and might have been misclassified as a "high-expression" allele in previous association studies. In this study, we aimed to compare the genotype distribution of the tri-allelic 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in 168 Chinese patients with schizophrenia, including 60 suicide attempters and 108 non-suicide attempters. In our analysis, which used the L-A dominant model, it was found that the L-A allele carriers were significantly more likely to have attempted suicide (p = 0.035). Further analysis showed this association existed only in male patients (p = 0.012). A similar association between the L-A allele and violent suicide attempt was also found (p = 0.028). In addition, logistic regression confirmed our findings that male L-A allele carriers were at a higher risk of suicide, although the lack of a significant association in females may reflect insufficient power due to small sample size. However, no association was found when we examined the traditional bi-allelic 5-HTTLPR. These findings differ from those reported in Caucasian subjects, where no associations have been reported. Different genetic backgrounds may give rise to different allelic distribution, causing differential effects on the expression of endophenotypes of suicide behaviours. Although the potential influence of multiple comparisons might weaken our findings, our study provides preliminary evidence for a potentially gender-specific role of a "high-expression" 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in susceptibility to suicide in Chinese patients with schizophrenia.

AB The association between a polymorphism in the promoter area of the serotonin transporter (17q11.1-q12) with impulsivity and history of aggressive behavior was studied in a Spanish general hospital. Subjects comprised 216 suicide attempters (152 women and 64 men) and 223 control blood donors (124 women and 99 men). They were classified as S individuals (s/s or s/l) with low expression of the serotonin transporter, and L individuals (l/l) with high expression. The genotype was not associated with high levels of impulsivity (measured with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale) or history of aggressive behavior (measured with the Brown-Goodwin scale). This lack of association did not appear to be explained by lack of statistical power. High scores on the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) and the Brown-Goodwin Aggressive Behavior Scale were associated with being an attempter, male,gender and borderline personality disorder. While our Spanish suicide attempters and published US suicide attempters have similar BIS scores, our Spanish suicide attempters have significantly lower aggressive behavior scores. If cross-cultural differences in aggressive behavior scores are definitively established, country norms for aggressive behavior scales will need to be developed to compare genetic studies in different countries.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and correlates of attempted suicide among young injection drug users (IDUs) from six study sites in five US cities. Two thousand two hundred and nineteen participants 15-30 years of age underwent interviewer-administered questionnaires relating to self-reported drug use, sociodemographics, suicidal ideation and attempts, and exposure to violence. The 6-month prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts was 35.8% (n = 795) and 7% (n = 156), respectively. Compared to those not reporting a recent (past 6 months) suicide attempt, those attempting suicide were more likely to have a lifetime history of mental health facility admission or sexual abuse. Participants receiving drug treatment at the time of the baseline interview (53.2% versus 37.1%, odds ratio [OR] = 1.93, 95% confidence interval [Cl]: 1.39, 2.67) were also more likely to report a recent attempt; as were those reporting a history of experiencing violence. These associations persisted after adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, study site, and other significant covariates by multiple logistic regression. These data suggest that increased access to drug treatment, community mental health, and violence prevention programs may decrease suicidal behavior among young injection drug users.

AB The present research examined how incarceration, suicide attempts, suicidality, and difficulty controlling violence relate to the underlying factor structure of psychiatric comorbidity among a large sample of Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans (N=1897). Diagnostic interviews established psychiatric diagnoses; self-report measures assessed history of incarceration, difficulty controlling violence, suicide attempts, and suicidality. A 3-factor measurement model characterized by latent factors for externalizing-substance-use disorders (SUD), distress, and fear provided excellent fit to the data. Alcohol-use disorder, drug-use disorder, and nicotine dependence were indicators on the externalizing-SUD factor. Posttraumatic stress disorder and depression were indicators on the distress factor. Panic disorder, social phobia, specific phobia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder were indicators on the fear factor. Incarceration was exclusively predicted by the externalizing-SUD factor. Difficulty controlling violence, suicidality, and suicide attempts were exclusively predicted by the distress factor. Contrary to hypotheses, the path from the externalizing/SUB factor to difficulty controlling violence was not significant. Taken together, these findings suggest that the distress factor of psychiatric comorbidity is a significant risk factor for suicidality, suicide attempts, and difficulty controlling violence and could help to explain the frequent co-occurrence of these critical outcomes among returning Iraq/Afghanistan veterans.

AB Background: While the elevated risk of suicide attempt among persons who inject drugs (PWID) is well documented, whether use of different substances is associated with varying degrees of risk remains unclear. We sought to examine the associations between substance use patterns and attempted suicide in a prospective cohort of PWID in Montreal, Canada.
   Methods: Between 2004 and 2011, participants completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire eliciting information on socio-demographics, substance use patterns, related behaviors, and mental health markers. Generalized estimating equations were used to model the relationship between self-reported use of six common substances (cocaine, amphetamine, opioids, sedative-hypnotics, cannabis and alcohol), associated patterns of use (chronic, occasional and none), and a recent (past six-month) suicide attempt.
   Results: At baseline, of 1240 participants (median age: 39.1,83.7% male), 71 (5.7%) reported a recent suicide attempt. Among 5621 observations collected during follow-up, 221 attempts were reported by 143 (11.5%) participants. In multivariate analyses adjusting for socio-demographics and psychosocial stressors, among primary drugs of abuse, chronic [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.97] and occasional (AOR: 1.92) cocaine use, and chronic amphetamine use (AOR: 1.96) were independently associated with attempted suicide. Among co-used substances, chronic sedative-hypnotic use was independently associated with an attempt (AOR: 2.29). No statistically significant association was found for the remaining substances.
   Conclusion: Among PWID at high risk of attempted suicide, stimulant users appear to constitute a particularly vulnerable sub-group. While the mechanisms underlying these associations remain to be elucidated, findings suggest that stimulant-using PWID should constitute a prime focus of suicide prevention efforts.

AB Deficits in decision-making using the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) have been found in past suicide attempters, but primarily euthymic and/or medicated patients. This study compared IGT performance among medication-free, currently depressed patients (unipolar and bipolar) with (n=26) and without (n=46) a past history of suicide attempt, and healthy volunteers (n=42). Attempter status, in a sample whose attempts were predominantly non-violent, was not associated with impaired IGT performance even when accounting for sex, mood disorder type, and comorbid Borderline Personality Disorder. A non-significant trend towards poorer performance was found in a small subgroup of past attempters who had used a violent method, consistent with prior studies. Suicide intent and ideation were unrelated to IGT scores. There were no consistent associations between IGT performance and ratings of impulsiveness (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS)), hostility (Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI)) or aggression (Brown-Goodwin Aggression Inventory (BGAI)). Results suggest that decision-making impairment is related to specific subtypes of suicidal behavior, but may not be universally sensitive to suicide risk in all types of attempters, especially those using non-violent means. Psychometric and conceptual issues surrounding the IGT also appear to affect its utility as a general marker of suicidal behavior risk. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The interpersonal theory of suicide (Joiner, T.E., 2005. Why People Die By Suicide. Harvard University Press, Cambridge) postulates that, for a serious or lethal suicide attempt one has to possess a desire to die and the capability to commit suicide. The capability is proposed to be acquired over time by repeated experiences with painful and provocative events such as self-injurious behavior and other experiences such as childhood abuse, combat exposure, physical fights, promiscuous sex, and playing contact sports. Up to now, experiences with painful and provocative events are measured with various versions of the Painful and Provocative Events Scale (PPES). However, a thorough validation of this assessment instrument is still lacking. Our study aimed at validating the German version of PPES, with two clinical (n=424) and one community sample (n=532). Results support a two-factor structure (eight items "active painful and provocative events", four items "passive painful and provocative events") that was invariant across the three subsamples. Nonetheless, low factor loadings, low indicator reliabilities, moderate construct reliability and mixed evidence for construct validity indicate that the PPES in its current form appears to be of limited use. The development of a new instrument to assess painful and provocative events seems appropriate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of an anxiety disorder is associated with greater frequency of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Given the high personal and societal costs of suicidal behaviors, suicide prevention is a priority. Understanding factors present within individuals with anxiety disorders that increase suicide risk may inform prevention efforts. The aims of the present study were to examine the prevalence of suicidal ideation and behaviors, as well as factors associated with suicide risk in patients with anxiety disorders in primary care. Data from a large scale randomized controlled study were analyzed to assess prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, as well as factors associated with suicide risk. Results revealed that suicidal ideation and behaviors were relatively common in this group. When examining mental and physical health factors jointly, presence of depression, mental health-related impairment, and social support each uniquely accounted for variance in suicide risk score. Methodological limitations include cross-sectional data collection and lack of information on comorbid personality disorders. Moreover, patients included were from a clinical trial with exclusion criteria that may limit generalizability. Results highlight the complex determinants of suicidal behavior and the need for more nuanced suicide assessment in this population, including evaluation of comorbidity and general functioning.

AB Although the relationships between PTSD, abuse history, and suicidal behaviors are well-established in military and outpatient samples, little data is available on this relationship in inpatient samples. This study examines the relationships between these variables and related demographic and clinical correlates in a sample of psychiatric inpatients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder using electronic medical record (EMR) data. Controlling for relevant demographic and clinical variables, PTSD diagnosis and history of abuse were both significantly associated with history of suicide attempt, but in a combined model, only history of abuse remained as a significant predictor. Whereas history of abuse was associated with a history multiple suicide attempts, PTSD diagnosis was not. Both insurance status and gender acted as significant moderators of the relationship between history of abuse and history of suicide attempt, with males and those with public/no insurance having greater associations with history of suicide attempts when an abuse history was present. These data indicate the importance of documentation of PTSD, abuse history, and history of suicide attempts. The results also suggest that in the presence of an abuse history or PTSD diagnosis, additional time spent on safety and aftercare planning following hospital discharge may be indicated.

AB Current suicidal ideation and attempts are more commonly found in female patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) than in males. However, little is known about the relationship between activity of female reproductive hormones and suicide. The study population consisted of 490 female MDD patients of age >= 18. They were assessed by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. At the same visit, we measured blood Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), estradiol, progesterone, Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH), cortisol, thyroid hormones, and prolactin. Blood FSH showed a significant difference among female MDD patients with suicide attempt, those with ideation, and those without within the previous month. Post-hoc analysis also showed that FSH was significantly lower in MDD patients with suicide attempt and ideation than those without, whereas other hormones showed no differences between those with and without attempt. FSH was negatively associated with current suicidality scores after adjustment for age and education years in all age groups. FSH was significantly lower in those with current suicide ideation or attempt than those without in age 45 years or under, but not in other age groups. In conclusion, blood FSH is significantly lower in female MOD patients with current suicide attempt or ideation than those without, especially in age 45 years or under. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB This study of youth seeking psychiatric emergency department (ED) services examined (1) youth self efficacy to use suicide-specific coping strategies, (2) whether these self-efficacy beliefs varied by demographic and clinical characteristics, (3) and associations of these beliefs with suicide attempts and ED visits 3-5 months later. Participants were 286 psychiatric ED patients (59% Female), ages 13-25. Ratings of self-efficacy to engage in 10 suicide-specific coping behaviors were assessed at index visit. A total of 226 participants (79%) were assessed 3-5 months later. Youth endorsed low-to-moderate self-efficacy for different suicide-specific coping behaviors, with lowest ratings endorsed for limiting access to lethal means and accessing professional resources. More severe baseline psychopathology was associated with lower self-efficacy. Males endorsed higher self-efficacy for coping behaviors not requiring external support. Lower coping self-efficacy for some of the key strategies, and lower confidence that these strategies will be helpful, differentiated those with and without follow-up suicide attempts and ED visits. The generally low-to-moderate confidence in youths' ability to engage in coping behaviors to manage suicidal crises, and its association with follow-up suicidal crises, is concerning because many of these strategies are commonly included as part of discharge recommendations or safety planning. Implications of findings are discussed. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Studies consistently indicate that inhalant use is associated with increased mental health problems in adolescents, but few investigations have focused on the potential relationship of inhalant use to suicidality (ideation or attempt). This study examined how different levels of volatile solvent use relate to suicidal ideation and attempted suicide among 723 incarcerated youth (mean age = 15.5, S.D. = 1.2; 87% male) in Missouri, and whether any associations between solvent use and suicidality differ by gender. In bivariate analyses, severity of inhalant use was positively associated with histories of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt for both boys and girls. In multivariate analyses, inhalant use disorders remained significantly associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempt histories even after adjusting for general level of psychiatric symptoms, prior trauma, other substance use, gender, and additional potential confounders. Inhalant use without abuse or dependence also significantly related to suicidal ideation in multivariate analyses, but an interaction between gender and inhalant use signified this relationship was stronger for girls. Inhalant use disorders in incarcerated youth, as well as inhalant use without abuse or dependence (particularly in girls), may signal elevated suicide risk. Suicide risk assessments should, therefore, include questions about inhalation of volatile solvents such as paint, gasoline, and household cleaners. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Suicide is a leading cause of death among young adults and the rate of suicide has been increasing for decades. A depression distress amplification model posits that young adults with comorbid depression and anxiety have elevated suicide rates due to the intensification of their depressive symptoms by anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns. The current study tested the effects of anxiety sensitivity subfactors as well as the depression distress amplification model in a very large sample of college students with elevated suicide risk. Participants were 721 college students who were at elevated risk of suicidality (scored > 0 on the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation). Consistent with prior work, anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns, but not physical or social concerns, were associated with suicidal ideation. Consistent with the depression distress amplification model, in individuals high in depression, anxiety sensitivity cognitive coricems predicted elevated suicidal ideation but not among those with low depression. The results of this study corroborate the role of anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns and the depression distress amplification model in suicidal ideation among a large potentially high-risk group of college students. The depression distress amplification model suggests a specific mechanism, anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns, that may be responsible for increased suicide rates among those with comorbid anxiety and depression.

AB A number of studies have established a strong connection between acute inebriation, alcohol addiction and suicides, as the last act of alcoholism or an act of desperation in an alcoholic's family, an act of escape from restraints in state of depression or as a way of self-destruction.
   In recent years in average 600 people per year committed suicide. Slovenia is a country with extremely high and variable suicide tendencies and harmful alcohol use levels, as well as a high level of alcohol-related troubles.
   The aim of our research was to ascertain some typical features, especially those connected to the inebriation of suicide victims from a wider Ljubljana region. Autopsies were carried out on the victims in the period between 1995 and 1999.
   There were 508 (31.2%) suicides among all the analyzed violent deaths; 73.2% of them were men. The average age of the victims was 46.5 years. Most suicides were committed at home (50.0%). 25.4% were completely sober in the moment of the act, while in all other cases inebriation was established, the average value being 9.57 g/kg. Men were drunk in 87.1% of cases, women only in 12.9% and the given alcohol levels were substantially higher with men (0.65:0.26 g/kg). The share of inebriated persons decreases with age-reaching its peak in the 35-54 age group. Regarding the method, the predominant ones are intoxication and the use of firearms, which is a typical way of committing suicide among men, while women rather choose jumping from great heights and drowning.
   Alcohol was present in as many as 55.7% of suicides with intoxication and in 68.8% of all suicides committed by using firearms, while the highest alcohol levels were found in those who died from cutting their veins (2.01 g/kg),
   Based on this and on other research, more effort should be focused on alcohol abuse prevention, making all people aware of the consequences of alcohol abuse, the possibilities of treatment and their availability as well as possible co-morbid depressions. Simultaneously, due to an established link, the national alcohol policy and strategy for prevention of suicides should be professionally harmonized. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI Suicide among male prisoners in France: A prospective population-based

ID WALES; JAIL
AB Background: Suicide rates are high among prisoners but little is known about the precise weight of each risk factor.
   Methods: We collected data on the periods of imprisonment of all adult males incarcerated in France between 1 January, 2006 and 15 July, 2009. We used survival analyses from the incarceration to its end, censored by the observation period. We calculated suicide rates and performed a Cox model to assess the link between prisoners' imprisonment characteristics and suicide risk.
   Results: Overall, 301,611 periods of imprisonment were observed and 353 suicides were recorded. The suicide rate was 17.9 suicides per 10,000 person-years (95% CI: 16.1-19.9). The hazard ratio (HR) of suicide risk was high for placements in a disciplinary cell (15.7, 95% CI: 10.6-23.5) and varied depending on the main offence (homicide: 7.6, 95% CI: 5.3-10.9, rape: 4.6, 95% CI: 3.2-6.6, other sexual assault: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.9-4.6, other violent offence: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.5-2.8, compared with other offences). HR was lower when visits from relatives were observed (0.4, 95% CI: 0.3-0.5) and higher if a hospitalization was observed (1.6, 95% CI: 1.3-2.0). After conviction, HR halved with respect to the remand period, but there was no difference by sentence length. HR was higher if incarceration occurred after age 30 (1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.7). Foreigners tended to have lower risks than French prisoners, with the exception of those incarcerated for rape.
   Conclusions: The suicide rate in prison is generally much higher than in the general population. This study has replicated previous international findings, highlighting the impact of the type of offence on suicide risk. Suicide prevention programmes must consider the high risk associated with incarceration for a criminal offence against a person. With regard to the impact of visits from relatives and placements in a disciplinary cell, further work should be conducted from a psychological perspective to examine the effects of physical and social isolation.

AB Introduction: Research indicates that experiencing the suicide of a relative can have a significant impact on family members' emotional health. However, research incorporating the impact of suicide bereavement on family members' physical health is sparse. This paper details the protocol for a mixed-methods study of suicide-bereaved family members. The study will primarily examine the physical and mental health needs of those bereaved by suicide. A secondary objective of the study is to describe the support service needs of family members bereaved by suicide.
   Methods and analysis: A mixed-methods approach, using semistructured interviews and self-report questionnaires, will be used. Interviews will be conducted with a group of 15-20 relatives who experienced suicide bereavement. This protocol will follow the COREQ checklist criteria for the reporting of qualitative research interviews. Thematic analysis will be used to examine experiences and impact of bereavement on psychological and physical health. Self-report quantitative data on well-being will be analysed using descriptive statistics.
   Ethics and dissemination: Ethical approval to conduct this study has been granted from the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Cork Teaching Hospitals. Pseudonyms will be given to participants to protect anonymity. It will be explained to participants that participation in the study is voluntary and they have to right to withdraw at any time. The findings of this research will be disseminated to regional, national and international audiences through publication in peer-reviewed international journals and presentations at scientific conferences. This research also forms part of a PhD thesis.

AB Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by cognitive impairments, motor abnormalities, and psychiatric disturbance. An increased risk for suicide has been documented. The majority of HD research has focused on cognitive and motor features of HD; the implications of psychiatric manifestations have received less consideration. Recent studies have sought to identify the stages of HD in which patients are at increased risk to experience suicidal ideation, though no study has examined possible risk factors for suicidality. The current study examines the presence of psychiatric comorbidity and its involvement in suicidal ideation. Suicidal ideation was examined in 1941 HD patients enrolled in the Huntington Study Group. Of those, 19% (N = 369) endorsed current suicidal ideation. Logistic regression analyses indicated that depression/anxiety and aggression/irritability are significant predictors of suicidal ideation. In a subsample with the greatest suicidal ideation, alcohol and drug abuse were also predictive. It is recommended that all individuals with HD (specifically those with features of depression, aggression, substance abuse) have routine suicide assessment; further research is needed to understand the high rate of suicide in HD.

AB Suicide rates doubled in males aged < 45 in England and Wales between 1950 and 1998, in contrast rates declined in older males and females of all ages. Explanations for these divergent trends are largely speculative, but social changes are likely to have played an important role. We undertook a time-series analysis using routinely available age- and sex-specific suicide, social, economic and health data, focussing on the two age groups in which trends have diverged most-25-34 and 60 + year olds. Between 1950 and 1998 there were unfavourable trends in many of the risk factors for suicide: rises in divorce, unemployment and substance misuse and declines in births and marriage. Whilst economic prosperity has increased, so too has income inequality. Trends in suicide risk factors were generally similar in both age-sex groups, although the rises in divorce and markers of substance misuse were most marked in 25-34 year olds and young males experienced the lowest rise in antidepressant prescribing. Statistical modelling indicates that no single factor can be identified as underlying recent trends. The factors most consistently associated with the rises in young male suicide are increases in divorce, declines in marriage and increases in income inequality. These changes have had little effect on suicide in young females. This may be because the drugs commonly used in overdose-their favoured method of suicide-have become less toxic or because they are less affected by the factors underlying the rise in male suicide. In older people declines in suicide were associated with increases in gross domestic product, the size of the female workforce, marriage and the prescribing of antidepressants. Recent population trends in suicide appear to be associated with by a range of social and health related factors. It is possible that some of the patterns observed are due to declining levels of social integration, but such effects do not appear to have adversely influenced patterns in older generations.

AB Introduction: Individuals with substance-related disorders are at increased risk for suicidal behavior. Identifying those at higher risk for suicide among this population is difficult and informed mainly on the basis of cross-sectional data.
   Methods: We examined factors associated with drug-related Suicidal behavior using Multivariable regression analyses in a 2-year prospective study of 470 inpatients enrolled from an unlocked, detoxitification unit. Suicidal behavior included suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempt (S A).
   Results: Lifetime prevalence for SI was 28.5%, and for SA, 21.9%. During the 2-year follow-up, 19.9% of the sample endorsed suicidal ideation and 6.9% reported a suicide attempt. Correlates of lifetime suicidal behavior included younger age, female, Hispanic, greater depressive symptoms, past sexual abuse, and problem sedative or alcohol use. Factors associated with suicidal behavior at follow-up included past suicidal behavior, more depressive symptoms, and more frequent benzodiazepine and alcohol use. Cocaine and heroin use did not reach statistical significance.
   Conclusions: Suicidal behavior is common among individuals with substance-related disorders. Differences in "suicide potential" may exist between drug categories with CNS depressants increasing the risk. These findings highlight the importance of addressing the recurrent 'suicide risk' of patients with substance-related disorders and regular monitoring for changes in depressive symptoms and drug use. Based on the prevalence and severity of this problem, the role of universal suicide screening of individuals with substance-related disorders merits greater attention. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Background: This study updated and expanded upon Harris and Barraclough's empirical review [Harris, E.C., Barraclough, B., 1997. Suicide as an Outcome for mental disorders. A meta-analysis, Br. J. Psychiatry 170, 205-228] of retrospective and prospective cohort studies of alcohol and drug use disorders and suicide.
   Method: Studies presenting data on alcohol and drug use disorders and suicide originally identified by Harris and Barraclough were used in this study. To find additional studies, (1) the location of English language reports on MEDLINE (1994-2002) were identified with the search terms 'substance-disorders' with 'mortality' and 'follow-up', (2) read throughs were conducted of four prominent alcohol and drug specialty journals from 1966 through 2002, and (3) the reference sections of studies that met criteria were searched for additional reports. This strategy yielded 42 new studies meeting eligibility criteria.
   Results: The estimated standardized mortality ratios (SMR; 95% confidence interval) for suicide were as follows: alcohol use disorder (979; 95% CI 898-1065; p < 0.00 1), opioid use disorder (135 1; 95% CI 1047-1715; p < 0.00 1), intravenous drug use (1373; 95% CI 1029-1796; p < 0.00 1), mixed drug use ( 1685; 95% CI 1473-1920; p < 0.00 1), heavy drinking (35 1; 95% CI 251-478; p < 0.00 1). SMR estimates stratified by sex were also calculated.
   Conclusions: Additional studies on the association of suicide and mixed drug use, heavy drinking, and alcohol use disorders in women augmented the findings of Harris and Barraclough, along with a novel estimate for intravenous drug use, a byproduct of intensive research on HIV in the past decade. There is a large empirical literature on alcohol use disorders and suicide and a moderate literature on suicide and opioid use disorders and IV drug use. There remains limited prospective data on the association of suicide and other drug use disorders (e.g., cocaine, cannabis). (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Methane is a suffocating gas, and "methane deaths" are largely the result of suffocation by gas-air displacement after accidental or deliberate exposure. Neither methane gas nor other suffocating gases are a common means of homicide, with the potential exception of the use of gas in chemical weapons or gas chambers. Here, we report the case of a 53-year-old woman who was killed by her husband with methane gas. The man had given his wife a dose of Lorazepam before setting up a hose that conveyed methane from the kitchen into the apartment's bedroom. The man subsequently faked his own suicide, which was later discovered. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

   suicidal behaviors and treatment response
SO NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS

AB The p11 protein (also called S100A10), which plays a pivotal role in the dynamic modulation of serotonergic I B receptor function, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD) and the therapeutic mechanisms of antidepressant action. Humans and mice with depression have lower central p11 levels, and treatment with antidepressant agents raises p11 levels in animals. Furthermore, brain p11 mRNA expression is lower in post mortem brains from patients who were suffering from depression and had committed suicide compared with control subjects who had died from other causes. From the above findings, the p11 gene may be considered a candidate gene for the investigation of MDD susceptibility, response to antidepressants or the likelihood of attempting suicide. Three p11 polymorphisms were genotyped in 470 patients with MDD and 447 normal controls. No significant association with MDD was discovered in single locus or haplotype analyses. The analysis for genotypic effects showed no significant association between any of the three p11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and MDD therapeutic response. With regard to the risk of suicide attempt, 51 of the 470 MDD patients were found to have attempted suicide in the depressive episode during which they were monitored. No significant association with suicide attempt was shown in both the alleles and genotypes of single loci or of haplotypes constructed from these three p11 polymorphisms. Our findings suggest that p11 genetic variants do not play a major role in the MDD susceptibility, antidepressant therapeutic response or the risk of suicide attempt in MDD.

AB Previous studies of the prolactin response to D-fenfluramine in depressed patients have yielded inconsistent results. This may be because they did not address the question of suicidality. We carried out this study to test the hypothesis that lower prolactin response to D-fenfluramine is more closely associated with suicidal behavior than with depression itself. A D-fenfluramine test was performed in a sample of 18 healthy control subjects and in 85 drug-free inpatients with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of major depressive episode (49 with a history of suicide attempt, 36 without). Depressed inpatients with a history of suicide attempt showed a significantly lower prolactin response to D-fenfluramine compared to depressed inpatients without such a history and compared to control subjects. Healthy control subjects and depressed inpatients without a history of suicide attempt showed comparable levels of prolactin after D-fenfluramine. Time elapsed since suicide attempt did not influence prolactin level (baseline or post-stimulation). Results show that in our depressed drug-free inpatient sample, prolactin response to D-fenfluramine seems to be a marker of suicidality, but not of depression itself. We suggest that it is a trait marker of suicidality. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An ingestion of an unknown quantity of Harmomed(R) (dothiepin and diazepam) capsules in a suicide is described. The authors report a new and fast method of analysing and determining the dothiepin concentration in postmortem specimens. Quantitation of dothiepin, and its metabolite desmethyldothiepin was performed by ethyl acetate extraction from alkalinized body fluids before GC-MS analysis. The analyses were performed without any complex sample clean-up steps and with little sample material. Postmortem concentrations of dothiepin, desmethyldothiepin, diazepam and desmethyldiazepam in body fluids are given. The proposed method is a rapid procedure for analysis in cases of deliberate poisoning with the antidepressant drug dothiepin. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Suicidal behaviours are highly complex, multi-determined phenomena. Despite this, historically research has tended to focus on bivariate associations between atheoretical demographic and/or psychiatric factors and suicidal behaviour. The aim of this study was to empirically test the Integrated Motivational Volitional model of suicidal behaviour using structural equation modelling. Healthy adults (N=1809) completed anonymous self-report surveys. The fit of the proposed model was good, and explained 79% of variance in defeat, 83% of variance in entrapment, 61% of variance in suicidal ideation, and 27% of variance in suicide attempts. All proposed paths were significant except for those between goal re-engagement and two factors of suicide resilience (Internal Protective and External Protective) and suicidal ideation; and impulsivity and discomfort intolerance and suicide attempts. These findings represent a preliminary step towards greater clarification of the mechanisms driving suicidal behaviour, and support the utility of basing future research on the Integrated Motivational-Volitional model of suicidal behaviour.

AB Suicide prevention in adolescents by early detection using screening tools to identify high suicidal risk is a priority. Our objective was to build a multidimensional scale namely "Suicidality of Adolescent Screening Scale (SASS)" to identify adolescents at risk of suicide. An initial pool of items was developed by using in-depth interview, focus groups and a literature review. Initially, 77 items were administered to 307 adolescents and analyzed using the exploratory Multidimensional Item Response Theory (MIRT) to remove unnecessary items. A subsequent exploratory factor analysis revealed 35 items that collected into 4 factors: Stressors, Pessimism, Suicidality and Depression. To confirm this structure, a new sample of 450 adolescents were collected and confirmatory MIRT factor analysis was performed. The resulting scale was shown to be both construct valid and able to discriminate well between adolescents that had, and hadn't previous attempted suicide. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

DE carbon monoxide; fires; suicide
ID SUICIDE; FIRES
AB Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning as a cause of death is well documented in industrialized countries. The objective of this study was to compare demographic data in deaths due to accidents (in fires) and suicides in the same population between 1988 and 1998. Furthermore, the potential effect of a community wide education effort regarding safety in the home was assessed. Postmortem reports were reviewed for all deaths examined at the Office of the Cuyahoga County Coroner in Cleveland, OH, USA. During the study period, there were 209 accidental deaths due to fires in the home (6.5% of all accidents in the home) and 182 CO deaths by suicide (9.8% of all suicides). Demographic characteristics of the two groups differed: while males represented the majority of cases in both groups (55% of accidents, 70% suicides), race specific death rates were higher for whites than blacks (18/100,000 white, 3/100,000 black) in suicides compared with 29/100,000 deaths for blacks and 11/100,000 for whites in accidental cases. Fire deaths were prevalent in the young (0-9 years) and old (> 60) whereas in the suicide group the age specific death rate was highest for those over 70 years. The majority of fire deaths occurred in the city of Cleveland but suicides were prevalent in the suburbs. More fire deaths occur-red in December than any other month whereas more suicides occurred in April. In 1992, there was a community wide effort to provide free smoke detectors to residents in Cleveland. In 1992, there were 4.2/100,000 fire deaths in the city. This decreased to 0.6/100,000 in 1996, increased to 1.2/100,000 in 1997 followed by a decrease to 0.8/100,000 in 1998. This suggested that the program may have aided in decreasing these types of deaths. Deaths due to fires in the suburbs were < 1/100,000 throughout the study period. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB In the discovery of human remains from water environments, manner of death may not be immediately obvious to medicolegal investigators due to several factors, including lack of associated material evidence, nondescript contextual environment, or possible poor preservation of remains due to delayed recovery. The determination of patterns of skeletal trauma in suicidal bridge jumpers assists investigators in determining whether the manner of death was suicide versus non-suicide. This study reports on the patterns of skeletal trauma sustained in individuals who jumped from one of four large bridges in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, and explores victim demographics, bridge height, position of the body upon impact, and velocity at impact on skeletal trauma for this suicide population. Data for all bridge jumpers were collected from coroner files spanning the years 1990-2011. Skeletal trauma is more heavily focused in the thorax/ribs (63%) and craniofacial (30%) regions. Fifty-six percent of jumpers sustained polytrauma. Comparative data on drowning victims, bodies recovered from boating/airplane accidents, and individuals who died by other suicidal means all show patterns of injury different than bridge jumpers.

AB A 44-year-old woman with a medical history of mental disorders and previous suicidal behaviour was found in a bathtub and pronounced death few minutes later despite of resuscitation attempts. After police investigation and on the basis of autopsy findings, the death was classified as suicide drowning. Retrospective examination of clinical data revealed, a prolonged rate-corrected QTinterval (QTc: 468 ms) 3 months before death. Post-mortem (PM) DNA analysis disclosed KCNH2(FIN) mutation for the long-QT syndrome (LQTS). The value of PM molecular screening for LQTS is emphasised, especially for victims of putative drowning.

AB This paper provides a mainly qualitative investigation of the role of methadone and methadone treatment in non-fatal illicit drug overdose. During 1997 and 1998, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 33 individuals in six hospital accident and emergency departments in two Scottish cities. The research identified four overdose situations related to methadone/methadone treatment. These were: (1) topping up a legitimate methadone prescription; (2) abusing another's methadone prescription; (3) preferring illegal drugs to prescribed methadone; and (4) failing to obtain prescribed methadone. The implications of these findings for methadone treatment policy and practice are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although previous studies in inmates, forensic and psychiatric samples suggest the relation between childhood trauma and suicide behavior as well as between childhood trauma and violent delinquency, the understanding of possible underlying mechanisms is still fragmentary. In a naturalistic study design, we tested if suicidal attempts and violent crimes are differently associated with adverse childhood experiences and levels of appetitive aggression in male forensic psychiatry inpatients. Adverse childhood experiences and appetitive aggression styles were collected by means of self-report measures, suicide attempts were taken from the medical history and violent crimes were appraised by official court records. The data were analyzed by the means of generalized linear models. Results revealed that appetitive aggression and adverse childhood experiences were significant predictors of suicide attempts, whereas violent crimes were associated solely with appetitive aggression. Suicide attempts and violent delinquency in forensic patients seem to be both positively associated with high levels of appetitive aggression, whereas their etiological pathways might differ with regard to adverse childhood experiences. Considering these interrelations to a greater extent might improve both diagnostics and treatment of forensic patients. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Deliberate self-harm is one of the most common reasons for emergency medical admission but remains a difficult and frustrating problem to manage, particularly in the longer term. Internationally the prevention of suicide has become a priority on the health agenda and measures aimed at the reduction of deliberate self-harm are considered central to that. There is a considerable body of epidemiological work highlighting changing trends in the at-risk population, yet so far this has been of limited value in developing effective management strategies. Psychological interventions developed in secondary care have shown some benefit but there is a need for such interventions to be evaluated in large populations, and given the prominent role of primary care in the aftercare of patients who deliberately self-harm this may be the most appropriate setting in which to determine their effectiveness.

AB The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) is the main source of serotonergic innervation of forebrain limbic structures disturbed in suicidal behaviour. We have evaluated the transcriptional activity of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in DRN neurons by AgNOR silver staining method. The cohort (containing 24 suicidal and 20 non-suicidal patients, and 28 controls) was previously analysed regarding diagnosis-related differences between schizophrenia and affective disorders. Significant decreases in both AgNOR and nuclear areas suggestive of attenuated rDNA activity were currently found in suicidal versus non-suicidal patients. This effect, which was more accentuated in affective disorders patients, was not explained by antidepressant and antipsychotic medication. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We examined an association between a history of hospital-treated depression and physical diseases in 1877 suicide victims from Northern Finland. Information on physical diseases and depression of victims was extracted from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Registers. Of suicide victims, 31% of female and 16% of male victims had a lifetime history of depression. When compared with victims without any lifetime hospital-treated physical illnesses, a history of depression was shown to associate with the diseases of the nervous, circulatory, respiratory, and musculoskeletal systems in the group of symptoms and signs, injuries and poisonings, and infectious diseases among male victims. Respectively, in female victims, an increased prevalence of depression was seen in endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases, diseases of the nervous, circulatory, genitourinary, skin and subcutaneous tissue, and musculoskeletal systems, and with injuries and poisonings, pregnancy-related problems and infectious diseases. This study is the first to evaluate comorbidity between physical illnesses and depression over the lifetime in Suicide victims; earlier studies reported Findings in living patients from epidemiological or clinical populations. Since depression can affect quality of life in severely ill patients, targeting depression in patients with chronic illness may assist in decreasing suicide rates. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Genome-wide gene expression analysis using DNA microarray has a great advantage to identify the genes or specific molecular cascades involved in mental diseases, including major depression and suicide. In the present study, we conducted DNA microarray analysis of major depression using postmortem prefrontal cortices. The gene expression patterns were compared between the controls and subjects with major depression. As a result, 99 genes were listed as the differentially expressed genes in major depression, of which several genes such as FGFR1, NCAM1, and CAMK2A were of interest. Gene ontology analysis suggested an overrepresentation of genes implicated in the downregulation or inhibition of cell proliferation. The present results may support the hypothesis that major depression is associated with impaired cellular proliferation and plasticity. Comparison between the controls and suicide victims with major depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia was also conducted in the present study. Two genes, CAD and ATP1A3, were differentially expressed in the three comparisons in the same direction. Interestingly, these two genes were also included in the differentially expressed 99 genes in major depression. It may be worth investigating the genes in relation to suicide or major depression.

AB The 2003-2011 period in Ireland can be viewed as a roller-coaster with years of high growth followed by years of deep recession. This paper reviews developments in income and health poverty in Ireland over that period using data from the survey of income and living conditions. Income and health poverty are examined both uni-dimensionally and bi-dimensionally using sequential stochastic dominance. Conventional poverty indices are also provided and the correlation between health and income poverty is also analysed Income poverty fell up to and including 2009, after which this trend is reversed. Health poverty shows less of a trend over the period though there is some evidence of a reduction in health inequality from 2006. Movements in bi-dimensional poverty are mostly driven by income poverty, but there is evidence of a reduction in the correlation between health and income poverty over the period.

AB National differences in the legislation on cause and manner of death investigation are reflected in a high autopsy rate in suicides in Finland and a low corresponding rate in Denmark. The consequences for mortality statistics of these different investigation practices on deaths classified as suicides in Denmark and Finland, respectively, are not known in detail.
   The aim of this article was to analyse autopsy rates in deaths classified as suicides, and to identify any differences in investigation practices in deaths with a comparable cause of death, but classified as unnatural deaths other than suicide.
   Data from the mortality registries were summarised for the years 2000, 2005 and 2010. Autopsy rates (total, forensic and medical) were analysed with regard to deaths classified as suicide, and they were compared for three age groups (1-50 years, 51-70 years and >= 71 years) and for causes of death. Deaths classified as suicide were compared with other unnatural classifications, and comparable causes of death were coded into six subgroups: poisonings, suffocations/strangulations, firearm discharges, drowning/submersions, explosions/flames and other/unspecified causes.
   The total autopsy rate for suicides was 99.8% in Finland and 13.2% in Denmark. Almost all of these autopsies were conducted as forensic autopsies. In the age group >= 71 years, Danish suicides outnumbered Finnish suicides (410 versus 283). The total autopsy rate was lower in the more senior age group in Denmark (19.5%, 9.9%, 5.6%), whereas it was consistently high in Finland (99.8%, 99.9%, 99.6%). Among Danish deaths due to poisonings, the autopsy rate was 89.5% when these were classified as accidents, but only 20.7% for cases classified as suicides. The number of deaths in the two Danish subgroups was comparable (550 versus 553).
   In Denmark, the decision regarding the need, if any, for a forensic autopsy is made during the external forensic examination of the body. Our study showed that the limited use of forensic autopsy to confirm the cause of death in deaths classified as suicides raises doubts about the accuracy of the Danish suicide mortality statistics. Our finding is emphasised by those cases in which the cause of death was registered as intentional self-poisoning. The high number of suicides among the elderly in Denmark is striking and begs further investigation and research. Overall, our data from Finland and Denmark reveal striking differences between the two countries and warrant further comparative studies on the subject in other countries.

TI What Are Reasons for the Large Gender Differences in the Lethality of
   Suicidal Acts? An Epidemiological Analysis in Four European Countries
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article

AB Background
   In Europe, men have lower rates of attempted suicide compared to women and at the same time a higher rate of completed suicides, indicating major gender differences in lethality of suicidal behaviour. The aim of this study was to analyse the extent to which these gender differences in lethality can be explained by factors such as choice of more lethal methods or lethality differences within the same suicide method or age. In addition, we explored gender differences in the intentionality of suicide attempts.
   Methods and Findings
   Methods. Design: Epidemiological study using a combination of self-report and official data. Setting: Mental health care services in four European countries: Germany, Hungary, Ireland, and Portugal. Data basis: Completed suicides derived from official statistics for each country (767 acts, 74.4% male) and assessed suicide attempts excluding habitual intentional self-harm (8,175 acts, 43.2% male).
   Main Outcome Measures and Data Analysis. We collected data on suicidal acts in eight regions of four European countries participating in the EU-funded "OSPI-Europe"-project (www.ospi-europe.com). We calculated method-specific lethality using the number of completed suicides per method * 100 /(number of completed suicides per method + number of attempted suicides per method). We tested gender differences in the distribution of suicidal acts for significance by using the chi(2)-test for two-by-two tables. We assessed the effect sizes with phi coefficients (phi). We identified predictors of lethality with a binary logistic regression analysis. Poisson regression analysis examined the contribution of choice of methods and method-specific lethality to gender differences in the lethality of suicidal acts.
   Findings Main Results
   Suicidal acts (fatal and non-fatal) were 3.4 times more lethal in men than in women (lethality 13.91% (regarding 4106 suicidal acts) versus 4.05% (regarding 4836 suicidal acts)), the difference being significant for the methods hanging, jumping, moving objects, sharp objects and poisoning by substances other than drugs. Median age at time of suicidal behaviour (35-44 years) did not differ between males and females. The overall gender difference in lethality of suicidal behaviour was explained by males choosing more lethal suicide methods (odds ratio (OR) = 2.03; 95% CI = 1.65 to 2.50; p < 0.000001) and additionally, but to a lesser degree, by a higher lethality of suicidal acts for males even within the same method (OR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.32 to 2.02; p = 0.000005). Results of a regression analysis revealed neither age nor country differences were significant predictors for gender differences in the lethality of suicidal acts. The proportion of serious suicide attempts among all non-fatal suicidal acts with known intentionality (NFSAi) was significantly higher in men (57.1%; 1,207 of 2,115 NFSAi) than in women (48.6%; 1,508 of 3,100 NFSAi) (chi(2) = 35.74; p < 0.000001).
   Main limitations of the study
   Due to restrictive data security regulations to ensure anonymity in Ireland, specific ages could not be provided because of the relatively low absolute numbers of suicide in the Irish intervention and control region. Therefore, analyses of the interaction between gender and age could only be conducted for three of the four countries. Attempted suicides were assessed for patients presenting to emergency departments or treated in hospitals. An unknown rate of attempted suicides remained undetected. This may have caused an overestimation of the lethality of certain methods. Moreover, the detection of attempted suicides and the registration of completed suicides might have differed across the four countries. Some suicides might be hidden and misclassified as undetermined deaths.
   Conclusions
   Men more often used highly lethal methods in suicidal behaviour, but there was also a higher method-specific lethality which together explained the large gender differences in the lethality of suicidal acts. Gender differences in the lethality of suicidal acts were fairly consistent across all four European countries examined. Males and females did not differ in age at time of suicidal behaviour. Suicide attempts by males were rated as being more serious independent of the method used, with the exceptions of attempted hanging, suggesting gender differences in intentionality associated with suicidal behaviour. These findings contribute to understanding of the spectrum of reasons for gender differences in the lethality of suicidal behaviour and should inform the development of gender specific strategies for suicide prevention.

AB Childhood adversities are strong predictors of psychopathology and suicidality. However, specific adversities are associated with different outcomes, with cross-national variations reported. The current study examined rates of adversities reported in Northern Ireland (NI), and associations between adverse childhood experiences and psychopathology and suicidal behaviour were explored. Data was obtained from the Northern Ireland Study of Health and Stress (NISHS), conducted as part of the World Mental Health (WMH) survey initiative (2004-2008); response rate 68.4% (n = 1,986). The on-line survey used, the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) to examine psychopathology and associated risk factors in the NI population. Prevalence rates of retrospectively reported childhood adversities were calculated, with gender and age variations explored. Females were more likely to experience sexual abuse. Individuals who grew up during the worst years of the civil conflict in NI experienced elevated levels of childhood adversities. Participants who endured childhood adversities were more likely to have mental health problems but variations in risk factors were found for different disorders. Parental mental illness was associated with all disorders however, with ORs ranging from 2.20 for mood disorders to 4.07 for anxiety disorders. Population attributable fractions (PAF) estimated the reduction in psychopathology and suicidal behaviour in the population if exposure to adverse childhood events had not occurred. The highest PAF values were revealed for parental mental illness and sexual abuse. The findings indicate that a substantial proportion of psychopathology and suicide risk in NI are attributable to childhood adversities, providing support for early intervention and prevention initiatives.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is the deliberate, self-inflicted destruction of body tissue without suicidal intent and an important clinical phenomenon. Rates of NSSI appear to be disproportionately high in adolescents and young adults, and is a risk factor for suicidal ideation and behavior. The present study reports the psychometric properties of the Impulse, Self-harm and Suicide Ideation Questionnaire for Adolescents (ISSIQ-A), a measure designed to comprehensively assess the impulsivity, NSSI behaviors and suicide ideation. An additional module of this questionnaire assesses the functions of NSSI. Results of Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) of the scale on 1722 youths showed items' suitability and confirmed a model of four different dimensions (Impulse, Self-harm, Risk-behavior and Suicide ideation) with good fit and validity. Further analysis showed that youth's engagement in self-harm may exert two different functions: to create or alleviate emotional states, and to influence social relationships. Our findings contribute to research and assessment on non-suicidal self-injury, suggesting that the ISSIQ-A is a valid and reliable measure to assess impulse, self-harm and suicidal thoughts, in adolescence.

AB This study assessed the relationship between perceived family functioning and two indicators of suicidality in an adolescent sample. A total of 103 adolescents psychiatrically hospitalized for suicidal ideation and/or behavior completed a battery of self-report questionnaires assessing family functioning, negative affectivity, suicidal ideation in the past week assessed by Beck's Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS; Beck et al., 1979), and past suicide attempts. Participants' primary caregivers also completed a questionnaire on family functioning. A paired samples t-test evaluated overall discrepancy between adolescent- and caregiver-reported family functioning. Linear and logistic regression models were used to evaluate the simple associations between perceived family functioning and suicidal indicators (BSS and previous attempt status), as well as the associations between perceived family functioning and suicidal indicators after controlling for negative affect. Results indicated that adolescents' ratings of family functioning were significantly worse than caregivers' ratings, and positively associated with BSS scores and a history of suicide attempt. When negative affect was controlled for, adolescent-reported family functioning was significantly associated with BSS, but only trended toward significance with attempt status. Findings suggest that adolescents' perceptions of family functioning may be a key contributing factor to suicidal ideation in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

DE firearms wounds; forensic pathology; Southern Italy
ID SUICIDE
AB Fatal gunshot injuries are routinely encountered by forensic pathologists practicing in Southern Italy. Bari, the capital city of the Italian region known as Apulia, is a leader with regard to the number of firearm deaths in Italy. This is mainly attributable to local organized crime groups which control a variety of illicit activities. This retrospective study analyzes autopsy data related to fatal firearm wounds, handled by the Institute of Legal Medicine [University of Bari], between 1988 and 2003. A total of 717 cases were selected and classified as follows: firearm homicides (634); suicides (82); and accidental death (1).
   A significant number of variables have been reviewed such as: month in which the violent event took place; the victims' nationalities; gender and age of victims; site and number of entrance wounds; weapon type used; and manner of death (i.e. homicide; suicide; accidental). Analysis has revealed a homicide versus suicide ratio of almost 8: 1. Victims were mostly male with a lower mean age than in other similar studies. Homicides with multiple gunshot wounds were more common than ones with single entrance wounds. For example, in one case, 30 entrance wounds were identified in the murder of a gang boss. Four suicides with two entrance gunshot wounds were identified. Handguns were the most frequently used weapon in all groups (i.e. homicide, suicide, and accidental), with 7.65 mm and 9 mm being the most common calibres.
   This study revealed a very low incidence of suicide among females. Mental and other types of illness, as well as financial stress were the apparent motives which prompted most of the suicide victims. The homicide cases described were most often related to continual, ongoing fights among local criminal gangs (75%). (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB An intrinsic association between suicidal ideation and sleep disorders in patients with depressive disorder has been observed in recent studies. This study was conducted in order to examine the relationship between suicidal ideation and sleep disorders, such as insomnia and excessive sleepiness, in outpatients with major depressive disorder. Seventy patients with diagnoses of major depressive disorder were interviewed and assessed with the Sleep Habits Questionnaire and the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI). Data analyses were performed through descriptive analysis, Students t-test, Chi-square test and logistic regression model, with a statistical significance of 5%. In this study, depressed patients had high SSI scores (6.12 +/- 2.67), particularly for active suicidal ideation (1.61 +/- 0.39) and specific plans for suicide components (1.51 +/- 0.40). Depressed patients with insomnia had significantly higher SSI scores (7.39 +/- 2.84), in relation to patients with excessive sleepiness (3.68 +/- 1.73). Furthermore it was observed that insomniac patients had significantly higher scores on the following components: active suicide ideation, specific plans for suicide and previous suicide attempts. The results of multivariate analysis showed that only insomnia had a significant association with suicidal ideation. Thus, sleep disturbances, particularly insomnia, should be considered in the assessment of suicidal risk in outpatients with depressive disorder. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Risk factors for suicide and fatal accidental intoxication are extensively studied, while risk factors for intoxications/injuries of undetermined intent are less well known. The latter have shown an overlap with suicides, but also with fatal accidental intoxications. The objective was to analyze potential differences and similarities in the patterns of risk factors for accidental intoxications, injuries/intoxications with undetermined intent, and suicides, respectively.
   Methods: A follow-up register study was conducted, using data from ASI interviews with clients in the criminal justice system in Sweden (n=6744), followed in the National Causes of Death Register. A set of risk factors from the ASI interview were tested in bivariate analysis with the respective cause of death, yielding significant risk factors further analyzed in three Cox regression models.
   Results: In Cox regression analyses, death from fatal accidental intoxication was associated with male gender (HR 4.09), use of heroin (HR 2.86), and use of cannabis (HR 1.94), and death from intoxication/injury of undetermined intent was associated with use of heroin (HR 3.48), binge drinking of alcohol (HR 2.46) and previous psychiatric hospitalization (HR 2.41), while negatively associated with depression (HR 0.33). Death from suicide was associated with previous suicide attempts (HR 2.78) and use of sedatives (HR 2.17).
   Conclusions: In this population of criminal justice clients with reported substance use problems, fatal injuries/intoxications with undetermined intent - like fatal accidental intoxications - appear to be associated with substance use variables, and cannot readily be assumed to represent the same background factors as suicide.

AB Background: Suicide is a significant public health issue with almost one million people dying by suicide each year worldwide. Deliberate self harm (DSH) is the single most important risk factor for suicide yet few countries have reliable data on DSH. We developed a national DSH registry in the Republic of Ireland to establish the incidence of hospital-treated DSH at national level and the spectrum and pattern of presentations with DSH and repetition.
   Methods and Findings: Between 2003 and 2009, the Irish National Registry of Deliberate Self Harm collected data on DSH presentations to all 40 hospital emergency departments in the country. Data were collected by trained data registration officers using standard methods of case ascertainment and definition. The Registry recorded 75,119 DSH presentations involving 48,206 individuals. The total incidence rate fell from 209 (95% CI: 205-213) per 100,000 in 2003 to 184 (95% CI: 180-189) per 100,000 in 2006 and increased again to 209 (95% CI: 204-213) per 100,000 in 2009. The most notable annual changes were successive 10% increases in the male rate in 2008 and 2009. There was significant variation by age with peak rates in women in the 15-19 year age group (620 (95% CI: 605-636) per 100,000), and in men in the 20-24 age group (427 (95% CI: 416-439) per 100,000). Repetition rates varied significantly by age, method of self harm and number of previous episodes.
   Conclusions: Population-based data on hospital-treated DSH represent an important index of the burden of mental illness and suicide risk in the community. The increased DSH rate in Irish men in 2008 and 2009 coincided with the advent of the economic recession in Ireland. The findings underline the need for developing effective interventions to reduce DSH repetition rates as a key priority for health systems.

AB Background: Stressful life events (SLEs) play a key role in suicidal behavior among adults with alcohol use disorders (AUD), yet there are meager data on the severity of SLEs preceding suicidal behavior or the timing of such events.
   Method: Patients in residential substance use treatment who made a recent suicide attempt (cases, n=101) and non-suicidal controls matched for site (n=101) were recruited. SLEs that occurred within 30 days of the attempt and on the day of the attempt in cases were compared to SLEs that occurred in the corresponding periods in controls. SLEs were categorized by type (interpersonal, non-interpersonal) and severity (major, minor) and were dated to assess timing. Degree of planning of suicide attempts was also assessed.
   Results: Major interpersonal SLEs conferred risk for a suicide attempt, odds ratio (95% CI) = 5.50 (1.73, 17.53), p=0.005. Cases were also more likely to experience an SLE on the day of the attempt than on the corresponding day in controls, OR (95% CI)=6.05 (1.31, 28.02), p=0.021. However, cases that made an attempt on the day of a SLE did not make lower planned suicide attempts compared to other cases, suggesting that suicide attempts that are immediately preceded by SLEs cannot be assumed to be unplanned.
   Conclusions: Results suggest the central importance of major interpersonal SLEs in risk among adults with AUD, a novel finding, and documents that SLEs may lead to suicide attempts within a short window of time (i.e., same day), a daunting challenge to prevention efforts.

AB We aimed to examine our autopsy data in order to analyze epidemiological and injury characteristics in criminal and suicidal immolation cases.
   During the 18-year period, we recorded 29 suicides and three homicides due to fire burns. In suicide group there was a majority of men (gender ratio: 3.1:1) and the mean age was 42.8 years (range 20-72). In the homicide group, the victims were two men and one woman. Their mean age was 44 years (range 39-54). The location of self-immolation was mostly the deceased's car or home and most suicides happened during the evening and the night. The main frequent motives for self-immolation were affective problems, financial problems, or both. One or several flammable fluids, usually petrol or alcohol, were used in 18 suicide cases and in one homicide. The median total body surface area burnt was 79.3% (range 10-100%) in self inflicted group and 83.3% (range 50-100%) in assault group. The sole of the feet was spared in all suicide cases. Blood CO-Hb level was measured in 27 self-immolation cases. It ranged between 1% and 10% in 11 cases and was superior to 10% in the remaining. Twenty-three self-immolation victims and one homicide victim had soot in their respiratory tracts. Soot in the respiratory tracts was associated to soot in the digestive tracts in six cases. Alcohol and drugs intoxication played a minor role. In six cases, the victim associated self incineration with one or more other methods of suicide (complex suicides). The presence of associated trauma raises the problem of vitality and interpretation of the lesions in determining the manner of death. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this prospective study was to determine if sleep disturbances and nightmares are associated with increased risk of repeat suicide attempt. Patients (n = 165) aged 18-68 years who were admitted to medical or psychiatric wards after a suicide attempt completed an initial interview; 98 of these took part in a 2-month follow-up interview. The Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) and two self-report instruments, the Uppsala Sleep Inventory and the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS) Self-Rating Scale for Affective Syndromes, were administered both at baseline and follow-up. Data concerning repeat suicide attempts within 2 years were obtained from hospital records. Analyses were performed using Student's t-test, chi-square test, and logistic regression. In total 42 patients (26%) made at least one repeat suicide attempt within 2 years. While neither difficulties initiating/maintaining sleep nor early morning awakening at baseline predicted repeat attempt, having frequent nightmares did (OR = 3.15). The risk was further heightened when nightmares were reported at both baseline and 2-month follow-up (OR = 5.20). These associations remained after adjusting for sex. axis-I DSM-IV diagnoses, and self-reported depression and anxiety symptom intensity. Our findings suggest that nightmares might constitute a market for increased risk of suicidal behavior. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study provides the first systematic research of homicide-suicide (HS) in a Chinese society. Data were drawn from the HK Homicide Monitoring Data-base computer file derived from investigation and death reports held by the HK Police Force and the Coroner's Court. During the 10-year study period, 56 events involving 133 deaths were identified. The majority of offenders were males (75%) and most victims were female (64%). The mean age of offenders and victims were 41.9 and 32.3 years, respectively. Spouses and lovers comprised the majority of victims (46.4%) followed by child victims (36%). Most HS events were motivated by separation or termination of marital or sexual relations (39%), economic reasons (25%) and other domestic disputes (20%). The most frequent modes of killing were strangulation/suffocation (26%), stabbing/chopping (24%), followed by gassing/poisoning (14%) and falling from a height (14%). The commonest method of suicide was falling from a height (48%). It was followed by gassing/poisoning (22%) and strangulation/suffocation (13%). Depression (18.3%) was found to be the commonest mental disorder. Most offenders were from low-socio-economic background. Two-third were unemployed and 76.6% had 9 or less years of education. HS in HK were distinguished from those reported in the western literature in respect to the high relevance of economic factors, the absence of mercy killing between old couples, a higher percentage of pedicide-suicides and the infrequent use of firearms.

AB Low plasma total testosterone (T) levels may influence the sense of well-being and produce depressive symptomatology, increasing the risk of suicide. In a previous study, we reported reduced serum T levels in male psychiatric patients after a suicide attempt. The reduction was more pronounced in subjects who used violent attempt methods, and we discussed the possible influence of stress of hospitalization, serious medical condition and treatment In order to minimize the influence of such factors, we compared in this study the levels of plasma sex hormones of 15 psychiatric patients (10 suffering from schizophrenia and 5 from depression) who had attempted suicide by jumping with those of a group of 18 male subjects who were hospitalized after accidentally falling from a high height. Compared with a healthy control group of 40 males, both accident and attempt groups had lower T levels. The attempt group showed a trend toward lower T levels compared with levels in the accident group. In the accident group, luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were elevated compared with levels in healthy controls, indicating a normal function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. This was not the case for the attempt group, where low T levels were not accompanied by increases in LH. Cortisol and prolactin were similarly elevated in both patient groups, but were not related to the low T levels. The results indicate that male psychiatric patients who attempt suicide by violent methods may have low total plasma T levels, possibly due to a dysfunction of the HPG axis at the hypothalamic-pituitary level. Monitoring HPG axis function in future studies could prove to be a predictor of suicide at least for male psychiatric attempters, and could lead to preventive strategies.

AB Attention is typically impaired in depression and may play a role in risk for suicidal behavior. In this study, 66 non-patients, 83 depressed subjects with no past history of suicide attempt, 53 depressed subjects with one or more low lethality suicide attempts, and 42 depressed subjects with at least one high lethality attempt were compared on two computerized measures of attention, a continuous performance test (CPT) and a Stroop task. All subjects were medication free at the time of assessment. Attention was impaired in all depressed subjects but worse in those with a past history of suicidal behavior. CPT performance did not differ among the groups, but Stroop interference was significantly poorer in all depressed subjects relative to non-patients, and poorer still in high lethality suicide attempters relative to all other groups. Interference scores correlated modestly with subjective depression, functional level, suicide ideation, number of past suicide attempts, and lethality of past attempts. Depression-related impairments of attention, especially susceptibility to interference, are accentuated in those with a past history of suicidal behavior. Fundamental deficits in attentional control may play a role in risk for suicidal behavior, and may contribute to a variety of cognitive deficits in suicidal patients. Brain regions subserving attentional control, which overlap considerably with regions implicated in affective disorders, may be a useful target for studies seeking to characterize neuropsychological factors associated with suicidal behavior.

AB Background: Prevalence estimates of suicidal behaviour in the college student population are consistently higher than rates for the general adult population. This study examines mental health disorders and childhood adversities as predictors of self-harm and suicidal behaviours.
   Methods: The Ulster University Student Wellbeing study commenced in September 2015 as part of the WHO World Mental Health Surveys International College Student Project. In Northern Ireland (NI) 739 students participated (462 female, 274 male and 3 other specified), with the WMH-CIDI used to examine psychopathology. Mean age was 21 years old.
   Results: Thirty-one percent endorsed suicidal ideation (24.3% of males and 36.9% of females) with almost 1 in 5 students having made a plan for suicide in the 12 months prior to the survey. Latent profile analysis revealed three profiles of childhood adversity (high, moderate, and low risk). Logistic regression analyses showed that there was an increased likelihood of all queried self-harm and suicidal behaviours in those who were not heterosexual orientation, and among those with either moderate or high levels of childhood adversities. Probable alcohol dependence was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of suicide attempt or self-harm with either a suicide plan or a suicide attempt.
   Limitations: Influences of self-report measures and the generalizability of the sample are discussed.
   Conclusions: Policies and strategies for early identification of those with mental illnesses or adversities that increase their risk, should be prioritised. It would also be useful to identify individuals at risk in secondary schools to allow for additional support to be offered to them during the key time of transitioning into higher education.

Criminal deaths (31 %) represented the second cause of death after accidents (52%), and before suicide (16%). Criminal burning seemed mainly to be means of covering up homicide, whereas criminal immolation was rarer. The particular characteristics of each of these situations have been highlighted (tying or poisoning in criminal immolation). We deemed it essential to make X-rays, to look for injuries due to trauma and to carry out systematic toxicological analyses in a victim of burning. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB An association between low levels of serum cholesterol and violent or suicidal behaviour has frequently been reported. However the role of serum cholesterol in the cycle of violence (Widom, 1989) has not been studied. The aim of this study was to investigate association between exposure to violence during childhood and used adult violence in suicide attempters with low and high serum cholesterol levels. 81 suicide attempters were assessed with the Karolinska Interpersonal Violence Scale (KIVS) measuring exposure to violence and expressed violent behaviour in childhood (between 6 and 14 years of age) and during adult life (15 years or older). We used median split to dichotomise groups below and above median serum cholesterol. In patients with serum cholesterol below median, the correlation between exposure to violence as a child and used adult violence was significant (rho=0.52, p=0.002), while in patients with serum cholesterol above median, the correlation between exposure to violence as a child and expressed violent behaviour as an adult was not significant (rho=0.25, p=0.2). Comorbid substance abuse predicted violent behaviour as an adult only in patients with serum cholesterol above median. Serum cholesterol may modify the effect of the "Cycle of Violence".

AB Prominent theoretical models and existing data implicate interpersonal factors in the development and maintenance of suicidal behavior and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). However, no known study has yet used computerized behavioral tasks to objectively assess responses to interpersonal conflict/collaboration among teens engaged in NSSI or having made a suicide attempt. The current study, therefore, compared interpersonal functioning indexed by the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) task among three mutually exclusive groups, adolescents (ages 13-17): engaged in NSSI only without history of a suicide attempt (n=26); who made a suicide attempt without history of NSSI (n=26); and typically developing controls (n=26). Participants also completed the Interpersonal Sensitivity Measure to assess their general sensitivity to/awareness of others' behaviors and feelings. No significant between-group differences were found in PD task performance; however, compared to typically developing control participants and those who had made a suicide attempt, the NSSI group reported significantly more stress during the task. Additionally, NSSI participants rated themselves as more interpersonally sensitive compared to both attempters and typically developing controls. Given the lack of knowledge about whether these groups either differentially activate the same circuitry during stressful interpersonal interactions or instead rely on alternative, compensatory circuits, future work using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging is warranted.

AB Background: A sense of disconnection for people who are suicidal seems to be a key construct of previous literature. Therapists' ways of encountering and understanding people who are suicidal have not been previously researched in depth using qualitative methodologies. Aims: The current study aims to develop a theoretical framework for the role played by connectedness in relation to suicide based on the perspectives of psychotherapists working in the field of suicide intervention. Method: Psychotherapists (N=12) from a suicide intervention service in Ireland were interviewed in relation to connectedness and suicide. The interviews were analysed using Constructivist Grounded Theory. A tentative theoretical model for connectedness in relation to suicide was developed. Results: Therapists view self-disconnect as at the core of suicidality and note that toxic relationships also play a critical role. Therapeutic connection can present as a life-saving paradox for people who are suicidal. Risk of death and therapeutic endeavour may present as challenging dynamics for working with people who are suicidal. Some discussion points include the worth of self-compassion development for people who are suicidal, the rephrasing of psychotherapy when trying to save someone's life and the emphasis on relationship skills for all healthcare professionals who encounter people who are suicidal.Clinical or methodological significance of this article: This article is one of the first in which therapists are interviewed about their understandings of suicide and the processes of suicide in the therapeutic space. It offers novel insights about how people who are suicidal present in therapy and what may be contributing to this presentation. The research also gives insights on the struggles for therapists working with people who are suicidal and who may be ambiguous about the prospect of therapy and connecting. The study also offers important direction for future studies in relation to what requires further discussion and exploration regarding engaging in therapy with people who are suicidal. In addition, the current study can offer previously unexplored insights regarding suicide and therapy that may have the potential to assist in future intervention for people who are risk of killing themselves.

AB Numerous death cases due to suffocation in a toxic or oxygen deficient gas atmosphere have been described in the literature, but unfortunately especially cases involving inert gases like helium are often presented without detailed toxicological findings. Observations on two suicides are reported, one by helium and the other by argon inhalation.
   During autopsies gas samples from the lungs were collected directly into headspace vials by a procedure ensuring minimal loss and dilution. Qualitative gas analyses were performed using headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-GC/MS). For carrier gas the commonly used helium was replaced by hydrogen. Qualitative positive results were obtained in the argon case, but the case involving helium revealed negative findings.
   The use of HS-GC/MS enables in principle to detect inert gases like argon or helium. However, a number of factors may later influence the results as, e. g. a longer period of time between death and sampling or pre-analytical artefacts during sampling of such highly volatile substances. In absence of analytical data supporting helium exposure, the causes of death in the actual cases were found to be asphyxia and in both cases the manner was suicide. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Some studies have suggested that noradrenergic activity may decrease with age in depressed patients. Pupil size is regulated by a balance between norepinephrine and acetylcholine. The present study compares pupil size in 10 unmedicated patients with unipolar depression (296.3) and in 16 normal controls. Pupil size after dilation with tropicamide, a cholinergic antagonist, was inversely related to age in the patients (r = -0.87), but did not diminish with age in controls. The results suggest that pupil size may provide an index of diminished noradrenergic function with age in patients with major depression. (C) Published by Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB Suicidal vulnerability has been related to impaired value-based decision-making and increased sensitivity to social threat, mediated by the prefrontal cortex. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we aimed at replicating these previous findings by measuring brain activation during the Iowa Gambling Task and an emotional faces viewing task. Participants comprised 15 euthymic suicide attempters (history of depression and suicidal behavior) who were compared with 23 euthymic patient controls (history of depression without suicidal history) and 35 healthy controls. The following five model-based regions of interest were investigated: the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial (MPFC) and dorsal prefrontal cortex (DPFC). Suicide attempters relative to patient controls showed (1) increased response to angry vs. neutral faces in the left OFC and the VLPFC, as previously reported; (2) increased response to wins vs. losses in the right OFC, DPFC and ACC; (3) decreased response to risky vs. safe choices in the left DPFC; and (4) decreased response to sad vs. neutral faces in the right ACC. This study links impaired valuation processing (here for signals of social threat, sadness and reward) to prefrontal cortex dysfunction in suicide attempters. These long-term deficits may underlie the impaired decision-making and social difficulties found in suicide attempters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide attempters often perform poorly on tasks linked to ventral prefrontal cortical (VPFC) function. Object Alternation (OA) - a VPFC probe - has not been used in these studies. In this study, currently depressed medication-free past suicide attempters whose most severe attempt was of high (n=31) vs. low (n=64) lethality, 114 medication-free depressed non-attempters, and 86 non-patients completed a computerized OA task. Participants also completed comparison tasks assessing the discriminant validity of OA (Wisconsin Card Sort), its concurrent validity relative to tasks associated with past attempt status (computerized Stroop task, Buschke Selective Reminding Test), and its construct validity as a VPFC measure (Go-No Go and Iowa Gambling Task). Against expectations, high lethality suicide attempters the majority of whom used non-violent methods in their attempts with some planning - outperformed other depressed groups on OA, with no group differences observed on Wisconsin Card Sort. Despite intact performance on OA, past attempters exhibited deficits on the Stroop and Buschke. OA performance was associated with performance on Go-No Go and Iowa Gambling, confirming that OA measures a similar construct. VPFC dysfunction may not be a characteristic of all suicide attempters, especially those who make more carefully planned, non-violent - though potentially lethal - attempts.

AB Suicide, PTSD, and obesity co-occur at high rates among returning veterans, yet limited research exists regarding the relationship among these variables. Self-report and diagnostic interview data from a longitudinal study of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans (N=130) enrolled in VA healthcare examined these inter-relations. As hypothesized, body mass index (BMI) significantly moderated the association between PTSD and suicidal ideation such that the association between PTSD and suicidal ideation was strongest among individuals with a high BMI. Programs that focus on health promotion, trauma treatment, and weight management should continue to monitor suicide risk. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB The interpersonal psychological theory of suicidal behavior (IPTS) offers a potential means to explain suicide in physicians. The IPTS posits three necessary and sufficient precursors to death by suicide: thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and acquired capability. The present study sought to examine whether provocative work experiences unique to physicians (e.g., placing sutures, withdrawing life support) would predict levels of acquired capability, while controlling for gender and painful and provocative experiences outside the work environment. Data were obtained from 376 of 7723 recruited physicians. Study measures included the Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale, the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire, the Painful and Provocative Events Scale, and the Life Events Scale Medical Doctors Version. Painful and provocative events outside of work predicted acquired capability (beta = 0.23, t = 3.82, p < 0.001, f(2) = 0.09) as did provocative work experiences (beta = 0.12, t = 2.05, p < 0.05, f(2) = 0.07). This represents the first study assessing the potential impact of unique work experiences on suicidality in physicians. Limitations include over-representation of Caucasian participants, limited representation from various specialties of medicine, and lack of information regarding individual differences.

AB Suicide is a major contributor to the morbidity and mortality of schizophrenia, accounting for approximately 10% of deaths in these patients. Genetic factors have been reported to modulate the risk for suicide, although the precise mechanism and magnitude of the genetic contribution are unknown. Further, suicide attempters present abnormalities in the serotonergic system. We evaluated whether genetic variants in the serotonin receptors HTR3A (rs897692, rs1150226, rs1176724, rs2276302, rs3737457, rs897687 and rs1176713) and HTR3B (rs3758987, rs10502180, rs11606194, rs17116121 rs1176744, rs17116138, rs2276307, rs3782025 and rs1176761) were susceptibility components for suicidal behavior in 154 Caucasians schizophrenia subjects (20.1% of suicide attempters). In a second step, we compared haplotype and gene-gene interaction approaches because both genes are located in the chromosome 11q23 approximately 28 Kbp apart. We did not observe allelic or genotypic associations. Six haplotypes were nominally significant associated with suicide. Gene-gene interaction using Helix Tree software showed two nominally significant interactions reproduced by haplotype association. Likewise, haplotypes composed by the markers included in the best multidimensional reduction three-locus model were nominally significant. Our results suggest that HTR3A and HTR3B polymorphisms may not play a major role in the susceptibility for suicidal behavior in schizophrenia subjects. Moreover, gene-gene interaction and haplotype association may have consistent results for genes located in the same chromosome. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In individuals with schizophrenia, the prevalence of cigarette smoking is significantly higher than that of the general population: this appears to be associated with specific psychosocial and clinical characteristics. Indeed, some evidence suggests an increased risk of suicide among smokers with schizophrenia. The purpose of this study was to examine the characteristics of smokers with schizophrenia in Taiwan. In this cross-sectional study, 95 outpatients with DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia were recruited and independently interviewed for nicotine dependency with tobacco use. The effects of cigarette smoking on the various measures, especially suicidality, were investigated. The results revealed that smokers with schizophrenia had higher rates of hospitalization, lifetime suicide attempts, antipsychotic treatment side effects, psychopathology, impulsivity, depression, anxiety, and suicidal risk than non-smokers with schizophrenia. When separate analyses were conducted in male and female patients, depressive symptoms were significant predictors of suicidality among males, whereas heavy smoking, anxious symptoms, and hopelessness were significant predictors among females. From this study, we may gain insights into the role of cigarette smoking in patients of schizophrenia in Taiwan. Furthermore, cigarette smoking may influence aspects of suicidality in schizophrenia.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a prevalent behavioral problem, yet many fundamental aspects of NSSI remain unknown. This case series study reports on the diagnostic correlates of adolescents with a recent history of NSSI and examines the relation between NSSI and suicide attempts. Data are from clinical interviews with 89 adolescents admitted to an adolescent psychiatric inpatient unit who engaged in NSSI in the previous 12 months. Results revealed that 87.6% of adolescents engaging in NSSI met criteria for a DSM-IVAxis I diagnosis (M=3.0, S.D.=2.2, range=0 to 8 diagnoses), including externalizing (62.9%), internalizing (51.7%). and substance use (59.6%) disorders. Most adolescents assessed also met criteria for an Axis II personality disorder (67.3%). Overall, 70% of adolescents engaging in NSSI reported a lifetime suicide attempt and 55% reported multiple attempts. Characteristics of NSSI associated with making suicide attempts included a longer history of NSSI, use of a greater number of methods, and absence of physical pain during NSSI. These findings demonstrate the diagnostic heterogeneity of adolescents engaging in NSSI, highlight the significant overlap between NSSI and suicide attempts, and provide a point of departure for future research aimed at elucidating the relations between non-suicidal and suicidal self-injury.

AB The neurobiology of suicidality in schizophrenia is largely unknown. We therefore assessed gray and white matter volumes associated with past suicidality and current self-aggression in schizophrenia. Fifty-five outpatients with schizophrenia (n=55) and healthy controls (n=55), matched for age, gender and handedness, were recruited. Ten patients had a life-time history of one or more suicide attempts. Current self-aggression was assessed using the Modified Overt Aggression Scale. High resolution structural magnetic resonance images were analyzed by voxel-based morphometry. We found significantly larger inferior frontal white matter volumes bilaterally in patients with a previous suicide attempt as compared with those patients without a history of suicidality. No other significant white or gray matter volume differences were observed. White matter volume in these regions did not differ between healthy controls and those patients without a previous suicide attempt. Furthermore, among patients, the level of current self-aggression showed a significant positive correlation with white matter volume in the same regions. Inferior frontal white matter alterations in fronto-temporo-limbic circuits may be associated with suicidality and self-aggression in schizophrenia. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Background: There have been only a few reports illustrating the moderate effectiveness of suicide-preventive interventions in reducing suicidal behavior, and, in most of those studies, the target populations were primarily adults, whereas few focused on adolescents. Essentially, there have been no randomized controlled studies comparing the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and cultural adaptability of suicide-prevention strategies in schools. There is also a lack of information on whether suicide-preventive interventions can, in addition to preventing suicide, reduce risk behaviors and promote healthier ones as well as improve young people's mental health.
   The aim of the SEYLE project, which is funded by the European Union under the Seventh Framework Health Program, is to address these issues by collecting baseline and follow-up data on health and well-being among European adolescents and compiling an epidemiological database; testing, in a randomized controlled trial, three different suicide-preventive interventions; evaluating the outcome of each intervention in comparison with a control group from a multidisciplinary perspective; as well as recommending culturally adjusted models for promoting mental health and preventing suicidal behaviors.
   Methods and design: The study comprises 11,000 adolescents emitted from randomized schools in 11 European countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden serving as the scientific coordinating center. Each country performs three active interventions and one minimal intervention as a control group. The active interventions include gatekeeper training (QPR), awareness training on mental health promotion for adolescents, and screening for at-risk adolescents by health professionals. Structured questionnaires are utilized at baseline, 3- and 12-month follow-ups in order to assess changes.
   Discussion: Although it has been reported that suicide-preventive interventions can be effective in decreasing suicidal behavior, well-documented and randomized studies are lacking. The effects of such interventions in terms of combating unhealthy lifestyles in young people, which often characterize suicidal individuals, have never been reported. We know that unhealthy and risk-taking behaviors are detrimental to individuals' current and future health. It is, therefore, crucial to test well-designed, longitudinal mental health-promoting and suicide-preventive interventions by evaluating the implications of such activities for reducing unhealthy and risk behaviors while concurrently promoting healthy ones.

AB Neuropsychological dysfunction is associated with risk for suicidal behavior, but it is unknown if antidepressant medication treatment is effective in reducing this dysfunction, or if specific medications might be more beneficial. A comprehensive neuropsychological battery was administered at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment within a randomized, double-blind clinical trial comparing paroxetine and bupropion in patients with DSM-IV Major Depressive Disorder and either past suicide attempt or current suicidal thoughts. Change in neurocognitive performance was compared between assessments and between medication groups. Treatment effects on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Scale for Suicide Ideation were compared with neurocognitive improvement. Neurocognitive functioning improved after treatment in all patients, without clear advantage for either medication. Improvement in memory performance was associated with a reduction in suicidal ideation independent of the improvement of depression severity. Overall, antidepressant medication improved neurocognitive performance in patients with major depression and suicide risk. Reduced suicidal ideation was best predicted by a combination of the independent improvements in both depression symptomatology and verbal memory. Targeted treatment of neurocognitive dysfunction in these patients may augment standard medication treatment for reducing suicidal behavior risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: People who use illicit drugs (PWUD) are known to experience high rates of suicidal behavior. While heavy alcohol use has been associated with suicide risk, its impact on the suicidal behavior of PWUD has not been well characterized. Therefore, we examined the relationship between heavy alcohol use and suicidal behavior among PWUD in Vancouver, Canada.
   Methods: Data are derived from two prospective cohort studies of PWUD in Vancouver, Canada, from 2005 to 2013. Participants completed questionnaires that elicited information regarding sociodemographics, drug use patterns, and mental health problems, including suicidal behavior. We used recurrent event survival analyses to estimate the independent association between at-risk/heavy drinking (based on National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [NIAAA] criteria) and risk of incident, self-reported suicide attempts.
   Results: Of 1757 participants, 162 participants (9.2%) reported 227 suicide attempts over the 8-year study period, resulting in an incidence rate of 2.5 cases per 100 person-years. After adjusting for potential confounders, including intensive illicit drug use patterns, heavy alcohol use (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 1.97; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.39, 2.78) was positively associated with an increased risk of suicidal behavior.
   Conclusions: We observed a high burden of suicidal behavior among a community-recruited sample of PWUD. Heavy alcohol use predicted a higher risk of suicide attempt, independent of other drug use patterns. These findings demonstrate the need for evidence-based interventions to address suicide risk among PWUD, particularly those who are heavy consumers of alcohol. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Despite the fact that depression and other emotional distress are well documented in infertile women, little is known about the relationship between infertility and suicidal risk. The aim of this cross sectional study was to examine the rate of suicide risk (suicidal ideation/suicidal attempts) among 106 infertile women visiting Infertility and In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Hospital Unit, and to identify the demographic, medical and clinical correlates to suicidal risk. The incidence of suicide risk was 9.4%. Suicidal women were more likely to be childless or had fewer children and experienced higher levels of depressive symptoms. In addition, they reported more frequently on denial, social withdrawal and self-blame coping strategies compared to participants without suicidal risk. A multiple logistic regression model revealed that being childless, using non-positive reappraisal and exhibiting depressive symptoms were significant predictors of suicide risk in the future. These results suggest that routine assessment of suicidal risk and depression should be provided for infertile women in the course of IVF. Furthermore, future interventions should focus on helping them acquire different emotions regulation strategies and provide alternative skills for positive coping. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Recording deaths from acute poisoning/substance abuse is not straightforward. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD), used to code mortality statistics, is aimed towards recording the underlying cause of death such as suicide or drug dependence rather than gathering data on poisoning per se. Despite the inherent difficulties clear trends can be observed from the data available for England and Wales. There have been marked changes in the compounds featuring in suicidal poisoning in the last 35 years reflecting changes in the availability of poisons, notably carbon monoxide and prescription barbiturates. However, although the number of poisoning suicides has decreased in the recent years, suicides from other means have increased in males (suicides in 1999, 75% male), hence there has been little change in the annual total of suicides. There are also striking differences in drug abuse- and volatile substance abuse (VSA)-related deaths between males and females. Drug abuse-related fatal poisoning (83% male, 1979-1999, European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) definition which does not include suicide), largely attributable to heroin and methadone, increased markedly during the 1990s, with a sharp rise in deaths attributed to accidental poisoning, although deaths involving methadone are now declining. VSA-related deaths (90% male, 1971-1999, almost entirely accidental deaths), nowadays predominantly from abuse of fuel gases (liquefied petroleum gas, LPG) from, for example, cigarette lighter refills, have declined from a peak in the early 1990s and are now becoming manifest in an older age group. These two latter instances especially provide examples where ICD-derived fatal poisoning data are inadequate and a 'poisons oriented' approach to data collection and analysis is necessary.

AB Background Previous UK studies have reported much lower rates of psychiatric and personality disorder in those who attempt suicide than in those who die by suicide.
   Aims To determine the nature and prevalence of psychiatric and personality disorders in deliberate self-harm (DSH) patients.
   Method A representative sample of 150 DSH patients who presented to a general hospital were assessed using a structured clinical interview and a standardised instrument. Follow-up interviews were completed for 118 patients approximately 12-16 months later.
   Results ICD-10 psychiatric disorders were diagnosed in 138 patients (92.0%), with comorbidity of psychiatric disorders in 46.7%. The most common diagnosis was affective disorder (72.0%). Personality disorder was identified in 45.9% of patients interviewed at follow-up. Comorbidity of psychiatric and personality disorder was present in 44.1%.
   Conclusions Psychiatric and personality disorders, and their comorbidity, are common in DSH patients. This has important implications for assessment and management.

ID UNUSUAL SUICIDE; CHAIN SAW; TABLE SAW; INJURIES; ACCIDENT; DEATH; NECK
AB Fatalities attributed to powered circular saws appear to be vanishingly rare events with highly wounding and rapidly incapacitating effects. When they do occur, they are mainly self-inflicted in nature. We report the suicide committed by a 79-year-old man using a self-made circular table saw. Autopsy confirmed that the man received multiple heterogeneously distributed saw-type impacts to the head and neck resulting in complete amputation of the upper skull and partial beheading. Homemade or modified commercial sawing instruments and the resultant injuries pose a number of forensic challenges starting from the death scene investigation, continuing with technical examinations, and concluding with determining the manner of death. As with all deaths due to sharp force injuries, fatalities involving power tools such as chainsaws, circular, and band saws warrant a high degree of suspicion of criminal activity and require diligence during all phases of the death investigation.

AB Psychiatric deviations resulting from alcohol and illegal drug abuse may be considered a major risk factor for suicidal behavior. This report describes a suicide by hanging, under the influence of ketamine and alcohol. The victim was a 29-year-old man, found dead hanging by the neck from a metallic beam in the ceiling of his workplace. Besides characteristic signs of hanging seen at the autopsy, toxicological analysis revealed a femoral blood concentration of ketamine and ethanol of 1.3 mg/L and 0.66 g/L, respectively. Positive qualitative results for ketamine were also detected, in a powder found near the victim and on the victim's nostrils, which suggests nasal inhaling as administration route. The hallucinogenic effects caused by ketamine, associated with an increased sensitivity of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors to ketamine as result of the previous history of alcoholism should be considered as potential inducing factors in suicide behaviors.

AB We reviewed the 33 727 postmortem toxicology investigations performed in Finland over a period of 5 years (2009-2013) and identified those in which the antidepressant bupropion was detected. Cases positive for other antidepressant drugs were reviewed for comparison.
   The postmortem toxicological examination included, in all cases, the routine screening and quantification of hundreds of drugs and poisons using quality-controlled methods.
   Bupropion was detected in 65 cases. A large proportion of the bupropion-positive deaths resulted from suicide (55%). In fatal poisoning cases found positive for bupropion, the proportion of suicide was even higher (77%). The measured median bupropion postmortem blood concentration (0.69 mg/L) was markedly higher than the normal therapeutic range in plasma in the treatment of depression (up to 0.1 mg/L) and even higher in fatal bupropion poisonings (13 mg/L).
   Only 14% of the deceased positive for bupropion were estimated to be drug abusers. However, nearly all of the drug abuse cases were from the last year of the study (2013), indicating a recent increase of the use of bupropion among drug abusers and possibly even abuse of bupropion itself.
   Suicide victims positive for bupropion were younger than those who died with other antidepressant drugs in their blood. In addition, the percentage of fatal poisonings among bupropion-positive postmortem cases was higher than among the users of other antidepressant drugs. Suicide was significantly more common among the deceased positive for bupropion than among users of other antidepressant drugs.
   An unknown degree of bupropion degradation before the assay and post-mortem redistribution of bupropion may have impacted the measured levels. Nonetheless, all post-mortem concentrations of bupropion were elevated and especially high concentrations were detected in suicides. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to identify whether age at onset (MO) identifies Bipolar Disorder (BD) subtypes. and to test whether the subgroups were confirmed by different clinical profiles. Admixture analysis was applied to determine a model that best fit the observed distribution of MO in 964 BD patients. Three distributions of MO were identified, and age means were 16.1 (S.D. 4.2), 25.4 (S.D. 2.5) and 32.2 (S.D. 9.5) years. A significant increased rate of suicide attempts, Bipolar I (BD I) caseness, and depressive onset was observed in the early-onset group when compared to those with later-onset by means of chi(2). Findings from extant studies and our results are remarkably consistent in showing that BD can be subdivided into three groups based on MO distributions, and that early-onset is associated with higher rates of suicide attempts.

AB The mortality of Female homicidal offenders has scarcely been studied. Our aim was to examine the mortality of homicidal women in Finland using a representative nation-wide material. The data consisted of all 132 women Mho underwent forensic psychiatric examinations after committing homicide or attempted homicide in 1982-1992. We analysed their rate and cause of death during follow-up using standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and the official classification of death. The mean follow-up rime for dead subjects was 7 years (S.D. 4). and for the rest 11 years (S.D. 3). There were 22 observed deaths. the expected value being 1.3 (SMR 17.4). The SMR for unnatural deaths was 226 and for suicides 425. The SMRs for women below 40 years were over 220. In conclusion. homicidal women have an over 200-fold risk of unnatural death, rising to over 400-fold for suicide. This should be taken into consideration in planning discharge programmes for homicidal offenders. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Melperone is judged to be a safe neuroleptic drug. Until now there has been no report of a melperone fatality, though it has been used in suicide attempts. We report on a case of a 36-year-old woman where no cause of death could be established at autopsy. Criminological investigation pointed to a homicide by poisoning but also the possibility of a suicide had to be taken in account. The toxicological analysis of blood, cerebral spinal fluid and urine revealed extremely high concentrations of melperone which had never been reported before. Furthermore, diazepam. nordazepam and carbamazepine were detected. To our knowledge, this case is the first melperone fatality. Possible interactions with diazepam and carbamazepine are discussed.

AB Hormones and neurobiological factors may be regulated differently in suicidal versus non-suicidal depressive patients. There is currently limited knowledge about the relation of substances in the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system to depression and suicidality. We therefore investigated whether plasma levels of renin and aldosterone differ between suicide attempters, non-suicidal depressive patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, we analyzed the relation of renin and aldosterone to psychiatric symptoms in the patients. Suicidal patients with MDD, adjustment disorder and dysthymia, as well as two control groups consisting of non-suicidal MDD patients and healthy subjects, were rated using the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS), including the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Brief Scale for Anxiety (BSA). Plasma samples were frozen immediately after collection and stored at -80 degrees C for 5-18 years. Aldosterone and renin levels were analyzed using radioactive- and chemiluminescent immunoassays. We found that suicide attempters with MDD had significantly lower plasma levels of aldosterone than the other patient groups, as well as than the healthy controls. Moreover, increasing severity of psychiatric symptoms was associated with lower aldosterone levels in the suicide attempters with MDD. Non-suicidal patients with MDD did not differ significantly compared to healthy controls with respect to aldosterone and renin levels. These findings may indicate that low aldosterone levels could be a marker of suicidality in patients with MDD. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Five cases of strangulation tool investigation are summarised. Two cases of homicide could be cleared up by identifying the mtDNA of both the victim and the suspect on cables which had obviously been used as strangulation tools. In eight of 10 cases, weapons could be reliably assigned to their users. The mtDNA of the users could be even detected on cartridges after firing. In one case, evidence of a suicide could be provided by means of mtDNA sequencing of the wiping traces on a suicide note. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The connection between community stress and problems and community residents' psychopathology is an understudied area, and a limited number of studies have reported inconsistent findings. This research aimed to estimate the effect of perceived social factors in the community environment on the residents' self-reported psychopathology. The study sample consisted of 2034 men and women from 16 selected rural counties in three provinces of China. The social factors in the village community were measured by the World Health Organization Multisite Intervention Study on Suicidal Behaviors (WHO SUPRE-MISS) scale of Community Stress and Problems. The sychological and mental health of the individuals was assessed by (1) suicidal thoughts, plans and attempts (National Comorbidity Survey Replication or NCS-R), (2) pro-suicide attitudes (General Social Survey or GSS), (3) depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale or CES-D) and (4) suicide ideation (Scale for Suicide Ideation or SSI). Multiple regressions were performed separately for each of the four psychopathologic traits with the scale of Community Stress and Problems as the major predicting variable and age, gender, education years, marital status, family annual income, family status in village and religion as the confounding correlates. It is found that community stress and problems generally increase rural Chinese residents' psychopathologies, especially issues in health care, housing and transportation, which play more important roles than others.

AB Sunlight exposure is considered responsible for seasonal serotonin changes. Sixty-six healthy participants were recruited, and single photon emission computed tomography ([I-123]-ADAM SPECT) was used to investigate the association between serotonin transporter (SERT) availability and duration of sunlight exposure in Taiwan, a subtropical country. No significant correlation between SERT availability and the duration of sunlight exposure was found. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although great efforts have been made to improve conventional therapy for diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma, the median survival time of the patients after appearance of clinical symptoms remains poor. Due to confinement of the primary tumor to the pleural space, locoregional approaches are attractive strategies to improve the clinical outcome. In this context locoregional gene therapy using the recombinant adeno-associated virus 2 (rAAV-2) may be a new approach. Vectors were constructed containing a fusion gene, consisting of the Herpes simplexvirus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) genes; the former serving as suicide gene by converting the prodrug ganciclovir (GCV) into a toxic agent, thereby killing infected cells. Among a number of different tumor cell lines, rAAV-2 achieved high GFP expression levels in three mesothelioma cell lines (H-Meso-1, MSTO-211H, NCl-H28). A variety of rAAV-2-constructs containing different promoters were tested. The vector with the elongation factor-1alpha (EF-1alpha) promoter showed the highest expression rates. Expression could be further increased by addition of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. Using the rAAV-2-based suicide system, a nearly complete eradication of transduced and GCV-treated mesothelioma cells was observed. rAAV-2-based suicide gene therapy may be a new approach for locoregional treatment of mesothelioma.

TI A case of Munchausen syndrome by proxy with subsequent suicide of the
   mother
SO FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL
LA English

DE Munchausen syndrome by proxy; factitious illness; child abuse;
   poisoning; suffocation; suicide
ID CHILD-ABUSE; CHALLENGE
AB Munchausen syndrome by proxy is a subtle and difficult to diagnose form of child abuse in which the carer (usually the mother) simulates, manipulates or produces symptoms of illness in the victim. In most cases the detrimental effect is caused by applying foreign substances or by airway obstruction.
   In the presented case a 20-month-old girl developed a spreading soft-tissue infection resistant to treatment on the left upper arm after vaccination, which required a number of surgical interventions. Repeatedly, microorganisms from the intestinal flora were isolated from the Wound secretion. After the girl suffered respiratory and circulatory arrest, which required resuscitation measures, chemical toxicological tests revealed not medically prescribed benzodiazepines in serum and urine.
   When the mother, a trained nurse, was confronted with the allegation to have manipulated the symptoms of the illness she committed suicide. The forensic autopsy of the suicide produced numerous hints suggesting chronic self-damaging behaviour described as Munchausen syndrome.
   This case shows a number of manipulation forms with the maintenance of a chronic skin and soft tissue infection belonging to the rarer forms of inflicting damage to the child. It also illustrates that confrontation with the allegation of Munchausen syndrome by proxy creates a very stressful emotional Situation that may lead to a suicidal act. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Many young adults who attempt suicide have no discernible mental illness, suggesting an etiology distinct from other psychiatric disorders. Neurological anomalies associated with a history of suicidal behavior may predict future risk. In the present study, we explored changes in neural circuit organization associated with suicidal behavior by comparing local synchronization of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging signals in suicide attempters without a psychiatric diagnosis (SA group, 19.84 +/- 1.61 years, n=19) with those in healthy controls (HC group, 20.30 +/- 1.72 years, n=20) using regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis. The SA group exhibited significantly lower mean ReHo in the left (L) fusiform and supraorbital inferior frontal gyri, L hippocampus, bilateral parahippocampal and middle frontal gyri, right (R) angular gyros, and cerebellar lobules RVIII, RII, and LVI compared with the HC group. Conversely, in the SA group, ReHo was higher in the R supraorbital middle frontal gyrus, R inferior parietal lobe, and L precuncus. The SA group also had significantly higher total Barratt: Impulsiveness Scale scores compared with the HC group. Local functional connectivity is altered in multiple regions of the cerebral cortex, limbic system, and cerebellum of suicidal young adults. Elucidating the functional deficits associated with these ReHo changes may clarify the pathophysiological mechanisms of suicidal behavior and assist in identifying high-risk individuals.

AB The aim of the present study was the validation of the Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale-Fearlessness about Death (ACSS-FAD) in a large population sample to further establish its reliability and validity, and to provide norm values.
   We assessed the ACSS-FAD, measures of depression, history of suicidal behavior, and anxiety in a representative sample of the German population (N=2513) and analyzed its dimensionality, invariance across sex and construct validity by means of confirmatory factor analysis, correlational analysis and analysis of variance.
   The one-factorial structure achieved satisfactory model fit after introducing several correlating error terms. Across sex, partial scalar invariance could be established. Depression and anxiety showed negative associations with the ACSS-FAD while no relation with past suicidal behavior was found. Because mean scores in the ACSS-FAD were affected by sex and age group, sex and age-specific norm values were calculated.
   Our findings support the one-factorial structure of the ACSS-FAD when the measurement model is slightly modified, pointing out the need of revising the wording of some items. The validity of the measure should be further examined in clinical samples. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The neural processes underlying suicide risk are incompletely characterized. This project utilized functional MRI (fMRI) to determine whether a history of self-harm was associated with striatal circuit function in recurrent major depression in remission. Twenty unmedicated subjects with recurrent major depression and 21 controls were studied using fMRI and a motor activation paradigm. We used functional connectivity analyses to identify circuits with aberrant connectivity. We also used correlational analyses to determine whether functional connectivity was associated with a history of self-harm. There was a significant association between history of self-harm and functional connectivity of a striatal-motor circuit. Additionally, striatal and cortical midline circuits exhibited decreased functional connectivity in remitted unipolar depression as compared to controls. Our previous study of individuals experiencing an episode of depression indicated an association between striatal circuitry and a history of self-harm. That study, along with the results reported herein suggests striatal circuit function may play a key role in the neurobiology of suicide and self-harm risk in recurrent major depression. Our results also indicate that both striatal and CMS circuit dysfunction persists in the euthymic state of recurrent major depression and thus may represent trait pathology.

LA English
DT Review
DE Planned complex suicide; Captive-bolt gun; Hanging; Computed tomography
   (CT)
AB Captive-bolt guns or slaughterer's guns are devices widely used in meat industry and private farmer households for slaughtering animal stocks. They consist of a simple cylindrical metal tube (barrel) with a metal bolt placed in their centre (around 9-15 cm long and 1-1.5 cm wide). The bolt is actuated by a trigger pull and is propelled forward by compressed air or by the discharge of a blank powder gun cartridge. Violent deaths inflicted by captive-bolt guns are rarely encountered in forensic practice and are predominantly suicidal events.
   We report an unusual complex suicide by hanging and self-shooting with a slaughterer's gun in a 21-year-old boy. The victim after putting a ceiling fixed rope around his neck shot himself in the head (occipital region) with a Kerner captive-bolt gun. He used two mirrors (a cosmetic mirror and a man-sized one) in order to properly visualize his back and to target the occipital region of his head.
   Radiological data (computed tomography with three dimensional reconstruction) and autopsy findings are discussed according to the clinical and forensic literature. A brief review on planned complex suicides is also given. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) has been identified as a correlate and predictor of suicidal ideation and attempts. Given the high-rates of NSSI presence among adolescents and young adults, it is important to identify specific characteristics of NSSI that might place individuals who engage in this behavior at highest risk for suicidal behavior. NSSI is thought to increase the acquired capability for suicide via habituation to self-harm, though the NSSI characteristics most responsible for this relationship are unclear. The current study examined three characteristics of NSSI (frequency, number of methods, and subjective pain) that may help to elucidate this risk relationship. University students (N=997) with a history of NSSI completed measures assessing lifetime NSSI frequency, number of NSSI methods employed, and subjective experience of pain during NSSI, as well as suicide attempt (SA) history. Results indicated that NSSI frequency, number of NSSI methods, and subjective pain experienced during NSSI were each positively associated with SA history. Further, subjective pain experienced during NSSI moderated the relationship between NSSI frequency and SA history, such that the association between NSSI frequency and SA history was stronger for individuals who experienced lower levels of subjective pain.

AB Suicide is a leading cause of death in America, with over 40,000 reported suicides per year. Mental illness is a major risk factor for suicidality. This study attempts to validate findings of volumetric differences from studies on suicidality. Psychiatric inpatients classified as having mildly severe or severe depression were separated into two groups: suicide attempted in the past two months (SA; n=20), non-suicidal control group (DA; n=20); these patients were all depressed and not significantly different for age, gender, race, marital status, education level, anxiety level, and substance abuse. Healthy controls (HC; n=20) were not significantly different from the suicidal groups for age and gender. Volunteers underwent MRI to assess volumes of cortical lobes, corpus callosum, and subcortical regions of interest, including the thalamus, insula, limbic structures, and basal ganglia. The right hippocampal volume of the SA group was significantly reduced compared to healthy controls. The frontal and temporal lobe volumes of the SA group were significantly decreased compared to the DA group. These volumetric reductions confirm previous findings and support the hypothesis that fronto-temporal function may be altered in suicidal patients. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI The association between self-harm and area-level characteristics in
   Northern Ireland: an ecological study
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH

DT Article
ID ECONOMIC RECESSION; SUICIDE RISK; PATTERNS; HEALTH; IMPACT; URBAN
AB Background: Factors contributing to suicidal behaviour are complex and multi-faceted. This study took an ecological approach to examine the association between area-level factors and rates of self-harm in Northern Ireland. Methods: Data on self-harm presentations to emergency departments (EDs) were obtained from the Northern Ireland Self-harm Registry. The study included residents of Northern Ireland aged 16-64 years. Deprivation was measured using the Northern Ireland Multiple Deprivation Measure 2017. Population density and social fragmentation were calculated using measures from the 2011 census. Associations between area-level factors and self-harm rates were explored using negative binomial regression. Results: Between 2013 and 2015, 14 477 individuals aged 16-64 years presented to EDs in Northern Ireland following self-harm. The rate of self-harm was 472 per 100 000 and was higher for male residents (478 vs. 467). Self-harm rates were highest in urban areas-680 per 100 000 in Belfast City and 751 per 100 000 in Derry City. Rates of self-harm in Northern Ireland were more than four times higher in the most deprived areas. A positive association with rates of self-harm held for the deprivation domains of employment, crime, education, health and income. There was a moderate association with population density. Some gender differences emerged, with associations with male rates of self-harm more pronounced. Conclusion: These findings indicate that self-harm rates are highest for those residing in highly deprived areas, where unemployment, crime and low level of education are challenges. Community interventions tailored to meet the needs of specific areas may be effective in reducing suicidal behaviour.

AB Chlormequat is a quaternary ammonium used as plant growth regulating agent. We report here the first suicide case involving a 45 year-old farmer man who intentionally self-injected C5SUN (R), containing chlormequat and choline. An original liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry method (LC-HR-MS), using a hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer, was developed for qualitative and quantitative analysis of chlormequat in different biological matrices. Toxicological analyses of postmortem samples highlighted the presence of chlormequat in the blood (2.25 mg/L) and the urine (4.45 mg/L), in addition to ethanol impregnation blood (1.15 g/L). The route of administration (subcutaneous injection) was confirmed by the detection of chlormequat in the abdominal fat sample (chlormequat: 10.04 mg/g) taken from the traumatic injury location, as well as in the syringe found at the death scene, close to the victim's body. Based on the results of these post-mortem investigations, the cause of death was determined to be consecutive to cardiac dysrhythmia and cardiac arrest following chlormequat self-injection.

AB On May 12, 2006, members of the UK House of Lords voted against a proposed Assisted Dying for the Terminal III Bill. This Bill was put forward to "enable an adult who has capacity and who is suffering as a result of a terminal illness to receive medical assistance to die at his own considered and persistent request". Under this Bill, it would be lawful for a physician, or a member of the health-care team working in conjunction with a physician, to assist a qualifying patient to die by prescribing drugs. In this Debate, Margaret Branthwaite, a retired barrister and former consultant medical practitioner, presents the case for physician-assisted suicide, whereas David Jeffrey, former chair of the ethics committee of the Association for Palliative Medicine of Great Britain and Ireland, presents the case against.

AB The application of gene therapy in cancer treatment is limited by non-specific targeting. In the present study, we constructed a recombinant plasmid, containing a carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) promoter and double suicide genes thymidine kinase (TK) and cytosine deaminase (CD), henceforth referred to as pCEA-TK/CD. Our results showed that the CEA promoter can specifically drive target gene expression in CEA-positive lung cancer cells. In the presence of prodrugs 5-flucytosine and ganciclovir, pCEA-TK/CD transfection decreased inhibitory concentration 50 and increased apoptosis and cyclomorphosis. Our result suggests that gene therapy using pCEA-TK/CD may be a promising new approach for treating lung cancer. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The Quality Adjusted Life Year influences the allocation of significant amounts of healthcare resources. Despite this surprisingly little research effort has been devoted to analysing how beliefs and attitudes to hastening death influence preferences for health states anchored at "dead" and "perfect health". In this paper we examine how, inter alia, adherence to particular religious beliefs (religiosity) influences attitudes to euthanasia and how, inter alia, attitudes to euthanasia influences the willingness to assign worse than dead (WTD) values to health states using data collected as part of the Irish EQ5D5L valuation study.
   Methods: A sample of 160 respondents each supplied 10 composite time trade-off valuations and information on religiosity and attitudes to euthanasia as part of a larger national survey. Data were analysed using a recursive bivariate probit model in which attitudes to euthanasia and willingness to assign Win values were analysed jointly as functions of a range of covariates.
   Results: Religiosity was a significant determinant of attitudes to euthanasia and attitudes to euthanasia were a significant determinant of the likelihood of assigning WTD values. A significant negative correlation in errors between the two probit models was observed indicative of support for the hypothesis of endogeneity between attitudes to euthanasia and readiness to assign WTD values.
   Conclusion: In Ireland attitudes and beliefs play an important role in understanding health state preferences. Beyond Ireland this may have implications for: the construction of representative samples; understanding the values accorded health states and; the frequency with which value sets must be updated.

DE Asphyxia; Autoerotic death; Masochism; Compression
ID AUTOEROTIC DEATHS; ASPHYXIA; FEATURES; FEMALE
AB "Autoerotic asphyxia'' typically involves an individual hanging or ligature, resulting in self-induced oxygen deprivation brought about by neck compression during sexual activity. Little about the so-called "atypical forms'' of autoerotic asphyxia, which also involve compression of the chest or abdomen, has been published in forensic literature. When death results from such practices, they are usually deemed accidental, however, suicide or homicide must also be considered.
   The authors present a single case of accidental fatal asphyxia by the simultaneous compression of the neck, chest, and abdomen using a chair-bed. The victim was known to have had masochistic tendencies. In order to confirm the hypothesis of accidental death, the results of crime scene investigations, and autopsy findings, including histological and toxicological analysis, are summarized here.

   Aims In this paper, the authors review the observational and experimental evidence for the acute neuropsychological effects of alcohol intake on suicidal ideation and behaviour.
   Methods A selective review of the literature was conducted, using the PubMed database. Search terms employed included `alcohol', 'suicide', `binge' and 'acute alcohol intake'.
   Results Cognitive mechanisms implicated include alcohol-induced deficits in attention-allocation, prospective cognition, autobiographical memory and disinhibition. Emotional mechanisms include alcohol-induced dysphoria, depression and aggression.
   Conclusions This paper serves to highlight the importance of identifying and tackling acute alcohol intake and binge drinking as a risk factor for suicidal behaviour.

AB Three cases of cremation on open-air pyres are described. One was classified as a suicide and two as homicides. Fire duration was estimated at approximately 1 h, close to 2 h and more than 3 h, respectively. The position of the remains, the colour alteration of bone and the burned bone fractures biomechanics are discussed. Knowledge of normal burn patterns in fire and detection of perimortem lesions are essential. These three cases highlight the specific thermal alterations and burning processes in accordance with fire duration. In each case, careful investigation yielded clues as to the manner of death. Close cooperation between law enforcement and forensic pathology investigators is required in order to correctly identify the circumstances of death. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB The current study was designed to evaluate the anti-tumor effects of MDR1 shRNA in combination with herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (HSV-tk/GCV) suicide gene therapy system. Introduction of an MDR1-targeted small hairpin RNA (shMDR) markedly enhanced the intracellular accumulation of and increased sensitivity to drugs transported by P-glycoprotein. Functional TK-eGFP fusion protein expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis and ganciclovir uptake assay. Compared with GCV or doxorubicin alone, the combination of anti-cancer drug chemotherapy with GCV administration displays additive cytotoxicity in shMDR 1-TK-eGFP expressing cells. These results for the first time suggest the potential of combination gene therapy using suicide gene therapy and RNAi-based gene therapy in vitro.

AB There exists an extensive literature documenting the impact of seasonality on rates of depression, atypical depression. bulimia. and Suicide. In the present report drawn from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project, we reviewed the results of 1500 diagnostic evaluations of patients who presented to our psychiatric outpatient practice between 1995 and 2001. We sought to determine whether seasonal fluctuations in psychopathology were discernible at the level of how patients present for psychiatric treatment. Contrary to our hypotheses. we did not find (1) higher rates of onset of major depressive disorder in the spring and fall, (2) higher rates of depressive symptoms or rates of atypical depression in the winter, (3) higher rates of bulimia in the winter, or (4) higher rates of suicidal ideation in the spring. We conclude from these results that the association between seasonality and psychopathology may not be discernible at the level of presentations to an outpatient psychiatric practice.

AB This article presents a highly unusual homicide involving intracranial stab wounds. Of three members of a family killed by intracranial stab wounds apparently inflicted with metal tent stakes, two also showed signs of wounds inflicted during an apparent struggle with the assailant. A wooden mallet appears to be the implement use to drive the metal stakes into the cranial cavity. In all victims, toxicological analysis indicated the presence of brotizolam at concentrations ranging from 30 to 50 ng ml (1). The one victim who showed no signs of wounds incurred during a defensive struggle was found to have blood alcohol levels of 2.87 mg ml (1). The assailant, another family member with a history of major psychiatric disorders, apparently committed suicide by drowning following the attacks. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to examine insomnia symptoms, behavioral problems, and suicidality among adolescents of insomniac parents (IP) and non-insomniac parents (NIP). A family survey of sleep and health was conducted among 1090 adolescents and their parents in Jinan, China. Adolescents completed a sleep and health questionnaire to report their sleep and mental health problems. Parents reported their insomnia symptoms and history of mental disorders. Insomnia, behavioral problems, and suicidal behavior were compared between IP adolescents and NIP adolescents. IP adolescents were more likely than NIP adolescents to report insomnia symptoms, use of sleep medication, suicidal ideation, suicide plan, and suicide attempt. IP adolescents scored significantly higher than NIP adolescents on withdrawn and externalizing behavioral problems. After adjustment for demographics and behavioral problems, parental insomnia remained to be significantly associated with adolescent suicidal ideation and suicide plan. Our findings support the need for early screening and formal assessment of sleep and mental health in adolescents of insomniac parents. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Excessive interpersonal dependency has been described in depression and addictive disorders. Moreover, excessive dependency and suicidality are linked in psychiatric subjects, but their relationships have not been studied in specific addictions. Separate samples of female anorectic patients (n = 150), female bulimic patients (n = 95), male (n = 150) or female (n = 68) alcoholics, male (n = 94) or female (n = 54) drug abusers and non-psychiatric control subjects (n = 683) were included in the study. On the basis of a structured interview, suicidal ideations, number of previous suicide attempts and diagnoses of dependent personality disorder (DSM-IV) were collected, and the subjects completed the Interpersonal Dependency Inventory and the Beck Depression Inventory. Logistic regression analysis revealed that excessive dependency and notably dependent personality disorder increased the likelihood of suicidal ideation or suicide attempts with a range of 2.65 to 9.42 in bulimic patients, female alcoholics and male drug abusers. Excessive dependency in specific addictive disorders as well as in male non-psychiatric subjects could constitute a risk factor for suicide. This hypothesis must be confirmed using prospective studies. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Insomnia has been associated with suicidality. Prisoners have an increased risk of both insomnia and suicidal behaviour. Therefore, it was decided to examine for a relationship between insomnia and suicidal behaviour in a large group of 1420 prisoners. Prisoners had a semi-structured psychiatric interview, which included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), and completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, Spielberg Anger Expression Inventory and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. It was found that 568 (61.2%) of the prisoners scored in the insomnia cluster of the HDRS and that 183 (12.8%) had attempted suicide. Regression analyses showed that insomnia was significantly and independently associated with a lifetime history of attempting suicide. Insomnia was also significantly related to actual suicidality. After controlling for confounders, axis 1 psychiatric disorder, childhood trauma, neuroticism, low resilience, and anger were significantly associated with insomnia in male prisoners. These data suggest the possibility of a relationship between insomnia and suicidality in prisoners. Assessing insomnia may be helpful when evaluating the risk of suicidality in prisoners.

AB Suicide gene therapy, also known as gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy, has the potential to provide a cure for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Linamarase from cassava is an enzyme that can hydrolyze the innocuous substrate linamarin into cyanide, which can block the mitochondrial respiratory chain of cells. To investigate whether linamarase and linamarin can be used for HCC treatment, a recombinant adenovirus carrying linamarase cDNA was constructed using the ViraPower (TM) Adenoviral Expression System. In vitro cytotoxicity assays indicated that the system has a dramatic inhibitory effect and a strong bystander effect on HCC cell lines. Application of the recombinant adenovirus with linamarin in nude mice bearing HCC xenografts also resulted in significant inhibition of the tumors, while the animals did not show any appreciable toxic effects. Our findings provide the first in vitro and in vivo evidence that this system may provide a potential strategy for HCC treatment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study provides the first systematic research of homicide-suicide (HS) in a Chinese society. Data were drawn from the HK Homicide Monitoring Data-base computer file derived from investigation and death reports held by the HK Police Force and the Coroner's Court. During the 10-year study period, 56 events involving 133 deaths were identified. The majority of offenders were males (75%) and most victims were female (64%). The mean age of offenders and victims were 41.9 and 32.3 years, respectively. Spouses and lovers comprised the majority of victims (46.4%) followed by child victims (36%). Most HS events were motivated by separation or termination of marital or sexual relations (39%), economic reasons (25%) and other domestic disputes (20%). The most frequent modes of killing were strangulation/suffocation (26%), stabbing/chopping (24%), followed by gassing/poisoning (14%) and falling from a height (14%). The commonest method of suicide was falling from a height (48%). It was followed by gassing/poisoning (22%) and strangulation/suffocation (13%). Depression (18.3%) was found to be the commonest mental disorder. Most offenders were from low-socio-economic background. Two-third were unemployed and 76.6% had 9 or less years of education. HS in HK were distinguished from those reported in the western literature in respect to the high relevance of economic factors, the absence of mercy killing between old couples, a higher percentage of pedicide-suicides and the infrequent use of firearms.

AB The aim of this study was to characterize patients after self-poisoning with suicidal intent regarding age, sex and type of substances ingested, as well as to identify temporal variations of attempted suicides and associations with climate variables and the lunar cycle. During the years 2002-2004, a total of 691 patients were admitted for self-poisoning parasuicides. The male to female ratio was 1:1.65 with mean ages of 39 and 37 years, respectively. Benzodiazepines and antidepressants were the most frequently taken substances. A significant variation with the time of the day with a peak before midnight was observed for both sexes. Variation with the day of the week was less clear and showed a peak incidence for parasuicides on Mondays. There was no significant variation with the monthly or annual cycle. The frequency of parasuicides was associated with "bad weather" (precipitation). No association of parasuicide incidences to the lunar cycle was observed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB This article uses a qualitative approach to elicit the views of 31 professionals who provide services to vulnerable young men. The findings reveal six key themes following focus group interviews: (i) the importance of masculinity in explaining problematic behaviour; (ii) the misuse of alcohol and drugs; (iii) alienation and social isolation; (iv) concerns about suicide and self-harm; (v) the quality of existing services; and (vi) recommendations for changes to services. Service providers generally acknowledged the social context in explaining these behaviours and argued for enhanced services and a more developed skills base in working with vulnerable young men.

AB The aim of the study was to explore differences and similarities between the various non-natural manners of death (accident, suicide, homicide) regarding toxicological findings in illicit drug users. Medicolegal autopsy reports from the Institute of Forensic Medicine University of Oslo concerning deaths from 2000 to 2009 were investigated. Those aged 20-59 whose manner of death was non-natural and who tested positive for any narcotic drug (morphine/heroin, amphetamines, ecstasy, cannabis, LSD, PCP, and high levels of GHB in addition to methadone and buprenorphine) were selected. All substance findings were registered and categorized (narcotics, ethanol, and medicinal products). Of the 1603 autopsies that met the selection criteria, 1204 were accidental intoxications, 122 accidents other than intoxication, 114 suicides by intoxication, 119 non-intoxication suicides, and 44 victims of homicide. Poly drug use was found in all manners of death. The drug profile as well as the mean number of substances (illicit drugs and medicinal products) varied from 2.9 to 4.6 substances per case, depending on the manner of death. Intoxication suicides had the highest number of substances and a total drug profile similar to accidental intoxications. Non-intoxication suicides had a total drug profile similar to homicide and accidents other than intoxication. The number of substances found per case increased during the decade, mainly due to increased findings of methadone, cannabis, amphetamines, and benzodiazepines. Methadone findings increased much more than buprenorphine. Methadone was found 20 times more often than buprenorphine in accidental intoxication cases. In summary, poly drug findings are common in adults who suffer a non-natural death while using illicit drugs. The different manners of death have some specific characteristics and significant differences regarding drug profile. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The importance of serotonin 2C receptor (HTR2C) in mental disorders has been implicated by studies of HTR2C-deficient mice and linkage and association studies. Recent studies have revealed that RNA editing of HTR2C is involved in mental disorders. Here we examined RNA editing efficiencies of site A and D of HTR2C in the prefrontal cortex samples of patients with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and major depression as well as control subjects by using primer extension combined with denaturing high performance liquid chromatography. Postmortem samples were donated by the Stanley Foundation Brain Collection. We could not find significant alterations of RNA editing efficiencies of these sites in patients. However, we found trends for increased RNA editing efficiencies of site D in depressive patients (P = 0.08) and site A in suicide victims (P = 0.07). These findings are in accordance with the previous findings, and suggest that altered RNA editing of HTR2C may have some significance in major depression and suicide.

AB Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a common cause of death globally, and case reports and empirical studies on CO poisoning are widely examined. However, to the authors' knowledge, CO poisoning deaths in the mainland China are scarcely studied. Therefore, this study aims to explore the incidence trend of CO poisoning deaths that occurred in Wuhan - a mega city in Central China - for a six-year period (2009-2014). This arguably is the first comprehensive study to provide an overall analysis of CO poisoning deaths that sampled the mainland Chinese population. Using the data provided by the legal physicians who are employed in nine districts of Wuhan, a total of 131 cases of CO poisoning that resulted in the death of 156 victims are collected. Out of the total, 76 cases (97 deaths) are classified as accidents, 49 cases (51 deaths) are suicides, three cases (four deaths) are homicides, one case (three deaths) is homicide-suicide, and one case (one death) is classified as undetermined. Male victims are found to be the dominant sex group (53.5%; N = 83); with a mean age of 44.9 years, while female victims averagely aged 46.1 years. The highest death occurring month is in January, and followed by February and December. Coal or charcoal burning is found to be the major cause of suicide CO poisoning death (66.7%), while fire accident is the major cause of accidental CO poisoning death (60.8%) in Wuhan during the six-year period.

ID RIVER BRIDGES; WATER
AB Suicide methods may differ widely. One of these methods is jumping from a height. The people who choose a high bridge for jumping may be considered as a special group. In this study, we evaluated the demographic data, mortality rates and postmortem findings of individuals who jumped from the 64 m high Bosphorus Bridge of Istanbul. For this purpose, we reviewed registration forms of two police centers on both sides of the bridge, court archives, and postmortem examination reports of the deceased for a period of 10 years between 1986 and 1995.
   During this period, 65 people had jumped from the Bosphorus Bridge of Istanbul. The mortality rate was 96.9%, as two individuals survived their suicide attempt. The male/female ratio for attempts was 15:1 (61 males, four females) in this study in contrast to the male/female ratio of 1.6:1 for all suicidal cases in Turkey. The average age of subjects was 29.2 (median: 26, range: 16-54). The frequency was highest in the 15-24 age group with a rate of 38.4%. People who jumped from the bridge were younger than other reported cases of suicide. For all methods of suicide in Turkey 53.5% of subjects are under the age of 35. However, in our study, 75.8% of individuals who committed suicide from the Bosphorus Bridge were under the age of 35. Unmarried people accounted for 56% of the individuals whose marital status was known. 20.8% of the individuals whose employment status was known were unemployed. 59% of the cases whose education was known were high school graduates. The highest rate of suicide by jumping was in 1990, and occurred during the fall and winter months, primarily between the hours of 24.00 and 06.00. The Bosphorus Bridge is forbidden to pedestrians. Arrival method to the bridge was by a taxicab in 53.3% of the cases. 91% of the recovered bodies had been discovered during the first 2 days of jumping. Positions on impact with the water were estimated according to external and internal injuries. Among the cases in which the position of impact could be assessed by external and internal injury patterns, combined lateral and horizontal positions were most common.

AB Impairment in decision-making is frequently observed in suicide attempters. Little is known, however, about neural circuitry underlying decision-making in adolescent attempters. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to assess decision-making and learning-related neural activity during Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) performance in adolescents with depression and suicide attempt (ATT, n=15), non-attempters with depression (NAT, n=14), and healthy controls (HC, n=13). ATT performed best on the IGT. A three group by two condition (high-risk versus low-risk) by three IGT block (each of 20 cards) whole-brain analysis (p < 0.05, corrected) interaction was found in the left hippocampal, frontal and temporal cortical, striatal and thalamic regions. Post-hoc analyses revealed that during low-risk decisions in blocks 2 and 3, NAT, but not ATT, showed greater left hippocampal activation versus HC (p=0.0004, p = 0.003); in block 2, during low-risk decisions NAT showed greater left middle temporal gyral activation versus HC (p=0.003); in block 3, during high-risk decisions ATT showed less activation in the right thalamus versus NAT (p=0.001) and during low risk decisions ATT showed greater activation than HC in the left caudate (p=0.002). NAT, but not ATT are differentiated from HC during performance of the IGT. Functional abnormalities in neural circuitry implicated in learning in the context of risk may underlie risk for MDD, but not risk for suicide attempt, in adolescence. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Background: National mortality statistics should be comparable between countries that use the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases. Distinguishing between manners of death, especially suicides and accidents, is a challenge. Knowledge about accidents is important in prevention of both accidents and suicides. The aim of the present study was to assess the reliability of classifying deaths as accidents and undetermined manner of deaths in the three Scandinavian countries and to compare cross-national differences.
   Methods: The cause of death registers in Norway, Sweden and Denmark provided data from 2008 for samples of 600 deaths from each country, of which 200 were registered as suicides, 200 as accidents or undetermined manner of deaths and 200 as natural deaths. The information given to the eight experts was identical to the information used by the Cause of Death Register. This included death certificates, and if available external post-mortem examinations, forensic autopsy reports and police reports.
   Results: In total, 69 % (Sweden and Norway) and 78 % (Denmark) of deaths registered in the official mortality statistics as accidents were confirmed by the experts. In the majority of the cases where disagreement was seen, the experts reclassified accidents to undetermined manner of death, in 26, 25 and 19 % of cases, respectively. Few cases were reclassified as suicides or natural deaths. Among the extracted accidents, the experts agreed least with the official mortality statistics concerning drowning and poisoning accidents. They also reported most uncertainty in these categories of accidents. In a second re-evaluation, where more information was made available, the Norwegian psychiatrist and forensic pathologist increased their agreement with the official mortality statistics from 76 to 87 %, and from 85 to 88 %, respectively, regarding the Norwegian and Swedish datasets. Among the extracted undetermined deaths in the Swedish dataset, the two experts reclassified 22 and 51 %, respectively, to accidents.
   Conclusion: There was moderate agreement in reclassification of accidents between the official mortality statistics and the experts. In the majority of cases where there was disagreement, accidents were reclassified as undetermined manner of death, and only a small proportion as suicides.

AB Objectives To evaluate web-based information on accessing abortion services retrieved through internet searches in different jurisdictions from the perspective of service users. To provide a formative evaluative mechanism for enabling user-focused design of abortion access information web pages.
   Design Web searches were conducted in three countries-England, Northern Ireland, and the Republic of Ireland-using two search engines in the summer of 2016. Four search terms were used and the first two pages of results were analysed. The perspective of someone seeking abortion services was used. Sources were evaluated using a five-item tool combining user-based indicators identified in other instruments and a question on jurisdictional accuracy.
   Results A total of 619 web pages were retrieved through initial searches, 83 of which related to accessing services; 22 pages were retrieved from the Republic of Ireland, 31 from Northern Ireland, and 30 from England. Fewer than a third (n=31) were judged as good or excellent by the tool. The jurisdictional relevancy of information retrieved varied; almost half of all results in each country provided information that was either inaccurate within or irrelevant to the jurisdiction where the search took place.
   Conclusions If online information is to support abortion access, the circumstances and perspective of the user requires more attention. Designers of abortion information pages online need to ensure that information about access is relevant to the jurisdiction in which users are based.

AB We investigated the associations between negative life events, social support, depressive and hostile symptoms, and suicide risk according to gender in multinational Asian patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). A total of 547 outpatients with MDD (352 women and 195 men, mean age of 39.58 +/- 13.21 years) were recruited in China, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Taiwan. All patients were assessed with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, the Symptoms Checklist 90-Revised, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and the List of Threatening Experiences. Negative life events, social support, depressive symptoms, and hostility were all significantly associated with suicidality in female MDD patients. However, only depressive symptoms and hostility were significantly associated with suicidality in male patients. Depression severity and hostility only partially mediated the association of negative life events and poor social support with suicidality in female patients. In contrast, hostility fully mediated the association of negative life events and poor social support with suicidality in male patients. Our results highlight the need of in-depth assessment of suicide risk for depressed female patients who report a number of negative life events and poor social supports, even if they do not show severe psychopathology.

AB The neuroimmunological kynurenine pathway (KP) has been implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults and adolescents, most recently in suicidality in adults. The KP is initiated by the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which degrades tryptophan (TRP) into kynurenine (KYN) en route to neurotoxins. Here, we examined the KP in 20 suicidal depressed adolescents composed of past attempters and those who expressed active suicidal intent-30 non-suicidal depressed youth, and 22 healthy controls (HC). Plasma levels of TRP, KYN, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA), and KYN/TRP (index of IDO) were assessed. Suicidal adolescents showed decreased TRP and elevated KYN/TRP compared to both non-suicidal depressed adolescents and HC. Findings became more significantly pronounced when excluding medicated participants, wherein there was also a significant positive correlation between KYN/TRP and suicidality. Finally, although depressed adolescents with a history of suicide attempt differed from acutely suicidal adolescents with respect to disease severity, anhedonia, and suicidality, the groups did not differ in KP measures. Our findings suggest a possible specific role of the KP in suicidality in depressed adolescents, while illustrating the clinical phenomenon that depressed adolescents with a history of suicide attempt are similar to acutely suicidal youth and are at increased risk for completion of suicide.

AB Suicidality is more commonly reported among individuals with addictions relative to the general population, though data from Asian countries remain scarce. The medical records of 2187 Singaporean patients with drug (n=879), alcohol (n=754) or gambling (n=554) disorders entering an outpatient treatment service were examined to explore differences in suicidal ideation and lifetime attempts between substance and gambling addictions. The relationship between suicidality, co-morbidity and addiction severity were also examined. 25.0% reported thoughts of suicide in the past month, 11.8% had a suicide plan and 12.2% reported lifetime attempts. Rates of suicidal ideation (thoughts, and plan) but not lifetime attempts were significantly higher among gambling than substance use patients. Co-morbid (DSM-IV axis-1) disorders were found among 32.5%, 38% and 40% of those reporting thoughts, plan and lifetime attempts respectively. Addiction severity was higher and quality of life lower among those reporting suicidal behaviors. Logistic regression revealed co-morbidity, debt, gender (being female) and being a gambling patient as significant predictors of suicidal behaviors. The findings highlight the importance of screening for suicidality, even in the absence of co-morbidity, particularly among gambling disorder patients with debts. Suicide risk should be assessed periodically and referral to suicidal prevention interventions routinely offered to this vulnerable population. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID PATHWAYS; SERVICES; HEALTH
AB Objectives: To investigate the nature and pattern of teenage admissions (13-18yrs) to the 14 adult psychiatric units in Northern Ireland (NI) between 1989 and 1995.
   Method: An analysis of routine hospital data, a review of case-notes at one hospital and in-depth interviews with young people previously admitted to adult inpatient care.
   Results: Sixteen per cent of all under 25s admitted during the six-year period (443/2823) were under 18. There was an increasing trend over time in admissions and re-admissions to hospital. More than half of the teenagers were female and the most common diagnoses included emotional/conduct disorders, 'stress' and neurotic illnesses. Self-harm, substance abuse and exposure to violent/abusive environments or behaviour were the most commonly recorded factors preceding admission. All but one of the small number of people interviewed had attempted suicide prior to admission to hospital.
   Conclusions: The increase in the use of adult inpatient care by young teenagers is of considerable concern but map be unavoidable in the absence of suitable alternatives especially for adolescents at risk of self-harm or suicide. Further research is required to determine the most appropriate and effective service response for this vulnerable group. The findings have important implications for the future development of adolescent mental health services.

AB This study examines the degree to which an eating disorder (ED) is associated with the recurrence and severity of suicide attempts, non-suicidal self-injury, rates of co-occurring Axis I and II disorders, and psychosocial functioning among Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) outpatients. A group of 135 treatment-seeking women with BPD were assessed using structured clinical interviews. BPD was assessed using the International Personality Disorders Examination, confirmed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)-II, and Axis I disorders were assessed with the SCID I. A total of 17.8% of the sample met criteria fora current ED, with 6.7% meeting criteria for Anorexia Nervosa (AN), 5.9% for Bulimia Nervosa (BN), and 5.2% for Binge-Eating Disorder (BED). In this BPD sample, in the last year, current BN was associated with a significantly greater risk of recurrent suicide attempts while current AN was associated with increased risk of recurrent non-suicidal self-injury. BPD with current AN or BED was associated with a greater number of non-ED current Axis I disorders. Further replication of these results is needed. Women with BPD must be assessed for AN and BN as these diagnoses may confer greater risk for suicidal and self-injurious behavior and may have to be prioritized in treatment.

AB Suicide constitutes a significant public health burden as global suicide rates continue to increase. Thus, it is crucial to identify malleable suicide risk factors to develop prevention protocols. Anxiety sensitivity, or a fear of anxiety-related sensations, is a potential malleable risk factor for the development of suicidal ideation. The Depression-Distress Amplification Model (DDAM) posits that the anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns (ASCC) subfactor interacts with depressive symptoms to amplify the effects of depression and lead to suicidal ideation. The current study tested the DDAM across the two most widely-replicated factors of depressive symptoms (cognitive and affective/somatic) in comparison to a risk factor mediation model where ASCC are related to suicidal ideation via depressive symptoms. Participants included 295 clinical outpatients from a community clinic. The interaction between ASCC and depressive symptoms in the prediction of suicidal ideation was not significant for either cognitive or affective/somatic symptoms of depression. However, results revealed a significant indirect effect of ASCC through cognitive symptoms of depression in the prediction of suicidal ideation. These cross sectional findings are not consistent with the DDAM. Rather, the relationship may be better conceptualized with a model in which ASCC is related to suicidal ideation via cognitive symptoms of depression. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Several lines of evidence suggest that suicidal behavior is associated with altered noradrenergic neurotransmission. Noradrenaline (NA) is catabolized by monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and cathecol-O-methyl transferase (COMT). We hypothesized that the genes encoding MAOA and COMT might contain genetic variation conferring increased risk for attempted suicide. In order to test this hypothesis, we genotyped the 941T > G and the promoter VNTR polymorphisms in the MAOA gene and the Val 108/158 Met COMT polymorphism in 305 families with at least one member having bipolar disorder (BD). No association with history of suicide attempt was found either in the MAOA polymorphisms (VNTR:LRS = 1.90, d.f. = 1, p = 0. 16; 941T > G:LRS = 1.39, d.f. = 1, p = 0.23), or with the Val 158 Met polymorphism (LRS = 1.61, d.f. = 1, p = 0.20). When we performed the haplotype analysis for MAOA gene, we found no association between suicide attempt and haplotype distribution (LRS = 3.07, d.f. = 2, p = 0.21). As both genes are involved in degrading noradreanline, we also tested the hypothesis of epistasis between MAOA polymorphisms and Val158Met, however, no additive effect was found in conferring risk for suicide attempt. These findings suggest that MAOA and COMT genes may not influence suicidal behavior in patients with bipolar disorder. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Childhood-onset mood disorders (COMD) are serious affective disorders with deleterious developmental sequelae including interpersonal dysfunction, psychotic symptoms and suicidal behavior. The current study examines 10 markers from two early-immediate genes for association with COMD and suicide attempt (SA) - HOMER1 and human neuronal pentraxin II (NPTX2). We examined individuals diagnosed with COMD versus matched controls, as well as individuals with COMD and a history of at least one lifetime SA versus COMD participants with no history of SA. No significant genotypic association was noted between any of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and COMD. Our sample yielded a nominally significant allelic association between the HOMER1 rs7713917 SNP and COMD. We report significant genotype associations between HOMER1 rs2290639 and SA, and between NPTX2 markers rs705315 and rs1681248 and SA, findings that remained statistically significant after multiple test correction. A three-way interaction was observed among HOMER1 rs4704560, rs2290639 and NPTX2 rs705318. The associations we describe for HOMER1 and NPTX2 with SA should be considered preliminary until replicated.

AB In mental health care, both clinical and scientific decisions are based on within-subject comparisons of test scores on the same self-report questionnaire at different points in time. To establish the validity of test score comparisons over time, longitudinal measurement invariance should be established. The current study tested whether the 19 item Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS) is measurement invariant (MI) over time. As the first five items of the scale are often used to screen for the presence of suicidal thoughts, we also tested a model consisting of only the first five items. Psychiatric in- and out-patients (n=475) completed the questionnaire upon admission and after 3 months. By means of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) we tested whether the parameters of a single factor model were equal over time. All fit indices indicated that both the 19-item questionnaire and the five-item screener were measurement invariant over time. This means that changes in test-scores over time can be attributed to true changes in the construct of interest. These findings legitimate the use of the 19 item scale and the five-item screener in longitudinal assessments. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB We report the strategy that we employed to identify the perpetrator of a suicide car bombing in front of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, on 9 September 2004. The bomb was so massive that only small tissue pieces of the perpetrator Could be recovered, preventing conventional approach to the identification of the bomber, necessitating the introduction of DNA analysis as the primary means for perpetrator identification. Crime scene investigation revealed the trajectory of the bomb blast, which was used to guide the collection of charred tissue fragments of the perpetrator. Mitochondrial DNA analysis was first conducted on 17 tissue fragments, recovered over large areas of the trajectory to, (a) confirm that they are of a common Source, i.e. the perpetrator, and thus (b) establish the mtDNA HV1 sequence profile of the perpetrator. The mtDNA of the perpetrator matches that of a maternally related family member of one of four suspects. Standard autosomal STR analysis confirmed the identification. This case is of interest as an illustration Of a Successful application of DNA analysis as the primary means of disaster perpetrator identification. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

DE fatal railway collisions; injury patterns; hit categories; train's speed
AB The autopsy findings in fatal cases of railway collisions of the, Bonn Institute of Legal Medicine in 1992-1999 were investigated and compared to the statements in the investigation files of the public prosecutor with regard to classification as accident or suicide as well as with regard to type and speed of collision. Of the 38 deaths, 10 were hit in an upright position, 11 fatal collisions affected persons lying outside the track and 13 were hit and overrun lying inside the track. According to the investigation classification 21 persons committed suicide (56%), while 10 died in an accident (26%). Our survey confirmed the leading role of being over-rolled in a lying position as an indication for suicides, while in accidents the upright hit was most important. With exception of the persons primarily affected between the rails in upright position and over-rolled consecutively an unequivocal assignment of injury patterns to the hit categories was possible. In cases of persons being primarily over-rolled in a lying position especially the criteria (i) opening of body cavities, (ii) or-an injuries and (iii) loss of parts of the body allowed for careful conclusion on hit, respectively, overrunning speed.

AB Objective: To examine associations of cannabis and other illicit drug use with depression, suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts over a two year period during adolescence.
   Methods: Nine hundred and seventy-six school students in four high schools in northern Nova Scotia, Canada, were surveyed in grade 10 and followed up in grade 12. Assessments of past 30 day cannabis and illicit drug use as well as mental health variables (risk of depression, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts) were obtained at baseline (2000 and 2001) and follow-up two years later (2002 and 2003). Generalized estimating-equations modelled depression, suicidal ideation and attempts among illicit drug users and non-users.
   Results: Illicit drug use with or without cannabis use was significantly associated with higher odds of depression, suicidal ideation and suicide attempt. Heavy cannabis use alone predicted depression but not suicidal ideation or attempt.
   Conclusions: Illicit drug use, with and without accompanying cannabis use, among high school students increases the risk of depression, suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts. Heavy cannabis use alone predicts depression but not suicidal ideation or attempts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This retrospective study from Western Norway is based on the cases of 196 homicide victims from 1985 to 2009. The median age of the victims was 35 years, in both genders. Within the cases, 113 of the victims were male and 83 female, 28 victims were under the age of 18, and 19 victims were not native Norwegians.
   Ethanol was detected in the blood of a higher proportion of male compared to female victims, whereas a higher proportion of female compared to male victims had both illegal/legal drugs detected in their blood. Most perpetrators were male. Men were most often killed by an acquaintance, women by their present or former intimate partner. In 14 cases of intimate partner homicide the perpetrator committed suicide after killing their female partner. The dominant scene of crime was private homes. Most victims were killed by blunt force, sharp force or gunshot. The head was the body region most often injured in the homicide victims. Female victims were more often killed by manual strangulation than male victims. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Philemon and Baucis death; Double deaths; Married couples; Natural
   death; Homicide-suicide
ID SUDDEN-DEATH
AB When two human corpses are found in temporal and locational context the assumption of a non-natural cause of death is close at hand. Suicide, extended suicide, homicide or accident (particularly with carbon monoxide) come to mind. When, however, a natural cause of death emerges for both after autopsy and further examinations, this provokes the question whether this incidence is coincidental.
   In our two presented cases, a married couple each was found dead together. In both cases, the wife needed nursing and was being cared for by a husband who died of cardiac disease shortly before the wife died. In one case, the wife died of acute uncompensated chronic congestive heart failure. In the other case, the cause of death of the wife was hypovolemic shock due to acute gastrointestinal bleeding from recurrent gastric mucosal erosion. It is to be discussed for both cases whether, given the pre-existing illness, the acute stress of the situation in view to the husbands' death may at least have favored the occurrence of death and may, thus, have led to the criminologically conspicuous situation of finding.

AB Studies have suggested that psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) are associated with behavioral problems in adolescents. The aim of this study was to investigate relationships between domains of PLEs, suicidal ideation, and depression in a large community sample of adolescents. The sample consisted of 8096 Korean subjects (3184 boys and 4912 girls) aged 14 to 19 years. The level of PLEs, depression, and suicidal ideation were assessed by the Eppendorf schizophrenia inventory (ESI), Beck's depression inventory, and Beck's scale for suicidal ideation, respectively. Both the level of depression and suicidal ideation were significantly associated with PLEs. Among the four domains of the ESI, the deviant perception, ideas of reference, and auditory uncertainty were associated with the suicidal ideation. Additionally, subjects with more PLEs had significantly more suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms. PLEs in adolescents are associated with potential risk of suicide and depressive symptoms significantly mediated the association between suicidal ideation and PLEs. The presence of perceptual disturbances, ideas of reference, and depression may be regarded as warning signs for suicide-related behaviors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cholecystokinin (CCK), a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS), co-exists in a large portion of A10 dopamine neurons to exert some effect on dopamine behavior. The aim of this study was to determine whether any association exists between the genotype of CCK gene promoter regions (-45C/T and -196G/A) and suicidal behavior. Genotypes and allele frequencies of CCK -45C/T and -196G/A were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis on the genomic DNA from selected suicide victims (N = 154) and from control subjects (N=328). Statistical analysis was performed using the Mantel-Haesnzel chi(2)-test and multiple logistic regression analysis with distinction of gender. An association between CCK -196G/A polymorphism and suicidal behavior in Japanese males was confirmed by statistical analysis (Odds ratio: 3.462, 95% CI: 1.128-10.626, P = 0.038 by multiple logistic regression analysis). However, a significant association between CCK -196G/A polymorphism and suicidal behavior was not discovered in females. The polymorphism of the CCK gene promoter region was found to represent a susceptibility factor for suicidal behavior in Japanese males. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A 39-year-old male, with a history of multiple suicidal attempts and psychiatric pathology, a professional lumberjack, was found dead at the meadow with his throat cut and a chainsaw beside him. Autopsy revealed that all physical injuries were confined to the head, neck and left shoulder. Two major (long and wide) wounds were found and documented on both sides of the neck and head. A wound on the posterior and right lateral side of his neck and head was noted. Medical examiner noted an irregular rupture on the posterior-right side of the atlanto-occipital joint with impaired bone, but without any damage on the spinal cord. Another gaping cut was noted in the lower part on the left lateral side of his neck. Medical examiner noted that muscles of the left side of the neck, left common carotid artery, left internal jugular vein and left vagus nerve were completely cut off. The body of the C5 and C6 vertebra, with the spinal cord at that level, was completely cut. Also, there were multiple linear and striped parallel abrasions on the outer side of the left shoulder and one abrasion on the left lateral side of the neck. The conclusion of inquiries was "suicide by chainsaw". (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of the present study was to examine the relative association of genetic and environmental factors with individual differences in each of the proximal, jointly necessary, and sufficient causes for suicidal behavior, according to the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS; joiner, 2005). We examined data on derived scales measuring acquired capability, belongingness, and burdensomeness (the determinants of suicidal behavior, according to theory) from 348 adolescent male twins. Univariate biometrical models were used to estimate the magnitude of additive genetic (A), non-additive genetic (D), shared environmental (C), and non-shared environmental (E) effects associated with the variance in acquired capability, belongingness, and burdensomeness. The best fitting model for the acquired capability allowed for additive genetic and environmental effects, whereas the best fitting model for burdensomeness and belongingness allowed for shared and non-shared environmental effects. The present research extends prior work by specifying the environmental and genetic contributions to the components of the IPTS, and our findings suggest that belongingness and burdensomeness may be more appropriate targets for clinical intervention than acquired capability as these factors may be more malleable or amenable to change.

   SCALE
AB Aim: Individuals with first-episode psychosis, like those with chronic psychotic disorders, are at elevated risk for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. However, relatively little is known about suicidality among first-episode patients prior to their initial presentation for treatment. This analysis was designed as a US-based examination of recent findings on prior suicide attempts from Dublin, Ireland, here focusing on prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideation during the weeks prior to initial treatment-seeking Methods: Participants included 109 first-episode inpatients with primary psychotic disorders in public-sector settings that serve an urban, lowincome, socially disadvantaged, predominantly African American population. Eligible patients had received < 3 months of prior antipsychotic treatment and had not been hospitalized for psychosis > 3 months prior to the index admission, though most were completely treatment na ve. Assessments included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia, Birchwood Insight Scale, and a rigorous method for determining age at onset of first psychotic symptoms and duration of untreated psychosis. Results: Disconcertingly, nearly one quarter of patients (23%) endorsed a history of suicidal ideation in the 2 weeks prior to first admission. In the model designed to replicate the prior study in Ireland, Calgary Depression score (calculated omitting hopelessness and suicidal ideation as these were separate variables in the analysis) was a predictor of suicidal ideation (P < 0.01). In separate bivariate analyses analogous to the original study, two domains of insight were associated with suicidal ideation. Conclusions: Findings suggest that depression, insight, and suicidality should be carefully monitored among first-episode patients initiating treatment and during the early course of illness. As insight improves, coping strategies should be enhanced with a goal of minimizing depression and preventing suicidality.

AB Our aim was to investigate the association between alcohol dependence and suicidal behavior among adolescent girls and boys suffering from conduct disorder (CD). The original study sample consisted of 387 adolescents (age 12-17) admitted to psychiatric inpatient care between April 2001 and May 2005. DSM-IV-based psychiatric diagnoses and variables measuring suicidal behavior were obtained from the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children-Present and Lifetime (KSADS-PL). Of the total study population, 59 adolescent girls and 82 boys had CD according to DSM-IV criteria. Of all adolescents with CD, 24 (40.7%) girls and 24 (29.3%) boys were suffering from alcohol dependence. Among girls with CD, alcohol dependence increased the risk for suicide attempts up to 3.8-fold (95% CI 1.1-13.4). Among boys with CD, alcohol dependence increased the risk for life-threatening suicide attempt over nine-fold (95% CI 1.2-80.1). In addition, the risk for self-mutilative behavior was as high as 3.9-fold (95% CI 1.1-13.8) among girls and 5.3-fold (95% CI 1.1-26.5) among boys. The results indicate that, among adolescents suffering from CD, the risk of suicidal behavior is considerably increased by co-morbid alcohol dependence, which should therefore be carefully taken into account in clinical work.

AB The Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ) is widely used for the assessment of depression in adolescents. The main aim of this study was to examine the concurrent and predictive validity of a composite of four MFQ items related to suicidal ideation using an interview measure of suicidal ideation. A prospective 3-wave high-risk study of offspring of parents with recurrent depression was used including 294 families where children were initially aged 9-17 years. Measures included four parent and child rated MFQ items assessing suicide-related ideation (referred to here as the "MFQ-SI") and a clinically-defined interview measure of suicidal ideation. A parent-child combined MFQ-SI subscale performed well as a screening tool against the interview measure of suicidal ideation (baseline area under the curve (AUC) (95% CI):0.92 (0.85-1.00)). Longitudinally, this measure showed reasonable predictive validity against future suicidal ideation (AUC (95% CI):0.73 (0.58-0.88)). Lastly, there was evidence that a child-rated MFQ-SI scale performed better than a parent-rated one in detecting concurrent suicidal ideation. Longitudinally, both parent and child scales showed reasonable predictive validity against future suicidal ideation. In summary, a brief screen using four MFQ items related to suicidal ideation performs well in identifying concurrent and future suicidal ideation in high-risk adolescents.

AB We present the as yet unresolved case of the death by gunshot wound of a 21-year-old student from a recent local inspection. It was reported that the daughter of the house had been shot through the window while she was washing the dishes. Slight discrepancies were noted in the statements of the family, who are very religious. The firearm, projectile and cartridge have not been found despite an intensive search. The daughter and the mother tested positive for traces of gunpowder on their hands, while in the case of the son traces were found on his hands and on his vest. That the trajectory of the projectile was from the kitchen outwards was established on the basis of a small hole in the inner pane of the kitchen window and a larger hole in the outer pane. The shot passed through the victim's cheek and the neck. The entrance wound (aditus) on the right cheek had complementary features characteristic of a gunshot from a short-barrelled firearm at relative proximity. The shot passed through the left jugular vein and the left internal carotid artery. The exit wound (exitus) was slightly larger and of irregular shape.
   The family chose a traditional burial. The mother and son did not present themselves for polygraph testing. A charge was filed against the mother of the deceased. Emphasis was placed on the scene investigation.

AB This study set out to explore the frequency and correlates of suicidal ideation in a community sample of school-aged adolescents living in a northeastern area of Italy. The study involved a mixed male-female sample of 1000 adolescents. corresponding to 10% of the young population aged 15-19 in the district. We investigated psychological distress through the revised Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R), from which we also derived our indicators on suicidality (items concerning hopelessness and suicidal ideation). Propensity to aggression was measured with an Italian version of the Aggression Questionnaire. Females scored significantly higher than males on all SCL-90-R subscales, with the exception of the hostility subscale. In our sample, 30.8% of females and 25.3% of males reported having thought about suicide; one adolescent out of 20 reported suicidal ideation of high intensity (5% out of the total sample in both (genders). Males scored significantly higher than females on the Aggression Questionnaire. Both males and females who reported suicidal feelings had significantly higher scores on the Aggression Questionnaire than did those who denied suicidal ideation. Suicidal ideation is a rather widespread occurrence among adolescents and correlates with other indicators of psychological distress. Psychological distress in adolescence might also be expressed through turbulent behaviors and conduct disorders. Identification of the mental disorders underlying a higher propensity to aggression might help to prevent other negative outcomes such as suicide. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID INGESTION
AB An uncommon suicide by oral ingestion of potassium cyanide salts and contemporaneous inhalation of hydrogen cyanide is presented. A 48-year-old tradesman was found dead sitting in his car. A penetrating odor of bitter almonds was noticed when opening the doors. A camping stove and a cooking pot containing large amounts of dark blue crystals were found in the footwell of the car. White powder adhered to his fingers and to the area around the mouth. Furthermore bottles containing potassium ferrocyanide and different kinds of acid and leach were found in the car together with internet information about, e. g. potassium ferrocyanide and potassium cyanide.
   At autopsy hemorrhages and erosions of the mucosa of the respiratory tract, esophagus and stomach were found. Concentrations of cyanide were 0.2 mg/l in stomach contents, 0.96 mg/kg in brain tissue, 2.79 mg/kg in lungs, and 5.3 mg/l in blood.
   The white and toxic powder potassium cyanide was formed by heating of the yellow crystals of potassium ferrocyanide on the camping stove. This powder was probably ingested orally. Addition of acid converted the salt into the highly toxic gas hydrogen cyanide. Oxidation with atmospheric oxygen built the dark blue ferrous compound Prussian blue.
   This case report of a person who was not familiar with chemicals demonstrates the acquisition of professional information via the internet, enabling a suicide with a complex procedure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study is to evaluate biological factors associated with recent suicidal attempts in a naturalistic sample. A total of 439 patients suffering from major depression disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and psychotic disorders (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and psychosis not otherwise specified), who were consecutively assessed in the Emergency Department of an Italian Hospital (January 2008-December 2009), were included. In the whole sample, suicide attempters and non-attempters differed with regard to free triiodothyronine (FT3) and prolactin values only. A univariate general linear model indicated significant effects of sex (F-1;379=9.29; P=0.002), suicidal status (F-1;379=4.49; P=0.04) and the interaction between sex and suicidal status (F-1;379=5.17; P=0.02) on prolactin levels. A multinomial logistic regression model indicated that suicidal attempters were 2.27 times (odds ratio (OR)=0.44; 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.23/0.82; P=0.01) less likely to have higher FT3 values than non-attempters; while prolactin values failed to reach statistical significance (OR=0.99; 95%CI: 0.98/1.00; P=0.051). Both prolactin and thyroid hormones may be involved in a complex compensatory mechanism to correct reduced central serotonin activity. Further studies may help in understanding how these findings can be used by clinicians in assessing suicide risk. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide gene therapy could be an attractive addition to the treatment of ovarian carcinomas, for which acquired chemoresistance frequently results in treatment failure. Here we show that transfection of the HSV-tk gene, followed by incubation with up to 1 mM ganciclovir fails to induce cell death in SKOV3 chemoresistant human ovarian carcinoma cells. However, co-transfection of HSV-tk with Cip1/Waf1 encoding the p21(cip1/waf1) inhibitor of cdks, allows 100 muM ganciclovir to eradicate the population of tumor cells. Potentiation of a drug by co-transfer of HSV-tk with Cip1/Waf1 could thus represent another therapeutic approach for tumours that are resistant to conventional therapy. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

ID NORTHERN-IRELAND; HEALTH
AB Background: Financial sector workers interface with indebted clients, who may be distressed and have heightened vulnerability to suicidality. Aim(s): This study examined the experiences of 10 Irish financial sector workers who had experiences of encountering distressed clients who discuss suicide. Method: Semistructured interviews (open-ended questions) were used. Results: Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) identified four themes, namely: (1) avoidance versus confrontation of reality (management of the debt); (2) role conflict (recovering the debt vs. supporting the client); (3) emotional impact and distancing from clients (coping with concerns for client welfare); (4) desire for support (practical and emotional training and support needs). Limitations: The frequency with which such clients were encountered was not assessed. Conclusion: These themes demonstrate the need to provide support to this group, and also the difficulties in providing training to manage suicidal clients in a context where the staff member's goal is to recover debt.

ID HEMORRHAGES; BONDAGE; TONGUE
AB When a body is found in suspended position, not only suicidal hanging has to be considered but also an accident or homicide. These alternatives and the criteria to be applied for their differentiation were already extensively discussed in the old medico-legal literature. Nevertheless, it is still a challenge for detectives and forensic experts to prove a homicidal assault when a suspended body is found. In the presented case, the findings collected at the scene and during autopsy seemed to be consistent with the assumption of suicide at first and the case has only been elucidated by supplementary inquiries and a secondary evaluation of the photos taken at the scene and during the autopsy.

AB Falls from high places, such as from a building, are frequently encountered in suicides, in some accidents, and sometimes in homicides. In this study, we evaluated the demographic data, mortality rates, fall causes, and post-mortem findings of individuals who fell from heights.
   Our cases were collected retrospectively from the files of the Branch of the Council of Forensic Medicine in Diyarbakir between 1996 and 2001.
   There were 431 accidental and 53 suicidal deaths due to blunt injury resulting from falls. Of the victims, 188 were female and 296 were male. The average age of the 484 victims was 27.05 years (range: 4 months-100 years). For buildings, the height ranged from 3 to 8 storeys for suicides and from 1 to 8 storeys for accidents. We proceeded to analyse the characteristics of accidental falls as follows. The majority of falls were from balconies or rooftops due to the tendency of people to sit and sleep on these places during the hotter months of the year. Some 54.5% of all falls occurred in May-August. The 53 suicidal jumps all occurred off buildings. The victims ranged in age from 15 to 70 years, and comprised 29 women and 24 men. One of the deceased jumped from the roof of a school in which he was boarding, and another from the seventh storey of a hospital in which he was receiving treatment. The remaining 51 jumped from heights ranging from 3 to 8 storeys. Psychiatric illness was reported in 18 (33.9%) of the suicide deaths, while 10 (18.8%) of the 53 suicides were single women.
   The results of this study were at variance with literature data with respect to the following: falls from heights were most common in the 0-5 year age group, females had a higher suicide rate than males, and the majority of accidental falls occurred at home rather than in the workplace.

AB A 23-year-old man was found on a raised hide in lying position, the head wrapped in a plastic bag connected with a helium gas cylinder by a polypropylene tube. The autopsy did not show any specific findings nor did the routine toxicological analysis reveal significant information regarding the cause of death (BAC 0.9 mg/g, diphenhydramine 0.81 mu g/ml in heart serum). For the detection of helium in the lungs, gas samples from both lungs were collected by a method ensuring minimal dilution. Gas analyses were per-formed using a GC-MS with a split-splitless injector and a headspace syringe. As carrier gas the commonly used helium was replaced by nitrogen. Helium was found in clearly elevated concentrations in gas samples from both lungs. Therefore, suffocation by breathing helium enriched, and thus oxygen deficient atmosphere, can strongly be assumed as the cause of death. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study examined the association between lifetime non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and current suicidal ideation among Iraq/Afghanistan veterans. NSSI was positively associated with passive, active, and concurrent active-passive suicidal ideation at the bivariate level. NSSI remained a predictor of active, OR=5.15, and concurrent active-passive suicidal ideation, OR=7.01, when other risk factors were considered. These findings suggest that NSSI may be a particularly useful marker of active suicidal ideation among veterans. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB This study examined the association between trauma exposure, PTSD, suicide attempts, and other psychopathology among 316 racially/ethnically diverse HIV-infected men and women who underwent semistructured psychiatric assessment. In addition, the role of psychological resilience in trauma exposure was examined in the context of neurological symptoms and functional status. Nearly half (47.8%; 151/316) of the participants reported trauma exposure, of which 47.0% (71/151) developed PTSD. Among trauma-exposed individuals, those with a current psychiatric diagnosis reported more neurological symptoms and lower functional status. Trauma exposure without PTSD was associated with a higher rate of panic disorder and substance-induced mental disorders. Trauma-exposed individuals who did not develop PTSD were less likely than those who reported no tram-ha exposure to meet criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Trauma exposure, MDD, borderline personality disorder, and substance-induced mental disorders were independently associated with increased odds of suicide attempt. These results indicate that co-morbid psychiatric disorders are common among trauma exposed individuals with a history of PTSD, but those with trauma exposure who do not develop PTSD are less likely to experience MDD. The role of other co-morbid psychopathologies in the genesis of suicidal behavior among individuals living with HIV deserves further study. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Impulsivity appears to play an important role in suicidal behaviors and drug abuse, which are two psychiatric problems that may interact with one another. Interpretation of the literature on impulsivity in these behaviors may be complicated by the variety of measurement techniques for the assessment of impulsivity. There are three general types of impulsivity assessment: self-report, biological, and laboratory behavioral. Because laboratory behavioral measures both meet an operational definition of impulsivity and are sensitive to state-dependent changes in impulsivity, this paper presents data that focuses on laboratory behavioral performance among samples emitting suicidal behaviors or substance abuse. To better account for influence of impulsivity in these psychiatric disturbances, no single source of measurement should be used without the consideration of other types of instruments.

AB Serotonin receptors, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors (HTRs), play a role in individuals' vulnerability to major depressive disorders (MDDs) and/or suicide attempts. In the first part of the study, we recruited 789 Taiwanese participants, which included 285 MDD patients, 191 MDD patients with a history of suicide attempts (MS), and 313 controls. The three groups were genotyped to identify HTR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and we analyzed the correlations among the three groups. In the second part of the study, which involved a functional test of HTR1B allelic and haplotype variants, another 113 MDD patients were recruited. The rs6298-T allele was more frequent in the MS group than in the control group. The rsl 923885-T allele occurred more frequently in the MS group than in the MDD group. Carriers of haplotype GT were estimated to have a 1.774-fold higher risk of suicide attempts. Younger age, alleles rs6296-C, rs6298-T and rs1923885-C, and haplotype CT were associated with a greater risk of MDD. Haplotypes GC and GT were directly associated with a lower risk of suicidal ideation. Haplotypes GC and GT also associated with higher levels of HTR1B mRNA, and haplotype GC was associated with extraversion, which caused a lower risk of suicidal ideation. The rs6296-C allele have directly and indirectly influenced a greater risk of suicidal ideation, which mediated by its negative effect on extraversion. Haplotype GT can be used to identify patients with a higher risk of suicide attempts. The rs6296-C allele lowered the level of HTRIB mRNA, causing individuals with MDD to display more hostility and aggressive behavior, which may lead to suicidal ideation.

AB The role of 5-HTFLPR and 5-HT2C Cys23Ser polymorphisms in the psychopathology of mood disorders and suicide behavior is controversial. The aim of present study was to investigate the association between 5-HTFLPR and 5-HT2C Cys23Ser variants and susceptibility to bipolar I disorder (BID). The 5-HT2C genotypes were studied in 152 patients with BID and 173 gender- and age-matched healthy individuals with Kurds ethnic background from Western Iran using PCR and PCR-RFLP methods. In recessive model (SS vs. LL+LS) the SS genotype was associated with 1.79-fold increased risk of BID (p = 0.018). Also, the presence of S allele increased the risk of adult-onset BID by 1.76-fold (p = 0.027). No association was detected between 5-HTTLPR genotypes and alleles with suicide attempt. The frequency of 5-HT2C Ser allele in patients and controls were 12.3 and 12.5%, respectively. Mutant allele of HT2C Ser had higher frequency in female (14.7%) than male (10.5%, p = 0.27) patients. The frequency of HT2C Ser allele in patients with a family history of BID tended to be higher (15.7%) than those without a family history of the disease (11.8%). The frequency of HT2C Ser allele in suicide attempter women was higher (16.7%) than those without a suicide attempt (14.3%). Our findings demonstrate 5-HTTLPR polymorphism might be a risk factor for BID and adult-onset BID in Kurds population. However, we found the lack of an association between 5-HT2C Cys/Ser variants and the risk of BID. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of self-mutilation (SM) in Turkish male substance-dependent patients, and to investigate the relationship of SM with childhood abuse and neglect, alexithymia and temperament and character dimensions of personality.
   Methods: Participants were 136 consecutively admitted males with substance dependence (96 alcohol and 40 drug). Substance dependence was diagnosed by means of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I), Turkish version. Patients were investigated with the childhood abuse and neglect questionnaire, Toronto alexithymia scale (TAS-20) and temperament and character inventory (TCI).
   Results: Among substance-dependent patients 34.6% was considered as a group with SM. Rates of being single and unemployed, histories of physical and sexual abuse and suicide attempts were higher in the SM group. Current age, age at first substance use and age at regular substance use were lower in the group with SM. Mean of TAS-20 and 'difficulty in identifying feelings' (DIF) and 'difficulty in describing feelings' (DDF) subscales of TAS-20 were higher in SM group. There were no significant differences between groups in terms of TCI subscales. Age, childhood physical abuse and suicide attempt history predicted SM in logistic regression.
   Conclusions: Young substance users with childhood physical abuse histories could be the target population to prevent self-mutilating behavior. This study also suggests that whenever self-mutilating behavior is present, the possibility of childhood abuse, alexithymia and suicide attempts must be evaluated. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Patients with schizophrenia have an increased lifetime risk of comorbid obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Up to 30% of these patients experience such symptoms and 12% may be diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder. The presence of these symptoms in schizophrenia seems to be associated with poor outcomes including a greater suicidal risk. A subgroup of patients develops this symptomatology after the initiation with Second Generation Antipsychotics (SGA). Also, there is evidence of a causal relationship for this association, particularly for clozapine. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the association of this comorbidity with suicidality in a population of clozapine-medicated schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients (N=65). The prevalence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in our sample was 29.2% (N=19) and the prevalence of obsessive-compulsive disorder was 13.8% (N=9). Significant positive correlations between suicidality and total Y-BOCS score and between Y-BOCS score and depressive symptoms were found. Further analysis indicated that a Y-BOCS score greater or equal than 8 was an independent predictor of suicide attempt during clozapine treatment. Routine screening for this adverse event should be warranted for this population. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Self-harm is the most robust risk for completed suicide. There is a lack of understanding of why some people who self-harm escalate to suicidal behaviour when others do not. Psychological factors such as attachment, self-forgiveness and self-appraisal may be important. To determine whether factors from the Interpersonal Theory and Schematic Appraisals models are useful to identify suicidal behaviour in populations that self-harm. Specifically we investigate whether resilience factors of secure attachment, self-forgiveness and positive self-appraisals significantly influence suicidality in people who self-harm. A cross-sectional online study of 323 participants recruited from self-harm support forum. Validated self report measures were used to assess appraisals, relationships, self-forgiveness, attachment style, suicidality and self-harm. Emotion coping and support seeking self-appraisals and self-forgiveness were negatively associated with suicidality in participants with a history of self-harm. Dismissing attachment was positively associated with suicidality. The perceived ability to cope with emotions, the perceived ability to gain support and self-forgiveness may protect against suicide in people who self-harm. Conversely the presence of dismissing attachment may increase the risk of suicidality. Findings provide therapeutic targets to reduce risk of suicidality in this high risk group.

ID PENETRATING CARDIAC INJURIES; WOUNDS
AB Gunshot wounds in the heart are frequent suicidal injuries, especially in men. Most of them are lethal, but some cases of survival due to immediate and proper surgical treatment are reported. However, survival without specific treatment is extremely rare.
   In our case, a 44-year man attempted suicide by home-made shooting device. A special 12 cm long and 2.5 mm wide needle-like missile entered his body at the left anterior part of his chest, passed through the heart and lower lobe of right lung and exited at the right side of his back. The patient was able to move normally and he also looked for medical help immediately after attempting suicide. We found large atypical-shaped entrance wound on the anterior part of the chest, which was surgically treated, and tiny pointed exit wound under the right scapula. The patient was stable from cardio-circulatory and respiratory aspects from the time of admission to discharge from the hospital. We found only minimal pericardial bleeding (up to 10 turn thick) and there was no need for surgical intervention. In the next 2 weeks the haematoma absorbed spontaneously. The gunshot injury healed without any complication. Paranoid psychosis was diagnosed by psychiatrist and this probably had been the cause of attempting suicide.
   We think that the favorable outcome of the proved heart gunshot injury in our patient was due to the needle-shaped low-energy missile, which caused only tiny gunshot (stab) hole in the heart. Such a heart injury caused only minimal bleeding into the pericardial sac without heart tamponade. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study sought to explore the impact of smoking reduction on suicidality (suicide ideation and behaviour) among people with a psychotic disorder (n=235) who participated in a randomized trial of a healthy lifestyle intervention trial. Suicidality, measured by item -4 of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) was the main variable of interest. Measures were collected by research assistants blind to treatment allocation at baseline, at 15 weeks (mid-intervention) and 12 months after baseline. Mediation analysis, adjusted for confounders, was used to determine the relationship between smoking reduction and suicidality and to explore whether this was mediated through depression. At 12 months, smoking reduction was found to be significantly associated with suicidality change; an association was also seen between smoking reduction and depression and depression and suicidality. After adjusting for depression, the association between smoking reduction and suicidality was attenuated but remained statistically significant; the proportion of the total effect that was mediated through depression was 30%. There was no significant association between suicidality and treatment group (vs. controls) over time. Our study suggests that smoking interventions may have benefits over and above those for improved physical health, by reducing suicidal ideation in people with psychosis.

AB Several theories posit a direct role of impulsivity in suicidal behavior. The interpersonal-psychological theory of suicidal behavior (IPTS) argues that the relationship between impulsivity and suicidal behavior is explained by the painful and/or provocative experiences (PPEs) often encountered by impulsive individuals. It thus seems plausible that nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), itself associated with impulsivity, might account for the relationship between impulsivity and suicidal behavior. We examined data from 93 adult inpatients (54.8% male) seeking treatment for substance use disorders. Patients completed a structured interview assessing prior suicidal behavior and a series of self-report questionnaires examining impulsivity, NSSI, and psychopathology. Four impulsivity dimensions (negative urgency, positive urgency, lack of premeditation, lack of perseverance) Were associated with lifetime number of suicide attempts and/or suicide potential. Furthermore, results supported our hypotheses, as all but one relation was better accounted for by NSSI and, in the one exception, the direct effect was non-significant. Findings are consistent with the IPTS and suggest that suicidal behavior may not be a direct manifestation of impulsivity, but facilitated through exposure to PPEs capable of altering an individual's relationship to pain and fear of death.

AB This case report describes a death attributed to the intake of the pyrethroid insecticides, alphacypermethrin and deltamethrin, and the antidepressant mirtazapine. The autopsy findings showed absence of external traumatic injuries and internal generalized visceral congestion, edema and cyanosis. The toxicological results revealed the presence of a toxic concentration of mirtazapine ( 12.5 mg/L and 10.7 mg/L in blood and urine, respectively) and high concentrations of pyrethroids (2.46 mg/L alphacypermethrin and 2.40 mg/L deltamethrin in blood, and 0.41 mg/L alpha-cypermethrin and 0.46 mg/L deltamethrin in urine, respectively). Blood ethanol concentration was 0.75g/L. All the evidence - from autopsy, police investigation and toxicology - was consistent with the intentional self-harm of the deceased. The current case was determined and recorded as a poisoning suicide. Cause of death of the deceased was reported as the synergistic toxicity of the ingested pyrethroids and mirtazapine. The presence of a significant blood ethanol concentration was considered a secondary contributory factor to the fatal outcome. The case presented herein is the first death attributed to poisoning from ingestion of pyrethroids in combination with mirtazapine, with the intention of the victim to cause self-harm, with corresponding toxicology results.

AB The presence of a comorbid eating disorder (ED) and personality disorder (PD) is associated with greater problems and poorer functioning than having an ED alone or PD alone. This pattern is also found for non-ED axis I disorders and PDs. This study aims to examine if an ED, compared to other non-ED axis I disorders, in a PD sample confers greater risks for: number and type of non-ED axis I and axis II disorders, suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-injury, and poorer psychosocial functioning. Standardized interviews were conducted on 166 females and 166 males with PDs. In females with PDs, EDs, as compared to other axis I disorders, were associated with more non-ED axis I and II disorders (particularly borderline and avoidant PD) and poorer global functioning, but not with suicide attempts or non-suicidal self-injury. In males with PDs. EDs were associated with more axis II disorders, particularly borderline PD. Given the small group of males with EDs, these results require replication. Males and females with PDs and EDs may have multiple comorbid disorders, particularly borderline PD and for females, avoidant PD that may warrant targeting in treatment.

AB This study examined clinical characteristics and laboratory-measured impulsive behavior of adolescents engaging in either non-suicidal self-injury with (NSSI + SA: n = 25) or without (NSSI-Only; n = 31) suicide attempts. We hypothesized that adolescent with NSSI + SI would exhibit more severe clinical symptoms and higher levels of behavioral impulsivity compared to adolescents with NSSI-Only. Adolescents were recruited from an inpatient psychiatric hospital unit and the two groups were compared on demographic characteristics, psychopathology, self-reported clinical ratings, methods of non-suicidal self-injury, and two laboratory impulsivity measures. Primary evaluations were conducted during psychiatric hospitalization, and a subset of those tested during hospitalization was retested 4-6 weeks after discharge. During hospitalization, NSSI + SA patients reported worse depression, hopelessness, and impulsivity on standard clinical measures, and demonstrated elevated impulsivity on a reward-directed laboratory measure compared to NSSI-Only patients. In the follow-up analyses, depression, hopelessness, suicidal ideation, and laboratory impulsivity were improved for both groups, but the NSSI+SA group still exhibited significantly more depressive symptoms, hopelessness, and impulsivity than the NSSI-Only group. Risk assessments for adolescents with NSSI + SA should include consideration not only of the severity of clinical symptoms but of the current level impulsivity as well.

DE macro indicators; Europe; alcohol; drug; suicide; mental health care
ID SUICIDE
AB Background This paper reports the findings of an analytical comparison of several macro indicators collected routinely from institutional sources in Europe. Methods We carried out a review of macro indicators capable of providing a synthetic description of mental health status and the availability of psychiatric care in European countries. These were collected routinely from sources such as WHO, OECD, EUROSTAT, and IMS. The evaluation of temporal trends in each nation permits subsequent comparisons between countries. Results In all European countries, a decreased trend of suicides was observed in the period 1980 - 2000, with the exception of Ireland and ( partially) of Spain. In Ireland, the increased trend was particularly strong, with a high risk in young and adult males. Portugal and Greece had respectively the highest and the lowest rates of undetermined causes of death. Most countries that were high consumers of alcohol in the initial period of observation had a rate above the national mean until 1980, after which consumption decreased. Most nations that were low consumers in 1960 had rates below the mean until 1980, when the rates progressively increased. However, a general decrease of alcohol-related deaths was apparent in all countries. Mortality associated with mental disorder increased, most clearly during the mid 1980s. The number of psychiatrists per 100,000 inhabitants ranged from 3.6 in Spain to 17.5 in Finland; of child psychiatrists, from 0.9 in Germany to 5.1 in Portugal. Psychiatric beds ranged from 0.4 per 1,000 inhabitants in Italy and Spain to 1.3 in Ireland. Nine countries showed a trend towards a reduction in psychiatric beds, whilst in a further five countries no change was observed. Rates of long-stay patients varied from 9.5 in the UK to 84 in Belgium, with a generally decreasing trend. The use of outpatient facilities differed markedly between countries, although there was a general increase over time. Official data were scarce in relation to the sale of psychotropic drugs. IMS data indicated increasing consumption in all European countries for antidepressant and antipsychotic medication. Conclusions The official data resources available for European countries seem to indicate some discrepancies, probably relating to methods of recording. Better co-ordination in the collection of data about mental health status in the European Union and an improvement of the quality in available services is needed.

AB Background: Serotonergic dysfunction is implicated in depression, psychiatric disorders and suicidal behaviors. The first and rate-limiting step in the synthesis of serotonin is catalyzed by tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) which is encoded by TPH1 and THP2 genes. Genetic association studies have revealed contradictory results about the effect of the TPH1 A218C (rs1800532) polymorphism on suicidal behavior in different populations.
   Material and method: In this study, we investigated A218C polymorphism in 109 suicide attempters and 98 healthy controls. Socio-demographic characteristics of participants were obtained through questionnaire. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and genotyping was performed by Real Time PCR. Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate the significance of the difference among the independent variables. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested using Pearson's goodness-of-fit chi-squared test.
   Results: The frequency of A allele was significantly higher in suicide attempters than controls (46.33% vs. 35.71%, p = 0.0357). However, there were no differences in genotype frequencies of this locus between participants having attempted suicide and controls (p > 0.05). Among males, frequencies of CC genotype and C allele were found to be significantly higher in controls (p = 0.0125, p = 0.0298). With regard to the female subjects and female controls, no significant association was detected between suicidal behavior and genotype/allele frequencies (p > 0.05).
   Conclusion: Our results provide evidence that A allele of TPH1 A218C polymorphism may be associated with suicidal behavior in Turkish population. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Colchicine overdose is uncommon but potentially life threatening because of the high toxicity of the drug. Poisoning by colchicine may occur following ingestion of medication used in acute attacks of gout and inflammatory diseases. We describe two cases involving suicide by the ingestion of medications marketed in France. In case 1, only heart blood was taken after body external examination. In case 2 an autopsy was performed and heart blood, urine, gastric contents and bile were taken for toxicological analysis. Colchicine was assayed in biological specimens by an HPLC-DAD method, after extraction by dichloromethane at pH 8, adding prazepam as internal standard (IS). Analyses were performed on a Symetry((R)) C-8 column. Mobile phase was a gradient of acetonitrile/pH 3.8 phosphate buffer. Colchicine is eluted at 13.1 min and the method is linear for blood, urine and bile over the range 4-1000 ng/mL. LOQ is 4 ng/mL. The concentrations of colchicine detected are: case 1: heart blood 13 ng/mL; case 2: heart blood 66 ng/mL, urine 500 ng/mL, gastric content 12 ng/mL, bile 5632 ng/mL. Our findings are in the range of lethal concentrations previously described, but there is no correlation with the amount of ingested drug. Even after massive overdose, it could be impossible to detect colchicine in blood, and as there is a widespread enterohepatic recirculation before excretion in bile and feces, bile is the target sample to analyse. We conclude in both cases that the cause of death was suicide with colchicine. It appears very important to perform an autopsy in order to obtain bile, urine, heart blood and femoral blood.

The objective of this study was to investigate the factors associated with anxious depression for Chinese inpatients with MDD. A total of 174 acutely ill patients were enrolled. Baseline demographic variables, suicide risk, depression severity, quality of life (QOL), and daily functional impairment were assessed. Those MDD patients with a 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) anxiety/somatization factor score >= 7 were defined as anxious depression. Logistic regression was employed to examine the factors associated with anxious depression. One hundred and forty-one (81.0%) of the subjects reported anxious depression. Patients with anxious depression were more likely to have melancholic features, to be older, to experience more severe depression, to be at greater risk of suicide, to have more pain, poorer quality of life, and more severe functional impairment. Anxious depression is common in inpatients with MDD. These findings suggest that anxious depression significantly differs from nonanxious depression on several clinically relevant variables. These data add to a growing body of evidence that anxious depression is a more complex presentation of depression. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a prevalent and difficult to treat psychiatric condition characterized by abrupt mood swings, intense anger and depression, unstable interpersonal relationships, impulsive self-destructive behavior and a suicide rate of approximately 10%. Possible underlying molecular dysregulations in BPD have not been well explored. Protein kinase C (PKC) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have both been implicated in affective disorders, but their role in BPD has not been examined. Platelets were isolated from blood obtained from 24 medication-free BPD patients and 18 healthy control subjects. PKC-alpha, phosphorylated-PKC-alpha (p-PKC alpha), PKC-beta II, and BDNF were measured in platelet homogenates by immunoblotting. In the males, platelet BDNF and PKC-alpha levels were lower in patients than controls. p-PKC-alpha and PKC-beta II were lower at trend levels. In the entire sample, platelet p-PKC alpha and PKC-alpha activity were lower, at a trend level, in patients compared to controls. This is the first report to our knowledge of PKC and BDNF activity in BPD and calls for replication. These findings are consistent with altered PKC and BDNF activity in a range of neuropsychiatric conditions including bipolar disorder, depression and suicide. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Rumination has been previously linked to negative psychological outcomes, including depression and suicidal behavior. However, there has been conflicting research on whether or not two different subtypes of rumination brooding and reflection are more or less maladaptive. The present research sought to (1) examine whether individuals high in brooding but lower in reflection would show higher trait and behavioral impulsivity, relative to individuals low in brooding and low in reflection; and (2) examine impulsivity as a mediator of the relation between ruminative subtypes and suicidal ideation. In Study 1, participants (N=78) were recruited based on high, average, and low scores on a measure of brooding and reflective rumination. Individuals who scored high in brooding and average in reflection scored significantly higher in negative urgency, that is, in the tendency to act rashly in an attempt to reduce negative affect, than did those who scored low in brooding and low in reflection. Study 2 (N=1638) examined the relationship between ruminative subtypes, impulsivity, and suicide risk. We found an indirect relationship between brooding and suicide risk through lack of premeditation and lack of perseverance, independently of reflection. These findings are discussed in relation to cognitive risk for suicide. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Pack-size legislation reduces severity of paracetamol overdoses in
   Ireland
SO IRISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID RESTRICTIONS; SUICIDE
AB Background Legislation was introduced in Ireland in October 2001 to control the sale of paracetamol in non-pharmacy outlets. Preparations are now limited to 12 tablets per pack and only one pack can be sold per transaction.
   Aim To assess the impact of this legislation on acute deliberate paracetamol overdoses.
   Methods We reviewed acute deliberate paracetamol overdoses reported during two 24-months periods before and after October 2001. We grouped cases according to the number of tablets taken and compared the periods using chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests.
   Results The number of tablets taken in acute deliberate paracetamol overdose fell significantly after October 2001 (chi(2) =11.663, P=0.0029). Fewer cases involved 12-24 tablets (U=74, P<0.001) and fewer cases involved more than 24 tablets (U=131.5, P=0.0006)
   Conclusion Legislation controlling sale and packaging of paracetamol preparations appears to be associated with a significant fall in the number of tablets taken in acute deliberate paracetamol overdoses.

TI Deaths as a result of hanging
SO BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH-INDIA

DT Article
DE Autopsy; Capital punishment; Suicide
ID SUICIDE; PRISONERS; AUSTRALIA; IRELAND; TRENDS
AB Background: Death by hanging occurs as a result of the tightening of a cord around the neck with the effect of body weight. Although generally seen, it is not always necessary for hanging to be in a completely perpendicular position with the feet off the ground. With the exception of judicial cases, most hangings are suicides and in some cases may be the result of accident or murder.
   Material and method: In this study an evaluation was made of the autopsies of 48 cases of death by hanging in the province of Tokat, Turkey between 2009 and 2013. Through a retrospective evaluation of autopsy data, the cases were examined in respect of age, gender, location, type of hanging, instrument of hanging, fractures of the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage and level of alcohol and other substances in the blood. In the evaluation of the data, the SPSS 11.0 software was used.
   Results: The cases were 35 (73%) males and 13 (27%) females with a mean age of 34.56 years; males, mean 35.37 years and females, mean 32.38 years. Typical hanging was determined in 42 (87.5%) cases. Fracture of the hyoid bone was seen in 14 (29.2%) cases and fracture of the thyroid cartilage in 13 (27%) cases. With the exception of 2 cases, ecchymosis was found in the fracture region of all the other cases. Ethanol was determined in the blood of 8 (16.6%) cases and other substances in the blood of 2 (6.2%) cases.
   Conclusions: In every case of hanging, the autopsy and toxicology and histopathology examinations made following autopsy are extremely important in respect of differential diagnosis and determining whether or not it is a case of suicide or whether the hanging occurred after death.

AB The aim of this study was to determine whether personality might partially explain associations between sociodemographic factors and self-reported suicide attempts. This analysis was motivated by reports that certain personality traits are logical targets for intervention, whereas sociodemographic characteristics are not generally modifiable. Data were from a postal survey sent to community residents who were previously selected at random (N = 912). Age, gender, health-insurance status, education, self-reported health, and marital history were identified as relevant sociodemographic predictors of having made one or more lifetime suicide attempts. Risk associated with each of these variables was mediated by the personality traits of self-directedness (SD) and harm avoidance (HA). In a multiple logistic-regression analysis constrained to sociodemographic predictors, only young age, female sex, poor self-reported health, and Medicaid status remained as predictors of suicide attempts. When personality factors were added to the model, all of the sociodemographic predictors except Medicaid status were rendered nonsignificant or marginally significant. Risk associated with gender was primarily related to HA, risk associated with poor self-reported health was mediated by both HA and SD, and the risk associated with young age was primarily mediated by SD; the last was the largest mediation effect observed. In contrast, risk associated with receipt of Medicaid, presumed to indicate low socioeconomic status, was not mediated by personality. We conclude that risk associated with certain nonmodifiable demographic factors is often mediated by potentially modifiable intrapersonal factors, such as SD. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Self-injurious behaviors (SIBs) are leading causes of death and injury. Unfortunately, disagreement regarding whether and how to classify suicidal and nonsuicidal SIBs has contributed to their mis-classification, likely hindering clinical care and impeding scientific progress. The present study utilized a data-driven approach to facilitate classification and measurement of three forms of SIBs, with a particular focus on one with scant clinical and scientific attention: nonsuicidal overdoses (i.e. intentional overdoses where the person states that they had no intention of dying from the overdose). Results from this study demonstrated that nonsuicidal overdoses were similar to suicide attempts in terms of age of onset, and similar to nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) in terms of suicidal thoughts and desire to die when engaging in these behaviors. Nonsuicidal overdoses were unique from NSSI and suicide attempts in terms of the reported likelihood of dying from the behavior. The present study highlighted that current definitions for nonsuicidal behaviors (including requirements that the person has zero intent to die) may not accurately represent people's intent when engaging in these behaviors. Additionally, the present study highlighted that empirical analysis of SIBs can provide important insights for classification of SIBs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SELF-HARM
AB Despite high suicide rates all over the world, complete decapitation as a consequence of violent suicide methods is exceptionally rare and there is always a potential for confusion with homicide as well as with body dismemberment or mutilation. We analyzed the phenomenology and morphology of 10 cases(six male, four female; individual age 18-60 years) of suicidal complete decapitation that were subjected to medico-legal autopsies at the Institute of Legal Medicine, University of Hamburg, Germany, between 1995 and 2002. All decapitations occurred while the person was alive as proven by signs of vitality. Blood alcohol levels were positive in five cases and ranged between 28 and 202 mg/dl. The applied methods of suicide were running over by a train in eight cases and hanging in two cases. In suicidal hanging resulting in complete decapitation the wound margins were clear-cut with an adjacent sharply demarcated circumferential band-like abrasion zone showing a homogenous width, the latter determined by the thickness of the rope. In decapitations due to railway interference a broad spectrum of pathologic alterations such as the co-existence of irregular, ragged and sharp-edged wound margins, vascular and nervous pathways forming bridges in the depth of the wound and bruising Could be observed. In such cases skin abrasion zones were generally not circumferential and showed a heterogenous width. Concerning hanging-related complete decapitations, our findings are well in line with those of other authors, namely that heavy body weight of the suicidal, fall from a great height and in some cases inelastic and/or thin rope material used for the noose are the determining factors decisive for complete decapitation.

Following targeted gene virotherapy of conditionally replicating adenoviruses (CRAds), the novel suicide gene of multisubstrate deoxyribonucleoside kinase of Drosophila melanogaster (Dm-DNK) was inserted into the double-regulated oncolytic adenovirus SG500 to ensure more safety and enhanced antitumor activity against breast cancer both in vitro and in vivo. Selective replication, cell-killing efficacy, and cytotoxicity, combined with chemotherapeutics were investigated in several breast cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7), normal cells (WI-38 and MRC-5), and human (MDA-MB-231) tumor models in vivo. The double-regulated SG500-dNK had high cell-killing activity in breast cancer. Replication was similar to wild-type in breast cells and was attenuated in normal cells. SG500-dNK combined with the chemotherapeutics (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (Bvdu) and 2',2'-difluoro-deoxycytidine (dFdC) resulted in synergistically enhanced cell killing and greatly improved antitumor efficacy in vitro or in breast xenografts in vivo. These data suggest that the novel oncolytic variant SG500-dNK is a promising candidate for targeting breast tumors specifically when combined with chemotherapeutics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Background: Suicidal ideation is elevated for individuals with alcohol use disorders. Sleep problems are associated with suicide risk and alcohol use, and sleep problems may be associated with suicide risk in those with alcohol use disorders. For the present study, we hypothesized that self-reported sleep problems are associated with suicidal thoughts in a sample of adults seeking treatment for alcohol dependence in Poland.
   Methods: The sample included 304 patients in addiction treatment programs in Warsaw, Poland who met criteria for alcohol dependence. Measures included demographic characteristics, frequency of alcohol use, psychiatric symptoms, suicidal ideation and two measures of insomnia, which differed by time frame: the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS, past 1 month) and the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire (SDQ-7, past 6 months). Multivariable logistic regression models tested the association between insomnia and suicidal thoughts.
   Results: In models that controlled for age, gender, and days of recent drinking, both measures of sleep problems were associated with suicidal ideation: AOR = 2.01 (95% Cl: 1.50-2.70) [AIS] and 1.73 (95% Cl: 1.29-2.31) [SDQ-7]. The association of sleep problems, as measured by the AIS, with suicide remained significant after adjusting for psychiatric symptoms, although the estimated effect size was smaller (AOR = 1.47; 95% CI: 1.05-2.06).
   Conclusions: Among Polish adults with alcohol dependence, insomnia severity was associated with suicidal ideation. This finding highlights the need to assess for sleep problems, in addition to suicidal thoughts, in alcohol treatment settings and to further examine the potential consequences of poor sleep in this population.

AB Aim: To determine the relationship between borderline personality disorder (BPD), antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and harm among current heroin users. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Sydney, Australia. Participants: 615 current heroin users. Findings: Forty-six percent met criteria for BPD, 71% for ASPD, and 38% met criteria for both diagnoses. ASPD was related to attempted suicide, lifetime overdose, polydrug use, depression and overall psychological distress. BPD was also related to each of these risk domains, and to needle risk and recent suicide as well. When analysed separately, both BPD and ASPD thus appeared to predict harm. For the purposes of further analysis, the relationships between BPD, ASPD and harm, the sample was divided into four independent diagnostic groups: no diagnosis (ND, 21%), ASPD only (ASPD, 33%), BPD only (BPD, 7%), ASPD plus BPD (DUAL, 38%). The division of the sample into four distinct diagnostic groups produced substantially different results. There were strong relationships between BPD and attempted suicide, needle sharing and psychopathology. In none of these domains did the ASPD group significantly differ from the ND group. Also, the levels of harm among the DUAL group were identical to BPD, suggesting no additive risk from ASPD. Thus, while initial analyses suggested an increased risk for ASPD patients for suicide and psychopathology, these relationships disappeared after BPD was taken into account. The only domain in which there appeared to be an additive risk for ASPD and BPD, was heroin overdose. Conclusions: The extensive comorbidity between BPD and ASPD means that, unless BPD is controlled for, artefactual relationships may emerge between ASPD and harm. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Improving insight in patients with schizophrenia appears necessary to enhance medication adherence and clinical outcome, but in some patients acquiring insight can paradoxically increase hopelessness, depression and suicidal behavior. The aim of this study is to explore the association of two dimensions of insight (cognitive and clinical) with depression, hopelessness and clinical variables in patients with psychosis. Using a cross-sectional design, 61 remitted outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders were included. Insight was assessed using the "Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder" (SUMD), the PANSS-item G12 and the Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS). Overall, 41.2% of the sample had a history of suicide attempts. Patients in the high clinical insight group had significantly higher depression scores, higher hopelessness scores, greater histories of suicide attempts and were more likely to have received psychoeducation. Compared to patients with low cognitive insight, those with high overall cognitive insight were significantly more depressed and had more often received psychoeducation. Greater insight may have negative consequences in terms of depressive symptoms and therefore presents a challenge to clinicians in assessing the individual risks and benefits of strategies intended to enhance awareness of mental disorder.

AB Introduction: In substance abusing families, sources of familial comorbidity are potentially confounded by genetic-environmental (GE) interplays. The children-of-twins (COT) design can be used to elucidate the association of a parental trait and an offspring outcome such as the association of parental alcoholism and offspring suicidality.
   Methods: We examined the association of paternal alcoholism and offspring suicidal behaviors in an adolescent and young adult COT sample of 'Vietnam Era Twins' offspring who had completed an interview including a comprehensive assessment of lifetime suicidal behaviors. We stratified the COT sample into four groups contingent upon paternal zygosity, MZ versus DZ, and lifetime paternal alcohol dependence history (AD), positive versus negative. We examined whether the relationship of paternal alcoholism and offspring suicidality was best explained by genetic predispositions common to alcoholism and suicidality or by GE interplay-environmental influences correlated with parental alcoholism or the interaction of genetic and environmental factors.
   Results: Our results suggest a main effect of paternal alcoholism on offspring suicide attempt; COT analyses do not support a purely genetic explanation for this association.
   Discussion: Suicide attempts probably result from GE interplays and must be studied in genetically informative samples of offspring of substance abusing parents. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Self-injury research has been located primarily in the disciplines of psychiatry and psychology however it is gaining increasing recognition as an interdisciplinary field, ripe with potential for sociological and psychosocial analysis. In this article, I revisit Goffman?s theory to explore retrospectively the dynamic nature of stigma and identity for people affected by self-injury in the socio-political context of Northern Ireland. Drawing on 30 in-depth interviews with people reporting a history of self-injury and practitioners in community roles who provide support to people that self-injure, I sought to understand their perspectives on the moral career of people who self-injure. This article provides insight into participants? experiences of three intersecting phases in the lives of those who self-injure: engaging in self-injury; help-seeking interactions; and, recovery. I propose that developing critical understanding of social theory is paramount for self-injury interventions in practice, research, and policy.

AB There has been a rise in suicide rates among men who grew up during the 1970's in Northern Ireland (NI). Conflict exposures (CEs) have been linked with suicide ideation but not attempts. Civil conflict has also been linked with aggressive parenting which is associated with the development of aggressive drives, psychopathology and suicidality. This study investigated (1) cohort specific associations between latent classes (LCs) of maltreatment and (2) associations between LCs, CEs, psychopathology and suicidality. Data were from NI Study of Health and Stress (N = 1986). Maltreatment and suicidality were queried using validated measures. Psychiatric assessments were based on DSM-IV criteria. Logistic regression, latent class analysis, chi square tests and mediation analyses were conducted. Two at risk LCs were identified, entitled "family violence exposure" (FVE, 10.4%; Male, 55.4%) and "family violence and sexual abuse exposure" (FVSAE, 1.2%; Female, 90.5%). Both were more likely to have experienced CEs (FVE = 71%; FVSAE = 77.5%) than the low risk class. The FVE were more likely to be male; aged 35-49 and to suffer from a mental disorder. The FVSAE class all endorsed rape, were more likely to be separated and to suffer from a mental disorder. CEs uniquely predicted ideation but not enactment. Psychopathology partially mediated the relationship between LCs and suicidality. FVE and FVSAE directly increased the odds of enactment. These findings are original and highly pertinent and they should be used to inform any strategy for addressing the cohort specific and trauma related rise in suicide rates in NI.

AB In the US the suicide rate on a population basis has risen and fallen over time between approximately 10 and 12 per 100,000 population. The recent trend toward an increased rate has been paralleled by an increase in emergency department visits for attempted suicide. The purpose of this study was to examine trends in suspected suicide (SS) cases reported to the National Poison Data System (NPDS), over a 9-year period (2000-2008).
   Methods: Data were obtained from NPDS, for all human patients between the years 2000 and 2008 with the reason for poisoning exposure recorded as "Intentional - Suspected Suicide" (ISS). Additionally, population sizes were obtained from the US Census Bureau as single annual counts by age and sex bands for the 2000-2008.
   Results: There were 1,672,324 human exposures reported to substances with the reason of SS. Sixty-five percent (1,084,669) were female. The average age of a patient was 30 years with the age groups 13-19 and 20-29 years reporting the highest SS events, 26.4% and 25.7%, respectively. From 2000 to 2008, the estimated rate of SS increased from 72.6 to 82.8 per 1000 human exposure cases. On a population basis, the estimated rate of SS increased from 55.8 to 67.9 per 100,000 population (p for trend <0.001). The relative risk of human exposures for reason of SS compared to human exposures for any other reason being reported to the NPDS is 1.13 (95% CI: [1.122-1.135], p < 0.001) for every 10 years. The relative risk for females vs. males was 1.82 for having SS as a reason for exposure (p <0.001). However, females were also 0.82 times less likely to experience a severe medical outcome (SMO) compared to males (95% Cl: [0.81-0.83], p <0.001). We noted an increasing risk of a SMO or fatality increasing with age.
   Conclusions: Based on the total human exposure cases reported to the NPDS, there was a suggested trend of an increase in SS rates of 13% in the next 10 years. There was a greater incidence of SS in females and younger age groups. However, the odds of a SMO or fatality were higher for males and increased with increasing age. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Background In 1997, 433 people committed suicide in Ireland, one-quarter of whom were less than 24 years of age.
   Aim To determine demographics, agent choice and source, suicidality and follow-up care of deliberate self-poisoning patients.
   Method Details of 111 patients admitted to one hospital in 1997 following drug overdose were studied retrospectively. Eleven had been accidental ingestions, the remaining 100 were deliberate self-poisoning.
   Results Men accounted for 38% of the presentations and were more likely to have suicidal intent than women. An average of 2.3 different agents were used. Paracetamol was taken by 37%, hypnotics/anxiolytics by 33% and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories by 17%. Alcohol was consumed synchronously by 51% and 17% fulfilled criteria for alcohol dependency. One-third of patients were clinically depressed. All six patients requiring ventilation had consumed a combination of tricyclic antidepressants and alcohol. There were no deaths.
   Conclusion Deliberate self-poisoning remains a significant problem. Paracetamol and alcohol use are particularly marked in this population. The combination of tricyclic antidepressant drugs and alcohol were the most dangerous.

TI Optimizing Suicide Prevention Programs and Their Implementation in
   Europe (OSPI Europe): an evidence-based multi-level approach
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH

DT Article

   ADOLESCENTS; BEHAVIOR; RATES
AB Background: Suicide and non-fatal suicidal behaviour are significant public health issues in Europe requiring effective preventive interventions. However, the evidence for effective preventive strategies is scarce. The protocol of a European research project to develop an optimized evidence based program for suicide prevention is presented.
   Method: The groundwork for this research has been established by a regional community based intervention for suicide prevention that focuses on improving awareness and care for depression performed within the European Alliance Against Depression (EAAD). The EAAD intervention consists of (1) training sessions and practice support for primary care physicians, (2) public relations activities and mass media campaigns, (3) training sessions for community facilitators who serve as gatekeepers for depressed and suicidal persons in the community and treatment and (4) outreach and support for high risk and self-help groups (e.g. helplines). The intervention has been shown to be effective in reducing suicidal behaviour in an earlier study, the Nuremberg Alliance Against Depression. In the context of the current research project described in this paper (OSPI-Europe) the EAAD model is enhanced by other evidence based interventions and implemented simultaneously and in standardised way in four regions in Ireland, Portugal, Hungary and Germany.
   The enhanced intervention will be evaluated using a prospective controlled design with the primary outcomes being composite suicidal acts (fatal and non-fatal), and with intermediate outcomes being the effect of training programs, changes in public attitudes, guideline-consistent media reporting. In addition an analysis of the economic costs and consequences will be undertaken, while a process evaluation will monitor implementation of the interventions within the different regions with varying organisational and healthcare contexts.
   Discussion: This multi-centre research seeks to overcome major challenges of field research in suicide prevention. It pools data from four European regions, considerably increasing the study sample, which will be close to one million. In addition, the study will gather important information concerning the potential to transfer this multilevel program to other health care systems. The results of this research will provide a basis for developing an evidence-based, efficient concept for suicide prevention for EU-member states.

AB Suicide attempts (SA) are common in patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Recent studies focus on aspects of personality associated with risk for SA such as deficits in affect regulation including impulse control and aggression. The current study examines associations of dysfunctional personality organization, psychiatric comorbidities as well as non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) with SA in a sample of 68 BPD outpatients. Patients with a history of SA yielded higher scores in personality domains of aggression, especially self-directed aggression. Further, a history of SA was associated with a worse general level of personality organization and a higher prevalence rate of NSSI and substance abuse disorder. The results demonstrate that SA in BPD patients might be regarded as a manifestation of impaired personality functioning rather than mere state variables and symptoms. Moreover, these findings might have implications for indication, treatment, and prognosis of Borderline Personality Disorder. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study examined the ability of the International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT) Scale for Suicidal Thinking (ISST) and the Calgary Depression Scale (CDS) to predict suicide attempts or hospitalizations to prevent attempts (referred to as Type I events) during the InterSePT trial (Meltzer, H.Y., Alphs, L., Green, A.I., Altamura, A.C., Anand, R., Bertoldi, A., Bourgeois, M., Chouinard, G., Islam, M.Z., Kane, J., Krishman, R., Lindenmayer, J.P., Potkin, S., 2003. Clozapine treatment for suicidality in schizophrenia. Archive of General Psychiatry 60, 82-9 1]. The primary goal of this analysis was to determine if the ISST and CDS ratings indicated that the raters, an unblinded (UP) and a blinded psychiatrist (BP) using the ISST, and a blinded rater using the CDS, were able to identify those patients who had a Type I event. The ratings of patients adjudged to have experienced a Type I event (Group 1) were compared with patients who did not (Group 2). The ISST and the CDS ratings obtained 2-8 weeks prior to a Type I event (Pre-1) and Pre-2, the rating immediately prior to Pre-1, obtained 2-12 weeks before Pre-1, were analyzed to test the hypothesis that the difference between Pre-2 and Pre-1 ratings for the Group I patients was significantly greater than the difference in the comparable ratings for Group 2 patients. The prediction that patients with Type I events would show greater worsening in ISST and CDS ratings between Pre-2 and Pre-1 than the Group 2 patients was confirmed. However, the sensitivity and specificity of a worsening in ratings was not sufficient to provide definitive warning of an impending Type I event. Other characteristics of the patients with Type I events provide additional warning: e.g. overall higher ratings on these scales, slower improvement in suicidality during treatment, and previous number of suicide attempts. These results indicate that the ISST and CDS may provide some additional information that can assist clinical decision making regarding suicidal risk in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

AB The report presents a fatal poisoning of a neonate occurring in the final stage of gestational life and evoked by his mother, who, while 9 months pregnant, took a toxic dose of clozapine aiming at committing suicide. She was also severely poisoned, but ultimately was saved.
   The woman had been taking the medication due to schizophrenia and depression prior to conception, and the discontinuation of the drug in the course of pregnancy increased the risk of the woman attempting suicide. In the course of comprehensive toxicological analysis based on the developed analytical procedure with the use of LC-APCI-MS, clozapine and its two metabolites, norclozapine and clozapine-N-oxide, were determined in postmortem blood, liver and kidney in concentrations explaining the death of the neonate.
   The interpretation of the above-described case is complex and - apart from toxicological aspects - also involves issues associated with psychiatry, pharmacotherapy in pregnancy and medicolegal problems. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB As part of a larger study, four decisions related to a vignette scenario of the elective death of a terminally ill patient suffering intractable pain are examined (doctor supplying information and drugs, assisting patient to take the drugs, or administering a lethal injection). Judgments on justifiability and legality of actions were obtained from laypersons and general practitioners (GPs) in Auckland, New Zealand. The results show that over 72% of laypersons and over 30% of GPs judged all four actions justified. Despite illegality a significant number of laypersons and some doctors were unsure of the legal status of actions. The current law in New Zealand prohibiting physician-assisted death may not reflect judgments by the majority of laypersons or 30% of general practitioners on the justifiability of elective death options for a terminally ill patient with intractable pain. Judgments on justifiability may be related to confusion over the legality of actions. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE mortality; socio-economic differentials; years of potential life lost
ID MORTALITY DIFFERENTIALS; PREMATURE MORTALITY; INEQUALITIES; MEN
AB Background: The study of mortality differentials by class or socio-economic group is underdeveloped in Ireland in comparison to other countries. The work that has been done has used a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) methodology to measure deaths. There has been no previous work exploring the social gradient in years of potential life lost (YPLL) in Ireland. Methods: The aim is to investigate socio-economic mortality differentials for men aged between 15 and 69 in Ireland, using VILL as a measure of premature mortality. The design is a mortality trends study. The study is based on mortality data supplied by the Central Statistics Office in Ireland and population data taken from the Census for the years 1981 and 1991. The data covers all male deaths aged 15-69 in the years 1981 and 1991. Social position is measured by a 12-category socio-economic group (SEG) framework and by a more aggregate four-category occupational classification system. Result!;: When age at death is taken into account through YPLL, injury and poisoning is a major cause of premature mortality in Ireland for all soclo-economic groups. The results also show significant differentials in VILL by 12-category SEG in Ireland. There was a widening of the social gap during the period 1981 to 1991 as measured by the VILL ratio between lower manual/upper non-manual occupational groups. The use of YPLL as a measure of premature mortality highlights the importance of respiratory disease and injury and poisoning as the major sources of health Inequality in 1981 and 1991. Conclusions: VILL is an. important indicator of general mortality and for monitoring mortality differentials by socio-economic group. Current health inequalities as measured by VILL are unacceptably high in Ireland. A comprehensive government strategy to reduce inequalities in mortality is required, having the primary objective of improving the economic and social circumstances of people in the lower manual occupational category. There is also a need to develop measurable priorities and programmes for the reduction of premature mortality in the injury and poisoning category for all social groups, and especially for people in the lower manual group. This means action now to prevent future deaths from road accidents, accidents at work and suicides.

AB GCV-ablation of transplanted TK-positive liver tumors or the application of syngenic and allogenic HSV-TK/GCV oncolysates significantly reduced the size of synchronously growing untreated sister tumors in the liver. These TK-negative liver tumors constantly showed tin increased infiltration by mononuclears ( x 4). The relative abundance of CD 4/8, NK and monocyte subtypes remained constant. The distant bystander effect was associated with a strong induction of GMCSF and IL-12 expression in the untreated TK-negative liver tumors. Analysis of the vbeta T-cell receptor profiles from TK-negative tumors did not point to clonal lymphocyte expansions. These results support the view of the 'distant bystander effect' as a predominantly local phenomenon, which is mediated by resident immune effectors rather than by MHC I restricted CD 3 positive lymphocyte.

AB In the current cross-sectional study, we aimed to investigate the presence and severity of "male" depressive symptoms and suicidal behaviors in psychiatric patients with and without a history of child abuse and neglect, as measured by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), as well as to explore the associations among childhood maltreatment, "male depression" and suicide risk. The sample consisted of 163 consecutively admitted adult inpatients (80 men; 83 women). The patients were administered the CTQ Gotland Male Depression Scale (GMDS), and Suicidal History Self-Rating Screening Scale (SHSS). Those with a moderate-severe childhood maltreatment history were more likely to be female (p < 0.05) and reported more "male depression" (p < 0.001) and suicidal behaviors (p <0.01) as compared to those not having or having a minimal history of child abuse and neglect. In the multivariate analysis, only the minimization/denial scale of the CTQ (odds ratio=0.31; p <0.001) and "male depression" (odds ratio=1.83; p <0.05) were independently associated with moderate/severe history of child maltreatment. The findings suggest that exposure to abuse and neglect as a child may increase the risk of subsequent symptoms of "male depression", which has been associated with higher suicidal risk.

AB This study examines the longitudinal associations between psychotic experiences (PE) and incident suicidal ideation and behaviour in the general population, and to what degree the association may be confounded by non-psychotic psychopathology. Data from three prospective, general population cohorts were combined into one dataset (n=15,837) and analysed using logistic regression, controlling for continuous measures of depression, anxiety and mania symptoms. Analyses were conducted in the entire sample, and in subsamples stratified by presence or absence of mental disorders. The presence of PE at baseline increased the risk of incident suicidal ideation and behaviour. However, adjustment for dimensional measures of psychopathology reduced effect sizes, although PE remained significantly associated with suicide attempts. Further examination of the associations revealed that PE were only associated with suicide attempts in individuals with at least one mental disorder. Similarly, in individuals without mental disorders, the risk of suicidal ideation increased as PE co-occurred with more symptom domains. The results of this study confirm that individuals with PE are at increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. However, these associations are not specific, but reflect the increased risk of suicidal ideation in individuals with subthreshold multidimensional psychopathology and suicide attempts in individuals with co-occurring mental disorders.

AB Carbon monoxide poisoning (COP) after charcoal burning results in delayed neuropsychological sequelae (DNS), which show clinical resemblance to Parkinson's disease, without adequate predictors at present. This study examined the role of dopamine transporter (DAT) binding for the prediction of DNS. Twenty-seven suicide attempters with COP were recruited. Seven of them developed DNS, while the remainder did not. The striatal DAT binding was measured by single photon emission computed tomography with (99m)-TRODAT. The specific uptake ratio was derived based on a ratio equilibrium model. Using a logistic regression model, multiple clinical variables were examined as potential predictors for DNS. COP patients with DNS had a lower binding on left striatal DAT binding than patients without DNS. Logistic regression analysis showed that a combination of initial loss of consciousness and lower left striatal DAT binding predicted the development of DNS. Our data indicate that the left striatal DAT binding could help to predict the development of DNS. This finding not only demonstrates the feasibility of brain imaging techniques for predicting the development of DNS but will also help clinicians to improve the quality of care for COP patients.

AB Suicidal ideation and behaviour are common among inmates. Anger is found at exaggerated levels and has been associated with suicidal ideation and behaviour in inmate samples suggesting its possible salience in the prediction of suicide. The study investigated relationships between anger, psychological distress, and self-harm/suicidal ideation among inmates. The principles of Ecological Momentary Assessment were considered and a structured self-assessment diary was utilised to examine relationships between the variables of interest. Participants completed a structured self-assessment diary for six consecutive days which included momentary ratings of items describing psychological states of concurrent affects, thoughts, and appraisals related to anger, psychological distress, and self-harm/suicidal ideation. Psychometric assessment measures were also conducted. Temporal associations between predictors and outcomes were investigated. Multilevel modelling analyses were performed. Increased anger was significantly associated with concurrent high levels of self-harm ideation in inmates, when controlling for depression and hopelessness. Temporal analyses also revealed that anger at one time point did not predict suicidal ideation at the next time point. Elucidating the temporal nature of the relationship between anger, psychological distress, and self-harm/suicidal ideation has advanced understanding of the mechanisms of suicidal behaviour, by demonstrating an increased risk of suicide when a male inmate is angry.

AB Impulsivity and aggressiveness are trait dispositions associated with the vulnerability to suicidal behavior across diagnoses. They are associated with structural and functional abnormalities in brain networks involved in regulation of mood, impulse and behavior. They are also core characteristics of borderline personality disorder (BPD), a disorder defined, in part, by recurrent suicidal behavior. We assessed the relationships between personality traits, brain structure and lethality of suicide attempts in 51 BPD attempters using multiple regression analyses on structural MRI data. BPD was diagnosed by the Diagnostic Interview for Borderline Patients-revised, impulsivity by the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS), aggression by the Brown-Goodwin Lifetime History of Aggression (LHA), and high lethality by a score of 4 or more on the Lethality Rating Scale (LRS). Sixteen High Lethality attempters were compared to 35 Low Lethality attempters, with no significant differences noted in gender, co-morbidity, childhood abuse, BIS or LHA scores. Degree of medical lethality (LRS) was negatively related to gray matter volumes across multiple fronto-temporal-limbic regions. Effects of impulsivity and aggression on gray matter volumes discriminated High from Low Lethality attempters and differed markedly within lethality groups. Lethality of suicide attempts in BPD may be related to the mediation of these personality traits by specific neural networks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved

AB Consumption of alcohol increases the risk of dying a violent death. We wanted to establish a connection between harmful alcohol use and dying a violent death. We analyzed all such victims in the extended region of Ljubljana. The research included 1630 deceased, who were autopsied at the Forensic Institute of the Ljubljana, Faculty of Medicine in the period from 1995 to 1999. Presence of alcohol was established in 76.3% of the cases. From all included in the research, 38.2% of all work accident victims, 28.8% of all murder victims, 25.4% of suicides, 24.6% of victims involved in traffic accidents and 19.3% of those who died in accidents at home. 23.2% of all violent death victims had a concentration of alcohol above 1.5 g/kg; among those, victims of traffic accidents, suicides and accidents at home represent the largest part. The lowest values of alcohol in blood were found in those who died because of accidents at work. The highest values were found in males aged 35-44. The research confirmed that consumption of alcohol in Slovenia was strongly connected to violent deaths. The blood levels of alcohol of the victims are distinctively higher where there are practically no limitations of alcohol consumption and lower in the environment or activities where legal restrictions prohibit or at least explicitly limit harmful use of alcohol (working environment).

AB When it comes to firearm fatalities, the main goal of forensic analysis is to distinguish firearm suicides from homicides and accidents. Apart from the location of the entrance wound, wound path trajectory and gunshot residue, blood stain pattern analysis of gunshot-related backspatter on the hands of the victim can be an essential tool not only to determine which hand was holding the firearm, but also to reconstruct the position from which a weapon was fired. We present a case of a 90-year-old man, who was found dead in his house. Because of unclear circumstances and an unusual position of the deceased with a gunshot entrance wound to the right temporal region and a firearm found on the left side of his body, an autopsy was performed. Due to the unusual bloodspatter stains on the hands and the firearm, it was possible to deduce the position and orientation of the hands and the firearm of the deceased. We could reconstruct that the man held the weapon in his right hand, using the left hand to stabilise the firearm and the right thumb to pull the trigger. A contact shot to the right temple led to central regulatory failure due to extensive brain injury. The manner of death was concluded to be a suicide. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB No studies have examined whether military sexual trauma, as measured and defined within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), is associated with suicidal ideation among Veterans in VHA care, when taking prior suicide attempts into account. Research regarding the role of gender in this association is also limited. The present study examined: (1) whether military sexual trauma was associated with the presence of past-week suicidal ideation among 354 Veterans in VHA (310 men, 44 women); (2) whether gender moderated the association between military sexual trauma and suicidal ideation. Information regarding military sexual trauma, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and psychiatric diagnoses was obtained from self-report instruments and medical records. Adjusting for age, gender, combat, posttraumatic stress disorder, depressive disorders, negative affect, and lifetime suicide attempt, Veterans with military sexual trauma were significantly more likely to report suicidal ideation, compared to Veterans without military sexual trauma. Furthermore, the association between military sexual trauma and suicidal ideation was stronger for men compared to women. These results contribute to a growing literature identifying military sexual trauma as a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors among Veterans in VHA care and emphasize the importance of screening for suicidal ideation among survivors of military sexual trauma.

AB Rates of suicide are alarmingly high in military and veteran samples. Suicide rates are particularly elevated among those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, which share overlapping symptoms and frequently co-occur. Identifying and confirming factors that reduce, suicide risk among veterans with PTSD and depression is imperative. The proposed study evaluated, whether post-deployment social support moderated the influence of PTSD-depression symptoms on, suicidal ideation among Veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan using state of the art clinical, diagnostic interviews and self-report measures. Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) Veterans (n=145) were invited to, participate in a study evaluating returning Veterans' experiences. As predicted, PTSD-depression, symptoms had almost no effect on suicidal ideation (SI) when post-deployment social support was high; however, when, post-deployment social support was low, PTSD-depression symptoms were positively associated with, SI. Thus, social support may be an important factor for clinicians to assess in the context of PTSD and, depressive symptoms. Future research is needed to prospectively examine the inter-relationship, between PTSD/depression and social support on suicidal risk, as well as whether interventions to, improve social support result in decreased suicidality.

AB Background: Self-harm is a strong predictor of future suicide, but little is known about self-harm among the homeless population. The study aim was to estimate the incidence of self-harm among the homeless population and to assess factors associated with self-harm.
   Methods: Data on self-harm presentations to 34 hospital emergency departments in Ireland were collected by the National Self-Harm Registry Ireland (NSHRI). Index presentations between 2010 and 2014 were included for the homeless and fixed residence populations. Incidence rates of self-harm were calculated using NSHRI data and census estimates. Factors associated with self-harm and repeated self-harm were analysed by multivariable-adjusted logistic regression.
   Results: The age-standardised incidence rate of self-harm was 30 times higher among the homeless (5572 presentations per 100,000) compared with those with a fixed residence (187 presentations per 100,000). Homeless people had significantly higher odds of being male (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.56-2.23), presenting with self-cutting (vs. overdose, OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.74-2.66) and having psychiatric admission (vs. general admission, OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.66-3.57). Homeless people had higher odds of self-harm repetition within 12 months (vs. fixed residence, OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.21-1.77). The odds of repetition were significantly increased among homeless who engaged in self-cutting (vs. overdose, OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.17-2.65) and did not receive psychiatric review at index presentation (vs. reviewed, OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.05-2.26).
   Limitations: The study only reflects self-harm presenting to hospital, and assumes no change in homelessness status after index presentation. Residual confounding may affect the results.
   Conclusion: There is a disproportionate burden of self-harm among the homeless. Targeted preventive actions are warranted.

AB Involvement of personality traits in susceptibility to suicidal behaviour has attracted considerable research interest over the past decades. This study was motivated by reports that emotionality may play a potentially confounding role in the association between the personality profile and suicidal behaviour. We assessed the association between personality traits, as measured using the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), and suicidal behaviour, while controlling for the effects of Affective Temperaments, measured using the Temperament Evaluation of the Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego auto-questionnaire (TEMPS-A) in a sample of 140 consecutive self-poisoning nonlethal suicide (SNS) attempters admitted to the Emergency Toxicology Clinic, comparing them with a sample of 140 age and sex matched healthy controls. After controlling for Affective Temperaments, the temperament dimension of Novelty Seeking (NS) and the character dimensions of Self-directedness and Self-transcendence remained significantly associated with SNS attempts. NS, in particular, was most consistently and uniquely associated with suicidal behaviour. The present study conveys the difficulty in disentangling the personality profile of SNS attempters from their emotionality. We conclude that the risk associated with certain personality traits is often entirely mediated by Affective Temperaments and few dimensions independently contribute to the risk of self-poisoning nonlethal suicidal behaviour.

In the present study, effect of the "bystander effect" associated with the MSCtk/GCV strategy on the background normal brain tissues was examined in both in vitro and in vivo conditions. Rat MSCtk and C6 glioma cells were mixed and seeded on the rat primary neuron and glia co-culture in the medium containing GCV to generate the bystander effect and the numbers of background cells were counted on day 0, 2 and 7. Though the number of MSCtk and C6 cells decreased rapidly due to the bystander effect, most of the neurons and glias survived on day 7. Next, rats were intracranially injected with the MSCtk and C6 cells and then intraperitoneally administered with GCV for 7 days. No remarkable histological abnormality including apoptosis was observed in the background brain tissues near the injection site. The present study has demonstrated that the tumoricidal bystander effect does not injure the background normal brain tissue significantly and that the suicide gene therapies are sufficiently safe.

ID PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; UNITED-STATES; NETHERLANDS
AB In the project 'Support and consultation in Euthanasia in Amsterdam' (SCEA) general practitioners can turn to 20 especially trained physicians for advice or consultation concerning euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. In this study the implementation was evaluated and it was investigated whether the goals of SCEA. supporting physicians and improving the quality of consultation, the quality of decision-making and the willingness to report. were met. Methods used were a questionnaire send to all general practitioners ls registered in Amsterdam (n = 398). registration forms SCEA physicians filled in for every time SCEA was contacted and records of the public prosecutor. After the study period of 14 months. of the general practitioners who had performed euthanasia during this period. 53% had contacted SCEA at least once. The vast majority of general practitioners felt supported bq SCEA. The quality of consultation was: (even) higher in cases of euthanasia in which a SCEA physician acted as consultant than in cases with another consultant. We found no relation between use of SCEA and the last two goals of SCEA. Conclusions: Whether the lack of relation found between SCEA and it's last two goals is real or due to the studies limitations remains unclear. The results of this study do suggest that SCEA. by further improving the quality of consultation, has contributed to the safeguarding of euthanasia and assisted suicide. Therefore, similar networks are being developed throughout the Netherlands. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose - This study reports on a project to monitor deliberate self-poisoning in a rural area of Northern Ireland over a 20-year period. Comparison is made with reports from large urban centres. In addition, a local prescribing database allows assessment of any association between psychotropic drug prescription and use for deliberate self-poisoning. Materials and methods - Frequency of self-poisoning, demographic details and drugs used were recorded for all episodes of deliberate self-poisoning occurring at Craigavon Area Hospital for the years 1976, 1986, 1991 and 1996. It was possible to compare prescriptions of psychotropic drugs with their use for deliberate self-poisoning between the years 1991 and 1996 in the region served by the hospital, using the Defined Daily Dose (DDD) system. Results - In this rural area the pattern of deliberate self-poisoning has changed, as in urban centres, with a rise in frequency and the male/female ratio approaching unity. The pattern of drug use has altered, with paracetamol overtaking benzodiazepines as the most commonly used agent. More recently, antidepressants have become the second most frequently used drug class for this purpose. Psychotropic medications used for self-poisoning altered in proportion to their prescription between the years 1991 and 1996. Conclusions - In the face of a continuing rise in deliberate self-poisoning, which is effecting both urban and rural areas, care should be taken to prescribe the least toxic agent available as this is associated with likely frequency of self-poisoning for most classes of psychotropic drug.

AB The differentiation of intoxication courses is one of the most difficult challenges for forensic pathologists and toxicologists. The case of a 52-year-old female inpatient of a psychiatric clinic with multiple medications who died from doxepin intoxication is reported. Concentrations of doxepin metabolites and isomers, pharmacokinetic modelling and genotyping of the doxepin-metabolizing cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes led to the following conclusion: the lethal doxepin concentration of 2100 ng/mL was more likely to have been reached due to drug interactions and genetic peculiarities leading to a reduction of the metabolic capacity and not by an acute (suicidal) overdose.

Using EDX, lead and some other metallic elements were detected in paraffin-blocks in which skin samples from a gunshot wound were embedded. Lead was not identified in control samples from non-injured cases. These findings indicate that EDX is a useful method for rapid non-destructive analysis of paraffin-embedded blocks. This technique can provide scientific evidence for identification of a firearm even after storing the sample for a long time. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The initial gastrointestinal symptoms were followed by intravascular haemolysis and renal failure. The course was favourable after symptomatic treatment and specific copper chelation therapy. However, the pathogenesis is not fully understood and with the present state of knowledge, no one treatment can be said to be superior to another. The authors discuss the various treatments of this rare poisoning through a review of the available literature. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There have been increasing calls for more gender-specific service provision to support young men's (20-29 years) mental health and well-being. In Ireland, young men are the demographic group that are most likely to die by suicide but among the least likely to seek help. This study sought to investigate service providers' perspectives on the factors that support or inhibit young men from engaging in services targeted at supporting their mental/emotional well-being. Qualitative methodologies (focus groups, n = 9; interviews, n = 7) were used for this study. Disconnection from family and community was identified as a key indicator of at-risk groups of young men who, more typically, had experienced significant disruption in their lives. The discord between demands and expectations facing young men on one hand, and insufficient life-management and coping skills on the other, left many young men vulnerable and bereft. The desire to save face and preserve one's masculine identity was linked to young men's reluctance to seek help when feeling down. There was a strong consensus that there could be no shortcuts to [re]connecting with young men. While sport, technology, and social media were cited as appropriate media in which to engage young men, the essence of sustained connection revolved around creating safety, trust, rapport, and meaningful relationships. The findings from this study have informed the development of a Train the Trainer program (Connecting with Young Men), which is currently being delivered to service providers in Ireland and which may have implications for service provision elsewhere.

AB Home-based treatment has been promoted as an alternative to hospital admission over the last 30 years, with the system in England being particularly well developed. There is less stigma, patients and families appear to prefer treatment at home, and there has been a significant reduction in the number of acute beds. In more recent years, there have been criticisms of the lack of effect on reducing hospital admissions and concerns have also been raised about patient safety. Home-based treatment is being further developed on the island of Ireland, and this will hopefully be influenced by current and future local research.

AB The kinematic motion analysis of 50 jumps from a height of 5 m demonstrated distinguishable maxima of jumping distances between passive and active jumps (1.0-3.4 and 3.7-7.1 m, respectively). The variation of several parameters concerning the 'take-off' mechanism showed less influence regarding the jumping distances.
   The congruence of the trajectory of the 'free-flight' domains of thejumps and the simple model for the parabola of an inclined throw has been proven. Thus, a prediction of the distance range for heights up to 20 m, was extrapolated. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between severity of borderline personality features and history of suicide attempt (NSA) in male substance-dependent inpatients and the effect of anger, hostility and aggression on this relationship. Further, the effect of some variables that may be related to suicide and/or borderline personality, such as age at inception of regular substance use, substance of dependence (alcohol/drug), depression, and both state and trait anxiety, were controlled. Participants were 200 consecutively admitted male substance-dependent inpatients. Patients were investigated with the Borderline Personality Inventory (BPI), the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (AQ), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Among substance-dependent inpatients, 33.0% (n = 66) were identified as the group with HSA. Mean scores employment status, marital status and duration of education did not differ between groups, whereas current age and age at onset of regular substance use were lower in group with NSA. Mean scores of BPI, AQ and its subscales (anger, hostility and physical/verbal aggression), BDI and STAI were higher in the HSA group. In addition, the rates of drug dependency and borderline personality disorder were higher in this group. The severity of borderline personality symptoms was highly correlated with subscales of the AQ, depression and anxiety, whereas it was negatively correlated with age at onset of regular substance use. The severity of anger and borderline personality features predicted HSA in the logistic regression model. Results suggest that, to reduce the risk of suicide attempt among substance-dependent patients, the feeling of anger must be the target of evaluation and treatment among those with borderline personality features.

AB Counterterrorism strategies involving the killing of terrorists are a prominently used but controversial practice. Proponents argue that such strategies are useful tools for reducing terrorist activity, while critics question their effectiveness. This article provides empirical insight into this strategy by conducting a series of negative binomial regression and Tobit estimations of the impact of killing Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) terrorists as well as members of the Catholic community on counts of PIRA bombings and targeting activity in Northern Ireland for the period 1970-1998. We consider the impact of discriminate and indiscriminate killings (where only PIRA militants are killed versus those in which both militants and civilians are also killed) on subsequent PIRA improvised explosive device (IED) attacks. Our findings illustrate that while total and discriminate counterterrorism killings have little to no effect on PIRA IED attacks, indiscriminate counterterrorism killings increased PIRA bombings overall and prompted the Provisional IRA to specifically target civilians in IED events. We conclude by discussing the scholarly and policy implications of these findings.

AB Increased evidence indicates an association between psychiatric disorders and dietary pattern. The objective of this study is to describe the differences in food consumption between suicide attempters and non-attempters. We analyzed the dietary information retrospectively collected from 6803 adults, aged 17 to 39 years, who also completed a mental disorder diagnostic interview as a part of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-1994. The Healthy Eating Index score was used to measure the degree of compliance with the national diet guidelines. In men, attempters (n=92) had a high odds of low consumption of vegetables (OR=2.47, 95%CI=1.19, 5.15). In women, attempters (n=275) had a high odds of insufficient fruit consumption (OR=2.36, 95%CI= 1.15, 4.85). For both men and women, the component scores for meat were lower in non-attempters compared with attempters. On a scale of zero (no serving) to 10 (meeting the serving recommendations), the scores were 6.74 (SE: 0.39) and 7.76 (0.10), respectively, for attempters and non-attempters among men, and 5.81 (0.33) and 6.43 (0.07), respectively, for attempters and non-attempters among women. It was further observed that female attempters ate significantly less fish and seafood. These results were obtained after adjustment for various factors, including the history of medical and psychiatric illnesses. The data suggest that fruits, vegetables and meat were significantly under-consumed in adults who had ever attempted suicide. The deleterious contribution of insufficient consumption of these foods to physical and psychiatric status in attempters merits investigation. In clinical practice, psychiatrists should pay more attention to what patients eat. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In our work, we have evaluated efficiency of gene-directed enzyme/prodrug therapy (GDEPT) based on combination of fusion yeast cytosine deaminase (yCD) and 5-fluorocytosine (5FC) on model human medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) cell line TT. We determined the efficiency of this GDEPT approach in suicide and bystander cytotoxicity induction. We have shown significant bystander effect in vitro and 5FC administration resulted in potent antitumor effect in vivo. Furthermore, we have unraveled high efficiency of cell-mediated GDEPT, when human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) were used as delivery vehicles in direct cocultures in vitro. Nevertheless, effector MSC exhibited inhibitory effect on TT cell proliferation and abrogated TT xenotransplant growth in vivo. We suggest that yCD/5FC combination represents another experimental treatment modality to be tested in MTC and our data further support the exploration of MSC antitumor potential for future use in metastatic MTC therapy.

AB Specimens of blood and other body fluids were obtained at autopsy from all deaths in Sweden classified as suicide covering a 10-year period (N = 11,441 cases). The mean age (+/- standard deviation, SD) of the victims was 51.3 +/- 18.8 years witha clear predominance of males 71%(mean age 51.3 +/- 18.8 years) compared with 29% females (mean age 51.4 +/- 18.9 years). The concentration of ethanol in blood samples was determined in duplicate by headspace gas chromatography and a mean blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.1 g/L (10 mg/100 mL) was the cut-off used to identify ethanol positive cases. The suicides were coded (ICD-9) as self-poisonings (N = 2462, 22%), hanging (N = 4474, 39%), asphyxia by gas (N = 509, 4.4%), drowning (N = 803, 7.0%), gun shot (N = 1307, 11.4%), fall from height (N = 632, 5.5%), self-inflicted cuts or sharp-force injury (N = 363, 3.1%) and miscellaneous ways (N = 891, 7.8%). On average 34% of all suicide victims in Sweden had consumed alcohol before death, 36% of the males and 31% of the females had a positive BAC. The mean (median) concentration of alcohol in femoral blood for men was 1.34 g/L (1.3 g/L) compared with 1.25 g/L (1.1 g/L) for women. Many victims were heavily intoxicated and the 90th percentiles of the BAC distributions ranged from 2.3 to 2.8 g/L depending on manner of death. Elevated blood-alcohol was most prevalent in poisoning deaths (45%) and gas asphyxia (51%) and least prevalent in falls from height (19%) and sharp-force injury (18%). Toxicological analysis for presence of drugs other than alcohol showed a predominance of paracetamol, SSRI antidepressants, anti-psychotics, sedative-hypnotics, and centrally acting opioids. A host of psycho-social factors drive a person to commit suicide and one of the catalysts is over-consumption of alcohol and acute alcohol intoxication. Heavy drinking leads to a loss of inhibitions, impulsive behaviour, poor judgment and a tendency to take risks, all of which might increase the propensity of predisposed individuals to take their own lives.

AB Suicide is a leading cause of preventable death. Epidemiological studies have shown strong associations between sub-threshold psychotic experiences and risk for suicidal ideation and behavior. Screens designed to assess psychotic experiences may have clinical utility in improving suicide prevention efforts. In the current study, we hypothesized that the Prodromal Questionnaire-Brief (PQ-B) would reliably distinguish levels of suicidal ideation within a sample of college students (n=376). As predicted, PQ-B scores varied significantly across levels of suicidal ideation, both when treated as a raw count of sub-threshold psychotic experiences and when taking into account subjective distress associated with those symptoms. In addition, we explored the feasibility of developing a short screen based on the most discriminating items, finding that a six-item version of the PQ-B yielded higher accuracy for detecting elevated suicidal ideation over the full measure. The PQ-B has the potential for clinical utility in detecting groups that might be at increased risk for suicidal ideation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE health; inequality; mortality; homicide; suicide
ID INCOME INEQUALITY; POPULATION HEALTH; ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; DETERMINANT;
   TRENDS
AB We investigate whether changes in economic inequality affect mortality in rich countries. To answer this question we use a new source of data on income inequality: tax data on the share of pretax income going to the richest 10% of the population in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US between 1903 and 2003. Although this measure is not a good proxy for inequality within the bottom half of the income distribution, it is a good proxy for changes in the top half of the distribution and for the Gini coefficient. In the absence of country and year fixed effects, the income share of the top decile is negatively related to life expectancy and positively related to infant mortality. However, in our preferred fixed-effects specification these relationships are weak, statistically insignificant, and likely to change their sign. Nor do our data suggest that changes in the income share of the richest 10% affect homicide or suicide rates. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with suicidal ideation and behavior, and is found to frequently co-occur with other conditions that exacerbate the risk for suicidal behavior. Despite these findings, few individuals with PTSD engage in suicidal acts, and there has been little research to examine those factors that protect against such behaviors. The current study used path analysis to examine the association among PTSD, depression, hazardous alcohol consumption, and beliefs about suicide (i.e., reasons for living) in a community sample with motor vehicle accident related-PTSD (N=50). Reasons for living were inversely associated with PTSD, depression, and alcohol use. Further, depression symptom severity accounted for the association between PTSD symptom severity and reasons for living. In contrast, hazardous alcohol consumption only demonstrated a trend for accounting for the association between PTSD and reasons for living. Our findings highlight the importance of clinicians assessing co-occurring depression symptoms and suggest the potential use of interventions that promote adaptive cognitions about suicide among people with PTSD.

ID DIFFICULTIES QUESTIONNAIRE; STRENGTHS; TROUBLES
AB There is consistent evidence that the rate of emotional, social and behavioural problems found in children and adolescents in out-of-home placements or state care is substantially higher than that of children and adolescents living with their families. However, with a few small-scale studies as exceptions, to date there has been little research carried out into the mental health needs of adolescents living in state care in Northern Ireland. This study aimed to examine the mental health needs of young people aged between 10 and 15 years living in state care in Northern Ireland. Data were collected on 165 adolescents via an analysis of case file data, questionnaires and interviews with social workers. It was found that the 70.3% of the young people scored within the abnormal and borderline ranges of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) total difficulties score indicating "high risk'' for meeting the criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis. Over the course of 1 year living in state care, 10 of the 165 adolescents had attempted suicide and 14 had engaged in deliberate self-harm. Nevertheless, social workers still rated the vast majority (92%) of these young people's overall health as being "as good as'', or "better than'' other young people in their age. It is concluded that as this group of young people have significant contact with health and social services, potential opportunities exist to develop the therapeutic potential of the experience of being "looked after'' in state care. They are a uniquely vulnerable group and their care and treatment may be considered as a minority rights issue which deserves a higher profile in the human rights agenda.

ID DEPRESSION
AB Suicidal behavior is a major health risk in psychiatric disorders, especially in schizophrenia, wherein up to 10% patients will commit suicide. However, the neurobiology of suicide is still unclear. Suicidality has been related to decreased central serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) function and reduced cholesterol levels. Platelet 5-HT has been used as a peripheral marker of the central serotonergic synaptosomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate serum cholesterol and platelet 5-HT concentrations in suicidal and non-suicidal men in the first episode of psychosis and in healthy male controls. Venous blood samples were collected within 24 h of admission, and serum cholesterol and platelet 5-HT were determined enzymatically and fluorimetrically. Platelet 5-HT and serum cholesterol concentrations were significantly lower in suicidal than in non-suicidal patients in the first episode of psychosis, and also lower than in healthy controls. Our results suggest that lower concentrations of serum cholesterol and platelet 5-HT in patients with a first episode of psychosis might be useful biological markers of suicidality.

AB Lifetime substance abuse comorbidity is frequent in schizophrenic patients, but the clinical correlates remain unclear. We have explored the chronological relations between substance abuse and course of schizophrenia, and compared several clinical characteristics and personality dimensions in 50 schizophrenic patients with or without lifetime substance abuse or dependence. Abuse occurred mainly after the first prodromal symptoms and just before the first psychotic episode. Substance-abusing patients were not different from non-substance-abusing patients on the Chapman Physical Anhedonia Scale, PANSS total score, negative subscore or depression item, CGI, treatment response and demographic variables. In contrast, substance-abusing patients had higher scores on the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (total, cognitive and non-planning scores) and had attempted suicide more often. In patients with schizophrenia, as in the general population, substance abuse or dependence appears associated with higher impulsivity and suicidality. High impulsivity could facilitate substance abuse as a maladaptative behavior in response to prodromal symptoms. precipitating the onset of a characterized psychosis.

AB Impulsivity is a multidimensional construct and has been previously associated with suicidal behaviour in borderline personality disorder (BPD). This study examined the associations between suicidal behaviour and impulsivity-related personality traits, as well as history of childhood sexual abuse, in 76 patients diagnosed with BPD using both the Structured Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders III (DSM-III) Axis-II diagnoses and the self-personality questionnaire. Impulsivity-related traits were measured using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11), the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI) and the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R). We found that hostility and childhood sexual abuse, but not impulsivity or other temperament traits, significantly predicted the presence, number and severity of previous suicide attempts. Hostility traits and childhood sexual abuse showed an impact on suicide attempts in BPD. Our results support previous findings indicating that high levels of hostility and having suffered sexual abuse during childhood lead to an increased risk for suicidal behaviour in BPD.

AB Cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) is a neuropeptide expressed in brain regions thought to regulate anxiety levels, depression, addiction and energy homeostasis. Individuals with a CART mutation display increased anxiety and depression. Severe anxiety is a core phenomenon of suicidality. We therefore Studied levels of CART in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 98 patients with different psychiatric diagnoses, shortly after a Suicide attempt. We also investigated the relationship between CSF-CART and relevant psychiatric symptoms. CART levels were determined using a radioimmunoassay and the psychiatric symptoms rated in structured interviews using the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS) and the Karolinska Scales of personality (KSP). No differences in CSF-CART were found between the diagnostic groups or controls. However, lower CART levels were associated with a higher degree of concentration difficulties. No significant association was found between CART levels and other psychiatric symptoms. CSF-CART correlated significantly with CSF-levels of orexin, but not with corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF). Further Studies on the role of CART in psychiatric diseases where concentration difficulties are prominent, such as attention deficit disorder, are warranted. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess physician assistant training programs incorporation of firearm injury prevention training in their curricula. Also, content of such programs as well as perceived benefits and barriers of providing such training were explored.
   Methods: A three-wave postal mailing of a 24-item questionnaire was sent to the population (n = 145) of physician assistant program directors.
   Results: The majority (77%) of directors responded. The majority (81.3%) reported they had not seriously thought about providing such training (pre-contemplation). The three most important barriers to providing firearm injury prevention training were: lack of time, lack of faculty expertise on the topic, and lack of standardized teaching materials. Those programs that offered training averaged one-half hour. Yet, 77.7% thought that firearm injuries were a very large or large problem to the health and wellbeing of the U.S. population.
   Conclusion: There is a paucity of professional training for physician assistants regarding firearm injury prevention. It appears unlikely that physician assistants are playing a role in helping to reduce one of the leading causes of death in the U.S., firearm trauma. The American Academy of Physician Assistants needs to take the lead in improving training in this area for physician assistants. Practice Implications: Physician Assistant training program directors should consider offering firearm injury prevention training to help reduce patient suicides and homicides.

AB Methanol is a potent neurotoxic substance that causes severe metabolic acidosis and serious neurological disorders. Most of the cases are accidental exposures to drinking beverages contaminated with methanol. There are few articles reporting pure methanol intoxication; however, it is well known that small quantities of pure methanol causes blindness and death, the minimum lethal dose being 50-100 ml. A case report is presented of a 67-year-old woman, who committed suicide by ingestion of 500 ml of absolute methanol. Despite symptomatic and supportive intensive care, the woman died 23 h after hospital admission due to metabolic acidosis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. A complete medico-legal autopsy was performed. Grossly, there was complete detachment of the oesophagus mucosa and brownish discolouration of the gastric mucosa. Histological findings showed diffuse haemorrhagic necrosis of the stomach mucosa and intense acute inflammatory infiltration of the lamina propria. To our knowledge, this is the first autopsy report of such severe digestive injuries. A discussion and review of the recent literature on the subject are given. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Compared to general population, pathological gamblers are 3.4 times more likely to attempt suicide. Our objective was to identify specific profiles of problem gamblers (PGs) with suicidal risk according to sociodemographic, clinical and gambling characteristics.
   The PGs cohort, called "EVALJEU", consists in the inclusion of any new PG seeking treatment in our Department. Patients underwent a semi-structured clinical interview and completed self-report questionnaires. The "suicidal risk module" of the Mini International Psychiatric interview (MINI) allowed to constitute two groups of patients that were compared, according to the presence of a suicidal risk. A logistic regression was performed to identify factors related to suicidal risk in PGs. In our sample (N=194), 40.21% presented a suicidal risk. A history of major depression and anxiety disorders were predictors of suicidal risk as well as the perceived inability to stop gambling.
   Suicidality is a significant clinical concern in PGs. Therefore, three specific predictors, identified by our study, must be assessed. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB AimsAcute drug overdose, especially with paracetamol, may cause acute liver failure leading to registration for transplantation (ALFT). Population statistics and between-country differences for ALFT related to overdose have been poorly described. The aim of the present study was to evaluate overdose ALFT in the multi-country Study of Acute Liver Transplantation (SALT).
   MethodsAll adult overdose-related ALFT, with or without suicidal intent, in France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and the UK between 2005 and 2007 were identified from liver transplant registries and hospital records. These were compared with whole-country and per capita use of paracetamol.
   ResultsSix hundred cases of ALFT were identified in 52 of 57 eligible transplant centres, of which 114 involved overdose (72 intentional, 10 non-intentional, 32 uncertain). Overdose represented 20% of all-cause ALFT: Ireland 52%, UK 28%, France 18%, the Netherlands 8%, and Italy 1%. Overdose ALFT were mostly females (61%), mean age 33.610.9years. A total of 111 (97%) of the overdoses involved paracetamol. Event rates ranged from one ALFT for 20.7 tons of paracetamol in Ireland, to one for 1074 tons in Italy and one case in 60 million inhabitants over 3years in Italy to one case in 286000 inhabitants per year in Ireland. Per-country event rates for non-overdose ALFT exposed to paracetamol were between 2.5 and 4.0 per million treatment-years sold.
   ConclusionsParacetamol overdose was found to represent one-sixth of all-cause ALFT. There was a 50-fold difference in Europe in the rates of paracetamol overdose ALFT, and a 200-fold difference per million inhabitants.

ID SUICIDE; MORTALITY; NEUROENDOCRINE; ASSOCIATION
AB We investigated the effect of cholesterol on serotonergic receptor function in 20 healthy male and 10 healthy female subjects using cortisol responses to meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) neuroendocrine challenge tests. M-CPP, a metabolite of the antidepressant trazodone, has been widely used in psychopharmacology research as a probe of serotonin function. In the human brain, m-CPP binds both to various serotonergic receptors, mainly 5-HT2C, and to alpha (2)-adrenoceptors. After an overnight fast, the subjects received m-CPP (0.5 mg/kg) or identical placebo capsules orally in a randomized, double blind, crossover design. Blood was obtained for measurement of cholesterol and cortisol. In some analyses, especially in males, there were significant positive correlations between serum cholesterol levels and cortisol responses. These findings suggest the possibility that serum cholesterol levels may be positively associated with serotonergic receptor function. The existence of such an association may provide an explanation for reported increases in depression, suicide and violence in individuals with low or lowered cholesterol.

TI Study of unusual phenomenon of contact firing on gelatine block using

SO FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL

DT Article
DE contact wound; gelatine block; wound ballistic parameters
AB Gunshot wounds in suicide cases are self-inflicted wounds. Self-inflicted wounds in suicide cases are usually caused by contact firing and are of great forensic significance. Evaluation of contact wound may be associated with difficulties if the bore gets obstruction prior to firing. This paper investigates the phenomenon and interprets the results of test firing conducted on 20% gelatine block at 10 degreesC, using .38 Special revolver with obstruction of a bullet in the bore. Test firings were conducted in three different muzzle-target contact conditions keeping the muzzle pressed against the gel block in each case. The physical evidence and the wound ballistic parameter namely bullet track, remaining velocity of the bullets and volume of permanent cavity have been studied. When compared with the results of contact firing conducted with the same firearm without having any bore obstruction under similar conditions, it has been found that the physical evidence and the wound ballistic parameters would be helpful for interpretation of such unusual incidents for forensic inference.

ID INTOXICATION; DEATH
AB A 19-year-old woman suspect of a suicidal drug intoxication was exhumed after a 10-month earth-grave, because the police was accused of manslaughter and neglected help by the relatives of the deceased. Toxicologic analysis revealed as the cause of death do acute chloroquine intoxication. An expert opinion had to deal with the question if the woman would have been saved if the police had appeared earlier. Therefore the duration of agonal period after suicidal chloroquine ingestion was important. An estimation of the time since death was possible on the one hand ex-post from the development of cadaveric changes and supravital reactions and on the other hand, based on premortal changes detectable on the body together with the findings of the authorities. Taking into account all evidence the woman was probably already dead at or prior to the arrival of the police (110 min after ingestion), at least this could not be excluded. Chloroquine has to be considered to be useful for fatal poisoning, which is also recommended in some publications on methods to commit suicide. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB High rates of anxiety disorders, including panic disorder (PD), have been found in patients suffering from alcohol dependence (AD). It has been suggested that alcoholic subjects with PD represent a more severe subgroup of patients. Eighty-nine patients with 'pure' AD (without abuse of other drugs) were examined and compared for the presence of PD. Several clinical scales were administered to assess symptomatology and severity. Twenty-three patients (25.8%) met the criteria for PD. The mean age at onset for alcohol use was 18.7 versus 28.5 years for PD onset. Our finding of an earlier onset for alcoholism than for PD in a sample of Spanish patients illustrates the potential importance of transcultural factors. These patients were more likely to be women and to have first-degree relatives with PD. Overall, alcoholic patients with comorbid PD showed greater clinical severity. They were found to have more comorbidity with axis I disorders (major depression and dysthymia), greater clinical severity, and a history of more suicide attempts.

AB Objective: To identify the proportion of female carers who experience death thoughts and the factors associated with these thoughts, using data from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH).
   Methods:A cross-sectional analysis of the fifth ALSWH survey was conducted. 10,528 middle-aged women provided data on caring and death thoughts, 3077 were carers and 2005 of those were included in the multivariate analysis.
   Results: 7.1% of female carers had felt life was not worth living in the previous week and were classified as having experienced death thoughts, compared with 5.7% of non-carers (p = .01). Carers with death thoughts had poorer physical and mental health, higher levels of anxiety, lower levels of optimism, and reported less social support (p < .01). In a multivariate model social support, mental health, carer satisfaction, and depressive symptoms significantly predicted death thoughts. Carers with clinically significant depressive symptoms were four times more likely to experience death thoughts than those without. Carers who were satisfied with their role were 50% less likely to have experienced death, thoughts than those who were dissatisfied.
   Conclusions: A small but significant proportion of female carers experience death thoughts and may be at risk for suicide. These findings add to the growing body of evidence on suicide-related thoughts and behaviours in carers and have implications for health professionals and service providers.

AB Organophosphorus (OP) insecticide self-poisoning is responsible for about one-quarter of global suicides. Treatment focuses on the fact that OP compounds inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE): however, AChE-reactivating drugs do not benefit poisoned humans. We therefore studied the role of solvent coformulants in OP toxicity in a novel minipig model of agricultural OP poisoning. Gottingen minipigs were orally poisoned with clinically relevant doses of agricultural emulsifiable concentrate (EC) dimethoate, dimethoate active ingredient (AI) alone, or solvents. Cardiorespiratory physiology and neuromuscular (NMJ) function, blood AChE activity, and arterial lactate concentration were monitored for 12 h to assess poisoning severity. Poisoning with agricultural dimethoate EC40, but not saline, caused respiratory arrest within 30 min, severe distributive shock and NMJ dysfunction, that was similar to human poisoning. Mean arterial lactate rose to 15.6 [SD 2.8] mm in poisoned pigs compared to 1,4[0.4] in controls. Moderate toxicity resulted from poisoning with dimethoate AI alone, or the major solvent cyclohexanone. Combining dimethoate with cyclohexanone reproduced severe poisoning characteristic of agricultural dimethoate EC poisoning. A formulation without cyclohexanone showed less mammalian toxicity. These results indicate that solvents play a crucial role in dimethoate toxicity. Regulatory assessment of pesticide toxicity should include solvents as well as the AIs which currently dominate the assessment. Reformulation of OP insecticides to ensure that the agricultural product has lower mammalian toxicity could result in fewer deaths after suicidal ingestion and rapidly reduce global suicide rates.

AB Postmortem brain studies have shown abnormal levels of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially docosahexaenoic acid, in the frontal cortex (particularly the orbitofrontal cortex) of patients with depression, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder. However, the results from regions in the frontal cortex other than the orbitofrontal cortex are inconsistent. In this study we investigated whether patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder have abnormalities in PUFA levels in the prefrontal cortex [Brodmann area (BA) 8]. In postmortem studies, fatty acids in the phospholipids of the prefrontal cortex (BA8) were evaluated by thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography. Specimens were evaluated for patients with schizophrenia (n=15), bipolar disorder (n=15), or major depressive disorder (n=15) and compared with unaffected controls (n=15). In contrast to previous studies, we found no significant differences in the levels of PUFAs or other fatty acids in the prefrontal cortex (BA8) between patients and controls. Subanalysis by sex also showed no significant differences. No significant differences were found in any individual fatty acids between suicide and non-suicide cases. These psychiatric disorders might be characterized by very specific fatty acid compositions in certain areas of the brain, and BA8 might not be involved in abnormalities of PUFA metabolism.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) involves deliberate acts (such as cutting) that directly damage the body but occur without suicidal intent. However, other non-suicidal behaviors that involve people mistreating or abusing themselves but that do not deliberately and directly damage bodily tissue may have much in common with NSSI. Such 'indirect' methods of self-injury might include involvement in abusive relationships, substance abuse, risky or reckless behavior, or eating disordered behavior. Using a community sample (N = 156) we compared individuals engaging in NSSI (n = 50), indirect (non-suicidal) self-injurers (n = 38), and healthy controls (n = 68) on a range of clinical and personality characteristics. As predicted, non-suicidal self-injurers and indirect self-injurers showed more pathology than healthy controls on all measures. Comparisons of the NSSI and the Indirect self-injury groups revealed no significant differences on measures of dissociation, aggression, impulsivity, self-esteem, negative temperament, depressive symptoms, and borderline personality disorder. However, compared to people who engaged only in indirect forms of self-injury, those who engaged in NSSI were more self-critical, had higher scores on a measure of suicide proneness, and had a history of more suicide attempts. The findings suggest that NSSI and indirect self-injury are best viewed as separate and distinct clinical phenomena. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB For hepatocarcinoma (HCC) gene therapy, the tumoricidal efficacy and selective expression of therapeutic gene remain two major challenges. The Escherichia coli (E. coli) purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP)/9-(2-deoxy-beta-dribofuranosyl)-6-methylpurine (MeP-dR) suicide gene system exhibits excellent anti-tumor effects, indicating this system directed by a HCC-specific promoter would offer a possibility of targeting gene therapy for HCC. To test this hypothesis, here, we prepared a plasmid (p[HRE]AF/PNP) containing the E. coli PNP/MeP-dR system and a chimeric human alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) promoter, [HRE]AF. We introduced this plasmid into AFP-positive and low-AFP-generating human HCC cells, and evaluated its therapeutic effects on both human HCC cell lines. In the presence of hypoxia, the E. coli PNP gene directed by the [HRE]AF promoter were HCC-specifically expressed in two human HCC cell lines and, moreover, the [HRE]AF-PNP/MeP-dR therapy would yield significant and selective cytotoxicity in both AFP-positive and low-AFP-generating HCC cells. Our findings suggest the [HRE]AF-PNP/MeP-dR therapy has worthy potentialities as an effective strategy for targeting therapy of AFP-positive, and especially AFP-negative or low-AFP-generating HCC.

ID DEATH; EUTHANASIA; INJECTION; BLOOD; DRUGS
AB Pentobarbital is a barbiturate, acting as a central nervous system depressant (CNS), being used for its anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic and anaesthetic properties. Barbiturates were replaced by benzodiazepines, leading to a decrease in poisoning cases with these compounds. However, pentobarbital is still used in many countries as an anaesthetic in veterinary medicine. Due to its properties, this compound is sought after by people who wish to commit suicide, acquiring it on the black market.
   The authors present an unusual fatal pentobarbital intoxication case, in a 37 years-old male salesperson, with no known connection with the veterinary field, being more difficult to obtain this compound.
   Toxicological results in cardiac blood revealed the presence of pentobarbital (111 mg/L), ethanol (0.94 g/L), diazepam (33 ng/mL), nordiazepam (50 ng/mL), oxazepam (3.3 ng/mL), temazepam (5.3 ng/mL), and metoclopramide. No illicit drugs were detected.
   Pentobarbital analysis in urine and gastric content was also positive, as well as its presence in the glass powder and in the bottle residue sent to the laboratory.
   In the present case, it was possible to conclude that the death was a suicide due to pentobarbital intoxication in association with other depressants of the CNS (benzodiazepines and ethanol).
   It is important to search pentobarbital in routine toxicological analyses, since it is one of the drugs most frequently mentioned by entities defending "painless death", advising the simultaneous use of metoclopramide for emesis avoidance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: The presented case deals with an unusual suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. In a car parked in a highway rest area, the body of a middle-aged man was found. In the open trunk of the car there was a gas-powered generator which was switched on, but no longer running. The tank was three quarters full. At autopsy, bright-red livores, cherry-pink fingernails, cherry-red blood and salmon-red skeletal musculature were found. According to the toxicological analysis performed during autopsy, the COHb content in the corpse blood was 68%.
   Methods: To reconstruct the event, the emergency generator was started again in the man's car. By means of measuring probes placed in the interior of the car, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and oxygen were measured and recorded in a concentration-time curve; the concentration of cyanide was measured at the end of the experiment.
   Results: The lower explosion limit of 500 ppm CO was reached after 30 s already. For technical reasons, no further values could be recorded. After about 14 min the engine started stuttering with approximately 14 vol.% of oxygen in the air, but continued to run at a lower speed until the experiment was stopped after 25 min. The final concentration of cyanide was 7.5 ppm.
   Conclusion: In view of the rapid CO increase in the interior of the vehicle it is to be assumed that the victim lost consciousness very fast. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Gelsemium elegans Benth. (Loganiaceae), a toxic plant indigenous to southeastern Asia, is well known among hilltribes as an effective means for committing suicide. A crude alkaloidal fraction from its leaves was isolated by conventional acid-base extraction. Tests in animals showed that the alkaloids exerted analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. At a lethal dose, the alkaloids produced violent clonic convulsions that led to respiratory failure. Since the convulsions could be prevented by pentobarbital or diazepam and potentiated by reserpine, it is postulated that the alkaloids act centrally against GABA action.

AB Context: Recent evidence from both clinical and population research has pointed to psychotic symptoms as potentially important markers of risk for suicidal behavior. However, to our knowledge, there have been no epidemiological studies to date that have reported data on psychotic symptoms and suicidality in individuals who have been clinically assessed for suicidal behavior.
   Objectives: To explore associations between psychotic symptoms in nonpsychotic adolescents and risk for suicidal behavior in (1) the general population, (2) adolescents with psychiatric disorder, and (3) adolescents with suicidal ideation.
   Design: Two independently conducted case-control clinical interview studies.
   Setting: Population-based studies in Ireland.
   Participants: Study 1 included 212 adolescents aged 11 to 13 years. Study 2 included 211 adolescents aged 13 to 15 years. Participants were recruited from schools.
   Main Outcome Measures: Suicidal behavior and psychotic symptoms, assessed by semi-structured diagnostic clinical interview.
   Results: Psychotic symptoms were associated with a 10-fold increased odds of any suicidal behavior (ideation, plans, or acts) in both the early and middle adolescence studies (odds ratio [OR], 10.23; 95% CI, 3.25-32.26; P<.001 and OR, 10.5; 95% CI, 3.14-35.17; P<.001, respectively). Adolescents with depressive disorders who also experienced psychotic symptoms were at a nearly 14-fold increased odds of more severe suicidal behavior (suicide plans and suicide acts) compared with adolescents with depressive disorders who did not experience psychotic symptoms (OR, 13.7; 95% CI, 2.1-89.6). Among all adolescents with suicidal ideation, those who also reported psychotic symptoms had a nearly 20-fold increased odds of suicide plans and suicide acts compared with adolescents with suicidal ideation who did not report psychotic symptoms (OR, 19.6; 95% CI, 1.8216.1).
   Conclusions: Psychotic symptoms are strongly associated with increased risk for suicidal behavior in the general adolescent population and in adolescents with (nonpsychotic) psychiatric disorder. In both studies, an absolute majority of adolescents with more severe suicidal behavior (suicidal plans and acts) reported psychotic symptoms when directly questioned about this as part of a psychiatric interview. Assessment of psychotic symptoms should form a key part of suicide risk assessment.

AB Hanging as a method of attempting suicide is increasing in incidence. A retrospective review of victims of hanging injuries presenting to our institution over a 5-year period was performed. Forty-two cases were reviewed. Drug and/or alcohol ingestion was identified in 70% of cases. There were no cervical spine injuries identified, although two unexpected thoracic spine fractures were found. There was an 88% survival rate, with a low incidence (5%) of poor neurological outcome. The Glasgow Coma Score at scene or on arrival at hospital was found to be a prognostic indicator. Victims without spontaneous cardiac output at scene did not survive, even if cardiopulmonary resuscitation was successful initially. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fewer men than women are diagnosed with depression, although commentaries about men's depression suggest that the lower reported rates may be due to the widespread use of generic diagnostic criteria that are not sensitive to depression in men, as well as men's reluctance to express concerns about their mental health or access professional health care services. This article provides an overview of the connections between depression and masculinities and, based on that literature, recommendations are made for how we might better understand, identify and treat men's depression in gender-sensitive ways.

AB Rates of hospital-treated self-harm are highest among young people. The current study examined trends in rates of self-harm among young people in Ireland over a 10-year period, as well as trends in self-harm methods.
   Data from the National Self-Harm Registry Ireland on presentations to hospital emergency departments (EDs) following self-harm by those aged 10-24 years during the period 2007-2016 were included. We calculated annual self-harm rates per 100,000 by age, gender and method of self-harm. Poisson regression models were used to examine trends in rates of self-harm.
   The average person-based rate of self-harm among 10-24-year-olds was 318 per 100,000. Peak rates were observed among 15-19-year-old females (564 per 100,000) and 20-24-year-old males (448 per 100,000). Between 2007 and 2016, rates of self-harm increased by 22%, with increases most pronounced for females and those aged 10-14 years. There were marked increases in specific methods of self-harm, including those associated with high lethality.
   The findings indicate that the age of onset of self-harm is decreasing. Increasing rates of self-harm, along with increases in highly lethal methods, indicate that targeted interventions in key transition stages for young people are warranted.

AB We report on a case of intoxication with a mix of new psychoactive substances. A 38-year-old male was brought to the emergency department (ED) following the ingestion of an unknown drug in a suicide attempt. During the transport, he became progressively more somnolent and unresponsive to painful stimuli. Urine and stomach content were collected on admission to be screened for drugs of abuse and medicinal drugs. After admission, the patient's next of kin presented five small grip seal plastic bags containing different powders/crystals, and they were sent for analysis along with urine and stomach content to the toxicology laboratory. An easy and rapid sample preparation technique was applied for the extraction of urine and stomach content. Samples were extracted with liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) technique and analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A small amount of powder material from the bags was diluted in methanol and injected directly into the GC-MS instrument. Obtained spectra (EI) were evaluated against SWGDRUG library. Five different designer drugs were identified in the powder material, including synthetic cannabinoids (AB-CHMINACA, AB-FUBINACA) and synthetic cathinones (alpha-PHP, alpha-PVP and 4-CMC). With the exception of 4-CMC, all of these substances were also detected in the stomach content along with the prescription drugs. This is the first time that a positive identification of these five drugs has been made by a clinical laboratory in Slovenia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MENTAL-HEALTH; SUICIDE; BRITAIN; BORN
AB More than a quarter of a million people left Ireland for Britain in the 1940s and 1950s. The literature on the Irish experience in Britain reveals high levels of social deprivation and poor health, some of which has been attributed to prejudice and discrimination, the legacy of a colonial relationship. Other commentators have suggested the more interwoven complexities for Irish migrants in Britain of maintaining an authentic identity. In this paper we explore the myth of return, encompassing notions of identity and settlement for this cohort of Irish people, now in the latter part of their lives. They discuss complex, conflicting attitudes to 'home' and belonging. We used focus groups and semi-structured in-depth interviews to explore their reasons for, and experience of, migration and their attitudes to the possibility of return. Many of the informants, particularly single men, detailed their lives as exiles, unable to return to Ireland and poorly connected to British life. They describe a state of disconnection to both worlds. Others have been able to obtain, over time, a relatively contented existence in the UK.

AB Background Studies conducted in the UK and in Ireland have reported increased rates of self-harm in adolescent females from around the time of the 2008 economic recession and through periods of subsequent national austerity programme implementation. It is not known if incidence rates have increased similarly in other Western European countries during this period. Methods Data from interlinked national administrative registers were extracted for individuals born in Denmark during 1981-2006. We estimated gender- and age-specific incidence rates (IRs) per 10,000 person-years at risk for hospital-treated non-fatal self-harm during 2000-2016 at ages 10-19 years. Results Incidence of self-harm peaked in 2007 (IR 25.1) and then decreased consistently year on year to 13.8 in 2016. This pattern was found in all age groups, in both males and females and in each parental income tertile. During the last 6 years of the observation period, 2011-2016, girls aged 13-16 had the highest incidence rates whereas, among boys, incidence was highest among 17-19 year olds throughout. Conclusions The temporal increases in incidence rates of self-harm among adolescents observed in some Western European countries experiencing major economic recession were not observed in Denmark. Restrictions to sales of analgesics, access to dedicated suicide prevention clinics, higher levels of social spending and a stronger welfare system may have protected potentially vulnerable adolescents from the increases seen in other countries. A better understanding of the specific mechanisms behind the temporal patterns in self-harm incidence in Denmark is needed to help inform suicide prevention in other nations.

AB The risk for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among pathological gamblers is high compared to the general population. Little is known about the interplay of Axis I and Axis II disorders, severity of gambling disorder, and suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. The study aims to address this linkage. The sampling design of the study "Pathological Gambling and Epidemiology" (PAGE) included four recruitment channels: general population, gambling locations, project telephone hotline, and in-patient treatment for pathological gambling. A total of 442 study participants with lifetime pathological gambling received a clinical interview. The multivariate analysis showed mood disorders (Relative Risk Ratio, RRR=5.14, 95%-Confidence Interval, CI=2.91-9.07), substance use disorders (RRR=1.73, CI=1.02-2.94), and early onset of gambling disorder (RRR=0.96, CI=0.93-0.99) to be associated with suicidal ideation. Suicidal attempts were associated with female sex (RRR=3.58, CI=1.56-8.19), mood disorders (RRR=11.92, CI=4.70-30.26), and Cluster B personality disorders (RRR=2.40, CI=1.13-5.10). Among study participants with suicide attempts, more had a Cluster B personality disorder than among participants with ideation solely (RRR=3.08, CI=1.48-6.40). Among this large mixed sample of pathological gamblers, high proportions of individuals with suicidal events, multi-morbidity on Axis I, and a strong linkage to Cluster B personality disorders were found.

AB Background: Epidemiologic studies have reported substance abuse and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnoses as risk factors for suicide among Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patients. Research on risk factors for suicide may not generalize to our understanding of non-fatal intentional self harm (ISH), given the evidence that these outcomes have unique risk factors. The aims of this study were to examine (1) gender-stratified rates of non-fatal ISH in VHA patients with alcohol abuse/dependence, drug abuse/dependence, and PTSD and (2) gender-stratified interaction between alcohol abuse and dependence and drug abuse and dependence and PTSD in predicting non-fatal ISH.
   Methods: Participants include all VHA care users who received a PTSD diagnosis in Massachusetts from 2000 to 2008 (n=16,004) and an age- and gender-matched comparison group (n=52,502). Data were obtained from the VHA administrative registries.
   Results: We found evidence of stronger interactions between substance abuse diagnoses and PTSD in predicting non-fatal ISH for females than for males. The interaction contrast (IC) for alcohol abuse and dependence and PTSD in predicting non-fatal ISH among female VHA patients was 62.35/100,000 person years; for male VHA patients the comparable IC was 21.49/100,000 person-years. For female VHA patients the IC for drug abuse and dependence and PTSD predicting ISH was 256.33/100,000 person-years; no interaction was observed for male VHA patients.
   Conclusions: This study contributes to the scant literature on gender differences in substance abuse and PTSD among VHA patients. The findings highlight comorbid diagnoses as particularly important risk factors for non-fatal ISH among female VHA patients. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

ID COTININE
AB Tobacco is one of the most easily accessible and commonly abused drugs world-wide. Nicotine, one of its principal constituents, can cause serious or fatal overdoses. Whilst the deliberate ingestion of this substance appears to be relatively rare, often the important signs of its consumption are not recognised, sometimes with fatal results. Here we describe two cases of intentional fatal ingestion of nicotine. The nicotine was extracted from tobacco using instructions available on the Internet. The first case involved a male aged 19 who died in 2008. The post-mortem blood and urine levels of nicotine were 5.5 mg/l and >80 mg/l respectively; the blood level is in line with the generally recognised fatal level of >5 mg/l. The levels of nicotine's mainmetabolite, cotinine, for this case were 2.5 mg/l and 7.9 mg/l for blood and urine respectively. A comparative case in 1999 involved a 32 year-old male. The level of post-mortem nicotine in his blood was 1.0 mg/l. These are believed to be the first UK suicides by nicotine using instructions from the Internet reported in the literature. Information that nicotine was the agent responsible only became apparent some time after death. There may be more deaths due to this cause that go unrecognised because quantification of nicotine and cotinine levels is not often conducted, due to the wide prevalence of smoking. It is important that all evidence at the scene of a sudden and unexplained death is carefully evaluated, including potential clues on PCs and lap-tops. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB We conducted four studies to examine the relationship between over-exercise and suicidality. Study 1 investigated whether over-exercise predicted suicidal behavior after controlling for other eating disorder behaviors in a patient sample of 204 women (144 with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) Bulimia Nervosa [BN]). Study 2 tested the prospective association between over-exercise and acquired capability for suicide (ACS) in a sample of 171 college students followed for 3-4 weeks. Study 3 investigated whether pain insensitivity accounted for the relationship between over-exercise and ACS in a new sample of 467 college students. Study 4 tested whether ACS accounted for the relationship between over-exercise and suicidal behavior in a sample of 512 college students. In Study 1, after controlling for key covariates, over-exercise was the only disordered eating variable that maintained a significant relationship with suicidal behavior. In Study 2, Time 1 over-exercise was the only disordered eating behavior that was associated with Time 2 ACS. In Study 3, pain insensitivity accounted for the relationship between over-exercise and ACS. In Study 4, ACS accounted for the relationship between over-exercise and suicidal behavior. Over-exercise appears to be associated with suicidal behavior, an association accounted for by pain insensitivity and the acquired capability for suicide; notably, this association was found across a series of four studies with different populations.

AB Background: In the present study, we examined the relationship between cannabis involvement and suicidal ideation (SI), plan and attempt, differentiating the latter into planned and unplanned attempt, taking into account other substance involvement and psychopathology.
   Methods: We used two community-based twin samples from the Australian Twin Registry, including 9583 individuals (58.5% female, aged between 27 and 40). The Semi-Structured Assessment of the Genetics of Alcoholism (SSAGA) was used to assess cannabis involvement which was categorized into: (0) no cannabis use (reference category); (1) cannabis use only; (2) 1-2 cannabis use disorder symptoms; (3) 3 or more symptoms. Separate multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted for SI and suicide attempt with or without a plan. Twin analyses examined the genetic overlap between cannabis involvement and SI.
   Results: All levels of cannabis involvement were related to SI, regardless of duration (odds ratios [ORs] = 1.28-2.00, p < 0.01). Cannabis use and endorsing >= 3 symptoms were associated with unplanned (SANP; ORs = 1.95 and 2.51 respectively, p < 0.05), but not planned suicide attempts (p > 0.10). Associations persisted even after controlling for other psychiatric disorders and substance involvement. Overlapping genetic (rG = 0.45) and environmental (rE = 0.21) factors were responsible for the covariance between cannabis involvement and SI.
   Conclusions: Cannabis involvement is associated, albeit modestly, with SI and unplanned suicide attempts. Such attempts are difficult to prevent and their association with cannabis use and cannabis use disorder symptoms requires further study, including in different samples and with additional attention to confounders.

ID ARROW WOUNDS; BOLT; SUICIDE; BRAIN
AB Today in modem times, traumatic injuries caused by crossbows are a rarity. The largest collection of cases so far is presented in this study, consisting of four fatalities (two homicides and two suicides) and two non-fatal injuries (grievous bodily harm and an accident). All the victims were male having an age between 31 and 54. The weapons, which were used, were mainly high-performance precision crossbows with telescopic sights and hunting bolts. The parts of the body involved were the facial/head area in three of the cases and the thorax in three of them. There were either deep or total penetration injuries to the cranium and thorax with the bolt remaining in the wound in four out of six cases. The persons with non-fatal crossbow injuries exhibited comparatively few symptoms, despite the sometimes extensive involvement of the interior of the cranium (cerebrocranial penetration, in one instance). The two cases of suicide favoured the body areas often found with gun-users. The aetiological classification of crossbow injuries may be difficult after the removal of the bolt. The external morphology is strongly dependent on the type of tip used. Multiple-bladed hunting broadheads produce radiating incised wounds, whereas conical field tips produce circular to slitlike defects. Correspondingly, the external injuries can be reminiscent of the effects of a violent attack by sharp force or of a gunshot wound. The possibility, supported by clinical data, that the victim might have the ability to act or even to survive for a period of time, even with penetration of the brain, should be taken into account when the cause of death is being investigated.

AB In this study, we tried to clarify the prevalence of suicidal ideation and self-mutilation including suicide attempts among patients with gender identity disorder (GID) and the relationship of those behaviors to demographic characteristics. A total of 500 consecutive Japanese GID patients without any other psychiatric comorbidity were evaluated at the outpatient GID Clinic of Okayama University Hospital. The lifetime rate of suicidal ideation was 72.0% of the total sample. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of suicidal ideation among groups divided by sex, age, age at onset or education. The lifetime prevalence of self-mutilation including suicide attempts was 31.8% of the total sample. Low level of education was significantly related to self-mutilation among both male-to-female and female-to-male GID patients. Younger age at onset was a significant factor affecting self-mutilation only among MTF GID patients. A lack of strategies to cope with severe distress among persons with lower education might induce a high frequency of self-mutilation including suicidal attempt. GID patients with a low level education might be at high risk of self-mutilation and should be watched with special attention to self-mutilation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aimed to describe the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and to identify the factors associated with Current Suicide Risk (CSR) in the first trimester of pregnancy. The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) was employed to diagnose mental disorders in 239 women enrolled in a prospective cohort in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Serum lipids, leptin and socio-economic status were the independent variables. CSR, the dependent variable, was entered as binary (yes/no) variable into crude and adjusted Poisson regression models with robust variances. CSR was found to be the main psychiatric syndrome (18.4%), followed by agoraphobia (17.2%), major depressive disorder (15.1%) and generalized anxiety disorder (10.5%). Women with CSR showed higher mean levels of cholesterol (169.2 vs. 159.2; p=0.017), high density lipoprotein (50.4 vs. 47.7; p=0.031) and low density lipoprotein (102.8 vs. 95.6; p=0.022) when compared to women without CSR. The adjusted regression model showed a higher prevalence ratio (PR) of CSR among pregnant women with generalized anxiety disorder (PR=2.70, 95% CI: 1.36-5.37), with >= two parturitions (PR= 2.46, 95% CI: 1.22-4.93), and with major depressive disorder (PR=2.11, 95% CI: 1.08-4.12). We have shown that generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder and higher parity are associated with CSR in the first trimester of pregnancy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Aims: To describe the mortality and causes of death among subjects with alcohol use disorder in comparison with those without alcohol disorder and to study whether mental disorders increase mortality in alcoholics.
   Design and setting: Data were analysed from the database of the Lundby Study, comprising 3563 subjects followed from 1947 to 1997.
   Method: A community-based sample was investigated in 1947 with follow-ups in 1957, 1972 and 1997. Best-estimate consensus diagnoses of mental disorders, including alcohol use disorder, were assessed. In the total cohort, 427 cases of alcohol use disorders were identified. Differences in mortality between subjects with alcohol use disorders and non-alcoholics were studied using Cox regression models and causes of death were compared between alcoholic subjects and other participants. Risk factors for mortality among the 348 individuals with alcohol use disorders and known age-of-onset were analysed by means of Cox regression analyses.
   Results: The hazard ratio for mortality was higher for alcoholics compared to other subjects in the cohort. A substantial proportion of the causes of death among the alcoholics was suicide N = 27(6.3%) (26 males, 1 female). In the multivariate models of risk factors in alcohol use disorders, anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, alcohol induced psychotic disorders and dementia were risk factors for premature death.
   Conclusion: The mortality risk for subjects with alcohol use disorder was increased, females were especially vulnerable. The risk for suicide was high among males with alcohol problems. Anxiety disorders and severity of alcohol use disorder turned out as risk factors for premature death. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Authors describe a rare case of suicide in a 31-year-old woman, due to oral ingestion of lidocaine; the histological and toxicological findings are discussed to provide useful information to the present experience with this particular modality of death. Histological examination revealed generalized stasis. In the myocardium we observed segmentation of the myocardial cells and/or widening of intercalated discs and associated group of hypercontracted myocardial cells with "square" nuclei in line with hyperdistended ones. Non-eosinophilic bands of hypercontracted sarcomeres alternating with stretched, often apparently separated sarcomeres, small foci of paradiscal contraction band necrosis, and perivascular fibrosis were observed too. Lidocaine was detected in the subject's urine through immunoenzymatic screening. Toxicological analysis by solid-liquid extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, was carried out to identify and quantify the individual substances present in the biological fluids and organs. Lidocaine concentrations were as follows: blood 31 mu g/mL, gastric content 2.5 g, liver 10 mu/g, kidney 12 mu g/g, brain 9 mu g/g, spleen 24 mu g/g, lung 84 mu g/g, heart 9 mu g/g, urine 9 mu g/mL, and bile 6 mu g/mL. No other drugs or alcohol were detected.
   When blood lidocaine reaches toxic levels, serious toxic symptoms associated with the central nervous system and cardiac system are noted. The overdose of lidocaine produces death from ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest. In this case, according to macroscopic and microscopic findings, the cause of death was most likely cardiac and possibly related to ventricular fibrillation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) have been associated with increased risk of suicidality, but it is unclear whether the level of risk varies with different types of PLE. A cross-sectional online survey was completed by 1610 university students. Respondents completed the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences-15 (CAPE-P15) assessing PLEs on three subscales: Perceptual Abnormalities (PA), Persecutory Ideation (PI) and Bizarre Experiences (BE). Lifetime suicidal ideation, plans and attempts, cannabis, ecstasy and methamphetamine use and family history of mental disorder were also assessed. Multinomal logistic regression was used to examine unique determinants of lifetime suicidality, defined as any history of (i) suicidal ideation or plans and (ii) any attempt, relative to no lifetime history of suicidality. A lifetime history of PA and PI provided significant unique contributions to the prediction of suicide risk, after control for other significant predictors. BE were not associated with any suicide variable demonstrating the variation in risk of suicidality with different types of PLEs. Perceptual abnormalities and persecutory ideation as measured by the CAPE-P15 are the PLEs associated with a higher risk of lifetime suicidality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study explores risk factors for suicide attempts using the electronic health records of 3322 patients with either schizophrenia spectrum disorders or affective disorders who underwent a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation at the Emergency Department at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center or the Hillside Evaluation Center at The Zucker Hillside Hospital from August 3rd 2011 to July 5th 2012. Multivariate regression analyses showed, after adjusting for sex, that previous suicidal attempts and financial or relationship losses were significantly associated with a current suicidal attempt. Additionally, higher odds of having a suicidal attempt were also found in those subjects with a diagnosis of an affective disorder, compared to a schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis, and those patients in the children/adolescent group compared to those in the adult/elderly group. Our study results confirm and expand results from prior studies. Therefore, physicians should be alert for the presence of any or all of these factors upon evaluation of psychiatric patients, and if present, either psychiatric hospitalization or a close psychiatric follow up in collaboration with family and a therapist would be key in reducing the risk of potential suicidal behavior.

AB This study investigated associations between the use of healthcare services and financial status and suicidal ideation (SI) in the past year among elderly people. Additionally, this study explored gender differences in such associations. Cross-sectional data of 1743 elderly people aged 65 years and above, who participated in the 2009 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, were analyzed. The results showed that lack of preventive care and failure to obtain necessary healthcare services during the last 12 months had a significant effect on SI, especially among elderly women. Low financial status (i.e., receipt of National Basic Livelihood Security (NBLS) assistance) was significantly associated with SI among elderly men. The findings of this study emphasize the need for community-based suicide intervention services, especially for elderly men who receive NBLS and elderly women who do not undergo medical checkups and fail to obtain necessary medical services. Multiple intervention approaches, including the provision of community-based geriatric psychiatric services, improved social support, links with general hospital services, and local monitoring programs, are likely to be useful.

AB Background: Community facilitators (CFs), such as teachers, nurses and social workers, are well placed as gatekeepers for depression and suicidal behavior, but not properly prepared to provide preventive and supportive services. The current study aimed: (1) to improve CFs' attitudes toward depression, knowledge on suicide, and confidence to detect suicidal behavior in four European countries and (2) to identify specific training needs across regions and CF groups.
   Methods: A standardized training program was provided to 1276 CFs in Germany, Hungary, Ireland, and Portugal. Attitudes toward depression, knowledge about suicide, and confidence in identifying suicidal persons were assessed before training, after training, and at three to six months follow-up. Additionally, several participants' characteristics were registered.
   Results: At baseline, CFs showed relatively favorable attitudes toward depression, but limited knowledge on suicide, and little confidence to identify suicidal behavior. Basic skills strongly differed across CF groups and countries. For example, in Germany, carers for the elderly, nurses, teachers, and managers were most in need of training, while in Portugal pharmacists and the clergy appeared to be important target groups. Most importantly, the training program improved the competencies of CF groups across countries and these improvements were sustained after three to six months. CFs with low basic skills benefited most of the training.
   Limitations: The observed training effects could be influenced by other external factors as our results are based upon a pre-post comparison with no control group.
   Conclusions: Gatekeeper trainings in community settings are successful in improving knowledge, reshaping attitudes, and boosting the confidence of gatekeepers. The most effective strategy to achieve the preferred objectives is to target those CF groups that are most in need of training and to tailor the content of the training program to the individual needs of the target group.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between self-mutilation (SM) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in male alcohol-dependent inpatients, and to examine whether there is something unique about self-mutilaters with the PTSD/alcohol-dependence co-morbidity, compared with self-mutilaters without PTSD in this population. Participants were 156 consecutively admitted male alcohol-dependent inpatients. Patients were investigated with the Self-mutilative Behaviour Questionnaire (SMBQ), the Traumatic Experiences Checklist (TEC), the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the Symptom Checklist-Revised (SCL-90-R) and the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST). Among alcohol-dependent inpatients, 34.0% (n = 53) were considered as group with SM. Rate of being unemployed, history of any trauma, history of suicide attempt and lifetime PTSD diagnosis were higher, whereas being married, current age, age at onset of regular alcohol use and duration of education were lower in the group with SM. Mean scores of SCL-90 subscales, TEC and MAST were higher in the SM group. Although SM might be related with PTSD among male alcohol-dependent inpatients, predictors of SM were age at onset of regular alcohol use, history of suicide attempt, anxiety, depression and hostility. Age at onset of regular alcohol use, history of suicide attempt, anxiety, depression and somatisation predicted SM in the subgroup of patients without PTSD, whereas hostility predicted SM alone in the subgroup of patients with PTSD. Results support the anti-suicide and the affect-regulation models of SM in the non-PTSD group, whereas they support the hostility model of SM in the subgroup with PTSD in alcohol-dependent inpatients. Thus, to reduce self-mutilative behaviour (SMB)among alcohol-dependent patients, clinicians must address different subjects in different subgroup patients; that is, focussing hostility in those with PTSD co-morbidity.

AB A fatality due to ingestion of a reversible inhibitor of monoamine-oxidase A (MAO-A) is reported. Moclobemide is generally considered as a safe drug far less toxic than tricyclic anti-depressants. However, severe intoxications may result from interactions with other drugs and food such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), anti-Parkinsonians of the MAOI-type (e.g. selegiline) or tyramine from ripe cheese or other sources. In the present case, high levels of moclobemide were measured in peripheral blood exceeding toxic values reported so far in the scientific literature. The body fluid concentrations of moclobemide were of 498 mg/l in peripheral whole blood, 96.3 mg/l in Urine while an amount of approximately 33 g could be recovered from gastric contents. The other xenobiotics were considered of little toxicological relevance. The victim (male, 48-year-old) had a past history of depression and committed one Suicide attempt 2 years before death. Autopsy revealed no evidence of significant natural disease or injury. It was concluded that the manner of death was suicide and that the unique cause of death was massive ingestion of moclobemide.

AB A lower ratio of tryptophan to other amino acids in serum (tryptophan ratio), established as an index of serotonin precursor available to the brain, has been shown to be associated with increased suicidal behavior in cross-sectional studies. The purpose of this study was to conduct the first prospective examination of the utility of the tryptophan ratio along with clinical variables in predicting suicidal behavior in high-risk and reference adolescents. Adolescents With alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and prior suicidal attempts (n=20), adolescents with AUDs without suicide attempts (n=20), and community controls with neither of these characteristics (n=20) were matched on demographic variables. These groups were not significantly different on the tryptophan ratio at baseline. Of 56 subjects who completed follow-up assessments, six had suicidal behavior in the follow-up period. The tryptophan ratio, along with demographic and clinical variables, was examined using Cox regression with a backward stepwise variable elimination procedure. In the final model, the tryptophan ratio and major depressive disorder both significantly contributed to the prediction of suicidal behavior. This finding suggests that the tryptophan ratio may improve the identification of adolescents at high risk for suicidal behavior. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) mediates the phosphorylation of nucleoside analogues that can be used as anti-cancer agents. We examined whether susceptibility of mouse colon carcinoma (Colon 26) and rat gliosarcoma (9L) cells to 1-beta -D-arabiofuranosylcytonsine (AraC), a chemotherapeutic agent, can be increased after the tumor cells were transduced with the human dCK gene. Expression of the dCK gene in both cell lines conferred increased sensitivity in vitro to AraC. Although their proliferation rates in vitro remained the same as those of parental cells, tumor growth of the transduced cells in syngeneic host animals was unexpectedly retarded compared with that of respective parental cells. In contrast, the growth of the transduced cells was not different from that of parental cells, when they were inoculated in T cell-defective nude mice. A histological examination revealed infiltration of eosinophils into the dCK gene-transduced but not into parental Colon 26 tumor. These data suggest that a therapeutic gene, when expressed in xenogenic animals, can be a tumor antigen which is recognized by a host defense system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science ireland Ltd.

AB The objective of this article is to review the literature as to the presence of depression during and after pregnancy and some of its clinical implications; and to present a simple statistical aide for screening purposes. Clinical depression affects at least one in five women of childbearing age. During pregnancy, this figure does not diminish and not only signals problems for the pregnant woman but also for the child, measurably so into adolescence. Postpartum depression, but even more so antepartum depression, are medical conditions that negatively affect mother and child, and need to be detected as early as possible to avoid or limit the use of pharmacological treatments with possible side effects. The obstetrician should regularly test for depression from the very first moments of planning for a child, and use the test results for a "pregnancy mood profile". This profile requires only a few minutes and is very simple to complex. It could serve for early control of depression during pregnancy as well as determine the risk for postpartum depression and thus serve as a pre-alert for postpartum suicide.

AB Cyclic-AMP response element binding (CREB) protein regulates the expression of many genes involved in the pathophysiology of depression. Increased CREB levels were found in the brain of antidepressant-treated rats and decreased protein and mRNA expression of CREB was reported in the postmortem brain of depressed suicide victims. We determined CREB protein expression, using Western blot technique, and CRE-DNA binding, using gel shift assay, in neutrophils obtained from 22 drug-free patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 23 normal control subjects. Diagnosis of patients was based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV criteria: severity of illness was rated by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). We found that the CRE-DNA binding activity and CREB protein expression were significantly decreased in the neutrophils of drug-free MDD patients compared with normal control subjects. Our findings suggest that CREB may play an important role in the pathophysiology of depression and that it may be an important target for the therapeutic action of antidepressant drugs. Neutrophil CREB levels may also serve as a useful biomarker for patients with MDD. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Intoxication with antidepressants, frequently encountered in pediatric emergency medicine, can often lead to life threatening situations. While hyperthermia, hypertonicity and rigidity are symptoms indicative of a serotonin syndrome triggered by an intoxication with serotonin reuptake inhibitors or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, cardiotoxicity, coma and ECG changes are typical of an intoxication with tricyclic antidepressants.
   Case report: Hypothermia (instead of the expected hyperthermia) is described for the first time as a persistent symptom during the course of a combined moclobemide-doxepin intoxication in an attempted suicide of a 16-year-old adolescent.
   Discussion: The administration of serotonin reuptake inhibitors alone or in combination with other medication which increases the level of 5-hydroxytryptamine, i.e. serotonin, in the synaptic cleft mainly leads to hyperthermia. According to a recent study, however, the application of a selective 5-HT1a agonist to transgenic mice with a prominent overexpression of the 5-HT1a receptor lead to immobility and hypothermia. These findings might help to explain the hypothermia observed in the case of the intoxicated 16-year-old.
   Conclusion: Intoxication with antidepressants should not be excluded a priori in a hypothermic patient who displays other clinical signs of the said intoxication. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB We provide a review of theoretical and empirical contributions on the economic analysis of terrorism and counterterrorism. We argue that simple rational-choice models of terrorist behavior - in the form of cost-benefit models - already provide a well-founded theoretical framework for the study of terrorism and counterterrorism. We also hint at their limitations which relate to the failure of accounting for the dynamics between terrorism and counterterrorism that may produce unintended second-order effects as well as for the costs associated with counterterrorism and its international dimension. We reevaluate previously proposed counterterrorism strategies accordingly. Finally, in the light of our findings, we discuss interesting areas of future research.

AB Self harm in the absence of expressed suicidal intent is an under explored area in psychiatric nursing research. This paper reports on findings of a study undertaken in two acute psychiatric inpatient units in Ireland. The purpose of the study was to gain an understanding of the practices of psychiatric nurses in relation to people who self harm, but who are not considered suicidal. Semi structured interviews were held with eight psychiatric nurses. Content analysis revealed several themes. For the purpose of this paper the prevention and intervention strategies psychiatric nurses engage in when working with non-suicidal self harming individuals are presented. Recommendations for further research are offered.

AB Ecstasy is a psychostimulative drug (ab)used mostly by teenagers and young adults in discotheques and on the "rave" parties. Older adults ecstasy abusing cases are very rare. Among four case, of ecstasy abuse with fatal outcome noticed and examined in Slovenia, two were examined at our Institute of Forensic Medicine in Ljubljana. The first case was the accidental intoxication with 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on "rave" party, the second case was suicidal intoxication with combination of insulin and MDMA. Because of the increasing popularity of MDMA, it is important for all emergency physicians to be well educated in prompt recognition of MDMA intoxication symptoms. It is important that emergency physician carefully examines the death scene. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB The relationship between impulsivity and serotonin function was explored in impulsive and non-depressed adolescents. Platelet serotonin content was chosen as a peripheral indicator of central serotonin function. Impulsivity was assessed with a questionnaire. All measures were performed once a week over a 6-week period for all subjects. Subjects comprised eight adolescent inpatients who were hospitalized as a result of their impulsive acts and eight healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects. Mean platelet serotonin concentration was significantly higher in the impulsive group than in the control group. Platelet serotonin concentration was positively correlated with the intensity of impulsivity in the patient group. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Examination of brain regional neurochemistry in disease states reveals differences among brain regions. Knowing where alterations in brain function are located is crucial to understanding the disease effect. The anatomical distribution of neurotransmitter receptors is now often studied using quantitative autoradiography, but the large number of brain regions involved raises serious problems for statistical analysis of such data. Due to the dependence among the subjects in case control designs, statistical analysis based on a 'mixed model' is useful. Such an analysis is illustrated using a small autoradiographic data set. The Bonferroni method, the method of Helm, and two 'False Discovery Rate'-controlling methods for adjusting P-values for multiple comparisons are compared. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB This structural magnetic resonance imaging study examined the relationship between pituitary gland volume (PGV) and lifetime number of parasuicidal behaviors in a first-presentation, teenage borderline personality disorder (BPD) sample with minimal exposure to treatment. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that age and number of parasuicidal behaviors were significant predictors of PGV. These findings indicate that parasuicidal behavior in BPD might be associated with greater activation of the hypothalamic-pituitaty-adrenal (HPA) axis. Further studies are required using direct neuroendocrine measures and exploring other parameters of self-injurious behavior, such as recency of self-injurious behavior, intent to die and medical threat.

AB Adoptive transfer of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells is a promising therapy for cancers. However, the safety of this approach is concerned. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a common but lethal complication of CAR-T cell therapy. The development of CRS correlates with CAR structures, tumor type and burden, and patients' genetic polymorphisms. CRS related adverse events may be reduced by designing safer CARs and CAR-T cells and following strict dose-escalation scheme. Timely and effective cytokine-directed treatment with corticosteroid and various cytokine antagonists is important to avoid CRS associated death. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB It is estimated that 450 million individuals worldwide are affected by mental, neurological or behavioral problems at any time, and that 873,000 die annually by suicide. Key international authorities and a literature review suggest that women are disproportionately affected by depression, anxiety and eating disorders, which usually go unrecognized and untreated, and that the mental health of women can be understood only if their biological, social, cultural, economic and personal context is considered. International efforts should increase to prevent, recognize and treat mental disorders in girls and women.

AB This study examined the efficacy of Manual Assisted Cognitive Therapy (MACT) as a stand-alone treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) with suicidal ideation, and piloted a Therapeutic Assessment (TA) intervention among 16 patients randomly assigned to MACT or MACT + TA. Although MACT was associated with significant reductions in BPD features and suicidal ideation, less than half of the sample completed the treatment. The TA augmentation did not improve treatment retention but it was associated with somewhat greater clinical improvement. Although findings associate MACT with symptom reduction among persisting patients, attrition rate was problematically high in the overall sample. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A number of studies have reported an increased risk for violent deaths and depression in subjects with reduced serum cholesterol concentrations. Links with hypothesized impairment of serotonin neurotransmission have not been satisfactorily tested. In this investigation, the serum and membrane cholesterol, microviscosity of erythrocyte membranes, platelet serotonin uptake, and clinical parameters were determined during pharmacotherapy of 17 hypercholesterolemic patients. A significant decrease in serum cholesterol and a nonsignificant decrease in membrane cholesterol concentration were found after 2 months of sinivastatin therapy. Serotonin transporter (SERT) activity was significantly increased following 1 month of simvastatin; the tendency to decrease the initial increase in SERT activity was evident following 2 months of therapy. Both membrane cholesterol and SERT activity returned to pre-treatment levels after more than 1 year of therapy. Microviscosity of plasma membranes, impulsivity, empathy, adventure, sensation seeking, and depressed mood were not markedly changed. These data indicate that long-term therapy has different effects on serotonin transmission from short-term (1- to 2-month) therapy. A significant increase in SERT activity was detected only during the first month of simvastatin therapy. This finding suggests that within this period some patients could be vulnerable to depression, violence, or suicide. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aimed at determining the functional neuroanatomy of mental pain, a hitherto neglected symptom in the study of depression, which according to DSM-IV is stronglylinked with suicide. Mental pain (measured with the Orbach & Mikulincer Mental Pain Scale), suicidal ideation (measured using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression), hopelessness (measured using Beck's Hopelessness Scale), and regional cerebral blood flow as measured with single photon emission computed tomography were assessed in 39 depressed individuals. Levels of mental pain were significantly and positively associated with suicidal ideation and levels of hopelessness. When compared with patients with low levels of mental pain, those with high levels of mental pain showed relatively increased perfusion in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, occipital cortex and inferior frontal gyrus and in the left inferior temporal gyrus, and relatively decreased perfusion at the medulla. The findings indicate that mental pain in depressed patients is associated with an increased risk of suicide and that high levels of mental pain are associated with changes in perfusion in brain areas that are involved in the regulation of emotions. Further study is warranted to understand whether this association reflects increased emotional processing or decreased cognitive control over mental pain in depressed individuals.

AB Seven new anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) have become available in Ireland over the last 10 years; data from animal models and clinical trials suggest that they have a superior safety profile to older AEDs. A specific relationship between epilepsy and psychiatric co-morbidity has long been recognised, including the relationship between epilepsy and suicide.
   AEDs are common agents taken in intentional drug overdoses.
   We undertook a study to review the frequency and outcome of non-accidental overdose with seven new AEDS in an Irish population from 1996 to 2000. Method: All reported cases of drug overdoses with AEDs from 1996 to 2000 were reviewed. Data was provided by the National Poisons Information Centre, Beaumont Hospital and the Central Statistics Office. Medical records from Beaumont Hospital were reviewed in specific cases of serious drug toxicities. An extensive review of published literature reviewing the safety profile of these AEDs was performed and medical literature retrieved from the databases of the pharmaceutical industry was similarly reviewed. Results: Of the 164 reported cases of newer AEDs, there were no fatalities among the cases followed up. Conclusion: The absence of mortalities and serious consequences from deliberate self-poisoning with the newer agents is supportive evidence for the superior safety profite of the newer AEDs.

AB Alcohol and drug use are considered to be risk factors for suicidal behaviors in adolescence, but the precise nature of the relationship between suicidality and substance abuse, and the implications of this relationship for prevention and treatment interventions remain elusive. There are several conceptual issues that need to be addressed when considering the substance abuse-suicidality relationship. What are the most appropriate ways of defining suicidal behaviors? What are the best ways of assessing suicidal behavior and characterizing its course over time? Should adolescents who are suicidal be considered to be a single homogeneous population? What are the possible ways in which the course of substance abuse and suicidality over time are related? What factors potentially affect the trajectories of both substance abuse and suicidality? Does the relationship between substance abuse and suicidality change over time? And, to what extent can our knowledge of factors precipitating and maintaining the joint outcomes of suicidal and substance abuse behaviors be incorporated into interventions that target both? Careful consideration and exploration of these issues hopefully should improve our understanding the substance abuse-suicidality interrelationship, and ultimately the development of more effective prevention efforts and treatments for youths with both problems.

AB Veterans with schizophrenia admitted for suicidal ideation were recruited into a post-discharge program consisting of Intensive Case Monitoring (ICM) with daily monitoring with the Health Buddy (HB; experimental group) or ICM alone (control group). This study tested the feasibility of the telehealth monitoring intervention in this population. Secondly, we determined whether augmentation of ICM with our intervention for 3 months would result in a reduction in suicidal ideation. Twenty of 25 telehealth participants could set up the device. Monthly adherence for telehealth participants was > 80%. A qualitative analysis of endpoint surveys revealed that the majority of participants had positive responses. In both groups, there were improvements in Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSS) scores at endpoint relative to baseline. No group differences were present with survival analysis when using remission (i.e., BSS score = 0) as the outcome; however, in a subgroup with a history of suicide attempt, there was a trend (p = .093) for a higher rate of remission for those in the FIB condition. In conclusion, telehealth monitoring for this population appears to be feasible for those who are able to start using the system. The pilot data obtained should help investigators design better telehealth interventions for this population. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB People who suffer from substance use disorders (SUDs) frequently report to have undergone childhood adversity that is often associated with father or mother dysfunction, or both. Yet that issue has been barely addressed in opiate dependent patients. Therefore we sought to evaluate parent-specific dysfunctional styles perceived during childhood in a clinical sample from an outpatient addiction treatment program using the Measure Of Parental Styles (MOPS) questionnaire. DSM-IV diagnoses of substance use disorders and history of suicide attempts, family structure and changes of caregiver during childhood were obtained from 159 consecutive outpatients, along with their perception of parental bonding with the MOPS, in which mother and father scores are separate. Mother neglect dimension was significantly correlated with an earlier age at onset of several substances' use, the number of prior hospitalizations and of lifetime suicide attempts. Most of these associations remained significant in multivariate models. This was the first assessment of a representative sample of outpatients with SUDs by the MOPS questionnaire. Given its excellent acceptance and its association with several key correlates of SUDs, it should be used to design specific interventions targeted at attachment and familial management as well as in research models on gene x environment interactions.

AB Tolperisone (Mydocalm (R)) is a centrally acting muscle relaxant with few sedative side effects that is used for the treatment of chronic pain conditions. We describe three cases of suicidal tolperisone poisoning in three healthy young subjects in the years 2006, 2008 and 2009. In all cases, macroscopic and microscopic autopsy findings did not reveal the cause of death.
   Systematic toxicological analysis (STA) including immunological tests, screening for volatile substances and blood, urine and gastric content screening by GC-MS and HPLC-DAD demonstrated the presence of tolperisone in all cases. In addition to tolperisone, only the analgesics paracetamol (acetaminophen), ibuprofen and naproxen could be detected. The blood ethanol concentrations were all lower than 0.10 g/kg. Tolperisone was extracted by liquid-liquid extraction using n-chlorobutane as the extraction solvent. The quantification was performed by GC-NPD analysis of blood, urine and gastric content. Tolperisone concentrations of 7.0 mg/l, 14 mg/l and 19 mg/l were found in the blood of the deceased.
   In the absence of other autopsy findings, the deaths in these three cases were finally explained as a result of lethal tolperisone ingestion. To the best of our knowledge, these three cases are the first reported cases of suicidal tolperisone poisonings. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide risk is high in early psychosis. Recent research has suggested that mood variability may be associated with levels of suicidal thoughts and behaviour. This has not been investigated in individuals during and following a first or second episode of non-affective psychosis. Repeated-measures data over 18 months from a large randomised controlled trial for cognitive behaviour therapy (N=309) were analysed using latent growth curve modelling, whereby both the variability and the level of depression, anxiety and guilt were entered as predictors of suicidality. The variability of depression, but not guilt and anxiety, predicted the course of suicidality even when controlling for a large range of potential confounders. The level of depression, anxiety and guilt for each participant also strongly predicted the development of suicidality. The findings support the theory that variability in depression may contribute to the formation of suicidal ideation and related behaviour. More variable depression may be harder to predict and intervene against, and therefore increase the likelihood that suicidality escalates. The levels of emotions may also be an important determinant. This has implications for the treatment and assessment of suicidality in early psychosis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We aimed to compare the influence of various parental factors on adolescent suicidal ideas from a population-based sample of 2965 adolescents between 15 to 18 years-old, and their parents. Among the subject variables, gender, satisfaction with one's health, having an illness, and satisfaction with family; and among parental variables, fathers' satisfaction with health; mothers' insufficient sleep; parents' history of suicidal ideation, and satisfaction with family were significantly different in adolescents who reported suicidal ideation compared to those who reported none. Odds ratios indicated increased risk of adolescent suicidal ideation was associated with the subject factors female gender, insufficient sleep, dissatisfaction with one's health, dissatisfaction with family, and with maternal data showing insufficient sleep and a positive history of suicidal impulse. A path analysis model (comparative fit index (CFI)=0.907; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA)= 0.047), indicated psychosocial factors (beta=0.232) had a greater influence on adolescent suicidal ideation than did genetic factors (beta=0.120). These results show psychosocial factors have an almost two-fold greater influence on adolescent suicidal ideation than genetic factors. Assessment and modification of these factors would greatly assist future interventions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL

DE Suicide; Homicide victims; Child safety; Greenhouse problems
AB There were two reasons why this work was conducted. The first was to help determine the time of death of suicide and homicide victims inside vehicles. The second was to investigate the serious threat to life of children or pets left in stationary vehicles on a hot summers day. This paper demonstrates that when a vehicle is parked in the sun, temperature levels in the cabin of the vehicle can be more than 20 degrees C above the ambient temperature. A simple 'greenhouse' model for predicting the daily internal vehicle temperatures, using readily available local meteorological data, was developed. This statistical model was calibrated using meteorological data and temperature data collected on parked vehicles over several summer seasons. The model uses environmental temperature and radiation data as input, and is shown to predict cabin temperatures to within about 1 degrees C. Both the data collected and the model developed show that the temperature inside the cabin of a black vehicle is typically 5 degrees C higher than that inside a white vehicle on a hot summer day. Also lowering the driver's window of the vehicle by 2.5 cm typically reduces cabin temperatures by about 3 degrees C, which is not sufficient to reduce significantly the safety concerns for children or pets left in parked vehicles.

AB Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the deadliest forms of cancer, with an average survival time of approximately 1 year despite aggressive surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Here, we report a preclinical study by which the two main energy pathways of the tumor cells, oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis, are simultaneously disrupted. The therapy is based on a plant gene encoding a beta-glucosidase, linamarase (lis), which react with the substrate linamarin (lin) producing cyanide. We also use glucose oxidase (GO) to enhance oxidative stress and to induce cell death in the tumor. To test in vivo this suicide gene therapy system (lis/lin/GO), we used an orthotopic model of the human U87MG glioma cells, genetically modified to express the lis gene, and stereotactically implanted into the brains of nude rats (rnu/rnu). Despite its genetic condition, 6% of the animals immunorejected the xenotransplanted cells giving false curative results. We tried several delivery methods with limited success. The therapeutic cocktail, at dosages that perhaps eliminated the brain tumors, is too toxic for the animal causing its premature death. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many European governments have abundantly cut down public expenditure on health during the financial crisis. Consequences of the financial downturn on health outcomes have begun to emerge. This recession has led to an increase in poor health status, raising rates of anxiety and depression among the economically vulnerable. In addition, the incidence of some communicable diseases along with the rate of suicide has increased significantly. The recession has also driven structural reforms, and affected the priority given to public policies. The purpose of this paper is to analyse how austerity impacts health in Europe and better understand the response of European health systems to the financial crisis.
   The current economic climate, while challenging, presents an opportunity for reforming and restructuring health promotion actions. More innovative approaches to health should be developed by health professionals and by those responsible for health management. In addition, scientists and experts in public health should promote evidence-based approaches to economic and public health recovery by analyzing the present economic downturn and previous crisis. However, it is governance and leadership that will mostly determine how well health systems are prepared to face the crisis and find ways to mitigate its effects. (C) 2013 The Authors.

AB Objective: At present, the problems associated with suicidal ideation and suicide in Huntington's disease (HD), worldwide, are much the same as 2 decades ago. This study seeks to investigate the psychological complications of predictive testing in HD at risk populations.
   Methods: The key problems of predictive testing, fear of acquiring carrier status, psychological consequences, autonomy, and rights to know are discussed.
   Results: This review (1) describes psychological affect and problems of persons facing the decision to test for HD, (2) discusses suicidal ideation, behaviour, and catastrophic events associated with predictive testing, (3) assesses ethical questions raised in the genetic counselling, (4) questions whether counsellors should promote or advocate predictive testing, and finally (5) discusses what professionalism actually is in genetic counselling.
   Conclusion: The need for professional counselling, using a well designed protocol, and the importance of focusing on the suicide risk of participants in predictive testing programs are emphasized.
   Practice implications: The counsellor has an obligation to provide adequate information. The professionals should not promote nor advocate presymptomatic DNA-testing. Depression, hopelessness, anxiety, emotional distress, suicidal tendencies, and social dysfunction grading should be considered in predictive testing of HD. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

ID WOUNDS; AMMUNITION; FEATURES
AB The suicidal infliction of two gunshot wounds to the head represents a critical issue for medicolegal investigation. In principle, simultaneous infliction with two firearms or third parties' involvement, i.e. two consecutive gunshots, have to be considered. We report for the first time on a case of suicidal infliction of two simultaneous gunshots to the head (oral, temporal) with Action 4 expanding ammunition. A male had robbed two service guns and committed suicide thereafter under the influence of high-dose alcohol and cocaine. Interestingly, Action 4 ammunition had been used, leading to an uncommon gunshot wound morphology and extensive backspatter. At the scene, these findings caused confusion; moreover, the number of gunshot wounds was unclear, until autopsy revealed two gunshot wounds to the head, which had obviously been inflicted simultaneously. Expanding ammunition like QD-PEP and Action 4, used by several German federal state police forces, can cause an atypical gunshot wound morphology, most probably due to its peculiar deformation behaviour. Investigators should be careful when interpreting gunshot wound morphology at the scene after usage of such expanding ammunition. With regard to reconstruction in cases of two gunshot wounds to the head and two guns at the scene, two simultaneous gunshots should be taken into consideration. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Psychoactive substance use is a risk factor for suicidal behavior and current intoxication increases the likelihood of serious intentional drug overdose (IDO). The objective was to assess the accuracy of information on substance use recorded in medical charts using toxicological assays as a reference in subjects admitted for IDO to an emergency department. Patients (17=1190) consecutively admitted for IDO were included. Information on substance use was recorded in routine practice by the emergency staff and toxicological assays (cannabis, opiate, buprenorphine, amphetamine/ecstasy, cocaine, LSD) were carried out in urine samples collected as part of routine management. The information on substance use was recorded in medical charts for 24.4% of subjects. A third of subjects (27.5%) were positive for toxicological assays. Recorded substance use allowed correct classification of nearly 80% of subjects. However, specificity (88.6%) was better than sensitivity (54.2%). Compared with toxicological assays, medical records allowed identification of only half of the subjects with current substance use. The usefulness of systematic toxicological assays during hospitalization for IDO should be assessed in further studies exploring whether such information allows medical management to be modified and contributes to improving prognosis.

ID NETHERLANDS
AB Objective: In the Netherlands the law states that physicians are allowed to grant a request for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (EAS) if specific criteria for due care are met. This study investigated which sources physicians use to determine whether three of these criteria (unbearable and hopeless suffering, and no realistic alternatives for treatment) are met. Methods: The data were collected for the project Support and Consultation on Euthanasia in the Netherlands. General practitioners (GPs) received a written questionnaire concerning the most recent request for EAS that they had received. Of the 3614 (60%) GPs who returned the questionnaire, 1681 described the most recent request for EAS. Results: The study shows that physicians used different types of sources, and more than one source. to determine whether the criteria were met. More sources were used when the criteria were met or when a request resulted in EAS. The determination of every criterion required a different approach, but for all criteria discussions with colleagues were important. Conclusion: Using less sources when a criterion is not met could possibly lead to less extensive consideration of the criteria, and therefore to assessing too easily that the request does not meet the criteria for due care.

AB Objective: Obtaining in-depth information from both patient and physician perspectives about what happens after a request for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (EAS) is refused.
   Methods: In-depth interviews with nine patients whose EAS request was refused and seven physicians of these patients, and with three relatives of patients who had died after a request was refused and four physicians of these patients. Interviews were conducted at least 6 months after the refusal.
   Results: A wish to die remained in all patients after refusal, although it sometimes diminished. In most cases patient and physician stopped discussing this wish, and none of the physicians had discussed plans for the future with the patient or evaluated the patient's situation after their refusal. Physicians were aware of patients' continued wish to die.
   Conclusions: Patients who are refused EAS may subsequently be silent about a wish to die without abandoning it. Open communication about wishes to die is important, even outside the context of EAS, because if people feel unable to talk about them, their quality of life may be further diminished.
   Practice implications: Follow up appointments after refusal could give patients the opportunity to discuss their feelings and physicians to support them. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Tianeptine (Stablon (R)), although structurally similar to tricyclic antidepressants, acts by enhancing the reuptake of serotonin. A fatal case is presented involving a 26-year-old man, found lying in bed with a "mushroom of foam" around his mouth. Empty blister packs of Stablon (R) and a suicide note were found next to the body. A liquid-liquid extraction procedure with n-hexane: ethyl acetate and n-hexane: 2-propanol, followed by LC-DAD-MS analysis, using positive mode electrospray ionization was performed. The detection limit was 0.001 mu g/mL. The toxicological results revealed the following tianeptine concentrations in the post-mortem samples: blood 5.1 mu g/mL; urine 2.0 mu g/mL; liver 23 mu g/g; stomach contents 22 mg. Femoral blood analyses also revealed an ethanol concentration of 0.53 g/L. The present method was also developed and validated for the other post-mortem specimens, since no previous published data had confirmed the post-mortem distribution of tianeptine. The absence of other suitable direct causes of death (macroscopic or histological) and the positive results achieved with the toxicological analysis led the pathologist to rule that death was due to an intoxication caused by the suicidal ingestion of tianeptine in combination with alcohol.

AB We examined the prevalence, correlates, and psychiatric comorbidities of community-dwelling subjects with problematic Internet use (PIU). In an epidemiological survey of mental disorders among Korean adults conducted in 2006, 6510 subjects (aged 18-64 years) completed the Korean version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV psychiatric disorders; Diagnostic Interview Schedule exploring pathological gambling; Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale-Version 1.1 Screener; questionnaire for sleep disturbances; and questionnaire for suicidal ideations, plans, and attempts. Young's Internet Addiction Test was administered to 3212 individuals who had used the Internet within one month before the interviews in order to identify problematic Internet users (cutoff > 39). The prevalence of PIU was 9.3% in the general population of South Korea. Being male, younger, never married, or unemployed were all associated with increased risks of PIU. Significant positive associations were observed between PIU and nicotine use disorders, alcohol use disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, pathological gambling, adult type ADHD symptoms, sleep disturbances, suicide ideas and suicide plans compare to subjects without PIU, after controlling for socio-demographic variables. These findings suggest that careful evaluation and management of such psychiatric disorders is needed for individuals with PIU. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The central serotonergic system is implicated differentially in the pathogenesis of depression and schizophrenia. The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) is the main source of serotonergic innervation of forebrain limbic structures disturbed in both disorders. The study was carried out on paraffin-embedded brains from 27 depressed (15 major depressive disorder, MDD and 12 bipolar disorder, BD) and 17 schizophrenia (9 residual and 8 paranoid) patients and 28 matched controls without mental disorders. The transcriptional activity of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in DRN neurons was evaluated by the AgNOR silver staining method. A significant effect of diagnosis on rDNA activity was found in the cumulative analysis of all DRN subnuclei. Further analysis revealed an increase in this activity in residual (but not paranoid) schizophrenia compared to depressed (both MDD and BD) patients. The effect was most probably neither confounded by suicide nor related to antidepressant and antipsychotic medication. Our findings suggest that increased activity of rDNA in DRN neurons is a distinct phenomenon in residual schizophrenia, related presumably to differentially disturbed inputs to the DRN and/or their local transformation compared with depressive episodes in patients with affective disorders.

AB The aims of the present study were to assess the prevalence and comorbidity of psychiatric disorders in subjects with intentional drug overdose and to explore whether there were gender differences in prevalence and comorbidity. A standardized psychiatric evaluation was performed in 100 randomly selected subjects, 18 years old and older, with intentional drug overdose referred to an emergency department. The prevalences of psychiatric morbidity and comorbidity were very high in both genders: 88% presented with at least one psychiatric diagnosis, and three-quarters presented with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Affective and anxiety disorders were the most prevalent diagnoses. One patient out of three presented with alcohol or substance misuse. Compared to females, males suffered five times more often from substance misuse and three times more often from psychotic syndrome and were three times less likely to present with anxiety disorder. When subjects are referred to hospital for intentional drug overdose, medical management should systematically involve a psychiatric assessment in order to identify not only affective and anxiety disorders, but also alcohol and substance misuse, due to the high prevalence of these disorders, especially in male subjects.

AB Suicide is a substantial public health problem, and it remains a serious cause of death in the world. Therefore, this study was designed to examine the relationships between brooding, reflection, emotional intelligence (assessed by performance-based test), and suicidal ideation; the mediation role of emotional intelligence on the relationships between brooding and reflection with suicidal ideation; and the moderating role of suicidal history on the relationships between brooding, reflection, and emotional intelligence with suicidal ideation among Iranian depressed adolescents. The study consisted of a cross-sectional sample of 202 depressed adolescent inpatients from five public hospitals in Tehran, Iran completed measures of depression, rumination, emotional intelligence, and suicide attempt history as indices of suicidal ideation. Structural Equation Modelling estimated that depressed adolescent inpatients with high levels of brooding and reflective rumination, and low levels of emotional intelligence were more likely to report suicidal ideation. Moreover, emotional intelligence partially mediated the relationships between brooding and reflective rumination with suicidal ideation. Suicidal history moderated the relationships between brooding, reflection, and emotional intelligence with suicidal ideation. These findings reinforce the importance of emotional intelligence as an influencing factor against the deleterious effects of rumination styles and suicidal ideation. The results indicate that brooding and reflection have detrimental effects on suicidal ideation in depressed inpatients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Carbofuran is a broad spectrum carbamate insecticide which inhibits cholinesterase. In the recent past several carbofuran related homicide and suicide cases were reported in Sri Lanka. The concentration of carbofuran found in blood, bile and/or tissues in eight fatal cases were presented in this paper. Liquid-liquid extraction with chloroform was carried out with tissue and beverage samples while blood and bile samples were roller mixed with n-hexane and finally extracted into acetonitrile. Qualitative analysis of carbofuran in biological specimens was carried out using TLC and GC-MS. Presence of carbofuran and its metabolite carbofuran phenol were confirmed by GC-MS. The quantitative analysis was carried out using a validated method where Zorbax Eclips XDB C18 column was used in HPLC with photo diode array detector and GC-MS. In blood, bile, liver and stomach contents/stomach and contents both carbofuran and carbofuran phenol were identified, while in certain cases only the metabolite, carbofuran phenol was identified in blood. The carbofuran levels ranged from 0.4 to 18 mu g/ml in blood, 0.4 to 60 mu g/ml in bile, 2.2 mu g/g in liver and 0.3 to 300 mu g/g in stomach contents/stomach and contents.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine trait impulsivity in patients with bipolar disorder and explore the possible connections between impulsivity and clinical presentation of the illness. Diagnoses were based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. The sociodemographic and clinical properties of 71 patients with bipolar disorder, who were euthymic according to Young Mania Rating Scale and Hamilton Depression Scale scores, were recorded. Their trait impulsivity was evaluated by using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) and impulsivity subscale of the Temperament and Character Inventory, and the results were compared with 50 age- and sex-matched healthy controls and among patients with different clinical properties. All BIS-11 subscale scores were higher in bipolar than in comparison subjects. There were no effects of education and age. Elevated BIS-11 scores were associated with predominant depressive polarity, longer duration of illness and a history of psychotic mood episodes and suicide attempts. These relationships persisted when age, gender, and education were taken into account. These results show that after accounting for common confounding factors, trait-like impulsivity was substantially higher in subjects with bipolar disorder than in nonbipolar comparison subjects and may vary according to different clinical presentations.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is considered one of the defining features of people diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Longitudinal studies are needed to identify factors predicting future NSSI in BPD participants. Several studies have shown that low meaning in life is associated with mental health problems, addiction problems, depression, hopelessness, and suicide. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether meaning in life predicts the frequency of NSSI behaviors during the one-year follow-up. The sample was composed up of 80 participants with a BPD diagnosis. We assessed the frequency of NSSI behaviors over a 12-month follow-up period. The results suggest that the participants who had low meaning in life had more frequency of NSSI, depression, and hopelessness at baseline, and more frequency of NSSI during the follow-up, than participants with high meaning in life. The predictor variables: Frequency of NSSI at base line, depression, hopelessness, and meaning in life, significantly predicted the frequency of NSSI during the one-year follow-up. Therefore, meaning in life was the only predictor of NSSI during the follow-up period. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hanging is a devastating method of suicide and unfortunately is common in Japan. Although several CT findings of the head have been reported, there have not been any reports about magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in hanging. We report here interesting MRI findings in a patient after hanging. A 39-year-otd woman was transferred to our department after attempting suicide by hanging. Respiration had probably ceased for about three minutes but heart had not stopped when she was pulled down by her father. After her father performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation, she started to breathe immediately. She was treated conservatively in our intensive care unit for 14 days, her condition became stable. Ten days after admission, MRI demonstrated symmetrical hyperintensity on T1-weighted images and relative hyperintensity on T2 weighted images in bilateral lentiform nuclei and medial thalami. There have been several reports about characteristic MRI findings in the case of acute global cerebral ischaemia caused by severe hypoglycaemia or longstanding cardiopulmonary arrest. It was postulated that these specific findings reflected tissue degeneration, deposition of mineral substances, or lipid accumulation. These MRI findings suggest that severe acute global cerebral hypoperfusion also occurs in hanging in the same way as in tong-standing cardiopulmonary arrest and that hanging has devastating sequelae.

AB An estimated 800 000 suicide deaths occur worldwide. The global suicide rate is 11.4 per 100 000 population; 15.0/100 000 for males and 8.0/100 000 for females. Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year olds. In a collaborative effort to reduce the high rates of suicide and mental health problems among youth across Europe, the European Union 7(th) Framework funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. SEYLE is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to promote mental health and healthy lifestyles, while preventing psychopathology and suicidal behaviours among adolescents. The epidemiological data on 11,110 pupils in the age group 14-16 years, with a mean age of 14.8 years (SD +/- 0.8), who were recruited from 168 schools across 10 European Union countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden as the coordinating centre showed the following prevalences: alcohol use (13.4%), smoking (30.9%), physical inactivity (32.8%), pathological Internet use (4.4%) and sleeping on average 7.7 hours per night. In terms of reproductive health, the prevalence of sexual debut was 18.8% for the total sample. Pupils aged >= 16 years had a higher prevalence (38%) of sexual debut compared to those aged <= 15 years (13.2%). Males had a higher prevalence (21.3%) than females (16.9%). Three clusters of adolescents were identified: 57.8% with low frequency of all risk-behaviours; 13.2% with high frequency of all risk behaviours; and 29% so-called `invisible' risk group, which did not show any striking externalised risk behaviours, but scored positive for high use of Internet/TV/videogames, sedentary behaviour and reduced sleep. When comparing pupils in the `invisible' risk group with those in the high-risk group, similar prevalence rates of anxiety (8% vs. 9.2%), subthreshold depression (33.2% vs. 34%), depression (13.4% vs. 14.7%) and suicidal thoughts (42.2% vs. 44%) were observed. Pupils meeting the criteria of depression and subthreshold depression were 10.5% and 32%, respectively. Prevalence rates for anxiety and subthreshold anxiety was 5.8% and 29.2%, respectively. Lifetime prevalence of deliberate self-injurious behaviours (D-SIB) was 27.6%, with higher rates reported for occasional D-SIB (19.7%) compared to repetitive D-SIB (7.8%). Suicidal ideation was present in approximately one third of the sample (32.3%). More than four percent (4.2%) of the sample reported attempting suicide during their lifetime, with a significantly higher prevalence among girls (5.1% vs. 3.0%, p<0.05). In comparing the effectiveness of the three active SEYLE interventions, based on three specific preventive strategies directed towards teachers and school staff, professionals and pupils in comparison to a control group, the intervention empowering pupils, called the Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) showed significant results in preventing new cases of suicide attempts, severe suicidal ideation with plans and depression. More than a 50% reduction of incident cases of suicide attempts (OR: 0.45 [0.24 - 0.85]; p=0.014), and of incident cases of severe suicidal ideation and plans (OR: 0.50 [0.27 - 0.92]; p=0.025), as well as a significant reduction by 30% of incident cases with moderate to severe depression (OR: 0.71 [0.52- 0.97]; p=0.031) was observed.

AB Background: The prevalence of adolescent self-harm in Northern Ireland (NI) and its associated factors are unknown. Given the established relationship between conflict and mental health, and NI's recent history of conflict, it is important to investigate the factors associated with self-harm in NI. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of self-bairn in NI adolescents and the factors associated with it, including exposure to the NI conflict.
   Methods: Observational study of 3596 school pupils employing an anonymous self-report survey. Information was obtained on demographic characteristics, lifestyle, life events and problems, exposure to the NI conflict, social and internet influences, and psychological variables.
   Results: Self-harm was reported by 105 of respondents. In univariate analyses, exposure to the NI conflict was associated with self-harm alongside established risk factors. In multivariate analyses, bullying and exposure to self-harm were associated with lifetime self-harm in both girls and boys. Alcohol use, drug use, physical and sexual abuse, and self-esteem were also associated with self-harm in girls. In boys, absence of exercise, sexual orientation concerns, anxiety and impulsivity were additional risk factors. The internet/social media and the self-harm of others were also key influences.
   Limitations: This is a cross-sectional study.
   Conclusions: The rate of self-harm was lower than elsewhere in the UK/Ireland. The study highlights the factors which should be considered in terms of risk assessment. In addition to established risk factors, the findings suggest that more research on the legacy of the NI conflict as well as the influence of new technologies warrant urgent attention.

AB IntroductionYouth suicide in Ireland is now the second highest in the European Union. General practitioners (GPs), as the health-care professional most often consulted by young people, have a central role in early detection of youth mental health problems. However, evidence regarding the perspectives of young people and health-care workers towards screening and treatment for such issues in primary care in Ireland is lacking.
   AimThis study aimed to examine the role of GP in providing early intervention and treatment for youth mental health problems.
   MethodsA mixed methods study that involved qualitative interviews with health-care workers from primary care, secondary care and community agencies (n=37) and young people (n=20) in two of Ireland's most socioeconomically disadvantaged areas and a national cross-sectional survey of GPs (n=175) were carried out.
   ResultsGP satisfaction rates were low in regard to postgraduate training received in child and adolescent mental health (17%) and substance use (21%). Key barriers to treatment included the attitude of patients/families, lack of specialist staff, poor service availability and time. Access to services (66%), knowing which interventions can be initiated in primary care (44%), having appropriate time and space (47%) and access to a youth worker (42%) were the interventions most commonly identified that would facilitate screening and treatment.
   ConclusionThe research outlined potential implications for clinical practice, research and education such as promoting awareness of mental health and the role of the GP in helping these issues, education of practitioners and improving access to psychological treatments.

AB The 'European Alliance Against Depression' community-based intervention approach simultaneously targets depression and suicidal behaviour by a multifaceted community based intervention and has been implemented in more than 115 regions worldwide. The two main aims of the European Union funded project "Optimizing Suicide Prevention Programmes and Their Implementation in Europe" were to optimise this approach and to evaluate its implementation and impact. This paper reports on the primary outcome of the intervention (the number of completed and attempted suicides combined as 'suicidal acts') and on results concerning process evaluation analysis. Interventions were implemented in four European cities in Germany, Hungary, Portugal and Ireland, with matched control sites. The intervention comprised activities with predefined minimal intensity at four levels: training of primary care providers, a public awareness campaign, training of community facilitators, support for patients and their relatives. Changes in frequency of suicidal acts with respect to a one-year baseline in the four intervention regions were compared to those in the four control regions (chi-square tests). The decrease in suicidal acts compared to baseline in the intervention regions (-58 cases, -3.26%) did not differ significantly (chi(2) = 0.13; p = 0.72) from the decrease in the control regions (-18 cases, -1.40%). However, intervention effects differed between countries (chi(2) = 8.59; p = 0.04), with significant effects on suicidal acts in Portugal (chi(2) = 4.82; p = 0.03). The interviews and observations explored local circumstances in each site throughout the study. Hypothesised mechanisms of action for successful implementation were observed and drivers for 'added-value' were identified: local partnership working and 'in-kind' contributions; an approach which valued existing partnership strengths; and synergies operating across intervention levels. It can be assumed that significant events during the implementation phase had a certain impact on the observed outcomes. However, this impact was, of course, not proven.

ID ASSOCIATION; BEHAVIOR
AB A polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) is being extensively studied for association with suicidal behavior. A new allelic variant within the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism was described but it has not been thoroughly analyzed in the recent literature. The SNP functional analysis demonstrated that the A variant of the L allele (L-A) produces high levels of mRNA and that the G variant (L-G) is equivalent to the S allele. Our aims were to compare the frequency of 5-HTTLPR alleles in 94 depressed patients who attempted suicide compared to 94 controls free of psychiatric disorder, including the embedded SNP rs25531. Using the biallelic classification, our sample contained 62 (33%) LL, 76 (40.4%) LS, and 50 (26.6%) SS individuals. Using the functional classification system, our sample contained 43 (22.5%) L'L', 84 (44.7%) L'S', and 61 (32.4%) S'S' individuals, with no significant differences between cases and controls in genotypic tests in either biallelic (chi(2) = 2.543; df = 2; p = 0.280) and functional models (chi(2) = 2.995; df = 2; p = 0.228). The minor allele frequency (MAF) - the S allele - did not show any distributional difference between cases and controls using biallelic classification system 0.51 vs. 0.43, (OR = 1.41; C195% 0.94 to 2.12; p, = 0.121). Also the S' allele of the functional classification system did not show any distributional difference between the two groups 0.59. vs. 0.51 (OR = 1.35: C195% 0.90 to 2.03; p = 0.178). This study provided the possibility of a re-analysis of novell 5-HTTLPR functional variants identified within L allele that alters its mRNA production and thus changes its functionality. We could not find any association between both biallelic and functional 5-HTTLPR in depressed patients with suicide attempt, being the small sample size an important limitation for these results. In conclusion, we can suggest that despite the several studies in this issue, the exact effect and role of 5-HTTLPR in genetics of suicide is still unclear and should be better investigated for future studies.

AB Objectives: Self-harm is a major health problem in many countries, with potential adverse outcomes including suicide and other causes of premature death. It is important to monitor national trends in this behaviour. We examined trends in non-fatal self-harm and its management in England during the 13-year period, 2000-2012.
   Design and setting: This observational study was undertaken in the three centres of the Multicentre Study of Self-harm in England. Information on all episodes of self-harm by individuals aged 15 years and over presenting to five general hospitals in three cities (Oxford, Manchester and Derby) was collected through face-to-face assessment or scrutiny of emergency department electronic databases. We used negative binomial regression models to assess trends in rates of self-harm and logistic regression models for binary outcomes (eg, assessed vs non-assessed patients).
   Participants: During 2000-2012, there were 84 378 self-harm episodes (58.6% by females), involving 47 048 persons. Results: Rates of self-harm declined in females (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.98; 95% CI 0.97 to 0.99, p<0.0001). In males, rates of self-harm declined until 2008 (IRR 0.96; 95% CI 0.95 to 0.98, p<0.0001) and then increased (IRR 1.05; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09, p=0.002). Rates of self-harm were strongly correlated with suicide rates in England in males (r=0.82, p=0.0006) and females (r=0.74, p=0.004). Over 75% of self-harm episodes were due to self-poisoning, mainly with analgesics (45.7%), antidepressants (24.7%) and benzodiazepines (13.8%). A substantial increase in self-injury occurred in the latter part of the study period. This was especially marked for self-cutting/stabbing and hanging/asphyxiation. Psychosocial assessment by specialist mental health staff occurred in 53.2% of episodes.
   Conclusions: Trends in rates of self-harm and suicide may be closely related; therefore, self-harm can be a useful mental health indicator. Despite national guidance, many patients still do not receive psychosocial assessment, especially those who self-injure.

AB Background: Overdose (OD) is a common cause of death in opioid users. Also, many current opioid users report a history of non-fatal OD. The present study aimed to identify factors associated with a history of non-fatal OD.
   Methods: A sample of 7085 Swedish criminal justice clients with alcohol or drug misuse was assessed, using the Addiction Severity Index. Subjects reporting use of opioids during the 30 days prior to incarceration were included (n = 1113). Relevant variables of misuse pattern, heredity, psychiatric symptoms and previous criminal charges were analysed in a logistic regression model.
   Results: A history of non-fatal OD was reported by 55% (n =604). The estimated contribution to the variance in OD history was 25% for variables describing misuse pattern, compared to 10% for psychiatric symptoms, 8% for heredity, and 8% for previous criminal charges. The final model included the following variables: history of injection drug use (OR 3.28), history of heroin use (OR 2.87), history of suicide attempt (OR 1.92), history of tranquilliser use (OR 1.91), being born in Sweden or other Nordic countries (OR 1.74), difficulty in controlling violent behaviour (OR 1.68). and paternal alcohol problems (OR 1.57).
   Conclusions: Suicide attempts and difficulty in controlling violent behaviour were associated with history of non-fatal OD, independent of variables of misuse pattern. This may indicate a possible association with impulse control disturbances, and may have clinical applications. Country of birth and heredity of alcohol problems also had some influence. As expected, severity of misuse most strongly contributed to history of non-fatal OD. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Self-injurious behaviours (SIB) can provide useful criteria for subtyping heroin-dependent patients, since SIB have been related to an opioid system dysfunction and they hinder patient management. The frequency of nine varieties of moderate/superficial SIB during active heroin use was assessed retrospectively in 164 heroin-dependent patients. A principal component analysis of SIB episodes revealed a four-component solution which accounted for 69.3% of the variance. The components were named as follows (percentage of variance explained by each component is enclosed in parentheses): 'SIB with objects' (27.3%), 'SIB by biting/scratching/hairpulling' (18.2%), 'SIB by hitting' (12.3%), and 'SIB by picking scabs' (11.5%). A cluster analysis using the results of the principal component analysis enabled us to define three types of heroin-dependent patients, labelled: 'low-occurrence SIB cluster' (59.8%), 'high-occurrence scab-picking cluster' (31.7%) and 'high-occurrence hitting and cutting cluster' (8.5%). SIB by hitting was the most discriminatory component among clusters: its frequency was at a minimum in the low-occurrence SIB cluster, and attained a maximum in the high-occurrence hitting and cutting cluster. However, there were no differences among clusters regarding heroin-use variables. Patients from the low-occurrence SIB cluster, compared with those from the other two clusters, reported fewer episodes of SIB or suicide attempts and were diagnosed less frequently with bulimia. Patients from the high-occurrence scab-picking cluster had a very frequent history of these SIB, while the opposite was true in patients from the high-occurrence hitting and cutting cluster. Patients from this cluster probably presented staff members with the main management problems. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The efficacy of the suicide gene therapy by using the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (HSVtk/GCV) system for the treatment of cancer is limited because of the insufficient gene transfer and the low killing activity. To enhance the anti-tumor activity, we probed into whether recombinant retroviral expression vector PLXSN expressing both HSVtk and TNF-alpha genes could potentiate the destruction of SGC7901. The pL(tk-TNF-alpha)SN harboring HSVtk and TNF-alpha genes in sequence was constructed with a bicistronic unit including the internal ribosomal entry site, the recombinant retroviruses were transferred into SGC7901 cells by lipofectamine, and pEGFP and Western blot analysis were used to detect the expression of fusion genes in transfected SGC7901 cells, and then apoptosis of the transfected cells were detected by using the TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling, flow cytometric analysis and transmission electron microscopy. In vitro study, the transfected gastric cancer cells were maintained in the GCV-contained medium, to assay the cell killing effect and bystander effect.
   In vivo experiments, retroviral serum plasmids were transfected into tumor-bearing nude mice, to observe the changes of tumor volumes and survival of the mice. In vitro there was no significant difference of cell survival rate between the three groups. However, in vivo results showed that tklGCV, tk-TNIF-alpha/GCV and TNF-alpha could inhibit the tumor growth, and the obvious anti-tumor effect was shown in tk-TNF-alpha/GCV group, and TNF-alpha obviously enhanced the anti-tumor effect in vivo. The pathologic examination showed necrosis of the cancer in the treated groups. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI Exploring synergistic interactions and catalysts in complex

AB Background: The Medical Research Council (MRC) Framework for complex interventions highlights the need to explore interactions between components of complex interventions, but this has not yet been fully explored within complex, non-pharmacological interventions. This paper draws on the process evaluation data of a suicide prevention programme implemented in four European countries to illustrate the synergistic interactions between intervention levels in a complex programme, and to present our method for exploring these.
   Methods: A realist evaluation approach informed the process evaluation, which drew on mixed methods, longitudinal case studies. Data collection consisted of 47 semi-structured interviews, 12 focus groups, one workshop, fieldnoted observations of six programme meetings and 20 questionnaires (delivered at six month intervals to each of the four intervention sites). Analysis drew on the framework approach, facilitated by the use of QSR NVivo (v10). Our qualitative approach to exploring synergistic interactions (QuaSIC) also developed a matrix of hypothesised synergies that were explored within one workshop and two waves of data collection.
   Results: All four implementation countries provided examples of synergistic interactions that added value beyond the sum of individual intervention levels or components in isolation. For instance, the launch ceremony of the public health campaign (a level 3 intervention) in Ireland had an impact on the community-based professional training, increasing uptake and visibility of training for journalists in particular. In turn, this led to increased media reporting of OSPI activities (monitored as part of the public health campaign) and also led to wider dissemination of editorial guidelines for responsible reporting of suicidal acts. Analysis of the total process evaluation dataset also revealed the new phenomenon of the OSPI programme acting as a catalyst for externally generated (and funded) activity that shared the goals of suicide prevention.
   Conclusions: The QuaSIC approach enabled us to develop and refine our definition of synergistic interactions and add the innovative concept of catalytic effects. This represents a novel approach to the evaluation of complex interventions. By exploring synergies and catalytic interactions related to a complex intervention or programme, we reveal the added value to planned activities and how they might be maximised.

AB Background: Heroin use carries the highest burden of disease of any drug of dependence. The study aimed to determine mortality rates of the Australian Treatment Outcome Study cohort over the period 2001-2015, and the years of potential life lost (YPLL).
   Methods: The cohort consisted of 615 heroin users. Crude mortality rates per 1000 person years (PY) and Standardised Mortality Ratios (SMR) were calculated. YPLL were calculated using two criteria: years lost prior to age 65, and years lost prior to average life expectancy.
   Results: The cohort was followed for 7,790.9 PY. At 2015, 72 (11.7%) of the cohort were deceased, with a crude mortality rate of 9.2 per 1000 PYs. Neither age nor gender associated with mortality. The SMR was 10.2 (males 7.3, females 17.2), matched for age, gender and year of death. The most common mortality cause was opioid overdose (52.8%). Using the <65 years criterion, there were 1988.3 YPLL, with a mean of 27.6 (males 27.6, females 27.7). Using the average life expectancy criterion, there were 3135.1 YPLL, with a mean of 43.5 (males 41.9, females 46.3). Accidental overdose (<65yr 63.0%, average life expectancy 63.7%) and suicide (<65yr 12.8%, average life expectancy 13.3%) accounted for three quarters of YPLL where cause of death was known.
   Conclusions: YPLL associated with heroin use was a quarter of a century, or close to half a century, depending on the criteria used. Given the prominent role of overdose and suicide, the majority of these fatalities, and the associated YPLL, appear preventable. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To outline the recent features of child and elderly victims from the medico-legal perspective with special reference to abuse and neglect, a retrospective investigation of forensic autopsy cases over a 5 year period (1994-1998) in the southern half of Osaka city and surrounding areas (a population of 1.57 million) was undertaken. Among 646 autopsy cases, there were 53 child cases (under the age of 15 pears, about 80% below 6) and 121 elderly cases (65 years old and above). Nearly half of the child deaths and more than half of the elderly deaths were described as accidental. Fire and traffic victims were much more frequent in the elderly. Child victims included those of neonaticide/infanticide (n = 6), physical abuse (n = 10), unintentional fatal infliction (n = 2), neglect (n = 2), mutual suicide (II = 2), suicide (n = 1) and murder (n = 3). Child abuse and neglect were domestic maltreatment nt by the parents. In this series, there was a comparable number of fatalities due to maltreatment in the elderly (n = 13) and in children, and non-domestic violence was more frequent in the elderly than domestic violence. Elderly females tended to be battered by their sons or grandsons in domestic violence cases, whereas males were predominantly attacked by younger males in non-domestic violence. The other elderly victims included those of self-neglect (n = 2), murder (n = 7) and suicide (n = 9). Non-domestic homicide of the elderly occurred mainly in the center of the city, whereas domestic maltreatment of children and the elderly was sporadic, although somewhat more frequent in the peripheral tom of the city and the surrounding areas. The above profile of child and elderly abuse suggests a substantial influence of social and familial backgrounds. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study was to replicate previous findings indicating that early-onset panic attack (less than or equal to 20 years) with fear represents a possible prodrome of early-onset severe psychopathology. Data were drawn from the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Survey (ECA) (n=20 291), a household sample of adults aged 18 and older drawn from five cities in the United States. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to differentiate those with early-onset panic attacks with fear from those with other panic attacks (early-onset without fear, late-onset without fear, late-onset with fear) with regard to psychiatric comorbidity, age at onset of comorbid mental disorders, and suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Results of statistical analyses revealed that early-onset fearful panic attack (n = 368) was associated with increased likelihood of major affective and substance use disorders, significantly earlier onset of comorbid mental disorders, higher rates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, and higher rates of antisocial personality disorder compared with those with other subtypes of panic attacks. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that early-onset fearful panic was independently associated with increased odds of major depression [OR= 3.0 (2.6, 3.5)], bipolar disorder [OR=7.9 (5.7, 10.8)], antisocial personality disorder [OR=1.5 (1.3, 1.7)], agoraphobia [OR=1.2 (1.1, 1.4)], simple phobia [OR=1.6 (1.4, 1.8)], and alcohol dependence [OR = 1.3 (1.2, 1.5)], compared with those with all other panic attacks. These findings are consistent with previous epidemiologic data and provide new evidence to suggest that early-onset fearful panic attack may be a marker of increased vulnerability to severe and persistent psychopathology and associated with high rates of suicidality, (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB Compilations of substances detected in fatal intoxications are important in order to observe changes in intoxication patterns, to monitor effects of preventive work and to discover new trends in drug usage. The aim of the present study was to describe the current pattern of substances detected in fatal intoxications in Sweden. Fatal intoxications investigated at the Department of Forensic Chemistry, Linkoping, Sweden, during 1992-2002, were analysed. All suicides, uncertain cases and accidents where the cause of death were fatal intoxications (ICD-9: E950, E980 and E859) were included and substances detected in more than 50 fatal intoxications (in femoral blood) were listed. For each substance, a cut off value was set, above which concentrations were considered toxic. Fatal intoxications were detected by forensic-chemical analyses in 12% (6998/60,314) of the forensic autopsies during the study period. Among the suicides, an average of 3.8 substances were detected per case, the corresponding figure for uncertain cases and accidents were 3.5 and 4.1 substances, respectively. Ethanol was by far the most frequently detected substance, detected in 43% (3039) of the fatal intoxications, of which 32% (960) had toxic concentrations, followed by propoxyphene, detected in 27% (1863) of the fatal intoxications of which 74% (1370) had toxic concentrations. The number of cases where ethanol and propoxyphene were detected decreased during the study period. Moreover, other CNS-active drugs such as antidepressants, analgesics and anxiolytics were also frequently detected. The drugs with high proportions of cases with toxic concentrations detected were propoxyphene, amitriptyline, zolpidem, carisoprodol, alprazolam, thioridazine, methadone and ketobemidone. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) were detected in 12% (833) and 10% (665), respectively. A significantly (P < 0.001) higher proportion of cases where TCA were detected had toxic concentrations when compared with cases where SSRI were detected (64% versus 31%).

AB Apoptosis is a conserved and regulated cell suicide process, the malfunction of which is closely linked with carcinogenesis. Caspases control the induction of apoptosis through an enzymatic cascade that can be activated by both the mitochondrial and death receptor pathways. Smac is a mitochondrial protein that interacts with Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs) and, upon apoptotic stimuli, is released into the cytoplasm to inhibit the capase-binding activity of IAPs. Smac plays key roles in both the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, especially lung cancer. Our review will focus on the roles of Smac in lung carcinogenesis and cancer progression and its relevance in lung cancer treatment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To assess recent disparities in fatal and non-fatal injury between travellers and the general population in Ireland.
   Design: A cross-sectional population-based comparative study.
   Setting: Republic of Ireland.
   Participants: Population census and retrospective mortality data were collected from 7042 traveller families, travellers being those identified by themselves and others as members of the traveller community. Retrospective injury incidence was estimated from a survey of a random sample of travellers in private households, aged 15 years or over (702 men and 961 women). Comparable general population data were obtained from official statistical reports, while retrospective incidence was estimated from the Survey of Lifestyle, Attitude and Nutrition 2002, a random sample of 5992 adults in private households aged 18 years or over.
   Outcome measures: Potential Years of Life Lost (PYLL), Standardised Mortality Ratios (SMR), Standardised Incidence Ratios (SIR) and Case Fatality Ratios (CFR).
   Results: Injury accounted for 36% of PYLL among travellers, compared with 13% in the general population. travellers were more likely to die of unintentional injury than the general population (SMR=454 (95% CI 279 to 690) in men and 460 (95% CI 177 to 905) in women), with a similar pattern for intentional injury (SMR=637 (95% CI 367 to 993) in men and 464 (95% CI 107 to 1204 in women). They had a lower incidence of unintentional injury but those aged 65 years or over were about twice as likely to report an injury. Travellers had a higher incidence of intentional injuries (SIR=181 (95% CI 116 to 269) in men and 268 (95% CI 187 to 373) in women). Injury CFR were consistently higher among travellers.
   Conclusions: Irish travellers continue to bear a disproportionate burden of injury, which calls for scaling up injury prevention efforts in this group. Prevention and further research should focus on suicide, alcohol misuse and elderly injury among Irish travellers.

AB The livings have responsibilities for the dead: and in particular, civilized societies recognize the need for identity both during life and at death, particularly in circumstances when an unknown body is summoned for medico-legal autopsy. There are numerous tools for identification of an unknown body which includes visual identification, fingerprints, medical prostheses, odontological techniques, DNA fingerprints and to include in the list is the occupational marks over the body sustained during the course of his or her profession. The medico-legal investigators should possess comprehensive knowledge of such occupational marks, which aid in identification. We are highlighting a case of rare entity, where a forensic evaluation of occupational marks was done to establish the identity of an unknown elderly male, who committed suicide by ligature hanging.

AB Two patients, a 36-year-old female and a 36-year-old male, separately experienced new onset nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, muscle weakness and pallor. Over a period of 14-16 h these symptoms continue and progress to include hypotension refractory to therapy, pulmonary edema and cardiovascular collapse. Autopsies show hemorrhagic pulmonary edema, splenomegaly and lack of anatomical cause for sudden death. Postmortem analysis, in one case post-embalming and exhumation, revealed elevated selenium concentrations and a determination of the cause of death. These two cases present several important features associated with selenium toxicity, two of which are previously unreported: (1) selenium as a potential homicidal agent, (2) the toxidrome and time frame of selenium toxicity, (3) selenium determination in exhumed, embalmed tissues, (4) postmortem urinary selenium concentration, and (5) decrease in tissue concentrations over time.

AB Background: Public attitudes toward depression and help-seeking behaviour are important factors influencing depressed people to obtain professional help and adequate treatment. OSPI-Europe is a multi-level suicide prevention programme including a public awareness campaign. It was implemented in four regions of four European countries (Germany, Hungary, Ireland and Portugal). This paper reports the results of the evaluation of the campaign, including its visibility and effects of the campaign on stigma associated with depression and help seeking behaviour.
   Methods: A representative general population survey (N = 4004) including measures on personal stigma, perceived stigma, openness to help, perceived value of help, and socio-demographic variables was conducted in the four intervention and four control regions in a cross-sectional pre-post design.
   Results: The public awareness campaign was considerably more visible in Germany and Portugal compared to Ireland and Hungary. Visibility was further affected by age and years of schooling. Personal stigma, perceived stigma and openness toward professional help varied significantly across the four countries. Respondents in the intervention regions showed significantly less personal depression stigma than respondents in the control regions after the campaign. Respondents of the intervention region who were aware of the campaign reported more openness toward seeking professional help than respondents who were unaware of it.
   Conclusion: The OSPI-Europe awareness campaign was visible and produced some positive results. At the same time, it proved to be difficult to show strong, measurable and unambiguous effects, which is in line with previous studies. Public awareness campaigns as conducted within OSPI-Europe can contribute to improved attitudes and knowledge about depression in the general public and produce synergistic effects, in particular when the dissemination of awareness campaign materials is simultaneously reinforced by other intervention levels of a multi-level intervention programme.
   Limitations: The survey was cross-sectional and based on self-report, so no causal inferences could be drawn.

AB Ethylene glycol (EG) can be found in many agents, such as antifreeze. Ingestion of EG may cause serious poisoning. Adults are typically exposed when EG is ingested as a cheap substitute for ethanol or in suicide- attempts. Children may be exposed by accidental ingestion caused by decantation of EG to unlabeled bottles. EG has in itself a low toxicity, but is in vivo broken down to four organic acids: glycoaldehyde, glycolic acid, glyoxylic acid and oxalic acid. The metabolites are cell toxins that cause central nervous system depression, and cardio-pulmonary and renal failure. Glycolic acid causes severe acidosis, and oxalate is precipitated as calcium oxalate in the kidneys and other tissues. We present five case reports of fatal EG-poisoning, and review the literature concerning clinical presentation and diagnosis, pathological findings, treatment and prevention.

ID DRUG-INDUCED APOPTOSIS; DEATH
AB Apoptosis, the cell's intrinsic death program, plays a crucial role in the regulation of tissue homeostasis, and an imbalance between cell death and proliferation may result in tumor formation. Also, killing of tumor cells by diverse cytotoxic approaches such as anticancer drugs, gamma-irradiation, suicide genes or immunotherapy, is predominantly mediated through induction of apoptosis. Failure to activate apoptotic pathways in response to drug treatment may lead to resistance of neuroblastoma cells to anticancer therapies. Understanding the molecular events that regulate apoptosis induced by cytotoxic therapies and how neuroblastoma cells evade apoptotic events may provide a new paradigm for neuroblastoma therapy. Thus, novel strategies targeting resistance of neuroblastoma cells will be based on insights into the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis as well as other forms of cell death.

AB Clozapine is the only evidence-based therapy for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but it induces agranulocytosis, a rare but potentially fatal haematological adverse reaction, in less than 1% of users. To improve safety, the drug is subject to mandatory haematological monitoring throughout the course of treatment, which is burdensome for the patient and one of the main reasons clozapine is underused. Therefore, a pharmacogenetic test is clinically useful if it identifies a group of patients for whom the agranulocytosis risk is low enough to alleviate monitoring requirements. Assuming a genotypic marker stratifies patients into a high-risk and a low-risk group, we explore the relationship between test sensitivity, group size and agranulocytosis risk. High sensitivity minimizes the agranulocytosis risk in the low-risk group and is essential for clinical utility, in particular in combination with a small high-risk group.

AB Here, we describe a high-performance liquid chromatography/photodiode array detector method for the detection of imidacloprid in biological fluids in a case of suicide by ingestion of liquor mixed with Admire Flowable insecticide (containing 20% imidacloprid). A plastic bottle containing a cloudy liquid (concentration of ethanol in the liquid was 150 mg/ml and that of imidacloprid was 50 mg/ml) was found near the decedent. The biological fluids collected at autopsy were prepared by deproteinization with acetonitrile. Zolpidem was used as an internal standard. The concentrations of imidacloprid in femoral blood and cerebrospinal fluid were 105 and 58.5 mu g/ml, respectively. Ethanol was also detected in the samples, with concentrations of 1.0 mg/ml in femoral blood and 1.4 mg/ml in cerebrospinal fluid. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) is the progression of disease in the presence of castrate serum levels of testosterone with a median survival of approximately 1 year. A variety of strategies have been developed to improve survival for the patients with advanced prostate cancer. Despite such efforts, the effective treatment modality for those patients has not been established other than chemotherapy. New experimental therapeutics such as gene therapy, vaccine therapy and target therapy use various mechanisms to kill tumor cells selectively while sparing surrounding normal tissues. Furthermore, new approaches in the field of chemoprevention are being made. Recent data from landmark studies, in particular vaccines, have shown improvements in overall survival of HRPC patients.

AB Risk assessment and safety planning are considered a cornerstone of mental health practice, yet limited research exists into how mental health nurses conceptualize risk' and how they engage with risk assessment and safety planning. The aim of the present study was to explore mental health nurses' practices and confidence in risk assessment and safety planning. A self-completed survey was administered to 381 mental health nurses in Ireland. The findings indicate that nurses focus on risk to self and risk to others, with the risk of suicide, self-harm, substance abuse, and violence being most frequently assessed. Risk from others and iatrogenic' risk were less frequently considered. Overall, there was limited evidence of recovery-oriented practice in relation to risk. The results demonstrate a lack of meaningful engagement with respect to collaborative safety planning, the identification and inclusion of protective factors, and the inclusion of positive risk-taking opportunities. In addition, respondents report a lack of confidence working with positive risk taking and involving family/carers in the risk-assessment and safety-planning process. Gaps in knowledge about risk-assessment and safety-planning practice, which could be addressed through education, are identified, as are the implications of the findings for practice and research.

AB Objective: Suicide is one of the leading causes of injury-related mortality in the United States and prior research has identified alcohol and other drug use as a major risk factor. In recent years, prescription drug misuse has become a serious public health issue; however, very little research examines the relationship between prescription drug misuse and suicide or suicidal ideation.
   Methods: Using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the current research examines the relationship between prescription drug misuse and suicidal ideation among adults. Suicidal ideation was measured by asking respondents if they seriously thought about killing themselves in the past 12 months. Prescription drug misuse was defined as use without a prescription or solely for the feeling or experience caused by the drug in the past 12 months. Several multivariable logistic regression models were estimated.
   Results: Findings show that respondents who report prescription drug misuse in the past year, specifically pain relievers, are more likely to report that they had seriously though about killing themselves.
   Conclusions: The current research fills an important gap in the literature by examining the relationship between prescription drug misuse and suicidal ideation. Consistent with the extant literature, prescription drug misuse is significantly associated with suicidal ideation among adults. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examines the roles of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and drug dependence in non-fatal suicidality, i.e., suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, among Vietnam veterans in their adult years. The sample includes male veterans deployed to Vietnam, including an oversample of those who tested positive for opiates at their return (n = 642). PTSD, substance abuse, suicidality, and other psychopathology are analyzed using three waves of survey and military data covering the time period from early adolescence to middle adulthood. Measures include the onset and recency of each of the lifetime DSM-IV PTSD symptom criteria, and yearly symptom measures of DSM-IV dependence for alcohol and eight classes of psychoactive substances. Survival and hazard models are applied to assess the effects of drug dependence, PTSD, and other psychopathology on the duration of suicidality. Longitudinal models estimate the casual relationships among PTSD, drug dependence, and suicidality over a 25-year period. Results show evidence of strong continuity of PTSD, drug dependence, and suicidality over time. The causal role of drug dependence on PTSD and suicidality is limited to Young adulthood. Evidence is stronger for self-medication in later adulthood. The results indicate that a life course perspective is needed for the combined treatment of PTSD and drug dependence for severely traumatized populations. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate trait-aggression, depression and suicidal behavior of drug dependent patients with and without ADHD symptoms. The cross sectional survey was conducted in outpatient drug centers in Hungary. The Adult Self-Report Scale (ASRS), the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (AQ), the European Version of the ADolescent Assessment Dialogue (EuroADAD), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used for measures. GLM analyses, adjusting for age and gender, indicated that patients who screened positive for ADHD (ADHD+ group) had significantly higher severity of overall trait aggression, as well as physical and verbal aggression than patients who did not (ADHD negative group). The highest severity of aggression was observed when the ADHD+ status co-occurred with heroin use, while the lowest severity of aggression was detected when ADHD - status co-occurred with the use of marijuana. ADHD+ patients showed a marked increase in depression symptoms, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts as well as self-injuries associated with suicidal attempts. Considering the substantial costs of aggression and suicide from a societal perspective and from the point of view of the individual sufferer, our results highlight the importance of the diagnostic investigation of ADHD in the treatment of drug dependent patients.

AB Although non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) involves self-inflicted physical harm, many self-injurers report feeling little or no pain during the act. Here we test: (1) whether the pain analgesia effects observed among adult self-injurers are also present among adolescents, and (2) three potential explanatory models proposing that habituation, dissociation, and/or self-criticism help explain the association between NSSI and pain analgesia among adolescents. Participants were 79 adolescents (12-19 years) recruited from the community who took part in a laboratory-based pain study. Results revealed that adolescent self-injurers have a higher pain threshold and greater pain endurance than non-injurers. Statistical mediation models revealed that the habituation and dissociation models were not supported; however, a self-critical style does mediate the association between NSSI and pain analgesia. The present findings extend earlier work by highlighting that a self-critical style may help to explain why self-injurers exhibit pain analgesia. Specifically, the tendency to experience self-critical thoughts in response to stressful events may represent a third variable that increases the likelihood of both NSSI and pain analgesia. Prospective experimental studies are needed to replicate and tease apart the direction of these associations, and may provide valuable leads in the development of effective treatments for this dangerous behavior problem.

AB Suicidal ideation is a risk factor for suicide attempt and completion. Cross-sectional or retrospective studies cannot capture the dynamic course and possible predictors of suicidal ideation as it occurs in daily life. This study utilizes an experience sampling paradigm to identify real-time predictors of suicidal ideation in inpatients with major depressive disorder. Thirty-one depressed patients admitted to a psychiatric unit were signaled by a mobile device to record suicidal ideation, affect, and other symptoms, multiple times a day over 1 week. Participants completed a total of 1350 questionnaires. Seventy-four percent of the sample reported suicidal ideation during the week. Time-lagged analyses revealed that momentary ratings of Sadness, Tension, and Boredom (as well as suicidal ideation itself) predicted subsequent suicidal thoughts in the following hours. Baseline severity of depression and past suicide attempts were both correlated with mean ideation severity during the week. A number of predictors identified in prior research (e.g. hopelessness) were unrelated to subsequent suicidal ideation in the current study. Momentary interventions that guide individuals through activities designed to reduce levels of Sadness, Tension, and Boredom in real-time (e.g., thought challenging, relaxation, behavioral activation) may be especially warranted.

AB The interpersonal theory of suicidal behavior proposes that fearlessness of death and physical pain insensitivity is a necessary requisite for self-inflicted lethal self-harm. Repeated experiences with painful and provocative events are supposed to cause an incremental increase in acquired capability. The present study examined whether playing a first-person shooter-game in contrast to a first-person racing game increases pain tolerance, a dimension of the acquired capability construct, and risk-taking behavior, a risk factor for developing acquired capability. N=81 male participants were randomly assigned to either play an action-shooter or a racing game before engaging in a game on risk-taking behavior and performing a cold pressor task (CPT). Participants exhibited higher pain tolerance after playing an action shooter game than after playing a racing game. Furthermore, playing an action shooter was generally associated with heightened risk-taking behavior. Group-differences were not attributable to the effects of the different types of games on self-reported mood and arousal. Overall these results indicate that action-shooter gaming alters pain tolerance and risk-taking behavior. Therefore, it may well be that long-term consumption of violent video games increases a person's capability to enact lethal self-harm. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to examine whether depression, hopelessness and perceptions of defeat and entrapment mediated the effects of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms on suicidal behavior. Participants were 73 individuals (mean age=29.2, S.D.=10.9, 79.5% female) diagnosed with current or lifetime PTSD who reported at least one PTSD symptom in the past month. Participants completed a series of self-report measures assessing depression, hopelessness and perceptions of defeat and entrapment. The Clinician Administrated Posttraumatic Scale for DSM-IV was administered to assess the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms. The results of Structural Equation Modeling supported a model whereby perceptions of defeat and entrapment fully mediated the effects of PTSD symptom severity upon suicidal behavior. The finding that perceptions of defeat and entrapment mediate the relationship between PTSD symptom severity and suicidal behavior was replicated in a subgroup of participants (n=50) who met the full criteria for a current PTSD diagnosis. The results support a recent theoretical model of suicide (The Schematic Appraisal Model of Suicide) which argues that perceptions of defeat and entrapment have a key role in the development of suicidal behaviors. We discuss the clinical implications of the findings. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In a number of previous reports, an association of altered, in most cases lower, serum cholesterol levels with depression, suicidal ideation and current or past suicidal behavior has been suggested. In this investigation, the course of serum cholesterol concentrations was measured in depressed patients during treatment. Ninety-two inpatients with a major depressive episode were included. Serum lipid concentrations were assessed at admission, after 1 week and after 4 weeks of antidepressant treatment. Degrees of depression and suicidality were measured with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Although there was a significant reduction in depression and suicidality scores, neither a significant change in serum cholesterol levels nor a correlation between cholesterol levels and clinical improvement was found. Further, there were no significant differences in lipid levels between patients with and without a history of attempted suicide. In patients who had used a violent method, there was a trend for lower total cholesterol levels compared to those who had poisoned themselves. The results of this study do not support the hypothesis of an association of serum cholesterol with the course of depression and suicidal ideation. Cholesterol levels do not appear to be an appropriate biological marker for suicidality during the first 4 weeks of treatment in patients with a major depressive episode.

AB Objective: To examine the potential biases arising from the nonlinkage of census records and vital events in longitudinal studies.
   Study Design and Setting: A total of 56,396 deaths of residents of Northern Ireland in the 4 years after the 2001 Census were linked to the 2001 Census records. The characteristics of matched and nonmatched death records were compared using multivariate logistic regression. Subject attributes were as recorded on the death certificate.
   Results: In total, 3,392 (6.0%) deaths could not be linked to a census record. Linkage rates were lowest in young adults, males, the unmarried, people living in communal establishments, or living in areas that were more deprived or had recorded low census enumeration. For those aged less than 65 years at census, this linkage would exclude from analysis 20.2% of suicides and 19.7% of deaths by external causes.
   Conclusion: The nonlinkage of census and death records is a combination of nonenumeration at census and deficient information about the deceased recorded at the time of death. Unmatched individuals may have been more disadvantaged or socially isolated, and analysis based on the linked data set may therefore show some bias and perhaps understate true social gradients.

AB To assess baseline predictors and consequences of antipsychotic adherence during the long-term treatment of schizophrenia outpatients, data were taken from the 3-year, prospective, observational, European Schizophrenia Outpatients Health Outcomes (SOHO) study, in which outpatients starting or changing antipsychotics were assessed every 6 months. Physician-rated adherence was dichotomized as adherence/non-adherence. Regression models tested for predictors of adherence during follow-up, and associations between adherence and outcome measures. Of the 6731 patients analysed, 71.2% were adherent and 28.8% were non-adherent over 3 years. The strongest predictor of adherence was adherence in the month before baseline assessment. Other baseline predictors of adherence included initial treatment for schizophrenia and greater social activities. Baseline predictors of non-adherence were alcohol dependence and substance abuse in the previous month, hospitalization in the previous 6 months, independent housing and the presence of hostility. Non-adherence was significantly associated with an increased risk of relapse, hospitalization and suicide attempts. In conclusion, non-adherence is common but can partly be predicted. This may allow strategies to improve adherence to be targeted to high-risk patients. Also, reversal of some risk factors may improve adherence. Non-adherence is associated with a range of poorer long-term outcomes, with clinical and economic implications. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The human body as a terrorist weapon: Hunger strikes and suicide bombers
SO STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM
LA English
DT Article
AB This article argues that a major factor in terrorist acts is an appeal to the actor's own community at an emotional and symbolic level, through acts of sacrifice, particularly self-sacrifice. Although other aims also exist, a prime concern is to recall the actor's home audience to the struggle, because the actor regards himself as acting on their behalf. This utilizes the imagery and symbolism of traditional religion, implying a strong communal and non-material impetus to terrorist acts, rather than rational material calculation, that modern Western man finds difficult to comprehend. It also recalls much classical social theory, which emphasized the central role of religion in community. Self-sacrifice tells an emotional story to the actor's community that is comprehensible to them and will have an emotional appeal to maintaining the community. For the Northern Ireland hunger strikes (possibly analogous to suicide bombers) this is reflected in their appeal solely to a Catholic/nationalist community that equates strongly with ideas of a pre-modern society under threat from a modernizing society. All the hunger strikers were very normal for their community, but left non-Catholics completely unmoved. Consequently there is a need to understand the communal dynamics behind terrorism if one is to effectively counter the threat and that different societies may have different values regarding the individual, community, and life itself. Individual motivations do not provide an adequate explanation for much terrorism and it is a failure to grasp this that severely hinders much counterterrorism.

AB In the majority of cases suicidal shots are put to the head. Typically the gun's muzzle is held against the head.
   The aim of the present prospective study was to investigate whether victim DNA could reliably be recovered from the inside of the barrels of firearms that were used in 20 cases of homicidal or suicidal close contact shots. Additionally, it was investigated whether such biological traces were eliminated by subsequent firing.
   After autopsy sterile swabs were used to collect samples from the anterior part of the barrel thereby avoiding the muzzle. In some cases prior endoscopic inspection had revealed traces of blood and soft tissue in the barrel.
   For 16 cases, another swab was used to also collect sample from the posterior part of the barrel entering from its rear end. Then one shot was fired through the weapon using the same ammunition as in the suicidal shot and the sampling procedure was repeated. DNA was extracted using a magnetic beads based protocol, quantified, and STR-systems were amplified using several commercially available multiplex-STR-PCR-kits.
   For samples taken after the first shot DNA-analysis yielded STR profiles eligible for reliable individualization in 17 of 20 cases. After a second shot had been fired 8 or more STR systems were amplified successfully in 14 of 20 barrels. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID DEATH; BATH
AB Fatalities caused by electrocution (n = 37) were re-examined on the basis of the autopsy records, the police reports and the technical expertise. Accidents including two lightning deaths caused 2/3rd and suicides 1/4th of the fatalities and there were two homicides. Carelessness or ignorance were a major reason for accidental deaths while technical defects Could be verified in five cases only. Low-voltage ac and male victims predominated. Electrical burns or Current marks were detected in 81% including all high voltage electrocutions. The seven victims lacking burns were electrocuted in a wet environment including six cases of suicide in the bathtub with a hair drier. Petechial haemorrhages were present in 74% of the cases and the favourite sites were the skin of the eyelids, conjunctivae, visceral pleura, and the epicard. The presence of petechiac did not depend on the voltage or the current pathway relative to the heart. It is, therefore. suggested that the petechiae are not caused by asphyxia but by a combination of venous congestion due to cardiac arrest and a sudden rise in blood pressure induced by muscle contractions. Consequently "electrical petechiae" represent a non-specific but typical finding in electrocution irrespective of the mechanism leading to death. Unlike electrical burns, petechiae also indicate the vital origin of the events. The relevance of this typical morphological sign in the examination of possible electrocution fatalities is therefore emphasised. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many anti-psychotic medications produce marked weight gain. In this study, we estimate the expected impact of degrees of antipsychotic-induced weight gain on selected mortality rate and incidence rates of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and hypertension (HTN) among US adults. Using raw data from 5209 respondents from the Framingham Heart Study's public use data set and national statistics on population demographics, we estimated the expected effect of weight gain on number of deaths and incident cases of IGT and HTN for a 10-year period commencing in 1999. Results indicated that the estimated deleterious effects of weight gain were greater for people with higher BMIs at baseline, for greater degrees of weight gain, for men than women, and for older than younger persons. Because there is a 'U-shaped' relation between BMI and mortality rate, small to moderate weight gains among people with baseline BMIs less than 23 were predicted to decrease mortality rates, whereas weight gains among people with baseline BMIs above that level were expected to increase mortality rates. However, the relations of IGT and HTN with BMI are monotonically increasing. Thus, the anticipated effect of weight gain on IGT and HTN is deleterious regardless of baseline BMI. Because it is unclear whether the beneficial effects of the atypical agents on, for example, reducing suicide mortality, outweigh the putative increase in mortality due to weight gain, we estimate the beneficial effects due to decreased death from suicide with the potential deleterious effects due to a 10-kg weight gain. We found that 492 suicide deaths per 100 000 schizophrenic patients would be prevented over 10 years with the use of clozapine compared to 416 additional deaths due to antipsychotic induced weight gain. Although this estimate is rather crude and should be seen only as offering a sense of the likely situation, results suggest that the lives saved via clozapine may essentially be offset by the deaths due to weight gain. As we discuss, it is not possible to provide definitive estimates of the effect of antipsychotic-induced weight gain on health and mortality, but our findings suggest that the magnitude of weight gains induced by many antipsychotic agents is likely to have important deleterious effects on mortality and health.

AB Background. Irish people living in Britain face a significant health disadvantage when compared to the white British host population. Objectives. Using recent survey data, determine whether there is an 'Irish health disadvantage' independent of socio-economic factors and explore whether there is an Irish ethnic identity effect which operates on health. Design. Data from the Census 2001 Individual Licensed SARs was analysed using binary logistic regression to study the relationship between the self-reported Irish ethnicity measure (which is presumed to reflect self-identification with Irish culture and community), considering country of birth subgroups, and the self-reported health measures of general health and limiting long-term illness. The analysis was adjusted for key demographic and socio-economic factors. Results. When compared to the white British reference population, the self-reported 'white Irish' population overall, the Irish born in Northern Ireland, and UK-born Irish, show a significantly increased risk of both self-reported poor general health and limiting long-term illness. The increased risk of poor health of the Irish born in the Republic of Ireland is greatly diminished after the socio-economic adjustments, and only statistically significant in the case of general health. Finally, the Irish born in Northern Ireland who self-report as Irish are significantly more likely than those who self-report as British to report poor general health, which may suggest an Irish ethnic identity effect. Conclusions. The findings demonstrate a persistent ethnic health disadvantage for first generation and UK-born Irish people living in England with respect to self-reported general health and limiting long-term illness, which cannot be fully explained by demographic and key socio-economic factors. Aspects of ethnicity related to both structure and identity may affect Irish self-reported health.

TI When being 'tired of living' plays an important role in a request for
   euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide: patient characteristics and
   the physician's decision
SO HEALTH POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE 'tired of living'; physician-assisted suicide; request; euthanasia;
   ageing; medicalisation
ID MEDICALISATION; NONDISEASE
AB Background: In the Netherlands physicians are allowed to grant requests for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (EAS) if they meet several requirements of due care. According to jurisprudence, a physician is not allowed to end the life of a patient whose request for EAS is based on being 'tired of living', because such a request falls outside the medical domain. Our previous studies have shown that in spite of this, such requests are made approximately 400 times a year.
   Objectives: To learn more about patients who request EAS because they are tired of living, and about factors that influence the decision of the physician.
   Design: Questionnaires (n = 4842) completed by general practitioners (n = 3994).
   Results: According to the physicians, 17% of patients who requested EAS were 'tired of living'. Of 139 patients in whose request for EAS being tired of living played a major role, 47% suffered from cancer, 25% suffered from another severe disease and 28% had no severe disease. In all three groups the same three symptoms occurred most frequently, 'feeling bad', 'tired', and 'not active'. Each of these symptoms occurred in more than half of the patients in each group. Most of the requests from patients with cancer were granted, but those from patients who had some other severe disease, or no severe disease at all, were refused. Factors that were related to granting a request were: the presence of unbearable and hopeless suffering, the absence of alternatives, and the absence of depressive symptoms.
   Conclusions: Being tired of living can play a major role in requests for EAS, both in the absence and the presence of a severe disease. The high occurrence of symptoms in the absence of a classifiable severe disease implies that physical symptoms are prevalent in this group of patients, leaving the legal requirement for EAS of 'a medical cause' open to interpretation in the more complex medical practice.

AB Background: Opioid substitution treatment (OST) has been implemented in Taiwan since 2006. We estimated the life expectancy (LE) and expected years of life lost (EYLL) in a cohort of heroin users stratified by OST for comparison.
   Methods: A total of 1283 heroin users recruited from 2006 to 2008 were linked to the National Mortality Registry until the end of 2011. Among them, 983 received OST, while 300 did not. Kaplan-Meier estimation for survival was performed, and it was extrapolated to 50 years to obtain the LE using a semi-parametric method. We further estimated the EYLL for both cohorts by subtracting their life expectancies from the age- and sex-matched referents of the general population. Cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated and compared with the national cohort to validate the representativeness of this sample.
   Results: After extrapolation to 50 years of survival, the estimated average LE and EYLL were 27.4 and 10.6 for OST subjects, respectively, while those of the non-OST were 20.2 and 18.4 years. The all-cause mortality rates (per 1000 person-years) in the observational period for the OST and non-OST group were 15.5 and 23.9, respectively, representing a 7.5- and 10.2-fold SMR compared to the general population, indicating a high representativeness for our sample. But SMR of suicide mortality elevated 16.2 and 3.1 folds in OST and non-OST group, respectively.
   Conclusions: OST saves 7.8 EYLL more than non-OST after accounting for lead time bias. Effective suicide prevention programs could enhance its life-saving effect, especially among those co-morbid with depressive disorders. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Research exploring the well-being and pastoral care of pupils attending primary and post-primary schools has become an issue of increased discourse and growing national and international concern in recent years. Society often expects that teachers can support or facilitate pupils experiencing such issues; however, there is little research that explores whether pre-service teachers encounter these issues on school placement and how they approach such concerns if they do. This paper reports on a study of pre-service teachers (N = 354) from the Republic of Ireland (RoI) and Northern Ireland (NI) and the frequency with which they encountered issues relating to bereavement, separation and divorce (BeSAD). To address the training needs, six semi-structured interviews with experts in the area of BeSAD and Initial Teacher Education (ITE) are also included. The quantitative component of the research indicated that nearly half of the pre-service teachers had encountered pupils who had experienced some form of BeSAD whilst on school placement. Respondents lacked confidence when supporting pupils experiencing BeSAD, particularly in relation to separation and divorce. The interviews conducted with experts from NI and the RoI (N = 6) identified the core role that teachers play as advocates for pupils who have experienced BeSAD.

AB The present study examined differences between White and ethnic minority emerging adults in the prevalence of self-harm behaviors - i.e., non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicide attempts (SA) - and in well-documented risk (i.e., depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety symptoms, social anxiety symptoms, suicidal ideation (SI), substance use, abuse history) and protective factors (i.e., religiosity/spirituality, family support, friend support) associated with NSSI and SAs. Emerging adults (N = 1156; 56% ethnic minority), ages 17-29 (M=22.3, S.D.=3.0), who were presented at a counseling center at a public university in the Northeastern U.S., completed a clinical interview and self-report symptom measures. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the association between risk and protective factors in predicting history of NSSI-only, any SA, and no self-harm separately among White and ethnic minority individuals. Ethnic differences emerged in the prevalence and correlates of NSSI and SAs. Social anxiety was associated with SAs among White individuals but with NSSI among ethnic minority individuals. Substance use was a more relevant risk factor for White individuals, and friend support was a more relevant protective factor for ethnic minority individuals. These findings suggest differing vulnerabilities to NSSI and SAs between White and ethnic minority emerging adults. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB According to World Health Organization, the life expectancy at birth is increasing. An increase in life expectancy might result in increased morbidity and mortality in elderly. The increase in the elderly population also leads to an increase in medico-legal problems, as well. Autopsy is of high importance for determination of cause of death in clinical and forensic cases. The purpose of this study was to find out general characteristics elderly deaths by examining forensic autopsy records.
   Out of 7033 forensic autopsies performed between years of 2007 and 2011, 1324 were elderly deaths and were included in the scope of the study. The records of public prosecutor office, crime scene investigation and autopsy findings were examined.
   The majority of victims (70.6%) were male, while 29.4% were female, with a male to female ratio of 2.4/1. Victims' ages ranged between 65 and 96 years, and the mean age was 74.8 years. A great number of presented elderly deaths were due to unnatural causes, followed by natural deaths cases. Out of unnatural deaths, 63.2% were related to accidents, 23.7% were suicides, and remaining 13.1% were homicides. More than half (56.6%) of all suicidal deaths were due to hanging. Of natural deaths, the majority (82.7%) were due to cardiovascular system disease.
   In the presented series the cause of death was determined in 90.9% of all elderly deaths, which validates the need for a forensic autopsy. Data obtained through autopsy procedures is of high importance for death statistics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a chronic, disabling, and high-risk mental disorder characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability in regulation of emotion, interpersonal relationships, self-image, and impulse control beginning in early adulthood. BPD affects about]%-2% of the general population and has a high mortality rate as a result of suicide and impulsive behaviour. The serotonin 2A receptor gene (HTR2A) is considered a candidate gene for BPD because multiple lines of evidence suggest that it plays an important role in suicide, impulsivity and emotional liability. To test for an association between HTR2A and BPD, we genotyped four polymorphisms, rs6313 (T102C), rs4941573, rs2296972 and rs6314 (His452Tyr), in 111 Caucasian patients with BPD and 287 Caucasian healthy controls. The program UNPHASED was used to compare allele and haplotype frequencies between cases and controls. We did not find a significant association between HTR2A and BPD based on allele, genotype or haplotype analyses. However, there were significant associations between HTR2A and personality traits in the BPD patients. The C allele of rs6313 and the A allele of rs4941573 associated with a higher Extraversion score. Our results suggest that the serotonin 2A receptor gene may not play a major role in the aetiology of borderline personality disorder, but may have a role in personality traits.

AB Objective: In the project 'Support and Consultation on Euthanasia in The Netherlands' (SCEN), general practitioners (GPs) receive training in formal consultation and in giving expert advice to colleagues who have questions about euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (EAS). This study describes the way in which this project was implemented in The Netherlands and how it was received by GPs.
   Method: In the period from April 2000 to December 2002, all GPs in the districts in which SCEN had been implemented received a written post-test questionnaire a year and a half after the start of the project. Registration forms were also filled in by the SCEN physicians and the GPs who contacted SCEN. The post-test questionnaire was returned by 60% of the GPs (n = 3614), and registration forms were returned by 86% (n = 3337) of the GPs who contacted SCEN.
   Results: The gradual nation-wide implementation of SCEN was completed within the 4-year study period. Almost all GPs were familiar with the project (99%) and most GPs knew what they could contact SCEN for. Most GPs felt supported by the presence of SCEN, and most GPs also had a positive attitude towards consultation and SCEN. GPs who had received an explicit request for EAS, or had performed EAS, often consulted SCEN physicians (71 and 85%, rispectively). Reasons for contacting SCEN were: independence (60%), expertise (58%), and accessibility/availability of a consultant (45%). Reasons for not contacting SCEN were: enough other possibilities for counselling and consultation (48%) only at the beginning of the decision-making process (36%), and sufficient knowledge about EAS (22%). Most GPs intended to use SCEN in the future (96%).
   Conclusion The implementation of SCEN has been successful, according to the four steps for successful implementation: awareness. attitude. use and future use. In this respect, linking up with existing networks and gocd organisation may play an important role. Furthermore, GPs consider it important to have a facility like SCEN which they can contact concerning EAS. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Suicidal Ideation among Afghanistan/Iraq War Veterans remains a health concern. As young Veterans adjust to civilian life, new risk factors might emerge and manifest differently in this group versus those in the general population. We explored these differences. With 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data, we examined differences in risk of past-year suicidal ideation between Veterans of the Afghanistan/Iraq War periods aged 18-34 years (N=328) and age-comparable civilians (N=23,222). We compared groups based on individual and socio-environmental risk factors as well as perceptions of unmet mental healthcare needs. We report adjusted rate ratios (aRRs); interaction terms tested for between-group differences. PY suicidal ideation rates for Veterans and civilians did not differ (52 versus 59 per 1,000, p=0.60) and both groups shared many risk factors. However, drug problems and perceived unmet mental health care needs were vastly stronger risk factors among Veterans versus civilians (interaction terms indicated that the aRRs were 3.8-8.0 times higher for Veterans versus civilians). Other differences were discovered as well. Past-year suicidal ideation rates did not differ by Veteran status among young adults. However, different risk factors per group were detected, which can inform Veteran suicide prevention efforts. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB We examined the prevalence, correlates, and comorbidities of adult attention-deficit hypersensitivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in a Korean community using data from the National Epidemiological Survey of Psychiatric Disorders in Korea conducted in 2006. A total of 6081 subjects aged 18 to 59 years participated in this study. Diagnostic assessments were based on the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale Screener and Composite International Diagnostic Interview administered by lay interviewers. The frequencies of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) disorders, sleep disturbances, and suicidal tendency were compared in the ADHD and non-ADHD groups. Odds ratios and significance levels were calculated. The 6 month prevalence of adult ADHD symptoms was 1.1%. Associations between ADHD symptoms and alcohol abuse/dependence, nicotine dependence, mood disorders, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, social phobia, specific phobia, somatoform disorder, sleep disturbances, and suicidality were overwhelmingly positive and significant (P<0.05), after controlling for gender and age. Adult ADHD symptoms are highly associated with substance abuse, mood and anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, sleep disturbances and suicidality, suggesting that clinicians should carefully evaluate and treat such psychiatric disorders in adults with ADHD symptoms.

   IDEATION; COMORBIDITY
AB Aims: To examine whether the association between prevalence measures of suicidality and substance abuse/dependence among adolescents (1) is attenuated when temporal priority of exposure and outcome are taken into account, (2) extends to substance use (i.e. without disorder), (3) applies to tobacco use and dependence independent of illicit drugs and alcohol use/disorder, and (4) is confounded by comorbid mental illness.
   Design: Discrete-time survival models were applied to retrospectively reported age of onset of first suicidal ideation, plan and attempt and age of onset of first substance use and disorder. Participants: 3005 adolescents aged 12-17 residing in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area in 2005.
   Measurements: The World Mental Health computer-assisted adolescent version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to assess suicidal outcomes and psychiatric disorders including substance dependence/abuse.
   Findings: Use of and dependence on tobacco is as strong a predictor of subsequent suicidality as is use of and dependence with abuse of alcohol and drugs. The association between substance use and subsequent suicidality is not fully accounted for by comorbid mental illness.
   Conclusion: Efforts to reduce the use as well as the abuse of alcohol, drugs and tobacco may help reduce the risk of subsequent suicidal behaviors among adolescents in Mexico. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Common clinical wisdom suggests that people who engage in self-injury are impulsive. However, virtually all prior work in this area has relied on individuals' self-report of impulsiveness, despite evidence that people are limited in their ability to accurately report on cognitive processes that occur outside awareness. To address this knowledge gap. we used performance-based measures of several dimensions of impulsiveness to assess whether people engaging in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) demonstrate greater impulsiveness than non-injurers. In Study 1, we compared adolescent self-injurers (n = 64) to age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-matched, non-injurious controls (n. = 30) on self-reported impulsiveness (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children. Present and LifetimeVersion) and on performance-based measures of two dimensions ofi mpulsiveness: behavioral disinhibition (Conners' Continuous Performance Test) and risky decision-making (Iowa Gambling Task). In Study 2, we compared adult female self-injurers (n = 20) with age- and race/ethnicity-matched, non-injurious controls (n = 20) on self-reported impulsiveness (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11), and performance-based measures of behavioral disinhibition, risky decision-making. and two measures of delay discounting. In both studies, self-injurers reported greater impulsiveness; however. performance-based measures of impulsiveness failed to detect any between-group differences. We propose several potential explanations for the discrepancies observed between self-report and performance-based measures of impulsiveness and discuss directions for future research on impulsiveness and self-injury.

ID POSTMORTEM DIFFUSION; INSECTICIDE
AB The carbamate aldicarb (Temik(R)) is a highly toxic (LD50 = 0.9 mg/kg oral in rats) insecticide often used in agriculture.
   The authors present a fatal intoxication case with aldicarb, in a 24-year-old male, under police custody in the island of S. Tome and Prince (STP), in Africa. He was found 3 h after his arrest, lying on the floor of his cell, unconscious, frothing at the mouth, and entered into the hospital already dead. Aldicarb analysis was carried out by high- performance liquid chromatography, with a post-column derivatization system (with o-phthaldialdehyde and 2-mercaptoethanol, under alkaline conditions at 80 degreesC) with fluorescence detection at lambda(ex) = 339 nm and lambdaem = 445 nm.
   The toxicological analysis revealed toxic concentrations of aldicarb in the post-mortem samples: blood (6.2 mug/ml), stomach (48.9 mug/g), liver (0.80 mug/g), kidney (8.10 mug/g), heart (6.70 mug/g) and urine (17.50 mug/ml). It was also detected to be the same substance in a grey granulate powder supplied by criminal authorities of that country, as a probable substance ingested by the victim.
   The toxicological analysis results, the autopsy findings and the information given, allowed us to conclude that death occurred due to an aldicarb acute intoxication. Although the case suggested a suicide, particularly based on the known information and on the high aldicarb concentration found in the stomach, it was not possible to indicate precisely its etiology (suicide or homicide).

   PREVALENCE; HISTORY
AB The relationship between bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder has generated intense interest. Similar to patients with bipolar disorder, patients with borderline personality disorder are frequently hospitalized, are chronically unemployed, abuse substances, attempt and commit suicide. However, one significant difference between the two disorders is that patients with borderline personality disorder are often viewed negatively by mental health professionals. In the present paper we examined whether this negative bias against borderline personality disorder might be reflected in the level of research funding on the disorder. We searched the National Institute of Health (NIH) Research Portfolio Online Portfolio Reporting Tool (RePORT) for the past 25 years and compared the number of grants funded and the total amount of funding for borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder. The yearly mean number of grants receiving funding was significantly higher for bipolar disorder than for borderline personality disorder. Results were the same when focusing on newly funded grants. For every year since 1990 more grants were funded for bipolar disorder than borderline personality disorder. Summed across all 25 years, the level of funding for bipolar disorder was more than 10 times greater than the level of funding for borderline personality disorder ($622 million vs. $55 million). These findings suggest that the level of NIH research funding for borderline personality disorder is not commensurate with the level of psychosocial morbidity, mortality, and health expenditures associated with the disorder.

AB On 12 March 2011 an earthquake devastated the Matsunoyama and Matsudai districts of Tokamachi City, Niigata, Japan. These areas had high pre-existing suicide rates, especially among the elderly. We investigated whether mental health status became worse among the sufferers 5 months after the earthquake, and what kind of factors were implicated in any changes. A 15-item questionnaire that tapped earthquake-related variables and the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale to measure psychological distress were distributed to 1923 residents aged over 40 years. The mean age (S.D.) of the total 1731 respondents (male, 805; female, 926) was 68.2 (13.1) years. Of these, we assessed K10 scores from 1346 respondents. The mean scores (S.D.) for K10 and K6 (six selected items from the K10) were 5.8 (6.3) and 3.4 (3.9), respectively. Among the respondents, 9.1% and 3.2% obtained a score of K10 >= 15 and K6 >= 13, respectively. These scores showed slightly higher psychological distress, especially among the elderly, in comparison with existing community-based data. Categorical regression analysis revealed significant and relatively strong effects of initial psychological impact, decrease in sleep hours, advanced age, and decrease in interpersonal relationships within the community on the 1(10 score. The last item suggests the importance of socio-environmental factors in post-disaster mental health. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article draws on legal arguments made by civil society organisations to challenge the legal reasoning that apparently produced the decision in the Ms Y case in Ireland in August 2014. I show how legal standards of reasonableness and practicality ought to be interpreted in ways that are respectful of the patient's wishes and rights. The case concerned a decision by the Health Service Executive, the Irish public health authority, to refuse an abortion to a pregnant asylum seeker and rape survivor on the grounds that a caesarean section and early live delivery were practicable and reasonable alternatives justified by the need to protect fetal life. I argue that the abortion refusal may not have been a reasonable decision, as required by the terms of relevant legislation, for four different reasons. First, the alternative of a caesarean section and early live delivery was not likely to avert the risk of suicide, and in fact did not do so. Second, the consent to the caesarean section alternative may not have been a real consent in the legal sense if it was not voluntary. Third, an abortion refusal and forcible treatment fall below the norms of good medical practice as interpreted through a patient-centred perspective. Fourth, an abortion refusal that entails forms of cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment ought not to be a reasonable action under the legislation. (C) 2014 Reproductive Health Matters

AB The risk factors for suicidal behaviour in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have been less studied compared than in other anxiety disorders. In the present study, we examined the demographic and clinical correlates of current suicidal ideation (SI) in patients with OCD. Forty-four patients were grouped into those with (n = 23) and without current SI (n = 21) as assessed by the Scale for Suicidal Ideation. The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was used to assess the obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptomatology. Following Bonferroni correction, only the severity of depression differed significantly between the two groups. The presence of major depression and aggressive obsessions, the level of hopelessness, and the severity of OC symptomatology were significant predictors of current SI in patients with OCD. The relatively low frequency of some comorbid Axis I disorders is based on small sample size and therefore may be vulnerable to type II error. We did not examine the relationship between the recent suicidal attempts and OCD. Also, we did not assess the effect of impulsivity in the occurrence of SI in patients with OCD. Associated depression, hopelessness, and aggressive obsessions might play an important role in the occurrence of SI in patients with OCD. However, future studies with a psychological autopsy design are required to systematically determine the presence for OCD among those who have completed suicide. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI Client personal recovery and recovery orientation of an Irish suicide
   intervention charity
SO IRISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background. Recovery is a key goal for individuals, and services' recovery orientation can facilitate this process. The independent mental health sector is increasingly important in Ireland, particularly in counselling and suicide prevention. We aimed to evaluate Pieta House as a recovery-oriented service through clients' self-rated recovery; and clients and therapists' evaluation of the service.
   Methods. Clients completing therapy over a 3-month period were invited to complete the Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS) and the Recovery Self Assessment-Revised (RSA-R). Therapists completed the RSA-R staff version.
   Results. Response rate was 36.7% for clients (n = 88), 98% for therapists (n = 49). Personal recovery was endorsed by 73.8% of clients, with highest agreement for factors 'Willingness to Ask for Help' (84.5%), and 'Reliance on Others' (82.1%). A smaller number agreed with factors 'Personal Confidence and Hope' (61.3%) and 'No Domination by Symptoms' (66.6%). Clients' and therapists' evaluation of the service showed high levels of agreement with factors of 'Choice' (90.9% clients, 100% therapists); 'Life Goals' (84.1% clients, 98% therapists) and 'Individually Tailored Services' (80.6% clients, 79.6% therapists). Client involvement in service management had the lowest level of agreement (36.4% clients, 30.6% therapists). Clients' self-rated recovery correlated with their rating of the service (correlation value 0.993, p = 0.01).
   Conclusions. Clients' self-rated recovery and the recovery orientation of Pieta House were rated highly, with areas for improvement in service user involvement, peer support and advocacy. The correlation of personal recovery and recovery orientation of the service may merit further study.

AB To determine if oxidative stress and inflammation are linked with major depressive disorder, nicotine dependence and both disorders combined. This study comprised 150 smokers and 191 never smokers. The instruments were: a socio-demographic questionnaire, diagnoses of mood disorder and nicotine dependence according to DSM-IV, (SCID-IV), and the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test. Laboratory assessments included: nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), lipid hydroperoxides, malondialdehyde (MDA), total reactive antioxidant potential (TRAP), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), fibrinogen concentrations, homocysteine, erythrocytes sedimentation rate (ESR) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were assayed from blood specimens. Statistically significant differences were found among depressed smokers who had more severe depressive symptoms, a higher risk of alcohol consumption, more suicide attempts, and more disability for work than non-depressed never smokers. Depressed smokers had significantly higher levels of NOx, fibrinogen, hs-CRP, AOPP, ESR and lower levels of TRAP compared to non-depressed never smokers. Depressed smokers had significant levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers after adjusting for gender, age, years of education, disability for work, and laboratory measures. The levels of NOx, lipid hydroperoxides, AOPP, and fibrinogen were substantially higher, whereas levels of TRAP were lower in depressed smokers compared to non-depressed never smokers. (1) Depressed smokers exhibited altered concentrations of NOx, lipid hydroperoxides, AOPP, TRAP, and fibrinogen. (2) Depressed smokers were more unable to work, showed more severe depressive symptoms and attempted suicide more frequently. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal behaviors frequently occur among adolescent psychiatric patients. Although those behaviors are distinct with regards to intent, NSSI has been shown to be an important risk-factor for suicide attempts. However, the association of NSSI and Suicidal Behavior Disorder (SBD) according to DSM-5 criteria has not yet been investigated. For investigating distinctive features and mutual risk-factors of NSSI-disorder and SBD, adolescent psychiatric inpatients (N=111, aged 12-19 years; 65.8% females) were interviewed using the Self-Injurious-Thoughts-And-Behaviors-Interview-German (SITBI-G). NSSI started significantly earlier in life (M=12.5 years, SD=2.2) than first suicide attempts (M=14.1 years, SD=2.0). Patients meeting NSSI-disorder and/or SBD were significantly more likely to be female and to be diagnosed with an affective disorder. NSSI-disorder and SBD seem to have several distinctive features (i.e. age of onset or frequency), but also seem to share certain mutual risk-factors (i.e. affective disorders, female gender). While both NSSI and SBD seem to be maintained by mainly automatic negative reinforcement, positive automatic and social functions were rated significantly higher for NSSI. Most importantly, NSSI seems to be a strong risk factor for the occurrence of SBD (even when controlling for suicidal ideation) and should therefore always be assessed when dealing with psychiatric adolescent patients.

AB Over the last decades, paraquat (1,1'-dimethy1-4,4'-bipyridilium dichloride; PQ) has been involved in numerous fatalities especially attributed to suicide attempts. Previously, it was shown that salicylates, namely sodium salicylate (NaSAL) and lysine acetylsalicylate (LAS) may form complexes with PQ which may contribute to prevent its toxicity. The direct chemical reactivity between PQ and NaSAL was previously studied by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry, showing the formation of complexes, though reported data was not fully conclusive. In the present study, the structure of the complex of PQ with NaSAL is fully characterized by crystallography. It was observed that PQ is complexed with 4 NaSAL molecules. Since formulations containing PQ and salicylates have been proposed, these results point that the stoichiometry of 1:4 (PQ:salicylates) should be considered to optimize prevention of PQ-mediated toxic effects.

AB Therapeutic relationships (TRs) are considered a key component of good psychiatric care, yet its association with outcomes for individuals with psychosis remains unclear. Five hundred and sixty-nine service users with psychotic disorders and care coordinators in community settings rated their therapeutic relationship; outcomes were assessed 18 months later. In multivariate analyses, a small but significant association was found between service user ratings and instances of psychiatric hospital admissions, self harm and suicide attempts over an 18 month period. Care coordinator ratings were associated with instances of psychiatric hospital admissions and harm to others over the 18 months and level of functioning at 18 months. The differential findings and small effect size suggests that the therapeutic relationship needs further definition for this patient group in this setting. Nevertheless, clinicians should prioritise interactions that strengthen therapeutic relationships. (c) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB The current study analyzed the life events reported by 1271 demented patients vs. 140 cognitively healthy elderly subjects. The Life Change Unit (LCU) method was used to quantify the results. When all the events were included in the analysis, the two groups had similar LCU scores (61.26 vs. 63.42). However, when events causally related to dementia (e.g. stroke) are excluded, demented patients were found to experience half of the LCU load in comparison to controls (30.70 vs. 63.42). In both groups the level of LCU load is far below 100 which is the threshold suggested for the induction of psychosomatic disorders. Conclusively, the current study suggests that there is no causal role for life events in the etiopathogenesis of dementia. On the contrary, demented patients even the last few months before the clinical onset of dementia experience low life-events-related stress, possibly because of subclinical impairment which is already present.

AB Suicide with charcoal burning, which results in carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, is common in Asia. This study was designed to elucidate associations between changes in the dopamine transporter (DAT) and cognitive function in patients following CO poisoning during a follow-up period of 6 months. Participants comprised 31 healthy controls (HCs) and 21 CO poisoning patients. Each subject underwent single photon emission computed tomography with [Tc-99m] TRODAT-1 to measure DAT availability and completed a cognitive battery assessing attention, memory, and executive function. For CO poisoning patients, a second DAT measurement and repeated cognitive evaluations were performed 6 months later. At baseline, DAT availability over bilateral striatum in CO poisoning subjects was significantly lower than in HCs. After 6 months, there was no significant change of DAT availability in CO poisoning patients. CO poisoning patients also had worse cognitive performance in all domains compared with HCs at baseline. After 6 months, most cognitive functions were significantly improved, except for the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), a measure of executive function. Interestingly, changes in the WCST were significantly correlated with changes in DAT availability during the 6-month follow-up period. The persistence of reduced DAT availability and its association with impaired performance on the WCST indicate a crucial role of DAT in the recovery of executive function following CO poisoning.

AB Background Ecological relationships between deprivation and forensic psychiatric admission rates may differ in urban and rural areas. Aims The aim of the study was to compare the relationship between material deprivation and forensic admission rates in rural and urban areas for a whole-national service in Ireland over a 3-year period. Method All Irish forensic admissions from 1997 to 1999 were allocated to the appropriate small area. Material deprivation scores were calculated from census data. Mean annual admission rates and Bayesian standardised forensic admission ratios for small areas were aggregated by material deprivation score and population density. Results At small area level, there were significant non-linear increases in forensic admissions with increasing deprivation. The increases in urban areas (population density > 10/ hectare) were absent in less densely populated areas. Conclusions Deprivation alone may not be the key factor in predicting forensic service utilisation. Factors associated with specifically urban deprived areas may be of greater relevance in planning services.

All 80,983 calls to a Red Cross Help-Line for children in 1991-1997 were included. In 22,698 calls, information about age, sex or issue could be identified. A monthly variation in frequency of calls with peaks in April and November and a correlation with the absolute values of monthly changes in length of day were found. Conversations concerning psychiatric suffering were more frequent in January or February and less frequent than expected in May/June and December. Conversations about sexuality correlated with the frequencies of births in the adult population 9 months later. A spring and fall peak in total calling and a winter peak in calls for depression, anxiety, pain and neglect were described. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study applied a functional approach to the study of bingeing and purging behaviors. Based on a four-function theoretical model of bingeing and purging, it was hypothesized that these behaviors are performed because of their intrapersonally reinforcing (e.g., emotion regulation) and/or interpersonally reinforcing (e.g., help-seeking, attention-getting behavior) properties. Participants were 298 adult females who had engaged in bingeing or purging in the last 3 months and who provided data via an online survey of these behaviors. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed support for a four-function model of bingeing and purging in which people use these behaviors for intrapersonal reinforcement functions and also for interpersonal reinforcement. Understanding the functions of binge eating and purging has direct implications for assessment and treatment of these behaviors. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Evidence that HTR2A receptor gene may be subject to genomic imprinting prompted us to examine a collection of family trios for evidence of ail association between the HTR2A T102C polymorphisin and psychosis in schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. We also tested for the possibility of imprinting by employing quantitative RT-PCR to measure the relative expression of post-mortem brain mRNA for each allele in 45 subjects who were heterozygous for the T102C polymorphism. We found that the ratio of C102 to 102T allele mRNA expression was the same in major psychoses and healthy controls. There was no genetic association between HTR2A T102C with either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder under the assumption of a parent-of-origin effect, and these data together essentially exclude imprinting at this locus as a potential explanation for the complex inheritance observed in major psychoses.

AB A 40-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department after a suicide attempt. The patient was found at home unconscious, with an open bottle of antifreeze near him. The patient was in a coma on admission, but neurological examination excluded intracranial changes. Results of initial urine and serum toxicological screening tests were negative. Laboratory values indicated metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis, urinalysis revealed hematuria and unrecognized crystals. Osmolality and osmol gap were not determined on patient admission. Treatment with ethanol as an antidote and hemodialysis were started because of metabolic acidosis, anamnestic data and clinical status of the patient, and subsequently led to improvement of his condition. Further toxicological analyses of glycolic and oxalic acids in serum and urine samples were performed by ion-chromatography (IC) method and showed high values in spot urine and serum ultrafiltrate at admission, but during therapy the values progressively decreased. Treatment of poisoned patient for 3 weeks resulted in complete recovery. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The goal of the current study is to examine the role of grit as a resilience factor that reduces the risk for suicidal ideation conferred by negative life events. Participants (N=209) completed measures of negative life events and grit at baseline and a measure of suicidal ideation at follow-up four weeks later. Poisson regression analyses found that higher levels of grit buffered the relationship between negative life events and suicidal ideation such that negative life events only predicted suicidal ideation if grit was low. These results suggest that high grit can abate the increased suicidal ideation associated with negative life events. Aside from absolute levels of suicidal ideation, being able to predict or buffer dramatic shifts in suicidal ideation can be a useful diagnostic tool during interventions.

AB Psychopathological disorders are frequent in chronic fatigue syndrome patients. The present study examines the presence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a sample of adult chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patients, and evaluates its clinical consequences in this population. CFS patients were assessed for childhood and adult ADHD by clinical interview and ADHD-specific scales. Psychopathological comorbidities were evaluated by clinical examination and questionnaires. Forty-seven of 158 CSF patients (29.7%) were diagnosed of childhood ADHD and in 33 (20.9%), the condition persisted into adulthood. CFS patients with adult ADHD had an earlier CSF onset, more severe anxiety and depression symptoms, and a higher risk of suicide than CFS patients without ADHD. Using lineal regression analysis, we found that depressive symptoms and ADHD severity were significant predictors of fatigue intensity. Consequently, ADHD may be common in CFS patients, and is associated with a more severe psychopathologic clinical profile. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID INTOXICATION
AB A 49-year-old male pharmacist suffering from depression phoned the emergency services telling of how he had ingested barium chloride. He was found semicomatose in bed and resuscitation attempts were to no avail and he died at the scene. A white plastic container labelled "Barium chloride... Poison", and a book with a writing on a blank page... "give sulphate... SO4" were found.
   At autopsy, 1.1 of whitish-yellow fluid was found in the stomach.
   Autopsy barium levels were: blood 9.9 mg/l; bile 8.8 mg/l; urine 6.3 mg/l; gastric 10.0 g/l.
   Cause of death was given as cardiorespiratory arrest due to barium chloride poisoning.
   The issue of barium toxicity in a variety of itatrogenic and non itatrogenic situation is discussed together with the two only other cases of suicidal barium ingestion, and the feasibility of early intervention at the scene by an emergency team.

AB Kavalactones are a group of compounds found in kava, a beverage or extract prepared from the rhizome of the kava plant (Piper methysticum). Traditionally kava extracts have been used for their anxiolytic and sedative properties. Sales of kava extracts were severely restricted or prohibited in European countries in 2002 following several cases of serious hepatotoxicity. Here we report a case where high concentrations of kavalactones and ethanol were detected in post mortem femoral blood. An injection needle with a 10-mL syringe containing 7.5 mL of slightly yellowish liquid was found next to the victim, and there were numerous needle prints on both lower arms following the venous tracks. No evidence of other cause of death was found in the medico- legal investigation. The case was therefore classified as suicide using an injection of kavalactones intravenously together with alcohol poisoning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Here we report the case of a 70-year-old woman who committed suicide by cyanide poisoning. During resuscitation cares, she underwent an antidote treatment by hydroxocobalamin. Postmortem investigations showed marked bright pink discolouration of organs and fluids, and a lethal cyanide blood concentration of 43 mg/L was detected by toxicological investigation. Discolouration of hypostasis and organs has widely been studied in forensic literature. In our case, we interpreted the unusual pink coloration as the result of the presence of hydroxocobalamin. This substance is a known antidote against cyanide poisoning, indicated because of its efficiency and poor adverse effects. However, its main drawback is to interfere with measurements of many routine biochemical parameters. We have tested the potential influence of this molecule in some routine postmortem investigations. The results are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Arsenic poisonings are still important in the field of toxicology, though they are not as frequent as about 20-30 years ago. In this paper, the arsenic concentrations in ante- and post-mortem materials, and also forensic and anatomo-pathological aspects in three cases of massive acute poisoning with arsenic(III) oxide (two of them with unexplained criminalistic background, in which arsenic was taken for amphetamine and one suicide), are presented. Ante-mortem, blood and urine arsenic concentrations ranged from 2.3 to 6.7 mu g/ml, respectively. Post-mortem tissue total arsenic concentrations were also detected in large concentrations. In case 3, the contents of the duodenum contained as much as 30.1 % arsenic(III) oxide. The high concentrations of arsenic detected in blood and tissues in all presented cases are particularly noteworthy in that they are very rarely detected at these concentrations in fatal arsenic poisonings.

AB Radioresistant cells have been shown to correlate with poor outcome after radiotherapy. Here, we found that human telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter (hTERTp) had lower activity in laryngeal squamous carcinomas cells than in radioresistant variant cells. Combining radiotherapy with plasmid phTERTp-HRP, in which expression of enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP) controlled by hTERTp, resulted in increased apoptosis and necrosis of tumor cells after prodrug indole-3-acetic acid (IAA; converted by HRP into a cytotoxin) incubation. Volume and wet weight of xenograft tumor were reduced more in the combination groups. These data suggest that hTERTp has potential use in targeted cancer gene therapy, especially for radioresistant tumors. Combining radiotherapy with hTERTp-HRP/IAA may overcome radioresistance in laryngeal squamous carcinomas cells and amplify the killing effect in targeted cancer cells. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The wide range of descriptions reaches from asymptomatic cases to sudden cardiac death. This will be discussed in a case report concerning a 31-year-old woman who was found dead in her apartment. Due to drugs that were found next to her, a suicide was assumed. The autopsy yielded an aplastic right coronary artery and a left coronary artery with an anomalous origin of the circumflex branch as well as a myocardial scar. The autopsy findings and the results of the toxicological examinations are presented and discussed in view of the cause of death. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB 3-Nitropropionic acid (3-NPA), a suicide inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH; complex II), has been used to provide useful experimental models of Huntington's disease (HD) and "chemical hypoxia" in rodents. The trace ion Zn2+ has been shown to cause neurodegeneration. Employing real-time Newport Green fluorescence imaging of extracellular Zn2+, we found that 3-NPA (10-100 muM) caused a concentration-dependent increase in the concentration of extracellular Zn2+ ([Zn2+](o)) in acute rat hippocampus slices. This increase in [Zn2+](o) was abolished by 10 mM CaEDTA. The increase of [Zn2+](o) was also accompanied by a rapid increase of cytoplasmic-free Zn2+ concentration ([Zn2+](i)). The induction of Zn2+ release by 3-MPA in hippocampus slices points to a potential mechanism by which 3-NPA might induce neurodegeneration. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Macro- and microscopic examinations revealed marked pulmonary edema and extensive contraction band necrosis of the cardiac muscles. Toxicological analysis revealed high levels of chloroform in the blood (41.4 mu g/ml in the wife and 29.1 mu g/ml in the husband) and in the adipose tissue (128 mu g/g in the wife and 131 mu g/g in the husband). From these findings, we conclude that the cause of death of both was acute heart failure due to chloroform poisoning. In addition, the pathological examination of the husband revealed submucosal hemorrhage at the root of the tongue and trachea, erosion of the stomach, and upper jejunum, none of which were present in the wife. Furthermore, hyperemia of the mucous membrane of the husband was more marked than that of the wife. Toxicological analysis also revealed that the chloroform levels in the liver and brain of the husband were higher than those of the wife, although the chloroform level in the blood of the husband was lower than that of the wife. We presume that the wife may have inhaled a greater amount of chloroform, and that the wife's circulation may have arrested before irritation of the mucous membranes became apparent. The husband may have inhaled a smaller amount of chloroform in longer duration, leading to irritation of the mucous membranes prior to the fatal heart failure. These findings suggest that toxicological and pathological outcomes of chloroform poisoning may vary between patients, and that they may reflect the dose and duration of chloroform inhalation.

AB Aim: To determine the rate of current major depressive disorder (MDD) among entrants to treatment for heroin dependence in three treatment modalities and a non-treatment comparison group; and to ascertain factors associated with depression. Design: Cross sectional structured interview. Setting: Sydney, Australia. Participants: 615 current heroin users: 201 entering methadone/buprenorphine maintenance (NIT), 201 entering detoxification (DTX), 133 entering drug free residential rehabilitation (RR) and 80 not in treatment (NT). Findings: Current major depressive episode was reported by 25%. The rates of major depressive disorder ranged from 26% in the treatment groups (23% NIT, 25% DTX, 31% RR) to 16% of those not in treatment. Females were more likely to have current major depressive episode (31% versus 21% OR 1.70, 95% Cl 1.16-2.48). Factors associated with depression in the treatment groups were post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attempted suicide in the last 12 months and severe physical disability. Among the non-treatment group those with depression were also more likely to have PTSD. Women entering treatment were three times more likely to meet criteria for current major depression than women not in treatment. Among men however, the rates were not significantly different. Conclusion: Depression is a significant concern among entrants to treatment for heroin dependence. An essential component of treatment should be a consideration of depression, with the provision of appropriate treatment were required. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aim: To assess whether substance-abusing people have a higher risk of dying from unintentional acute intoxication in specific periods of the year. Methods: A total of 15 792 deaths (males = 14 259; females = 1533) were ascertained to be due to unintentional acute intoxication by illicit drugs in Italy in the study period (1984-2000). Distribution of deaths by month was studied with circular statistics techniques, based on the maximization of mean vector length (MMVL) method. The Rayleigh test was used to verify the hypothesis of uniform distribution of the events across some relevant periods. Density estimates for significant periodicities were derived with the kernel method for circular variables. Results: Over the study period there was a steady increase in the number of deaths by overdose in Italy, affecting both genders, but more evident among males. The monthly distribution of deaths over the study period followed an uneven trend, with a slightly higher risk in the period between December and January, and in August, in both genders. The monthly distribution of deaths due to unintentional acute intoxication by illicit drugs appears influenced by non-casual oscillations following a thrice-yearly cycle, interlaced with a significantly more evident 6-monthly recurrence. Conclusions: There does seem to be a higher risk of dying from unintentional overdose in specific periods of the year. Better knowledge of the factors affecting the risk of mortality among substance-abusing people-due to changes in environmental or biological rhythms - could allow prediction of negative events, hence their prevention.

TI "Legal highs"-Toxicity in the clinical and medico-legal aspect as
   exemplified by suicide with bk-MBDB administration
SO FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL

DT Article

ID DESIGNER DRUGS; MDMA
AB The easily available "legal highs", which are products containing psychoactive substances, such as cathinones, piperazines and synthetic cannabinoids, are abused by adolescents in Poland and in the world as alternatives to classic drugs, such as amphetamines or marijuana. The majority of these potentially dangerous substances are still legal and they are associated with a risk of severe poisoning or even death, and provide new challenges in clinical and forensic toxicological practice.
   Investigations in the field of "designer drugs" may be well illustrated by the case of a suicide of a 21-year old male who ingested a specified dose of a preparation called "Amphi-bi-a" that contains bk-MBDB, chemically 2-methylamino-1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl) butan-1-one, which belongs to the cathinone group, as a synthetic euphoric empathogen and psychoactive stimulant that is chemically similar to MDMA. It is one of more common components of "legal highs" examined in Poland and other countries. The documentation of the case includes a clinical assessment of the patient's health status performed during his almost 4-h hospitalization before death, autopsy and histological examinations supported by toxicological findings revealing bk-MBDB at extremely high concentrations (at 20 mg/l in the blood and 33 mg/kg in the liver); hence, this body of evidence contributes to knowledge in the field of "designer drugs".
   Inventions of designers of new psychoactive xenobiotics, which are much in demand, especially in view of the dynamic Internet marketing, which drums up narcobusiness, must be balanced by a national strategy developed by medical, legal and educational circles in the modern civilized world in order to prevent the spreading of the phenomenon.

AB In our previous study we evaluated the antitumor effect of herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase gene (HSV-tk) on human medulloblastomas (MBs) in a therapeutic delivery system using the immortalized neural stem cell (NSC) line C17.2. However, our findings indicated that the bystander effect between C17.2tk and Daoy MB cells was weak compared to the bystander effect between NSCtk and C6 glioma cells. Gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) is the main mechanism mediating the bystander effect in HSV-tk gene therapy. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has been shown to up-regulate the expression of Connexin43 and GJIC. In this study we investigated the synergistic effect of ATRA and HSV-tk gene therapy in the treatment of MBs. We found that the expression of Connexin43 in Daoy cells was significantly increased when cells were exposed to 3 mu mol/l of ATRA (P < 0.05). After co-culturing C17.2tk cells with Daoy cells at different ratios ranging from 1:1 to 1:16, ATRA significantly increased the bystander anti-tumor effect compared to ATRA-untreated cells (P < 0.05). In intracranial co-implantation experiments, mice co-implanted with C17.2tk/Daoy cells and treated with a combination of ATRA and GCV had significantly smaller tumors compared to the animals treated with GCV alone (P < 0.05). Together, our results show that ATRA enhanced the tumoricidal effect in HSVtk/GCV suicide gene therapy against Daoy MB cells by strengthening the bystander effect in vitro and in vivo.

AB The aim of the present study was to investigate clinical and economic consequences of medication non-adherence during 21-month follow-up in the treatment of bipolar disorder following a manic or mixed episode. Data were taken from the European Mania in Bipolar Longitudinal Evaluation of Medication (EMBLEM), which was a prospective, observational study on patient outcomes with a manic/mixed episode in Europe. Physician-rated adherence was dichotomized as adherence/non-adherence at each assessment. Cox proportional hazards models were employed to investigate the impact of non-adherence on remission, recovery, relapse, recurrence, hospitalization and suicide attempts. Costs of medication and resource use in adherent and non-adherent patients during follow-up were estimated with multivariate analyses. Of the 1341 patients analysed, 23.6% were rated non-adherent over 21 months. Non-adherence was significantly associated with decreased likelihood of achieving remission and recovery as well as increased risk of relapse and recurrence as well as hospitalization and suicide attempts. In addition, costs incurred by non-adherent patients during this period were significantly higher than those of adherent patients (10231 pound vs 7379 pound, p<0.05). This disparity mainly resulted from differences in inpatient costs (4796 pound vs 2150 pound, p<0.05). In conclusion, non-adherence in bipolar patients was associated with poorer long term clinical outcomes that have economic implications for health-care providers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal ideation are potent risk factors for suicide and are associated with general and eating disorder-specific psychopathology. Limited research has examined the effects of combined NSSI+suicidal ideation thus concurrent examination is needed to understand potential differential effects on psychopathology. College-aged women (N=508) completed self-report measures of NSSI, suicidal ideation, general psychopathology, and Eating Disorder-specific psychopathology. MANOVAs determined whether the NSSI/SI status groups differed on general and eating disorder pathology measures as a set. Significant MANOVAs were followed up with univariate ANOVAs and posthoc tests. Thirteen women endorsed NSSI+Suicidal Ideation, 70 endorsed NSSI-only, 25 endorsed Suicidal Ideation-only, and 400 endorsed no NSSI/Suicidal Ideation. Both general and eating disorder-specific psychopathology differed across groups. NSSI+Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Ideation-only groups typically endorsed higher general psychopathology than the no NSSI/Suicidal Ideation and NSSI-only groups. Regarding eating disorder pathology, the NSSI+Suicidal Ideation group was more pathological than no NSSI/Suicidal Ideation and NSSI-only, except on the weight concerns scale, where NSSI+Suicidal Ideation only differed from no NSSI/Suicidal Ideation. The NSSI+Suicidal Ideation group was only greater than Suicidal Ideation-only on measures of depression and eating concern. Results highlight the importance of screening for both NSSI and suicidal ideation, especially for individuals with eating disorder symptoms. Likewise, screening for eating disorder pathology may be beneficial for individuals presenting with NSSI and suicidal ideation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Toxicological findings in deaths by asphyxiation due to a pure inert gas like helium are rare. We present three suicide cases of asphyxial death attributed to anoxia caused by inhalation of helium in a plastic bag positioned over the head.
   Methods: In one case, lung tissue, brain tissue and heart blood were obtained during standard autopsy procedures. In two cases, samples were obtained differently: heart blood, femoral blood, brain tissue, lung tissue and/or air from the lungs were directly sealed into headspace vials during autopsy. Air from the lungs was collected using a syringe and transferred into an aluminum gas sampling bag which was heat sealed as soon as possible. Semi-quantitative gas analyses were performed using headspace gas chromatography-thermal conductivity detection (HS-GC/TCD) with a molsieve column capable of separating permanent gasses. Nitrogen was used as carrier gas.
   Results: In the first case no helium was detected in lung tissue, brain tissue and heart blood. In the second case the presence of helium was detected in lung tissue (approximately 5% helium in gaseous phase) but not in femoral blood. In the third case the presence of helium was detected in air from the lungs (0.05%), lung tissue (0.4%), brain tissue (0.1%) and heart blood (0.04%).
   Conclusions: Helium is easily lost if sampling is not performed properly. The presented cases suggest that quick sample collection of various matrices during autopsy is suitable to detect gasses like helium in postmortem cases. Use of HS-GC/TCD enables to detect an inert gas like helium. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An adenovirus harboring the HSV thymidine kinase (HSVtk) gene under the regulation of a trans-splicing ribozyme that targets telomerase is cytotoxic to cancer cells because it inhibits DNA replication (Ad5mTR). Furthermore, it induces anti-tumor immunity by activating cytotoxic T cells. Because multiple chemotherapeutic agents also activate cytotoxic T-cell immunity during the direct killing process of tumor cells, we herein explored whether low-dose cisplatin could synergize with cytotoxic Ad5mTR to potentiate its therapeutic effect by boosting anti-tumor immunity in a murine HPV16-associated tonsillar carcinoma model. Tumor regression was enhanced when low-dose (1 mg/kg) cisplatin was added to suicide gene therapy using Ad5mTR. Meanwhile, 1 mg/kg cisplatin alone had no tumor-suppressive effects and did not result in any systemic toxicity. Thus, cisplatin along with Ad5mTR improved tumor clearance by increasing the number of E7-specific CD8+ T cells. Specifically, analysis of the tumors and lymph nodes supported improved immune clearance by increasing the number of E7-specific CD8+ T cells inside tumors (40%, P < 0.05) as a result of the combination of suicide gene and cisplatin therapy. These results suggest that a low dose of cisplatin potentiates CD8+ T-cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity, and its addition to the HSVtk-based adenovirus results in additional therapeutic benefits for HPV16-positive head and neck cancer patients.

AB Purpose: To investigate whether hypoxia targeted bifunctional suicide gene expression-cytosine deaminase (CD) and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) with 5-FC treatments can enhance radiotherapy.
   Materials and methods: Stable transfectants of R3327-AT cells were established which express a triple-fusion-gene: CD, UPRT and monomoric DsRed (mDsRed) controlled by a hypoxia inducible promoter. Hypoxia-induced expression/function of CDUPRTmDsRed was verified by western blot, flow cytometry, fluorescent microscopy, and cytotoxicity assay of 5-FU and 5-FC. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with 5-FC and local radiation. Tumor volume was monitored and compared with those treated with 5-FC or radiation alone. In addition, the CDUPRTmDsRed distribution in hypoxic regions of tumor sections was visualized with fluorescent microscopy.
   Results: Hypoxic induction of CDUPRTmDsRed protein correlated with increased sensitivity to 5-FC and 5-FU. Significant radiosensitization effects were detected after 5-FC treatments under hypoxic conditions. In the tumor xenografts, the distribution of CDUPRTmDsRed expression visualized with fluorescence microscopy was co-localized with the hypoxia marker pimonidazole positive staining cells. Furthermore, administration of 5-FC to mice in combination with local irradiation resulted in significant tumor regression, as in comparison with 5-FC or radiation treatments alone.
   Conclusions: Our data suggest that the hypoxia-inducible CDUPRT/5-FC gene therapy strategy has the ability to specifically target hypoxic cancer cells and significantly improve the tumor control in combination with radiotherapy.

AB Rates of suicidal ideation and behavior are extremely high in bipolar spectrum disorders (BSDs). However, relatively little work has evaluated potentially synergistic relationships between cognitive and emotion-regulatory processes proposed by theoretical models of suicidality in BSDs. The present study evaluated whether negative cognitive style and subtypes of rumination would exacerbate the impact of self-criticism on suicidal ideation in a prospective study of individuals with BSDs. Seventy-two young adults with BSDs (bipolar II, bipolar NOS, or cyclothymia) completed diagnostic interviews and trait measures of self-criticism, negative cognitive style, and brooding and reflective rumination at a baseline assessment. The occurrence of suicidal ideation was assessed as part of diagnostic interviews completed every 4 months for an average of 3 years of follow-up. Negative cognitive style and reflective rumination strengthened the association between self-criticism and the prospective occurrence of suicidal ideation across follow-up. Individuals with high levels of self-criticism in conjunction with negative cognitive style or reflective rumination were most likely to experience the onset of suicidal ideation. Self-criticism may work synergistically with negative cognitive style and rumination to confer risk for suicidal ideation in bipolar spectrum disorders. These results support theoretical models of suicidality in BSDs and indicate that evaluating and understanding negative cognitive styles may help to identify individuals who are at risk of suicide.

AB Background: Risk of self-harm repetition has consistently been shown to be higher following self-cutting compared to intentional drug overdose (IDO) and other self-harm methods. The utility of previous evidence is limited due to the large heterogeneous method categories studied. This study examined risk of hospital presented self-harm repetition according to specific characteristics of self-harm methods.
   Methods: Data on consecutive self-harm presentations to hospital emergency departments (2010-2016) were obtained from the National Self-Harm Registry Ireland. Associations between self-harm method and repetition were analysed using survival analyses.
   Results: Overall, 65,690 self-harm presentations were made involving 46,661 individuals. Self-harm methods associated with increased repetition risk included minor self-cutting, severe self-cutting, multiple drug IDOs involving psychotropic drugs and self-harm by blunt object. Minor self-cutting was the method associated with highest repetition risk (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 1.38, 95% CI 1.31-1.45). Risk of repetition was comparable following IDOs of four or more drugs involving psychotropic drugs (AHR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.20-1.39), severe self-cutting (AHR 1.25, 95% CI 1.16-1.34) and blunt object (AHR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.07-1.42).
   Limitations: Information was not available on suicide or other causes of mortality.
   Conclusions: Self-harm method and the associated risk of repetition should form a core part of biopsychosocial assessments and should inform follow-up care for self-harm patients. The observed differences in repetition associated with specific characteristics of IDO underline the importance of safety planning and monitoring prescribing for people who have engaged in IDO.

AB Previously we have reported adipose-tissue derived human mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSC) as cellular delivery vehicles for tumor-targeted cancer gene therapy. In this report we aimed to determine whether Herpes simplex virus - thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) expressing AT-MSC (TK-MSC) could exert cytotoxic effect on tumor cells upon treatment with prodrug ganciclovir (GCV). Direct co-cultures of human glioblastoma cells 8-MG-BA, 42-MG-BA and U-118 MG with TK-MSC/GCV resulted in substantial viability decrease in vitro. This therapeutic paradigm was most efficient against 8-MG-BA glioblastoma cells exhibiting cytotoxicity (>50%) in the presence of TK-MSC and 0.1 mu M GCV. Rapid apoptosis induction in three glioblastoma cell lines and TK-MSC demonstrated both bystander cytotoxic effect on tumor cells and GCV conversion-mediated suicide effect on TK-MSC. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate formation of gap junctions between AT-MSC and human glioblastoma cells as a mechanism contributing to bystander cytotoxicity. Inability of human HeLa and MCF7 to form gap junctions with AT-MSC rendered these cell refractory to the TK-MSC/GCV mediated cytotoxicity. Gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) capability of AT-MSC with tumor cells further supports the exploitation of mesenchymal stem cells for approaches relying on the bystander effect. Biological consequences of these capabilities remain to be further explored. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Several studies have noted that multi-impulsive bulimia nervosa tends to be refractory to treatment. However, it is not known whether these impulsivities are an expression of more fundamental psychopathology or simply the consequence of chaotic eating behaviors. Studies of the temporal relationship between the onset of eating disorder and the occurrence of impulsive behaviors will facilitate a better understanding of these issues. Subjects consisted of 60 patients with anorexia nervosa restricting type (AN-R), 62 patients with anorexia nervosa binge-eating/purging type (AN-BP), 114 patients with bulimia nervosa purging type (BN) and 66 control subjects. Impulsive behaviors and childhood traumatic experiences were assessed by self-report questionnaire. Multi-impulsivity (defined by at least three of the following: heavy regular alcohol drinking; suicide attempt; self-mutilation; repeated shoplifting of items other than food; sexual relationships with persons not well known to the subject) was found in 2% of AN-R, 11% of AN-BP, 18% of BN and 2% of control subjects. Eighty percent of BN patients with multi-impulsivity had a history of suicide attempts or self-mutilation history prior to the onset of bulimia nervosa. In BN patients, there tended to be a relationship between childhood parental loss or borderline personality disorder and multi-impulsivity. In conclusion, primary impulsivity (chronological prior occurrence of impulsive behaviors) does exist even in a very different culture, although the number of patients of this type is very limited.

AB Objective: Dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) metabolizes the conversion of dopamine to noradrenaline. DBH, located on chromosome 9q34.2 has variants with potential functional consequences which may be related to alterations of neurotransmitter function and several psychiatric phenotypes, including alcohol dependence (AD), depression (MD) and suicidal behavior (SA). The aim of this association study in a large multicenter sample of alcohol-dependent individuals and controls is to investigate the role of DBH SNPs and haplotypes in AD risk and associated phenotypes (AD with MD or SA).
   Method: 1606 inpatient subjects with DSM-IV AD from four addiction treatment centers and 1866 control subjects were included. Characteristics of AD, MD and SA were obtained using standardized structured interviews. After subjects were genotyped for 4 DBH polymorphisms, single SNP case-control and haplotype analyses were conducted.
   Results: rs1611115 (near 5') C-allele and related haplotypes were significantly associated with alcohol dependence in females. This association with female alcohol dependence also accounts for the significant relationship between this variant and comorbid conditions and traits.
   Conclusions: This study presents evidence for a potentially functional DBH variant influencing the risk for alcohol dependence while other comorbid conditions are not independently influenced by this SNP. However, the study also supports the possible role of the dopamine system in the etiology of female alcohol dependence. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Deliberate self-harm (DSH) is a major public health problem in many countries and varies by age group, gender, and ethnicity. Having engaged in an act of DSH is the strongest predictor of future suicidal behaviour, both non-fatal and fatal. Development and implementation of effective assessment procedures for DSH patients are required in order to assess risk of repetition and prevent repeated suicidal behaviour. In this chapter we present the outcomes of a review of studies addressing the extent of the problem of DSH and repetition, prediction of factors associated with repeated DSH including age, gender, ethnicity, and assessment procedures for DSH patients presenting to hospital emergency departments.
   The extent of the problem of DSH varies across countries, with relatively high rates in the United Kingdom and Belgium and low rates in Scandinavia. DSH rates are consistently higher in females compared to males. However, recent studies in Ireland indicate that rates of repeated DSH are similar for men and women. Factors predicting repeated DSH vary by age (young, adults, older adults) with some overlap. A history of previous DSH is a predictor for repetition in both young people and adults. Even though most national suicide prevention programmes prioritize the implementation of uniform guidelines for the assessment of DSH patients, there is still considerable variation within and across countries with regard to the types of assessment and aftercare offered to DSH patients. A four-question tool (Manchester Self-Harm Rule) is an example of an evidence-based screening tool for identifying risk of repeated suicidal behaviour (non-fatal and fatal) and is recommended for wider implementation.

AB Suicide rates in young Irish males have risen markedly in the past 10 years, and suicide is now the leading cause of death in young men in the 15-24-year-old age range.
   This is the first large-scale study in Ireland that set out to identify young people at risk of psychiatric disorders, including depressive disorders, and suicidal ideation. Seven hundred and twenty three school-going adolescents aged 12-15 years were screened using the Children's Depression Inventory and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. 19.4% were identified as being 'at risk' of having a mental health disorder. Of this 'at risk' group, 12.1% expressed possible suicidal intent and 45.7% expressed suicidal ideation. Of the 583 adolescents identified as being 'not at risk', 13% expressed suicidal ideation while none expressed suicidal intent. Being 'at risk' was not related to gender or to socio-economic status. Those living with two parents were significantly more likely to be in the 'not at risk' group. Girls attending co-educational schools were twice as likely to be in 'at risk' group compared with those attending all girls schools, while school type was not a risk factor for boys.
   This study shows that, as in other western countries, there are large numbers of young Irish people at risk of mental health disorders and suicidal ideation in the community, and raises the question of the importance of mental health promotion in our education system.

AB The validity and reliability of using psychological autopsies to diagnose a psychiatric disorder is a critical issue. Therefore, interrater and test-retest reliability of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I and Personality Disorders and the usefulness of these instruments for the psychological autopsy method were investigated. Diagnoses by informant's interview were compared with diagnoses generated by a personal interview of 35 persons. Interrater reliability and test-retest reliability were assessed in 33 and 29 persons, respectively. Chi-square analysis, kappa and intraclass correlation coefficients, and Kendall's tau were used to determine agreement of diagnoses. Kappa coefficients were above 0.84 for substance-related disorders, mood disorders, and anxiety and adjustment disorders, and above 0.65 for Axis 11 disorders for interrater and test-retest reliability. Agreement by personal and relative's interview Generated kappa coefficients above 0.79 for most Axis I and above 0.65 for most personality disorder diagnoses; Kendall's tau for dimensional individual personality disorder scores ranged from 0.22 to 0.72. Despite of a small number of psychiatric disorders in the selected population, the present results provide support for the validity of most diagnoses obtained through the best-estimate method using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I and Personality Disorders. This instrument can be recommended as a tool for the psychological autopsy procedure in post-mortem research. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: : To examine lifetime and current prevalence rates of substance use disorders and the demographic and clinical correlates of current drug dependence in a sample of homeless women.
   Methods: : A cross-sectional study of 196 homeless women in three Canadian cities was done. Each subject was assessed using structured clinical interviews. A multivariate regression model was applied to determine predictors of substance use.
   Results: : The mean age of the sample was 35.3 years, 54.4% identified as Aboriginal, 46.4% lived on the street Crack cocaine (58%) was the most common substance used, followed by alcohol (53%), cannabis (41%), and heroin (30%). Overall, 82.4% of the sample had at least one type of current substance use disorder, of which 70.5% had drug dependence and 37.8% had alcohol dependence. 58.3% had concurrent substance use and mental health disorders. 76.7% of those individuals with current alcohol dependence had concurrent drug dependence. Only 24.6% of those who had recovered from alcohol dependence had no current substance use disorder. Multivariate analyses showed that younger age, living on the street, engaging in sex work, and having ever attempted suicide were associated with current drug dependence.
   Conclusion: : Prevalence rates for alcohol and especially drug dependence were exceptionally high in this sample. Innovative programs need to be developed which are accessible and tailored to meet the needs of this specific population, accounting for high problem severity, polysubstance dependence, and high rates of psychiatric comorbidity.

AB Self-harm patient management varies markedly between hospitals, with fourfold differences in the proportion of patients who are admitted to a medical or psychiatric inpatient bed. The current study aimed to investigate whether differences in admission practices are associated with patient outcomes (repeat self-harm) while accounting for differences in patient case mix.
   Data came from the National Self-Harm Registry Ireland. A prospective cohort of 43,595 self-harm patients presenting to hospital between 2007 and 2012 were included. As well as conventional regression analysis, instrumental variable (IV) methods utilising between hospital differences in rates of hospital admission were used in an attempt to gain unbiased estimates of the association of admission with risk of repeat self-harm.
   The proportion of self-harm patients admitted to a medical bed varied from 10 to 74 % between hospitals. Conventional regression and IV analysis suggested medical admission was not associated with risk of repeat self-harm. Psychiatric inpatient admission was associated with an increased risk of repeat self-harm in both conventional and IV analyses. This increased risk persisted in analyses stratified by gender and when restricted to self-poisoning patients only.
   No strong evidence was found to suggest medical admission reduces the risk of repeat self-harm. Models of health service provision that encourage prompt mental health assessment in the emergency department and avoid unnecessary medical admission of self-harm patients appear warranted. Psychiatric inpatient admission may be associated with a heightened risk of repeat self-harm in some patients, but these findings could be biased by residual confounding and require replication.

AB Background: Past self-harming behavior is one of the most significant predictors of future suicide. Each year in Ireland there are approximately 11,000 presentations of self-harm to emergency departments (EDs) across the country. Study Objectives: This study examines predictors of perceived personal effectiveness in dealing with self-harming patients as reported by ED staff. The predictors are derived from past research and are influenced by Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory. Method: One hundred twenty-five ED medical staff (28 doctors and 97 nurses) from five EDs in the West and South of Ireland completed a questionnaire. Predictor variables included in the design, and informed by past research, included knowledge of self-harm and suicidal behavior and confidence in dealing with incidents of self-harm. Results: Standard multiple regression suggested a statistically significant model fit between the two predictors and the criterion variable, accounting for 24% of total variance. Knowledge and Confidence were significant contributors to perceived personal effectiveness in dealing with self-harming patients. Conclusions: Little is known regarding specific factors that influence perceived effectiveness in dealing with self-harming patients in the ED setting. These findings have implications for psycho-education and training content for staff. The findings suggest that increasing knowledge of self-harm and confidence in dealing with self-harming patients can lead to more positive perceived personal effectiveness in responding to clients' needs.

AB Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) are a family of several isoenzymes expressed in various tissues and in all subcellular fractions. In some tumours, there is an increase of ALDH activity, especially that of class 1 and 3. The increase in the activity of these isoenzymes is correlated with cell growth and drug resistance shown by these cells. It has been observed that hepatoma cells expressing low ALDH3 activity are more susceptible to growth inhibition by low concentration of lipid peroxidation products than hepatoma cells expressing high ALDH3 activity. The products of lipid peroxidation are good substrates for ALDH, but when their intracellular levers are increased in hepatoma cells treated repeatedly with prooxidants, they inhibit ALDH3 and bring about growth inhibition or cell death. As a follow up to the work previously reported on S-methyl 4-amino-4-methylpent-2-ynethioate, a synthetic suicide inhibitor of ALDH1, which induced bcl2 overexpressing cells into apoptosis and exhibited an ED50 of 400 muM, a novel broad spectrum inhibitor of ALDH1 and ALDH3 was synthesised. This new compound (ATEM) is a suicide inhibitor of ALDH1, an irreversible inhibitor of ALDH3 and exhibits an ED50 of 10-25 muM on rat cultured hepatoma cells. Four hours after treatment with 25 muM ATEM, ALDH activity using benzaldehyde or propionaldehyde in hepatoma cells was decreased by 40% and cell number by 15% compared with controls. As cell growth did not resume when the inhibitor was removed from the culture medium, it suggested strongly that. ALDHs play a pivotal role in mediating cell death.

AB In a large body of research the influence of contextual information on decisions made in a broad range of disciplines has been studied. To date, the influence of these expectancy effects on the crime scene investigation has not been studied. In the present study we explored the effect of prior information given to crime scene investigators on their perception and interpretation of an ambiguous crime scene.
   Participants (N = 58) were experienced crime scene investigators who were provided with a panoramic photograph of an ambiguous mock crime scene. The victim may have committed suicide or was murdered. Participants either received prior information indicating suicide, prior information indicating a violent death, or they received no prior information. Participants were asked about what they thought had happened at the scene of the crime, both at the initial assessment of the scene and at the end of the investigation when they were asked to describe the most likely scenario. They were also asked which traces they wanted to secure and why.
   Results showed that participants interpreted the crime scene differently dependent on how it was presented to them. Both the initial assessment of the scene and the most likely scenario that was described after the investigation were influenced by the prior information the participants were provided with, even though roughly the same traces were secured by all, independent of the prior information.
   Results demonstrate that prior information indeed influences the interpretation of the crime scene, but since the present study was exploratory further research is needed. (C) 2016 The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives. To investigate the association between optional thinking (the ability to generate alternative solutions to interpersonal problems) in deliberate self-harm (DSH) patients and repeated self-harm. Design. A prospective study of the association between optional thinking in interpersonal problem solving and repeated DSH within 12 months.
   Method. A non-consecutive sample (N = 152) of DSH patients presenting to the Accident and Emergency department of an acute hospital in Cork city, Ireland, was assessed using a structured interview schedule including the Suicide Intent Scale, the Hopelessness Scale, and the Optional Thinking Test. Repetition within I year was established by checking Accident and Emergency records at all three city hospitals. Participants were categorized as repeaters if they engaged in at least one further hospital-treated DSH episode, or non-repeaters.
   Results. Approximately two-thirds (63.1%) of the sample had engaged in at least one act of DSH prior to their index episode. During follow-up 31 individuals (20.4%) repeated. History of self-harm was significantly associated with prospective repetition when considered alongside all the other predictor variables. Among first evers, low scores on the optional thinking test were significantly associated with the increased risk of repetition within 12 months. Among those with previous DSH, there was no evidence of an association between optional thinking and repetition within 12 months.
   Conclusions. Poor optional thinking is associated with increased risk of repeated deliberate self-harm in those who present with a first self-harm episode. Interventions to improve optional thinking skills, delivered soon after a first DSH presentation, may be useful in preventing repetition.

AB Background: There has been a great deal of clinical concern regarding alprazolam abuse. This paper reported on alprazolam positive cases of sudden or unnatural deaths presenting to the New South Wales Department of Forensic Medicine (DOFM), 1/1/1997-31/12/2012.
   Methods: Case series.
   Results: 412 cases were identified. There was a large increase in the annual number of cases, from 3 in 1997 to 86 in 2012. By 2012, 4.5% of all DOFM case presentations involved alprazolam. The mean age was 41.3 years and 66.5% were male. Circumstances of death were: accidental drug toxicity (57.0%), deliberate drug toxicity (10.4%), suicide by means other than drug overdose (12.6%), disease (10.0%), accident (5.1%), homicide (2.4%). The major factor driving the increase in cases was accidental drug toxicity involving alprazolam, rising from 0 in 1997 to 58 in 2012. A history of drug/alcohol problems was noted in 80.4%, and 56.6% were injecting drug users. The median alprazolam concentration was 0.08 mg/L (range 0.005-2.10 mg/L), with 37.4% of cases having concentrations of >= 0.1 mg/L. In 94.9% of cases, drugs other than alprazolam and its metabolites were present, including all accidental overdoses. The most commonly detected drugs were opioids (64.6%), others were benzodiazepines (44.4%) and alcohol (34.5%). A third (31.8%) of cases were HCV positive.
   Conclusions: Cases involving alprazolam increased markedly, driven mostly by toxicity deaths amongst people with known drug and alcohol problems. Caution in prescribing alprazolam would appear appropriate, particularly to those with known drug dependence. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB It is generally accepted that successful gene therapy depends on two major factors: tumor-specific expression of a therapeutic gene and the efficient transfer of a therapeutic gene to tumor cells. For gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT) involving Escherichia coli cytosine deaminase (CD) and 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), several tumor-specific promoters and virus-based vectors were used. No attention whatsoever was paid to the way of 5-FC delivery to solid tumors, despite the fact that the delivery of drugs to such tumors is generally low because of their insufficient transfer from the blood. To compare the effectiveness of GDEPT with free and liposomal 5-FC, the prodrug was encapsulated in liposomes composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and cholesterol (H). When the liposomal form of 5-FC was administered i.v., mice treated with a dose of 5 mg of liposomal 5-FC/kg body weight for 10 days, showed complete regression of transplanted tumors and complete cure was observed, whereas in animals treated with the same amounts of the free prodrug, 50% tumor regression and only insignificantly prolonged median survival were found. In summary, these results showed a remarkable enhancement of the antitumor effects of the liposomal form of 5-FC in comparison with the free prodrug. Therapy with liposomal 5-FC thus represents a new approach to achieving a high local concentration of the prodrug for suicide gene therapy using E coli CD. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Trends in forensic toxicology show the introduction of rapid analytical methods for the simultaneous quantitative analysis of drugs. The authors present a fatal case involving a 32-year-old male, found dead in bed by his mother, with several blue, white and orange pills next to the body. Empty tablets were found in the trash bin and a suicide note was on the desk. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had been under psychiatric treatment, having repeatedly demonstrated intent to commit suicide. A rapid method was developed to determine 55 different medicines and 32 benzodiazepines in blood by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) with electrospray ionization source in positive and negative ion mode.
   Chromatographic analysis was preceded by an optimized solid-phase extraction procedure using Oasis (R) HLB (3 cc, 60 mg) extraction columns. The extracted analytes were separated by UPLC (Waters) with a reversed-phase Acquity UPLC (R) HSS T3 (2.1 x 100 mm id, 1.8 mu m) column with acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water as mobile phase, at 0.5 mL/min flow rate and a chromatographic run-time of 8 min. Analytes detection was achieved with a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer in positive and negative electrospray ionization mode with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Two MRM transitions were monitored for each target-compound and one for each deuterated internal standards.
   Toxicological results showed high blood concentrations of antipsychotics (haloperidol, olanzapine and quetiapine), antidepressants (fluoxetine and paroxetine) and anxiolytics (bromazepam and lorazepam). Risperidone and other benzodiazepines were also present in therapeutic concentrations. Neither alcohol nor illicit drugs were present in the analyzed samples
   The UPLC-MS-MS method showed to be appropriate for screening, identification and quantitation of antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics and antiepileptic drugs in blood after intake of therapeutic as well as toxic doses. The autopsy and toxicological results led the pathologist to rule that death was due to a mixed-drug intoxication. The manner of death was determined to be suicide. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB In postmortem cases where the cause of death is hanging, toxicological analyses may be considered unnecessary by some medical examiners, toxicologists, and other persons involved in medico-legal investigations because the cause of death seems "obvious.'' To ascertain if toxicological analyses are necessary when the cause of death is hanging, all 102 hanging cases (25 females; 77 males) from 2011 to 2013 that came under the jurisdiction of the San Francisco Office of the Chief Medical Examiner were examined from a total of 3912 sudden, unexpected, or violent death cases in the same period. Suicide was the manner of death in 99 of these cases, with two accidental and one undetermined death. The average age of decedents was 43.9 years (median 41), the youngest was an 11-year old male and the oldest was an 86-year old female. Of the 102 cases, 33 had negative toxicology while 69 cases had at least one positive toxicology result. Females were equally likely to have negative or positive results (12 and 13 cases respectively), but males were 37.5% more likely to have positive toxicology (n = 56) rather than negative toxicology (n = 21). For females, alcohol, mirtazapine, venlafaxine, and trazodone were the top psychoactive substances in peripheral blood while THC, cocaine, hydrocodone, bupropion, olanzapine, doxylamine, quetiapine and dextromethorphan were also reported. For males, alcohol, THC, cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, bupropion, and diphenhydramine were the top psychoactive substances in blood, but several other drugs were also found in individual cases. Our study of hanging cases over a 3-year period support the idea that complete postmortem toxicology investigation of hangings should be performed, even when the "obvious'' cause of death is asphyxia due to hanging. Many of these cases involved psychoactive substances (most often alcohol and cannabis), and having such knowledge provides a better understanding of the circumstances surrounding the decedent's death, their possible state of impairment, including the possibility of a staged suicide if the decedent was too impaired to perform a self-hanging.

AB Background: Sudden deaths are common findings in Rivers state of Nigeria. The victims of such deaths are subjects, of coroners' autopsies, and the records there from constitute important sources of epidemiological data.
   Aims: To determine the pattern, causes and demographic features of all deaths reported to the coroner for medico legal autopsies in Rivers state of Nigeria.
   Materials and methods: Retrospective descriptive study on reports of coroner autopsies carried out between January 2000 and December 2010 in different mortuaries located across Rivers state was undertaken. The autopsies were unlimited and standardized. Information analyzed were: gender, age, circumstances of death and, autopsy-defined cause of death.
   Results: Of the 1987 cases reviewed, 83.4% were males. The age range was 2 weeks to 98 years with a mean of, 31.7 years. The peak age range was 21-30 years with 46.5%. The manners of deaths in descending order include: homicides with 50.5%, accidents with 32%, sudden natural deaths with 14.1%, maternal deaths with 2.6% and suicides with 0.8%. Males were most affected in homicidal death with average male: female ratio of 12.4:1. Gunshots constituted the commonest means of homicidal deaths, with 67.9% while decapitation was the least with 0.1%. The commonest cause of accidental death was, road traffic accident with 63.6%. Cardiovascular system pathologies were the commonest causes of natural deaths with 46.1%. Illegal abortions with 41.1% were the commonest causes of maternal, deaths and all suicidal cases were committed by hanging.
   Conclusions: Homicides were by far the commonest findings of medico legal autopsies, followed by accidental and natural deaths respectively while suicides were the least in Rivers state of Nigeria. Firearms were the, most frequently used weapons for homicides and road traffic accidents remain the major causes of accidental deaths while cardiovascular system pathologies account for the highest proportion of sudden natural deaths and suicides are committed by hanging. Males within the productive age, brackets of 20-49 years are more affected by sudden deaths of all manners. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Assessing the fitness to drive (FTD) of individuals with depression is important for their safety and the safety of other road users. Although medical fitness to drive (FTD) guidelines exist in Ireland little is known about how the guidelines are used in practice or how driving is addressed by health professionals.
   Aim: To examine General Practitioners, Consultant Psychiatrists and Occupational Therapists in Ireland knowledge, attitudes and current practice related to FTD for individuals with depression.
   Method: A cross-sectional survey employing a purposely designed questionnaire.
   Results: Surveys were returned by 228 participants (60 Consultant Psychiatrists, 72 General Practitioners and 96 Occupational Therapists. Assessment of FTD was deemed important by 75% of respondents. Driving was routinely discussed by 39.5% of respondents. Clinical reasoning was considered important in FTD decisions by 91.6% of respondents, with an informal discussion/ assessment the most common type of measurement used. Respondents identified impaired cognition, decreased concentration, medication side-effects, suicidal ideation/intent and decreased reaction time as the factors that most influence their FTD decisions. The largest percentage of Consultant Psychiatrists and Occupational Therapists felt that addressing driving would not negatively influence the therapeutic relationship while General Practitioners reported concern about impact on the therapeutic relationship. Physicians were not considered the best profession to assess FTD by a large percentage of respondents. Varying levels of confidence and competence were self-reported by all professions. All respondents reported the need for additional training. These findings require further validation as low response rates make it difficult to generalize the results.
   Conclusion: A gap exists between what is expected of health professionals according to the Irish Slainte agus Tiomaint Guidelines and respondent's self-reported practices in addressing driving with their patients with depression. Further research to delineate the role of each profession and to explore assessment practices in greater detail is required.

   violence; Spousal violence; Violence against women; Violence during
   pregnancy; Wife beating
ID DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; WOMEN; CHILDREN; RISK
AB Intimate partner violence (IPV), Usually men's violence against women, appears universal. It may be associated with pregnancy, but this may be because pregnant women receive more medical attention. Violence may cause bruises, abrasions, and cuts, but its extremes include hospitalization, death, and suicide. IPV is often disclosed when women are asked why they feel in poor health or depressed. A legal dilemma arises when healthcare providers consider that intervention such as law-enforcement is appropriate, but patients refuse approval. Patients may fatalistically accept violence, or fear loss of support for their children and themselves if their partners are held in custody. Legal reforms, such as punishing spousal rape, may provide some protection of women's autonomy. Ethical dilemmas concern intervention without patients' approval, and whether treating violent injuries without taking preventive action breaches the principle to Do No Harm. Professional advocacy and social action have been urged to expose and reduce IPV. (C) 2009 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Lung cancer is a formidable worldwide health problem causing more deaths than breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer combined. Eighty percent are non-small cell type (NSCLC) and less than one in five patients can have a curative resection. Decisionmaking in treating cancer, and lung cancer specifically, requires an understanding of the basic ethical principles as well as a priortization of values beyond medical knowledge alone. Choosing a treatment plan can be difficult because of the multiple confronting dilemmas occurring simultaneously. Economic analysis also is required of every major treatment strategy proposed. Active patient involvement is helpful in making these important and difficult choices at the same time clinicians must be mindful of their roles as healers, educators, and innovators of knowledge in a disease that has a five year mortality rate of nearly 90%. Finally, because end of life care issues are so common with this illness, clinicians must be aware of their importance in making dying easier for so many individuals.

AB The present study was conducted on a large sample of Chinese medical students to test the moderating effect of resilience between negative life events and mental health problems, and investigate the factors that affect the mental health problems of the students. The Adolescent Self-Rating Life Events Check List, Eysenck Adult Personality Questionnaire-Revised, Social Support Rating Scale, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and Symptom Check List were adopted for a survey with 1,998 Chinese medical students as respondents. Mental health problems had a positive correlation with negative life events and neuroticism. On the other hand, mental health problems had a negative correlation with social support, extraversion, and resilience. Regression analysis showed that resilience moderated negative life events and mental health problems. Promoting resilience may be helpful for the adjustment of college students.

TI Austerity: a failed experiment on the people of Europe
SO CLINICAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID PUBLIC-HEALTH PROFESSIONALS; FINANCIAL CRISIS
AB Many governments in Europe, either of their own volition or at the behest of the international financial institutions, have adopted stringent austerity policies in response to the financial crisis. By contrast, the USA launched a financial stimulus. The results of these experiments are now clear: the American economy is growing and those European countries adopting austerity, including the UK, Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain, are stagnating and struggling to repay rising debts. An initial recovery in the UK was halted once austerity measures hit. However, austerity has been not only an economic failure, but also a health failure, with increasing numbers of suicides and, where cuts in health budgets are being imposed, increasing numbers of people being unable to access care. Yet their stories remain largely untold. Here, we argue that there is an alternative to austerity, but that ideology is triumphing over evidence. Our paper was written to contribute to discussions among health policy leaders in Europe that will take place at the 15th European Health Forum at Gastein in October 2012, as its theme 'Crisis and Opportunity Health in an Age of Austerity'.

AB The influence of rain and malathion on the initial oviposition as well as development of blowfly species infesting rabbit carcasses decomposing in sunlit and shaded habitats were studied over a period of 1 year in Kelantan, Malaysia. Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius) was the most dominant species that infested the carcasses, followed by Chrysomya rufifacies (Macquart). In general, rain, depending on its intensity, delayed initial oviposition by 1-2 days and prolonged the pupation period by 1-3 days. The presence of malathion in the carcasses delayed initial oviposition by 1-3 days and prolonged the pupation period by 2-3 days. These findings deserve consideration while estimating postmortem interval since rain is a commonplace occurrence in Malaysia and malathion is one of the common poisons as an agent for choice to commit suicide.

ID GUNSHOT WOUNDS
AB A 64-year-old male was found dead in his house with his face covered with blood and a 38-caliber revolver between his legs. He had been suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus and aftereffects of cerebral infarction. Autopsy revealed a normal round contact wound in the left lateral cervical region. A bullet from the firearm had entered through the left lateral cervical region and traveled to the outer right sternocleidomastoid muscle. This also triggered another wound from the fifth cervical vertebra to the muscle tissue near the right cartilage thyroid. At the end of this channel, there were three bone fragments. Here, we report this interesting case with two channels caused by a bullet and by a resulting bone fragment. We also discuss the characteristics of an ear lobe injury found on the victim and show how this injury and blood and skin on the revolver were used as clues to determine the posture at the time of the shot.

AB Impairment of neuroplasticity is considered to play a role in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. To further characterize the impairment of neuroplasticity in psychiatric disorders, expression of the neuronal plasticity marker 43 kDa growth-associated protein (GAP-43) was detected in postmortem hippocampal sub-regions from psychiatric patients including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia subjects, and matched control subjects. We found that GAP-43 protein levels in the hippocampal hilar region were significantly lower in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia subjects than in control subjects. We also found that GAP-43 protein levels in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and the stratum radiatum of CA2 region were reduced in a trend in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia subjects when compared with control subjects. These results suggest that impairment of neuroplasticity may occur in the hippocampus of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia patients. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The muzzle imprint (barrel mark) is a pressure abrasion typically associated with contact shots. Apart from the contours of the actual muzzle profile, other constructional parts such as the front sight and/or the recoil spring guide of semiautomatic pistols may be imprinted next to the bullet entrance wound. In some types of submachine guns the shoulder stock can be folded forward so that its end partly encircles the muzzle. If such a weapon was in contact with the skin at the instant of discharge, a corresponding contusion mark is to be expected. The imprint configuration may point to the type of weapon and to the way in which the gun had been held when firing the shot. The paper presents the injury pattern in a 36-year-old man who committed suicide with a Scorpion SA Vz 61 submachine gun cal. 7.65 mm Browning from former Czechoslovakia.

AB Childhood trauma and aggression were examined in 540 male prisoners. The Thus 540 male prisoners had a psychiatric interview, completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), and were assessed with the Brown-Goodwin Lifetime History of Aggression (BGHA) interview. There were significant correlations between CTQ scores and BGHA scores. Also prisoners with CTQ scores above the median had significantly higher BGHA scores than prisoners with CTQ scores below the median. Significantly more of the prisoners with CTQ scores above the median had more than one conviction, and significantly more had convictions as minors, and had exhibited violent behavior in prison. However, in logistic regression analyses that included possible confounding variables, CTQ scores related only to violence in prison while BGHA scores related to violent crime, having more than one conviction, conviction as a minor, and violence in prison. The relationship between CTQ and BGHA scores suggests the possibility that childhood trauma may be one determinant of aggression in prisoners. (C) Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Abamectin is widely used as an insecticide and an anthelmintic. A previous report indicated that abamectin was used to commit suicide and led to death in Taiwan. This investigation focused on the toxicological effects of abamectin on serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and nitrate/nitrite (NO) levels in rats. After rats were gavaged with abamectin ranging from 1 to 20 mg/kg/body weight, AST and NO levels were examined within 12 h. AST and NO levels were elevated in abamectin-dosed rats in a dose-dependent manner. The least increase of AST corresponded to the highest enhancement of NO release at 6 h. A negative correlation coefficient (r = -0.55) between AST and NO was found. Both N-G-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester and aminoguanidine, inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase, increased the AST level induced by abamectin. These findings suggest that NO may be involved in the alteration of AST release induced by abamectin in rats. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between stressful life events and depression. Ninety major depressive patients, aged 36.57 +/- 12.02 years, and 121 matched controls, aged 27.11 +/- 10.59 years, took part in the study. The life change units (LCU) according to Rahe et al. were used for the quantification of life events. The results suggested that mates reported significantly more life events than females. Atypical males differed from all other gender-by-type groups, while no other differences emerged. LCU correlated with melancholic indices but did not correlate with anxiety or functioning. The results suggest that subgroups of depressive patients are characterized by the presence of stressful life events. Male atypical patients reported the highest load of life events. The question that arises is whether this finding is valid or whether these patients (who have higher personality psychopathology and interpersonal rejection sensitivity) tend to over-report life events.

AB Background: Repeated self-harm represents the single strongest risk factor for suicide. To date no study with full national coverage has examined the pattern of hospital repeated presentations due to self-harm among young people.
   Methods: Data on consecutive self-harm presentations were obtained from the National Self-Harm Registry Ireland. Socio-demographic and behavioural characteristics of individuals aged 10-29 years who presented with self-harm to emergency departments in Ireland (2007-2014) were analysed. Risk of long-term repetition was assessed using survival analysis and time differences between the order of presentations using generalised estimating equation analysis.
   Results: The total sample comprised 28,700 individuals involving 42,642 presentations. Intentional drug overdose was the most prevalent method (57.9%). Repetition of self-harm occurred in 19.2% of individuals during the first year following a first presentation, of whom the majority (62.7%) engaged in one repeated act. Overall, the risk of repeated self-harm was similar between males and females. However, in the 20-24year- old age group males were at higher risk than females. Those who used self-cutting were at higher risk for repetition than those who used intentional drug overdose, particularly among females. Age was associated with repetition only among females, in particular adolescents (15-19 years old) were at higher risk than young emerging adults (20-24 years old). Repeated self-harm risk increased significantly with the number of previous self-harm episodes. Time differences between first self-harm presentations were detected. Time between second and third presentation increased compared to time between first and second presentation among low frequency repeaters (patients with 3 presentations only within 1 year following a first presentation). The same time period decreased among high frequency repeaters (patients with at least 4 to more than 30 presentations).
   Conclusion: Young people with the highest risk for repeated self-harm were 15-19-year-old females and 20-24-year-old males. Self-cutting was the method associated with the highest risk of self-harm repetition. Time between first self-harm presentations represents an indicator of subsequent repetition. To prevent risk of repeated self-harm in young people, all individuals presenting at emergency departments due to self-harm should be provided with a risk assessment including psychosocial characteristics, history of self-harm and time between first presentations.

AB Several lines of evidence point to the role of serotonin (5HT) neurotransmission in the epileptogenesis. The present preliminary study investigated possible association of the temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with the polymorphisms in several 5HT-related genes, including serotonin transporter (5HTT), monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and serotonin receptors 5HT-1A, 5HT-1B and 5HT-2C. All participants (101 TLE patients and 170 healthy controls) were unrelated individuals of Croatian origin. 5HT-1B allele 861G was found to be slightly overrepresented in the patient group (p = 0.0385). No significant differences between groups were observed for the other tested polymorphisms. Within the limitations imposed by the size of our sample, negative findings suggest that the respective loci do not make considerable contribution to the etiopathogenesis of TLE. Further examination of 5HT-1B gene, which yielded positive result at a trend level, is possibly warranted. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mental health literacy among the general public is poor; many people lack the skills to provide early intervention and suicide prevention strategies. 'Mental Health First Aid' (MHFA) is a 12-hour mental health promotion programme offering a tool kit and action plan supporting participants to engage with those experiencing a mental health difficulty. Exploring the MHFA model, this study aims to capture the views of experienced MHFA instructors, sharing their journey of programme delivery in Northern Ireland. A focus group of six instructors participated in a semi-structured recorded meeting, transcripts of which were analysed and key themes identified using a pragmatic approach to schematic content analysis. This study identifies and explores four themes: future roll out, instructor skills, challenges, networks and motivation. Results indicate that complex strategies are employed in delivering MHFA training, while the conclusion calls for the development of a mental health public awareness campaign and continuation of the MHFA programme.

ID ATTRIBUTABLE MORTALITY; CONSUMPTION
AB Aims: The aim of the study was to assess whether alcohol-related mortality data in the UK should be extended to include contributory as well as underlying cause of death. Methods: A total of 101,320 deaths registered in Northern Ireland between 2001 and 2007 were analysed to determine the quantity and characteristics of those with an underlying or contributory alcohol-related cause of death. Results: Alcohol was found to be an underlying cause of death in 1690 cases (1.7% of deaths) and a contributory cause in a further 1105 cases. Analyses show that the addition of alcohol-related contributory causes of deaths would increase the male-female ratio, result in steeper socio-economic gradients and amplify the apparent rate of increase of alcohol-related deaths. The significant contribution of alcohol to external causes of death, such as accidents and suicide, is also more evident. Conclusions: Using only underlying cause of death undoubtedly underestimates the burden of alcohol-related harm and may provide an inaccurate picture of those most likely to suffer from an alcohol-related death, especially among younger men.

AB Paraquat, a non-selective herbicide, is a known fatal substance in humans, acid intentional ingestion of paraquat is increasing among Korean suicides. In 1999, 147 subjects admitted to the Institute of Pesticide Poisoning, Soonchunhyang Chunan Hospital. Korea ingested paraquat. Initial routine laboratory tests were conducted and the outcome of paraquat poisoning was categorized as survivor and fatality. Mean amount (S.D.) of ingestion was 54.5 (104.9) mi, and the overall fatality rate was 44.2%. Abnormal liver function (GOT and GPT), renal dysfunction (BUN and creatinine), metabolic acidosis (pH and PaCO2), and abnormal urine analysis (RBC, WBC, and protein) had significant odds ratios (ORs) for paraquat fatality (P < 0.05). In multiple logistic regression. subjects with liver or renal dysfunction or metabolic acidosis had significant risks of the fatality. Our results determined that initial routine laboratory parameters could be used to predict the outcome of paraquat poisoning and recommended that evaluation of acid-base status and renal and liver function should be conducted and evaluated before intensive therapy.

AB We examined the association between parental death during childhood and lifetime and 12-month psychopathology, age of onset, incidence of mental health problems, use of mental health services during adulthood and functional limitations during adulthood.
   We conducted a longitudinal, population-based epidemiological study in adults aged 18-64 years (N=7076). Mental disorders were assessed with a standardized diagnostic interview (Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)). Few indications were found that there was a significant increase in mental disorders in adulthood among people who had lost a parent before the age of 16 (N=541). Parental death was not associated with mental disorders (12 months; lifetime), age of onset, incidence of mental disorders, functional limitations or use of mental health services. The majority of children overcome the loss of a parent during childhood without experiencing increased mental health problems, reduced functional limitations or a greater need for mental health services during adulthood.

AB The role of cholesterol in psychiatric diseases has aroused the interest of the medical community, particularly in association with violent and suicidal behavior. Herein, we discuss some aspects of brain cholesterol metabolism, exploring possible mechanisms underlying the findings and reviewing the available literature on the possible neurochemical link between suicide and low or reduced levels of serum cholesterol. Most of the current hypotheses suggest a decreased serotonergic activity due to a decrease in cholesterol in the lipid rafts of synaptic membranes. Some aspects and limitations of this assumption are emphasized. In addition to serotonin hypofunction, other mechanisms have been proposed to explain increased impulsivity in suicidal individuals, including steroid modulation and brain-derived neurotrophic factor decrease, which could also be related to changes in lipid rafts. Other putative markers of suicidal behavior (e.g. protein S100B) are discussed in connection with cholesterol metabolism in the brain tissue. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Apart from commercial reasons, two motivations have led to the introduction of SSRIs to replace the first and second generation antidepressants already available. One was the search for a more rational treatment, based on specific mechanisms, the other the development of effective treatments with fewer side effects, particularly for older patients, who have a greater sensitivity to cardio-vascular and central nervous system effects. The first has been frustrated up to a point, in that SSRIs and other single mechanism drugs do not appear to be more effective than the earliest relatively non-specific antidepressants. The second has been fulfilled, in that SSRIs generally are better tolerated in older patients and in overdose. However, there is a spectrum of other side effects that are particularly relevant in older age and that need attention when treating depression in this particular patient group.

AB Castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is essentially incurable. Recently though, chemotherapy demonstrated a survival benefit (similar to 2 months) in the treatment of CRPC. While this was a landmark finding, suboptimal efficacy and systemic toxicities at the therapeutic doses warranted further development. Smart combination therapies, acting through multiple mechanisms to target the heterogeneous cell populations of PC and with potential for reduction in individual dosing, need to be developed. In that, targeted molecular chemotherapy has generated significant interest with the potential for localized treatment to generate systemic efficacy. This can be further enhanced through the use of oncolytic conditionally replicative adenoviruses (CRAds) to deliver molecular chemotherapy. The prospects of chemotherapy and molecular-chemotherapy as single and as components of combination therapies are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Teenage suicide is a major public health issue in Western societies, especially in France. An instrument to measure suicidal thoughts in French adolescents and thus identify the teenagers at risk is urgently required. The aim of this study was to validate a French version of the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (SIQ) for use with teenagers. Respondents (n=956, age range 14-18.0) completed the SIQ and other convergent measures (self-esteem, psychic morbidity, anxiety, and personality) for three validation steps (general and clinical samples). A confirmatory factor analysis was performed on the SIQ The study supported a 30-item one-factor model, similar to the original questionnaire, with moderate model fit indices (chi(2)/ddl=3.21; RMSEA=0.05; CFI=0.87; GFI=0.92). Significant correlations (-0.22 to 0.74) were found with convergent measures among general (n=871) and psychiatric samples (n=38). A high internal consistency was found with a reliability coefficient of 0.91. The results confirm the psychometric qualities of the questionnaire for French adolescents.

AB Despite the high prevalence of depressive disorders in cancer patients and elderly people, the topic of depression in elderly cancer patients still remains unexplored. This emerges from a systematic review of the literature conducted to investigate issues of depression, diagnosis, pathogenesis, treatment and their complex neuroimmunobiological interactions. Indeed, it becomes apparent that depression in elderly patients with cancer may have a peculiar phenomenology. In addition, the moderate rate of major depressive disorder and the high rate of minor depressive disorder are accompanied by subthreshold forms of depression that are at risk to be underecognized and untreated. Immune dysfunction may represent a common pathogenic ground of depression, cancer and aging. This may have important implications for treatment. In the near future, we need to develop validated mood disorder diagnoses and verify antidepressant treatment efficacy for elderly cancer patients with depression in order to improve their clinical outcome and quality of life.

AB Background:Intentional drug overdose (IDO) is the most common form of hospital-treated self-harm, yet no national study has systematically classified the range of drugs involved using a validated system. We aimed to determine the profile of patients engaging in overdose, to identify drugs frequently used and to quantify the contributions of multiple drug use and alcohol involvement. Methods: Between 2012 and 2014, the National Self-Harm Registry, Ireland recorded 18 329 presentations of non-fatal IDO to Irish emergency departments. Information on demographic and overdose characteristics were obtained. Drugs were categorized using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. Results: Analgesics (32.4%), antidepressants (21.9%), anxiolytics (21.2%) and hypnotics and sedatives (21.0%) were the most frequently used drugs types involved in overdose. Presentations involving analgesic and antidepressant medication were more common for females whereas males more often took illegal, anxiolytic and hypnotic and sedative drugs. Overdoses with drugs other than those which affect the nervous system were identified, including musculoskeletal drugs, taken in 12.0% of presentations. Paracetamol was the most frequently used drug, particularly among females (32.0%) and persons under 25 years (36.2%). Alcohol was most often present in overdoses involving anxiolytics and illegal drugs. Multiple drug use was a factor in almost half (47.1%) of presentations. Conclusions: People who engage in IDO frequently take prescription only or sales restricted drugs, often involving alcohol and/or multiple drug use. These findings highlight the importance of addressing drug and alcohol misuse, potential inappropriate prescribing and the enforcement of legislation restricting specific drug sales.

AB Background Understanding the causes of poor mental health in early childhood and adolescence is important as this can be a significant determinant of mental wellbeing in later years. One potential and relatively unexplored factor is residential mobility in formative years. Previous studies have been relatively small and potentially limited due to methodological issues. The main aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between early residential instability and poor mental health among adolescents and young adults in Northern Ireland.
   Methods A Census-based record linkage study of 28% of children aged 0-8 years in 2001 in Northern Ireland (n= 49 762) was conducted, with six monthly address change assessments from health registration data and self-reported mental health status from the 2011 Census. Logistic regression models were built adjusting for socioeconomic status (SES), household composition and marital dissolution.
   Results There was a graded relationship between the number of address changes and mental ill-health (adjusted OR 3.67, 95% CIs 2.11 to 6.39 for 5 or more moves). This relationship was not modified by SES or household composition. Marital dissolution was associated with poor mental health but did not modify the relationship between address change and mental health (p= 0.206). There was some indication that movement after the age of five was associated with an increased likelihood of poor mental health.
   Conclusions This large study clearly confirms the close relationship between address change in early years and later poor mental health. Residential mobility may be a useful marker for children at risk of poorer mental health in adolescence and early adulthood.

AB AimCurrently, Ireland has the fourth highest rate of youth suicide in the European Union with psychological morbidity ranging from 21% to 27% in young adults. Primary care is ideally situated to address mental health problems and provide direction and support to young adults. This study investigates the prevalence and management of young adults aged 18-25 presenting to their general practitioner with a psychological problem as part of a larger study on all adults.
   MethodsA random sample of 100 patients aged 18 and over with a consultation in the previous 2 years was selected from the practice management systems of 40 general practices in Ireland. Clinical records of active patients (excluding temporary visitors to the practice) were examined using a standardized reporting tool to extract information on demographics, prevalence, diagnoses and treatments for psychological problems.
   ResultsOf the 3845 active patients sampled aged 18 and over, 479 were in the target age group of 18-25. Of the 479 young adults identified (51% female, 60% fee paying), 57 (12%, 95% CI: 9-15%) had a documented psychological problem within the previous 2 years. Those with psychological problems were more likely to be frequent attenders and eligible for free medical care. Depression (23%) and stress and anxiety (23%) were most commonly identified.
   ConclusionsThe estimated prevalence rate is considerably lower than previous studies which may indicate reluctance among young adults in presenting to primary care or reflect under-identification of psychological problems. Given the high rate of prescribing, enhancing access to non-pharmacological treatments in primary care is a priority.

AB ObjectivesMortality in young people with perinatally acquired HIV infection (PHIV) following transfer to adult care has not been characterized in the UK. We conducted a multicentre audit to establish the number of deaths and associated factors.
   MethodsFourteen adult clinics caring for infected young people reported deaths to 30 September 2011 on a proforma. Deaths were matched to the Collaborative HIV Paediatric Study, a clinical database of HIV-infected children in the UK/Ireland, to describe clinical characteristics in paediatric care of those who died post-transition.
   ResultsEleven deaths were reported from 14 clinics which cared for 248 adults with PHIV. For the 11 deaths, the median age at transfer to adult care was 17 years (range 15-21 years), and at death was 21 years (range 17-24 years). Causes of death were suicide (two patients), advanced HIV disease (seven patients) and bronchiectasis (one patient), with one cause missing. At death, the median CD4 count was 27 cells/L (range 0-630 cells/L); five patients were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) but only two had a viral load <50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL. Nine had poor adherence when in paediatric care, continuing into adult care despite multidisciplinary support. Eight had ART resistance, although all had potentially suppressive regimens available. Nine had mental health diagnoses.
   ConclusionsOur findings highlight the complex medical and psychosocial issues faced by some adults with PHIV, with nine of the 11 deaths in our study being associated with poor adherence and advanced HIV disease. Novel adherence interventions and mental health support are required for this vulnerable cohort.

AB Objectives: To determine etiology of pediatric OHCA in a population-based sample from autopsy and coroner's diagnosis.
   Design: As part of the Ontario Pre-hospital Advanced Life Support (OPALS) study, we conducted a prospective cohort study including children below age 19 years with OHCA in an 11-year period. Deaths were matched with provincial coroner's office records and autopsies and investigation notes were reviewed.
   Results: From 1992 to 2002, there were 474 cardiac arrests in children below 19 years of age giving an annual incidence of 59.7 per million children. Mean age was 5.8 (S.D. 6.3), 43.0% were < 1 year of age, mates were 59.1%. 25.1% were bystander witnessed and 20.3% received bystander CPR. 1.9% survived to discharge. Four hundred and thirty nine matched to coroner's office records. Annual incidence rates per million by age groups were: 175.0 (age 1-4 years), 33.0 (age 5-14 years) and 61.6 (age 15-18). Annual incidence rates per million according to coroner's cause of death were: natural (26.2), accidental (17.4), suicide (3.7) and homicide (1.9). Post-mortem rate was 84.3% and Mean Injury Severity Score was 31.4 (S.D. 16.5). The commonest causes of natural death were SIDS (30.3%), cardiovascular (19.2) and respiratory (18.3%). The commonest causes of accidental death were drowning (27.5%), residential accidents (18.8%), fire (13.0%) and motor vehicle collisions (12.3%).
   Conclusion: The highest mortality rates were among children age < 4 years. 52.6% of deaths were from 'unnatural' causes (accidental, suicide, homicide, undetermined). Our findings will be useful for planning prevention, treatment and future research of pediatric OHCA. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE suicide; self harm; children; adolescents
ID PREVENTION
AB Objectives: To determine the frequency of reported suicidal thoughts and acts in (a) a school-based sample of Irish adolescents, (b) adolescents attending a community child and family mental health service.
   Method: The study population consisted of: (a) 195 adolescents aged 13-15 years attending ten secondary schools throughout Ireland. The schools were selected to represent a wide social and cultural spread: and (b) 66 adolescents aged 13-15 years attending a community child mental health service. The measures used were the Child Behaviour Checklist completed by the parents of the adolescents and the Youth Self Report completed by the adolescents.
   Results: Within the school sample, the parents of 3% of adolescents reported that their child had talked of harming him/herself, but none reported acts of self-harm. Fifteen percent of the adolescents themselves reported that they had thoughts of harming or killing themselves, and 8% reported that they had tried to harm or kill themselves. Within the mental health clinic attenders sample, the parents of 33% of the adolescents reported that their child had talked of harming him/herself, and the parents of 27% reported that their child had tried to harm or kill themselves. Twenty-one percent of the adolescents themselves reported that they had thoughts of harming or killing themselves, and 21% percent reported that they had tried to do so. In both groups, adolescents with higher total problem, internalising and externalising scores on the questionnaires, indicating greater disturbance, were more likely to report thoughts and acts of self harm.
   Conclusions: Thoughts of suicide and acts of self harm are common in Irish adolescents and are not limited to those attending mental health services. Parents are frequently unaware of these thoughts. Further studies involving interviews with adolescents at risk are indicated to determine the significance of these thoughts and how adolescents deal with them.

AB Background: Doxylamine (DA) is widely available in pharmacies without prescription and can be used in suicidal intention because of its sedative and anticholinergic properties. Research of literature shows that only a few publications deal with post-mortem evidence of DA and its interpretation during toxicological examination.
   Material and methods: In this study, all cases with a positive detection of DA during toxicological analyses with high-performance liquid chromatography in the time period 2000 to 2010 at the Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences in Berlin, Germany were retrospectively analysed and interpreted, taking into account police investigations, autopsy results and toxicological analyses.
   Results: In total, 22 cases with DA intoxications were discovered (male = 16/female = 6, age-at-death range 17 to 90 years). Maximum blood concentration was measured at 77.5 mu g/mL Cause of death was due to DA intoxication in eight suicide cases; seven of those were combined intoxications (DA and other substances, particularly diphenhydramine). During the evaluated time period no monointoxications with DA were discovered.
   Conclusion: Benchmarks published in past literature are meant as orientation during evaluation of post-mortem DA evidence. These should not be used as absolute values and need to be interpreted individually in each case. Post-mortem redistribution needs to be considered as a main factor in alteration of DA concentration measurement. Furthermore, proof of DA ingestion found in gastric content should only be interpreted quantitatively due to unreliable calculation of the ingested amount. In conclusion, a variety of factors, such as the time period between time of death and the time of the first toxicological analysis, the condition of the body and the findings at autopsy, must also be critically considered.

AB Depression in the elderly is nowadays a predominant health care problem, mainly due to the progressive aging of the population. It results from psychosocial stress, polypathology, as well as some biochemical changes which It occur in the aged brain and can lead to cognitive impairments, increased symptoms from medical illness, higher utilization of health care services and increased rates of suicide and non-suicide mortality. Depression may be also caused by a various number of drugs currently administered; this is remarkable especially in elderly people, where polypathology is often associated with polypharmacotherapy. However, the pathogenesis of geriatric depression is not well understood; major depression may arise from dysfunction of the limbic -hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Some clinical observations also suggest that striato-frontal dysfunction is associated with late life depression. A number of hypotheses have been made, focusing that mood disturbances are probably linked to a disturbed central metabolism of monoamines 5-hydroxytryptamine, noradrenaline and dopamine; however most of this knowledge is derived from animal models. Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases are age-related diseases associated to decreased activity or brain lesions in the orbital frontal cortex and basal ganglia. These observations lead to the hypothesis that the dysfunction of one or more of the cortical basal ganglia-thalamic neuronal loops are involved in the pathophysiology of primary and secondary depression. This dysfunction may be mediated by decreased serotonin release and probably, also by reduction in serotonin receptors. Development of novel approaches such as dynamic brain imaging methods, together with indirect knowledge coming from the effects of new antidepressants, will increase the understanding of neurochemistry of depression in old age.

AB Background: Despite the high rates of comorbidity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol dependence (AD) in clinical and epidemiological samples, little is known about the prevalence, clinical presentation, course, risk factors and patterns of treatment-seeking of co-occurring PTSD-AD among the general population.
   Methods:The sample included respondents of the Wave 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). Weighted means, frequencies and odds ratios (ORs) of sociodemographic correlates, prevalence of psychiatric disorders and rates of treatment-seeking were computed.
   Results: In the general population, the lifetime prevalence of PTSD only, AD only and PTSD-AD was 4.83%, 13.66% and 1.59%, respectively. Individuals with comorbid PTSD-AD were more likely than those with PTSD or AD only to have suffered childhood adversities and had higher rates of Axis I and II disorders and suicide attempts. They also met more PTSD diagnostic criteria, had earlier onset of PTSD and were more likely to use drugs and alcohol to relieve their PTSD symptoms than those with PTSD only; they also met more AD diagnostic criteria than those with AD only and had greater disability. Individuals with PTSD-AD had higher rates of treatment seeking for AD than those with AD only, but similar rates than those with PTSD only.
   Conclusion: PTSD-AD is associated with high levels of severity across a broad range of domains even compared with individuals with PTSD or AD only, yet treatment-seeking rates are very low. There is a need to improve treatment access and outcomes for individuals with PTSD-AD. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Suicidality is a life-threatening symptom in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). Impulsivity and mood instability are associated with suicidality in mood disorders. Evidence suggests that gray and white matter abnormalities are linked with impulsivity in mood disorders, but little is known about the association between corpus callosum (CC) and impulsivity in BID. We examined the relationship between CC areas, impulsivity and suicidality in BID patients. We studied 10 female BD patients with a history of suicide attempt (mean +/- SD age 36.2 +/- 10.1 years), 10 female BD patients without suicide attempt history (44.2 +/- 12.5 years) and 27 female healthy subjects (36.9 +/- 13.8 years). Impulsivity was evaluated by the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS). We traced MR images to measure the areas of the CC genu, anterior body, posterior body, isthmus and splenium. The genu was divided into anterior, middle and posterior regions. The suicidal and non-suicidal BID patients had significantly higher BIS total, attention and non-planning scores than the healthy subjects (ps < 0.01), and the suicidal BID patients had significantly higher BIS motor scores than the non-suicidal BD and healthy subjects (ps < 0.01). There were no significant differences among the three groups on any regional CC areas, although the suicidal BD patients had the smallest areas. The suicidal BD patients showed a significant inverse correlation between anterior genu area and the BIS total (r = -0.75, p = 0.04), motor (r = -0.79, p = 0.02) and non-planning scores (r = -0.79, p = 0.02). These correlations were not found in the non-suicidal BID patients or healthy subjects. The results suggest that the anterior medial frontal region may be involved in the pathophysiology of impulsive and suicidal behaviors in BD. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate demographic. clinical and symptomatologic features of the following mood disorder subtypes: bipolar disorder I (BP-I): bipolar disorder II (BP-II): major depressive disorder. recurrent (MDR); and major depressive episode. single episode (MDSE). A total of 1832 patients with mood disorders (BP-I=863, BP-II=141. MDR=708, and MDSE=120) were included in our study. The patients were assessed using structured diagnostic interviews and the operational criteria for psychotic illness checklist (n=885), the Hamilton depression rating scale (n=167), and the social adjustment scale (n=305). The BP-I patients were younger had more hospital admissions presented a more severe form of symptomatology in terms of psychotic symptoms, disorganization, and atypical features and showed less insight into their disorder than patients in the other groups. Compared with the major depressive subgroups, BP-I patients were more likely to have an earlier age at onset, an earlier first lifetime psychiatric treatment, and a greater number of illness episodes. BP-II patients had a higher suicide risk than both BP-I and MDSE patients. MDSE patients presented less severe symptomatology. lower age at observation, and a higher number of males. The retrospective approach and the selection constraints due to the inclusion criteria are the main limitations of the study. Our data support the view that BP-I disorder is quite different from the remaining mood disorders from a demographic aid clinical perspective. with BP-II disorder having an intermediate position to MDR and MDSE, that is, as a less severe disorder. This finding may help in the search for the biological basis of mood disorders. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Opioid therapy alone or in combination with benzodiazepines poses safety concerns among patients with substance use disorders (SUD). Guidelines for opioid therapy recommend SUD treatment and enhanced monitoring, especially in patients with additional risk factors, but information on monitoring practices is sparse. This study estimated high-risk conditions - psychiatric comorbidity, suicide risk, and age <35 and >= 65 - and described clinical monitoring among patients with SUD who were newly prescribed opioids alone and concurrent with benzodiazepines long-term.
   Methods: This study included VA Northwest Veterans Network patients with SUD who started opioids only (n = 980) or benzodiazepines and opioids concurrently (n = 353) long-term (>= 90 days) in 2009-2010. Clinical characteristics, outpatient visits and urine drug screens (UDS) documented within 7-months after starting medications were extracted from VA data.
   Results: Approximately 67% (95% CI: 64-70) of opioids only and 94% (92-97) of concurrent medications groups had >= 1 psychiatric diagnoses. Prevalences of suicide risk and age <35 and >= 65 were 7% (5-8), 6% (5-8) and 18% (15-20) among the opioids only group, and 20% (16-24), 8% (5-11) and 13% (9-16) among the concurrent medications group. Among patients prescribed opioids only and medications concurrently, 87% and 91% attended primary care, whereas 28% and 26% attended SUD specialty-care. Overall, 30% and 48% of opioids only and concurrent medications groups engaged in mental health or SUD care, and 35% and 39% completed UDS.
   Conclusions: Improvements in clinical monitoring are needed as many VA patients with SUD and comorbid risks who initiate opioid therapy do not receive sufficient mental health/SUD care or UDS monitoring. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Background: Changes in per capita alcohol consumption are temporally linked to changes in rates of alcohol-related harm. Methodological approaches for analysing this relationship have been suggested, however, the problem of time lags is not well-addressed. This study provides a review of time lag specifications, looking at (a) time to first effect on harm, (b) time to full effect and (c) the functional form of the effect accumulation from first to full effect to inform modelling of the relationship between changes in aggregate alcohol consumption and changes in rates of harm.
   Methods: Bibliographic databases were searched and citation and reference checking was used to identify studies. Included studies were time series analyses of the relationship between aggregated population alcohol consumption and rates of alcohol-related harms where time lag specifications had been derived or tested.
   Results: 36 studies were included with liver cirrhosis, heart disease and suicide dominating the evidence base. For a large number of alcohol-related harms, no literature was identified. There was strong evidence of an immediate first effect following a change in consumption for most harms. Recommended lag specifications are proposed for a set of alcohol-attributable harms.
   Conclusions: Research on time lag specifications is under-developed for most harms although we provide suggested specifications based on the findings of the review. Greater methodological attention needs to be given to the rationale for choosing or applying lag specifications and the inherent complexity of the time lag process. More consistent and transparent reporting of methodological decisions would aide progress in the field. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aims: Though the introduction of office-based buprenorphine has greatly contributed to stern the HIV epidemic since 1995, concerns have been raised about the intravenous use of buprenorphine even in patients on substitution treatment. The aim of this study was to identify which factors are predictive of buprenorphine injection in patients receiving office-based buprenorphine.
   Design and setting: Subazur is a survey consisting of two longitudinal assessments of 111 stabilized patients receiving office-based buprenorphine in southeastern France.
   Measurements: Patients were interviewed by phone at enrolment and 6 months later about social characteristics, addictive behaviors, treatment experiences, overdoses and suicide ideation or attempt. A logistic regression based on generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to identify factors associated with buprenorphine injection at any interview.
   Findings: Among the 111 patients (32% women, mean age 38 years), 36 reported buprenorphine injection after having started treatment initiation in 40 interviews. After adjustment for time since first injection, individuals perceiving their prescribed dosage as inadequate (OR = 2.6 95% CI[1.2-5.7]) and those reporting a history of suicide ideation or attempt (OR=2.7 95% CI[1.1-7.0]) had approximately a three-fold higher risk of injecting buprenorphine.
   Conclusions: Providing adequate care for both drug dependence and psychiatric comorbidities in primary care is a major issue. Like heroin use during methadone treatment, buprenorphine injection should be regarded more as a response to inadequate care than simply as a "misuse". A re-assessment of the treatment efficacy through a possible dosage increase or a switch to methadone could potentially reduce diversion and assure sustained adherence to OST.

AB Aims and objectives To develop a grounded theory to explain mental health nurses' responses to clients with suicidal behaviour. Background Mental health nurses are an integral part of the multi-disciplinary teams supporting people who experience suicidal behaviour, yet limited research is available that explores how nurses respond to the needs of people at risk of suicide and what factors influence their responses and actions. Methods Grounded theory was the methodology for this study. Interviews were conducted with 33 mental health nurses working in an urban area in the Republic of Ireland. Data were analysed using the concurrent processes of comparative analysis, theoretical sampling, theoretical sensitivity and memo writing. COREQ 32-item checklist was used. Results The core category from the data was "Attenuating Anxieties." Participants' main concerns about caring for suicidal clients were related to their feelings of professional and personal vulnerability and the need to protect clients and themselves. This theory "Attenuating Anxieties" highlights the way in which nurses allay their anxieties by utilising historically known risk adverse strategies to care for the suicidal person. Acquisition of further psychotherapeutic training, clinical supervision as well as increased reflexivity protected some participants and enabled them to work creatively and collaboratively while supporting and facilitating therapeutic risk-taking. Conclusions The theory of "Attenuating Anxieties" identifies how participants worked within the context of mental health as members of the "risk society," wherein they worried about the possibility and probability of a negative or adverse effect for both the client and self, leaving them to feel constantly vulnerable and unsafe. Relevance to clinical practice This theory highlights the need for a culture of openness that acknowledges nurses' and organisations' anxieties surrounding suicide and promotes a discourse among nurses that moves from a position of risk aversion to a relational and recovery-orientated approach.

AB Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), Chandigarh undertakes the examination of the crime cases of some northern states of India. The shooting cases of last two decades (1980-1999) involving shotguns were analysed in this laboratory. This paper consists of the study of 360 actual cases of shotguns for evaluation of various parameters, such as type of firearm, number of firearm and firing, location of wound, age, occupation, sex and caste of accused and victim, etc. Out of 360 cases, 253 (70%) were classified as homicidal, 68 (19%) accidental, 11 (3%) suicidal, 9 (2.5%) hunting and 19 (5.5%) cases of insufficient information including the cases of illegal possession of firearm. Single Barrel Breech Loading (SBBL) gun 144 (40%) was preferred over Single Barrel Muzzle Loading (SBML) 109 (30.3%), Double Barrel Breech Loading (DBBL) 72 (20%) and Double Barrel Muzzle Loading (DBML) gun 35 (9.7%). All the breechloader guns were of 12 bore. Muzzleloader gun were recovered only from the remote rural areas. Three hundred and thirty-one (92%) cases involved single, 22 (6%) double and 7 (2%) more than two shotgun. Majority of cases were found of single firing 288 (80%), followed by double 29 (8%) and multifiring 18 (5%). Eleven (3%) cases were of misfiring and in 14 (4%) cases information was not available. Accidental and suicidal cases had only one firing. The mean age for male and female victim was 31 and 24 years, respectively. Occupationally, agriculture is predominating over business, service and security guards for accused and for victim agriculture followed by service, business, student and security guards are in the descending order. Caste wise the most aggressive community of Kshatriyas is predominating as accused and victim over lower cast people. Head (64%) being a vital part was chosen most frequently for committing suicide followed by body (36%). Service personnel committed maximum number of suicide. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) has shown efficacy in speeding the onset of the antidepressant effect of imipramine in depressed patients. This effect may be related to their interactions at the serotonin(1A) (5-HT1A) receptors. Acute imipramine up-regulated the frontal cortex 5-HT1A receptors (B-max, 51.5 +/- 8.4 fmol/mg protein) vs. saline (B-max, 27.5 +/- 5.9 fmol/ mg protein), and did not show antidepressant effect. Acute SAM and imipramine + SAM did not modify frontal cortex 5HT(1A) receptors, and showed antidepressant effects (decrease of the immobility response of 26%, P < 0.01; and 47%, P < 0.001) vs. saline. All the chronic treatments showed antidepressant effects and up-regulated the hippocampus 5HT1A receptors. SAM prevents the 5-HT1A receptor up-regulation induced by acute imipramine in the frontal cortex. This mechanism may contribute to imipramine's antidepressant effect.

AB liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for simultaneous determination of four aconitines (aconitine, mesaconitine, hypaconitine, jesaconitine) and seven of their hydrolysis products (benzoylmesaconine, benzoylhypaconine, 14-O-anisoylaconine, benzoylaconine, aconine, mesaconine, hypaconine) in human serum and urine samples. Extraction was undertaken using a mixed-mode cation-exchange cartridge (OASIS MCX), and D-5-aconitine was used as an internal standard. Separation of aconitum alkaloids was carried out using an L-column ODS with the mobile phase consisting of 10 mM ammonium formate and methanol. The intra- and inter-day precisions were 0.3% to 9.9% and 3.2% to 12.8%, respectively. Intra- and inter-day accuracies were -14.1% to 7.3%, and -10.6% to 8.3%, respectively. The limit of detection and limit of quantification of analytes were 0.04-0.38 ng/mL and 0.12-1.15 ng/mL respectively. This method was applied in an autopsy case and successfully detected aconitines and their metabolites as well as some anti-psychiatric drugs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many plants contain toxic alkaloids which may be dangerous to humans. Despite the large number of poisonous plants, cases of fatal plant poisonings are relatively rare. The frequencies of poisonings and the plants involved are often regionally specific. Plant poisonings can be aggregated into three categories: unintended ingestions, intended ingestions, and poisoning due to abuse of plant material. Unintended ingestions often occur in children or from a mix-up of plants and mushrooms in adults. Intended ingestions are common in homicides and suicides. Increasingly common is the abuse of plants for hallucinogenic reasons. Toxicological analysis of such alkaloids may help in diagnosis of poisoning or abuse cases. This review describes the toxic alkaloids aconitine, atropine, coniine, colchicine, cytisine, dimethyltryptamine, harmine, harmaline, ibogaine, kawain, mescaline, scopolamine, and taxine, which are often involved in fatal and non-fatal poisonings. The paper summarizes the symptoms of the intoxications and reviews the methods of detection of their toxic constituents in biological fluids.

AB Following the initial popularity of mephedrone (4-methylmethcathinone) there has been a stream of new "recreational drugs" entering the global market. The lack of clinical studies on the effects and toxicity of these drugs has made interpretation of toxicological findings difficult. In an attempt to assist in a better understanding of the extent of their use and the fatalities that have been linked to these compounds we present our collated findings in post-mortem and criminal casework where these have been detected and/or implicated. Between January 2010 and December 2012 we have detected new psychoactive substances (NPS) in 203 cases, with 120 cases in 2012 alone. The drugs detected in in life or post-mortem blood and urine are, in order of decreasing frequency; mephedrone, 4-methylethcathinone, BZP, MDPV, TFMPP, methoxetamine, 4-fluoromethcathinone, 4-methylamphetamine, PMA, methylone, PMMA, naphyrone, alpha-methyltryptamine, butylone, MDAI, desoxypipradrol, D2PM, MPA, synthetic cannabinoids, 2-AI, 5-IAI, 5-MeODALT, MDPBP, 5/6-APB, pentedrone and pentylone. Other drugs or alcohol were detected in 84% of the cases including other NPS and in fatalities it should be noted that alternative causes of death (including mechanical suicide, accidental death and non-psychoactive drug overdose) accounted for the majority. Related to this was that of all fatalities involving cathinones, 41% of these were hangings or other mechanical suicides, this was a higher proportion than seen with other drugs found in such cases. The presence of multiple NPS and/or other stimulants was a particular feature in various cases, however, of the drug deaths only 7% solely involved NPS. Across all case types and including some cases investigated in 2013, NPS concentrations showed a wide range but these and selected cases are presented to assist toxicological interpretation in future cases.

AB There is evidence to suggest that both psychological characteristics and stressful life events are contributory factors in deliberate self-harm among young people. These links, and the possibility of a dose-response relationship between self-harm and both psychological health and life events, were investigated in the context of a seven-country school-based study. Over 30,000, mainly 15 and 16 year olds, completed anonymous questionnaires at secondary schools in Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway and Australia. Pupils were asked to report on thoughts and episodes of self-harm, complete scales on depression and anxiety symptoms, impulsivity and self-esteem and indicate stressful events in their lives. Level and frequency of self-harm was judged according to whether they had thought about harming themselves or reported single or multiple self-harm episodes. Multinomial logistic regression assessed the extent to which psychological characteristics and stressful life events distinguished between adolescents with different self-harm histories. Increased severity of self-harm history was associated with greater depression, anxiety and impulsivity and lower self-esteem and an increased prevalence of all ten life event categories. Female gender, higher impulsivity and experiencing the suicide or self-harm of others, physical or sexual abuse and worries about sexual orientation independently differentiated single-episode self-harmers from adolescents with self-harm thoughts only. Female gender, higher depression, lower self-esteem, experiencing the suicide or self-harm of others, and trouble with the police independently distinguished multiple- from single-episode self-harmers. The findings reinforce the importance of psychological characteristics and stressful life events in adolescent self-harm but nonetheless suggest that some factors are more likely than others to be implicated.

AB Affective disorders are more common in women. The forced swim test acts like a depressive stimulus. Hippocampus and frontal cortex 5-HT1A receptors of female and male Wistar rats subjected to the forced swim test were compared with a sham group. The forced swim test diminishes (P < 0.05) the hippocampus H-3-80H-DPAT bound in the female rats (184 +/- 16 fmol/mg protein) with respect to the male rats (309 +/- 41 fmol/mg protein) and to the female sham rats (255 +/- 20 fmol/mg protein). The forced swim test increases the frontal cortex 5-HT1A receptors in the female rats with respect to the female sham group (40.4 +/- 5 versus 24.7 +/- 4 fmol/mg protein, P < 0.05). An increased sensibility of the 5-HT1A receptors to depressive-stimulus may be one mechanism underlying the higher prevalence of depression in female. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB This study examined the relationship among symptoms of anhedonia and suicidal ideation at baseline, at termination, and over time in 1529 adult psychiatric inpatients. Anhedonia was associated with suicidality cross-sectionally at baseline and at termination. In addition, change in anhedonia from baseline to termination predicted change in suicidality from baseline to termination, as well as level of suicidality at termination; moreover, anhedonia remained a robust predictor of suicidal ideation independent of cognitive/affective symptoms of depression. Symptom-level analyses also revealed that, even after accounting for the physical aspect of anhedonia (e.g., loss of energy), loss of interest and loss of pleasure were independently associated with higher levels of suicidal ideation at baseline, over time, and at discharge. Loss of interest was most highly predictive of suicidal ideation, providing support for recent differential conceptualizations of anhedonia. Taken together, these findings indicate that the manner in which anhedonia is conceptualized is important in predicting suicidal ideation, and that anhedonia symptoms warrant particular clinical attention in the treatment of suicidal patients.

AB Depression in early psychosis is linked to poor outcome, relapse and risk of suicide, yet remains poorly understood. This article aims to examine the development of depression in acute and post psychotic phases of first episode psychosis (FEP), and its relationship to persecutors, voices, insight, and recovery. Data were gathered on 92 patients with acute FEP on depression course, severity and experience of positive symptoms, insight and appraisals of illness using validated semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. Measures were repeated at 12 months. Malevolent voices, use of safety behaviours and subordination to persecutors were associated with depression and suicidal behaviour in acute FEP. Loss, Shame, low level continuing positive symptoms and longer duration of untreated psychosis were associated with post psychotic depression. Negative appraisals remained stable despite recovery in other symptom domains. Thus, depression and risk in early psychosis may be propagated by the personal significance and content of positive symptoms experienced. When in recovery, low level symptoms, longer period of illness and negative appraisals are significant factors. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In schizophrenia, poor insight has been associated with negative outcome. In fact, some studies have found insight to be associated with greater treatment adherence and lower levels of symptomatology, as well as better psychosocial functioning. However, others have found that insight into illness is associated with an increase in depression, low self-esteem, and possibly higher risk of suicide. We investigated the relationship between insight and well-being in a sample of 40 people presenting paranoid symptoms and diagnosed with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder. Independent-samples t-tests revealed that compared to a paranoid group with high insight, paranoid participants with low insight had more self-acceptance, higher sense of autonomy and personal growth, and greater orientation towards gratification. Moderation analyses showed that when experiential avoidance was high, insight into paranoia had a detrimental effect on self-acceptance. Overall, our results support the need to explore which psychological variables moderate insight in patients with persecutory beliefs. We discuss the implications of these results for the research of paranoia. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is no effective treatment for late stage and metastatic cancers of colorectal, prostate, pancreatic, breast, glioblastoma and melanoma cancers. Novel treatment modalities are needed for these late stage patients because cytotoxic chemotherapy offers only palliation, usually accompanied with systemic toxicities and poor quality of life. Gene directed enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT), which concentrates the cytotoxic effect in the tumor site may be one alternative. This review provides an explanation of the GDEPT principle, focusing on the development, application and potential of various GDEPTs. Current gene therapy limitations are in efficient expression of the therapeutic gene and in tumor-specific targeting. Therefore, the current status of research related to the enhancement of in situ GDEPT delivery and tumor-specific targeting of vectors is assessed. Finally, GDEPT versions of stem cell based gene therapy as another potential treatment modality for progressed tumors and metastases are discussed. Combinations of traditional, targeted, and stem cell directed gene therapy could significantly advance the treatment of cancer. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Selenium is one of the most toxic elements necessary for the life of mammals. Only a narrow range separates therapeutic (connected with a protective effect) and toxic doses. Selenium incorporated into animal or human tissues in larger amounts can exceed normal human levels and may be toxic (only elemental selenium and selenium sulphide are poorly absorbed). Acute poisonings with selenium or its compounds, especially fatal ones, occur extremely rarely in humans. Levels of selenium in four fatal cases are reviewed, and the levels in a fatal poisoning with sodium tetraoxoselenate(VI) are evaluated. Postmortem tissue selenium contents in the latter case were the following: brain, 1.45 and 1.60 mug/g; stomach, 6.12 and 6.37 mug/g; small intestine, 4.37 and 4.13 mug/g; large intestine, 4.53 and 4.43 mug/g; liver, 4.20 and 4.35 mug/g; kidney, 3.35 and 3.60 mug/g; lung, 1.80 and 1.60 mug/g; blood, 1.43 and 1.41 mug/ml measured by the use of ETA-AAS and fluorimetric methods, respectively.

AB Organophosphosphates (OPs) are highly effective acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors that are used worldwide as cheap, multi-purpose insecticides. OPs are also used as chemical weapons forming the active core of G-series and V-series chemical agents including tabun, sarin, soman, cyclosarin, VX, and their chemical analogs. Human exposure to any of these compounds leads to neurotoxic accumulation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, resulting in abnormal nerve function and multiple secondary health complications. Suicide from deliberate exposure to OPs is particularly prevalent in developing countries across the world and constitutes a major global health crisis. The prevalence and accessible nature of OP compounds within modern agricultural spheres and concern over their potential use in biochemical weapon attacks have incentivized both government agencies and medical researchers to enact stricter regulatory policies over their usage and to begin developing more proactive medical treatments in cases of OP poisoning. This review will discuss the research undertaken in recent years that has investigated new supplementary drug options for OP treatment and support therapy, including progress in the development of enzymatic prophylaxis.

AB Evidence from a range of sources demonstrates that end-of-life (EoL) care practices and preferences vary across countries; culture is consistently one of the main explanations given for this. In order to understand how cultural factors are used. to explain similarities and differences in EoL care between Spain, Italy and Portugal, database and hand searches were performed and cross-cutting core themes identified. Similarities included higher proportions of people who wished to die at home than actually died at home, a persistent trend for partial disclosure in Italy and Spain, low use of advance directives, and low incidence of all medical EoL decisions (with the exception of terminal sedation) compared to northern European countries. The role of religion and the importance of family ties were the two main cultural factors used to explain the similarities. Further research is needed in order to interpret the important differences that were also found. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) Disorder has been included in DSM-5 for the first time as a disorder requiring further research. The present study investigated DSM-5 criteria for NSSI Disorder in a community sample of adults and provided an initial investigation of differences between those with and without a diagnosis of NSSI Disorder and NSSI history. Participants over the age of 18 (N = 5 48) completed an online survey using Amazon's MTurk. A lifetime history of NSSI was reported by 23% of the sample. Nearly 3% of the total sample and 11.2% of those with an NSSI history met criteria for NSSI Disorder. Those with NSSI Disorder were similar to participants with an NSSI history who did not meet criteria for the disorder on NSSI frequency and methods, and age of NSSI onset, use of coping strategies, and borderline symptoms, but they differed on automatic reinforcement of the behavior and reported interference with functioning. Endorsement of specific NSSI Disorder criteria, potential implications for the diagnosis, and avenues for future research are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB HSP70 promoter-driven gene therapy and inhibition of HSP90 activity with small molecule inhibitors are two shining points in a newly developed cohort of cancer treatment. For HSP70 promoters, high efficiency and heat inducibility within a localized region make it very attractive to clinical translation. The HSP90 inhibitors exhibit a broad spectrum of anticancer activities due to the downstream effects of HSP90 inhibition, which interfere with a wide range of signaling processes that are crucial for the malignant properties of cancer cells. In this review article, we summarize exciting applications of newly emerged molecular imaging techniques as they relate to HSP, including protein-protein interactions of HSP90 complexes, therapeutic response of tumors to HSP90 inhibitors, and HSP70 promoters-controlled gene therapy. In the HSPs context, molecular imaging is expected to play a vital role in promoting drug development and advancing individualized medicine. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The goal of this study was to determine the contribution of substance abuse to the expression of suicidal ideation in a sample of patients referred for evaluation of chemical dependency in a large urban Psychiatric Emergency Service (PES). Records from 777 consecutive patients referred to the chemical dependency service of the PES were analyzed. Of this sample, 43.7% of the patients with only a cocaine use disorder expressed suicidal ideation compared to 38% of those with both cocaine and alcohol use disorders, 24.3% with only an alcohol use disorder and 17% with other drug use disorders (x(2) = 24.768; df = 3; P < 0.0001). More than half of the patients (55.26%) with a substance-induced mood or psychotic disorder expressed suicidal ideation (x(2) = 23.174, df = 1, P < 0.0001), and the majority (85%) of these patients had a cocaine use disorder (x(2) = 12.309, df = 1, P < 0.0005). In this sample of patients served by an urban PES, cocaine use is associated with suicidal ideation, more so than other substances of abuse. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

ID PUBLIC-OPINION; NEWS COVERAGE; INJURIES; SUPPORT
AB Aim: International research indicates that the role which alcohol plays in accidents tends to be understated in media reports. Evidence suggests that public support for alcohol harm reduction policies would increase if people were better informed about the role of alcohol in serious injuries. We hypothesized that the role of alcohol in Irish accidental deaths is under-reported in the Irish print media. Method: We identified all traumatic and poisoning deaths (excluding suicides) in Ireland during the years 2008 and 2009 where alcohol was mentioned on the death certificate. We conducted an Internet-based search for newspaper reports of these deaths. The content of each report was examined and rated for mention of alcohol's possible role in the individual death. Results: This study demonstrates the under-reporting in Irish newspapers of the role of alcohol in traumatic and poisoning deaths. Where deaths were reported, the role played by alcohol was generally ignored. Conclusion: This represents a missed opportunity to inform the public about the role of alcohol in these deaths. More accurate information would permit the public to make more informed decisions regarding their own behaviour and regarding their support for alcohol harm-reducing strategies.

AB Selectively replicating recombinant adenovirus has emerged as a novel strategy for the treatment of incurable human cancers. One of the major characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma is the transcriptional reactivation of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). In this study, we evaluated the liver cancer-specific oncolytic potential of E1B 55kDa-deleted recombinant adenovirus (YKL-1001), which retained other E I genes driven by the AFP promoter. Transient transfection study using luciferase indicated the selective activation of the AFP promoter only in human liver cancer cells secreting AFP (HepG2, Hep3B). YKL-1001 induced both cytopathic effects exclusively in AFP-positive liver cancer cells and the growth inhibition of pre-established Hep3B xenografts. Finally, hematoxylin-eosin staining and the immunohistochemistry to the adenoviral hexon showed a large distributed necrotic area and this implied a wide spread of YKL-1001. Therefore. the present study demonstrated that YKL-1001 holds significant promise as an oncolytic agent for hepatocellular carcinoma. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID PUBLIC-ATTITUDES; DEPRESSION; DISORDER; CAMPAIGN
AB This paper describes the needs assessment phase of a mental health promotion programme for rural communities in Ireland. As part of a larger study encompassing four rural communities, a cross-sectional study of the mental health beliefs and perceptions of 1014 people was carried out. Employing a combination of interviewer-administered questionnaire and the vignette method, the needs assessment explores the levels of awareness, current practices, attitudes and stigma concerning depression and suicide among a randomly selected quota sample of community members. Lower levels of awareness, less confidence in dealing with mental health issues, negative attitudes to helpseeking and social stigma emerge as particular issues for men and the under 40 age group. Women were found to have more positive attitudes generally, were more likely to use informal social support networks and were more open about discussing mental health matters. The predominant interpretation of the depression vignette was to view it as a mental health problem with good prospects for recovery given appropriate help. Social relationships, negative thinking patterns and social stresses were perceived as being particularly important in explaining the origins of depression. The implications of the findings for planning the intervention phase of the project are considered.

AB Introduction. Poisoning is a common cause of emergency visits and hospital admission in Western countries. The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence and type of toxic exposures presenting to emergency medical facilities in Iceland. Materials and methods. The study was prospective and included all patients with confirmed or suspected poisoning presenting to hospitals and rural medical centers providing emergency services in Iceland during the twelve-month period from April 2001 until March 2002. Results. A total of 1,121 toxic exposures were documented representing an incidence of 3.91 cases per 1,000 inhabitants per year. The female to male ratio was 1.23. The majority of exposures (56.7%) occurred in the patient's home, 60% were deliberate, 72% had drugs and/or alcohol as their main cause, and 11% involved illicit drugs. Exposures to chemicals other than drugs were usually unintentional. Conclusion. Toxic exposures requiring emergency medical care are common in Iceland. Self-poisonings by ingestion of prescription drugs and/or alcohol accounted for the majority of cases.

AB Anger attacks are episodes of intense anger with autonomic arousal, which occur in response to often trivial provocations. This study explores some of the antecedents, concomitants, and consequences of anger attacks in patients with depression. The sample comprised three groups: depression with anger attacks (n = 20), depression without anger attacks (n = 20) and normal controls (it = 20). Subjects were administered the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, the Anger Attack Questionnaire, Irritability, the Depression Anxiety Scale, the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory, the Psychoticism Extraversion Neuroticism Inventory, the Hassles Scale, the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF Version and the Dysfunctional Analysis Questionnaire. Depressed patients with anger attacks exhibited more suicide-related phenomena and dysfunction scores in comparison to depressed patients without anger attacks. Depressed patients with anger attacks also had higher scores of anxiety, irritability, trait-anger, anger-out, anger expression, psychoticism, hassles, and poor quality of life in comparison to the other two groups. In conclusion, anger attacks adversely affect the lives of depressed patients and their family members and may serve as a qualifier for partially distinct syndrome of depression.

AB Hypothalamic neuronal histamine is involved in the central regulation of energy expenditure through the activation of sympathetic nerves innervating brown adipose tissue (BAT). The present study examined the effect Of L-histidine, a precursor of neuronal histamine, on BAT sympathetic nerve activity in rats. Infusion of histamine at a dose of 1 nmol/rat into the third cerebroventricle significantly increased BAT sympathetic nerve activity as compared with the effect of phosphate buffered saline (P < 0.05). Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection Of L-histidine (0.3 mmol/rat) also significantly increased BAT sympathetic nerve activity as compared with the effect of PBS (P < 0.05). Pretreatment with an i.p. bolus injection of 224 mumol/kg alpha-fluoromethylhistidine, a suicide inhibitor of the histamine synthesizing enzyme histidine decarboxylase, blocked the stimulatory effect Of L-histidine on BAT sympathetic nerve activity. These results indicate that L-histidine regulates BAT sympathetic nerve activity through its conversion into neuronal histamine in the hypothalamus. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Recent studies reported that a recovery of motoneurons after spinal cord transection at the sacrocaudal level may depend on adaptive alterations of the serotonin 2C (5-HT2cR) and 2A (5-HT2cR) receptor function via changes in mRNA editing or protein expression, respectively. It has been suggested that depletion of serotonergic input may drive these adaptations. Here, mRNA editing and/or expression of 5-HT2cR and 5-HT2AR was evaluated in rats that sustained a complete transection at the thoracic (T10) level. While 5-HT2AR mRNA expression was upregulated below the site of spinal cord injury (SCI), no changes in 5-HT2cR mRNA editing or expression were detected. These findings argue against the hypothesis that 5-HT2cR editing is regulated by extracellular serotonin levels. Rather, it appears that the editing process is just one of the ways in which excitability of motor neurons can be restored following SCI. To this end, the influence of excitatory locomotor circuits on motor neurons in the thoracic spinal cord of rats requires further exploration. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB This international comparative study addresses differences between adolescents who engage in deliberate self-harm (DSH) and who receive help following the DSH episode versus those who do not. A standardised self-report questionnaire was completed by Pupils aged 14-17 in Australia, Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, The Netherlands, and Norway (n=30532). An act of DSH in the year prior to the study was reported by 1660 participants. Nearly half (48.4%) had not received any help following DSH, 32.8% had received help from their social network only and 18.8% from health services. Except for Hungary, cross-national comparisons revealed remarkably similar findings. Adolescents who had been in contact with health services following DSH reported more often a wish to die, lethal methods, alcohol/drug problems and DSH in the family compared to those who had not. However, those who received no help or help from their social network only were also heavily burdened. (C) 2008 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

AB The functions of non-suicidal self-injury were examined in 39 young adults with a history of skin-cutting and other self-injurious behaviors including banging, burning, and severe scratching. Consequences, affect-states, and reasons associated with self-injury were assessed by a structured interview. Results indicate that self-injury is associated with improvements in affective valence and decreases in affective arousal. Specifically, participants tended to feel overwhelmed, sad, and frustrated before self-injury, and relieved and calm after self-injury. Further, these affective changes predict lifetime frequency of self-injury, suggesting that they reinforce the behavior. Finally, although reasons for self-injury related to both affect-regulation (e.g., to release emotional pressure that builds up inside of me) and self-punishment (e.g., to express anger at myself) were endorsed by a majority of participants, affect-regulation reasons were overwhelmingly rated as primary and self-punishment reasons as secondary.

AB Among risk factors for suicide, suicidal ideation (SID) is of paramount importance. This study sought to determine sex- and age-related SID point prevalence rates in the general population. A population-based survey of 3154 subjects, 35 to 84 years, conducted in 2004/05 in southern Germany, identified 170 subjects (5.4%; 95% CI 4.6-6.2) suffering from SID within the last 14 days. Age-adjusted short-term period prevalence in women (6.0%, 95% CI 4.9-7.2) was higher than in men (4.0%, 95% CI 3.1-5.1). Among 10-year age groups, sex-related differences were only significant in middle-aged subjects (55-64 years). Prevalence increased significantly with age, leading to a prevalence of > 10% in the oldest age group (75-84 years). The population-based approach demonstrates a substantial proportion of subjects suffering from SID, particularly in older age groups. (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB The relationships between acute life events and type of depression were evaluated among inpatient adolescents with schizophrenia. Forty-two adolescent inpatients were assessed, 25 with schizophrenia and 17 with personality disorder. Acute life events and other psychosocial situations were identified with the ICD-10 Axis V semistructured interviews. The Depression Equivalent Questionnaire for Adolescents (DEQ-A) and the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) were used to measure quality and severity of depression. In the patients with schizophrenia, psychosocial situations were related to the anaclitic type of depression, whereas in the subjects with personality disorder. they were highly correlated with introjective depression. In the schizophrenic group, the psychosocial situations related to depression were of a more intrapersonal nature and, in the personality-disordered group, they were more interpersonal. Environmental factors play an important role in the course of schizophrenia in adolescents and should remain a focus of study. Object relations theory may be of heuristic value in the investigation of these factors. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: This paper presents an analysis of call data records pertaining to a telephone helpline in Ireland among individuals seeking mental health and well-being support and among those who are in a suicidal crisis.
   Objective: The objective of our study was to examine whether rule sets generated from decision tree classification, trained using features derived from callers' several initial calls, could be used to predict what caller type they would become.
   Methods: Machine learning techniques were applied to the call log data, and five distinct patterns of caller behaviors were revealed, each impacting the helpline capacity in different ways.
   Results: The primary findings of this study indicate that a significant model (P<.001) for predicting caller type from call log data obtained from the first 8 calls is possible. This indicates an association between callers' behavior exhibited during initial calls and their behavior over the lifetime of using the service.
   Conclusions: These data-driven findings contribute to advanced workload forecasting for operational management of the telephone-based helpline and inform the literature on helpline caller behavior in general.

AB Oncolytic viruses are investigational cancer treatments. They are currently being assessed as single agents or in combination with standard therapies such as external beam radiotherapy - a DNA damaging agent that is a standard of care for many tumour types. Preclinical data indicate that combinations of oncolytic viruses and radiation therapy are promising, showing additional or synergistic antitumour effects in in vitro and in vivo studies. This interaction has the potential to be multifaceted: viruses may act as radiosensitizing agents, but radiation may also enhance viral oncolysis by increasing viral uptake, replication, gene expression and cell death (apoptosis, autophagy or necrosis) in irradiated cells. Phase I and II clinical trials investigating combinations of viruses and radiation therapy have been completed, paving the way for ongoing phase III studies. The aim of this review is to focus on the therapeutic potential of these combinations and to highlight their mechanistic bases, with particular emphasis on the role of the DNA damage response.

AB Background: Overdose (OD) is a leading Cause of mortality and morbidity for individuals with substance use disorders (SUDS), and there are limited prospective data on OD during the months following treatment for SUDS.
   Methods: Variables associated with an OD in the 12 months after leaving an initial treatment episode were examined in an analysis of the Drug Abuse Treatment Outcomes Study (DATOS), a longitudinal naturalistic multisite study. Participants included 2966 patients with one or more SUDS. Non-fatal OD was ascertained by a positive response to "In the past 12 months, have you overdosed on drugs?" Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify variables associated with OD.
   Results: By 12 months, 93 (3.1%) participants reported one or more ODs. Variables associated with OD were lifetime history of OD, injection drug use (IDU), male sex, greater pain, and history of sexual abuse.
   Conclusions: OD-risk appears to be increased by IDU, lifetime OD, sexual abuse history, and pain. The latter finding is novel for a prospective report and requires further study. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

With continued culture, the agents induced a form of programmed cell death in which DNA laddering was not detected and ultrastructural changes were not characteristic of classic 'type 1' cellular suicide. The changes were more consistent with a type 2 cytosolic, autophagic form of PCD. MK886 induced strikingly abnormal mitochondrial morphology. Since the lipoxygenase inhibitors and NTBN induce classic type 1 PCD in U937 monoblastoid cells, these agents can activate either pathway, depending upon cell type. It is not certain whether activation of type 1 or 2 pathways depends entirely upon cell lineage and/or initiating agent, if all cells retain both pathways, and if type 1 PCD a more effective mediator of the process. These are all relevant questions for assessing the impact of PCD on malignant cell survival and considering ways in which it might be enhanced. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB Although children of depressed parents are at heightened risk for suicidal ideation, little is known about specific risk factors. This study focused on the relation between a broad range of cognitive vulnerabilities proposed by the leading cognitive theories and the development of suicidal ideation in children. Participants were 209 mothers (aged 24-55) and their 8-14 year old children. Children of depressed mothers who had previously experienced suicidal ideation themselves reported higher levels of brooding rumination than children of depressed mothers who had not experienced suicidal ideation as well as children of never depressed mothers who had not experienced suicidal ideation. Further, among children of depressed mothers with no prior history of suicidal ideation, higher levels of hopelessness and lower global self-worth predicted first onset of suicidal ideation over a 2-year follow-up. Importantly, these results were maintained even after taking the occurrence of major depressive disorder in children during the follow-up into account. The findings highlight specific cognitive vulnerabilities that could be targeted in early suicide prevention and intervention efforts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Acute and chronic GVHD are still a major concern in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, still contributing substantially to morbidity and mortality in this therapeutic procedure. Over the past decade, many advances have been made with regard to the prevention and treatment of GvHD using various drugs such as cyclosporine A, FK506, mycophenolate mofetil and/or monoclonal IL-2 receptor antagonists. Despite these measurements with regard to the prevention of acute GVHD, it is very difficult to treat these clinical conditions successfully. However, if patients do not experience any GvHD often the desired effect of graft versus leukemia (GvL) remains absent increasing the probability of a relapse, in particular, in patients transplanted, which are considered at higher risk for relapse. At the present time, new strategies in the prevention of acute GvHD are in progress in particular the use of genetic manipulated donor T cells expressing suicide genes. Further clinical and laboratory studies are required in order to improve the prevention and. in particular, the therapy of established GvHD. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB Depressive symptoms seem to be frequent in schizophrenia, but so far they have received less attention than other symptom domains. Impaired serotonergic neurotransmission has been implicated in the pathogenesis of depression and schizophrenia. The objectives of this study were to investigate platelet serotonin concentrations in schizophrenic patients with and without depressive symptoms, and to investigate the association between platelet serotonin concentrations and symptoms of schizophrenia, mostly depressive symptoms. A total of 364 patients were included in the study, 237 of which had significant depressive symptoms. Significant depressive symptoms were defined by the cut-off score of 7 or more on Calgary Depression Rating Scale (CDSS). Platelet serotonin concentrations were assessed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Prevalence of depression in patients with schizophrenia was 65.1%. Schizophrenic patients with depressive symptoms showed lower platelet serotonin concentrations (mean +/- SD; 490.6 +/- 401.2) compared to schizophrenic patients without depressive symptoms (mean SD; 660.9 +/- 471.5). An inverse correlation was established between platelet serotonin concentration and depressive symptoms, with more severe symptoms being associated with lower platelet serotonin concentrations. Depressive symptoms in schizophrenic patients may be associated with reduced concentrations of platelet serotonin. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Diagnoses of psychiatric diseases do not include criminal behavior. In schizophrenia, a non-negligible subgroup is incarcerated for capital and other crimes. Most studies that compared offender and non-offender patients with schizophrenia have only focused on male patients. With this study, we compared demographic and disease-related characteristics between 35 female incarcerated forensic patients (fSZ) and 35 female inpatients with schizophrenia (SZ). Basic clinical documentation and basic forensic clinical documentation revealed significant clinical and demographic differences between the two groups. Compared to SZ, fSZ were more severely clinically impaired, showing higher rates of comorbid alcohol and substance disorder, more suicide attempts, had more previous hospitalizations, and were younger at disease onset. Regarding demographic variables, fSZ showed a higher rate of unemployment and homelessness and had to rely more often on housing and legal guardianships compared to SZ. These results suggest that female forensic patients with schizophrenia are more severely affected by clinical and non-clinical variables requiring an adapted intervention program. These results may also indicate two developmental trajectories for criminal and non-criminal schizophrenia in females, (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The relationship between psychiatric severity and substance use disorders treatment outcome was assessed in 393 individuals who received either standard treatment or standard treatment plus contingency management. The sample was divided into groups of low, moderate, and high psychiatric severity based upon baseline Addiction Severity Index psychiatric composite scores. Participants in the high psychiatric severity group reported a greater prevalence of psychiatric hospitalization, psychiatric medications, and suicide attempts, as well as poorer baseline psychosocial functioning. In terms of treatment outcome, a significant interaction between psychiatric severity and treatment modality was found in relation to treatment retention. Participants in the standard treatment condition were more likely to dropout of treatment earlier as psychiatric severity increased, while retention was similar across the psychiatric severity groups in the contingency management condition. Psychiatric severity was not linked to longest duration of abstinence achieved during treatment or adherence with contingency management procedures. Overall, these findings suggest contingency management is an efficacious and appropriate intervention for substance use disordered individuals across a range of psychiatric problems.

AB This review of the literature on elderly cancer patients and their psychiatric disorders was undertaken to determine the extent of the problem. It consists of articles with elderly cancer patients. Keyword terms included "cancer'', "elderly'', "aging'', "geriatric'', "psychiatric disorders'', "psychiatric symptoms'', "psychological problems'', "aged > 60 years'', "sucidal ideation, geriatric, cancer'', "suicide geriatric cancer''. We conducted searches on the following databases: PubMed; PsychINFO (1980-2013); finally, 102 publications were suitable for the current review. Depression in elderly cancer patients is the most common disorder in elderly cancer patients associated with disability, morbidity and mortality. Anxiety disorders may be less frequent in geriatric patients; however, it seemed to be a major problem in late life. Psychiatric disorders are common in geriatric patients with cancer especially at advanced stages of the disease. In addition, health care professionals can help provide treatment and emotional support. Future research should aim to provide data about the real prevalence and severity of psychiatric disorders in elderly patients with cancer, for the improvement of patients' quality of life and their caregivers.

AB Despite promising findings from problem-solving interventions in the treatment of parasuicide, little is known about problem-solving difficulties that distinguish "Non-Repeaters" from "Repeaters". The present study examined whether problem-solving ability could be used to identify repeaters of parasuicide. Findings are presented from the follow-up part (N = 35) of a larger investigation (N = 146) of non-consecutive hospital-treated cases of parasuicide, interviewed by the National Suicide Research Foundation in Ireland as part of the WHO/EURO Multicentre Study on Suicidal Behaviour. The median interval from initial to follow-up interview was 15 months. The European Parasuicide Study Interview Schedule (EPSIS II) was used in the follow-up interview. Within this schedule, responses to a questionnaire measuring habitual problem-solving style were analysed. Repeaters scored significantly lower than non-repeaters on the following problem-solving dimensions: Active handling, Comforting cognitions and Seek social support. Repeaters scored significantly higher on the Passive reactions dimension. A logistic regression model including these four problem-solving dimensions correctly identified 79% of the repeaters and 82% of the non-repeaters. Despite the limitations of this sample size, these significant differences in problem solving have implications for the treatment of parasuicide. Further work, using larger samples, is required.

AB Although lesions related to chemical burns have been studied through case reports, clinical analyses and autopsy series, microscopic lesions have not yet been precisely described. Our study analyses the microscopic lesions recorded after caustic exposure in fourteen lethal and four non-lethal cases. We find that microscopic lesions after caustic exposure are various and non-specific. Moreover, the distribution of gastrointestinal lesions is inconsistent. Histological changes affect the digestive mucosa first, with the entire wall suffering damage in some cases. Multiple factors influence the pattern of lesions, including the nature of the caustic substance, the duration of contact, the amount of the substance encountering the tissue and the length of postingestion survival. The assessment of microscopic lesions, especially necrosis, can be limited by post-mortem autolysis, which quickly affects the digestive tract. Chemical pneumonia due to caustic burns is rare and, when present, typically secondary to aspiration. According to the presented findings, macroscopic examination at autopsy under-or overestimates the nature and degree of lesions. Significant complications of caustic ingestion such as chemical pneumonitis can also be found by histological analysis. Microscopic examination can be useful to rule out oesophagitis or other digestive pathologies that can mimic chemical burns. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB This study investigated whether crisis intervention (Cl) at the General Hospital is a suitable management strategy among borderline patients referred to the emergency room (ER) for deliberate self-harm. Two patient cohorts (n = 200) meeting DSM-IV Borderline Personality Disorder criteria, were prospectively assessed for repeated deliberate self-harm and service consumption. At ER discharge, 100 subjects received Cl, while 100 comparison subjects (recruited before the implementation of Cl) were assigned to treatment as usual (TAU). At 3-month follow-up, a high proportion of repeated deliberate self-harm and hospitalization in the global study sample was found. However rates were lower in the Cl group: 8% repeated deliberate self-harm and 8% psychiatric hospitalization, versus 17% and 56% in the TAU group. The global expenditure for psychiatric hospitalization was 728,840 Swiss Francs (CHF) for Cl and 914,340 for TAU. This study indicates that associated with mean hospitalization/relapse rates, Cl may be a suitable management strategy for acutely suicidal borderline patients. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB This study examines the correlations between serum lipid levels and psychological distress. There were 4444 consecutive attendees of general health clinics who participated in the study. Psychological symptoms were measured by the Taiwanese version of the Symptoms Check List 90, revised (T-SCL-90-R). Levels of fasting serum lipids, including total cholesterol, total triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), were determined. Multiple linear regression analyses, with adjustment for confounders, revealed that the concentration of HDL-C had significant inverse associations with scores of depression, somatization and phobic anxiety. Women with an HDL-C level lower than 35 mg/dl scored significantly higher on depression, interpersonal sensitivity, phobia, anxiety, somatization and aggressive hostility, while subjects with a total cholesterol concentration lower than 160 mg/dl scored significantly higher. on anxiety, aggressive hostility, phobia, and psychoticism. This study provides, for the first time, comprehensive data derived from the Taiwanese population on the link between lipids and psychological symptoms, revealing a reverse correlation between depression and serum concentrations of HDL-C.

AB Religious coping is very common among individuals with psychosis, however its relevance to symptoms and treatment outcomes remains unclear. We conducted a prospective study in a clinical sample of n=47 psychiatric patients with current/past psychosis receiving partial (day) treatment at McLean Hospital. Subjects completed measures of religious involvement, religious coping and suicidality prior to treatment, and we assessed for psychosis, depression, anxiety and psychological well-being over the course of treatment. Negative religious coping (spiritual struggle) was associated with substantially greater frequency and intensity of suicidal ideation, as well as greater depression, anxiety, and less well-being prior to treatment (accounting for 9.0-462% of the variance in these variables). Positive religious coping was associated with significantly greater reductions in depression and anxiety, and increases in well-being over the course of treatment (accounting for 13.7-36.0% of the variance in change scores). Effects remained significant after controlling for significant covariates. Negative religious coping appears to be-a risk factor for suicidality and affective symptoms among psychotic patients. Positive religious coping is an important resource to this population, and its utilization appears to be associated with better treatment outcomes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Little is known about which risk factors longitudinally predict non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) during adolescence, a period when these self-injurious behaviors become alarmingly prevalent. We prospectively studied the rates, course, and longitudinal prediction of NSSI from early through middle adolescence with a community sample of 103 youth (ages 11-14) who were assessed for NSSI at baseline and 2 1/2 years later (94% retention; final N=97). Multiple risk factors (temperament, cognitive and interpersonal vulnerabilities, stressors; youths' and mothers' depression) were examined as prospective predictors of NSSI over the 2 1/2 year follow-up. Analyses showed that 18% of youth engaged in NSSI over the 2 1/2-year follow-up; 14% for the first time. Distal risks (assessed at baseline) that differentiated youth who engaged in NSSI from those who did not included negative cognitive style and mothers' prior depression. Proximal factors (assessed 2 years after baseline) that differentiated NSSI from non-NSSI youth included stressors, depressive symptoms, poor relationship quality, excessive reassurance seeking, and mothers' onset of depression. Several of these factors predicted new engagement of NSSI over 2 1/2 years. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID REDISTRIBUTION
AB A suicide caused by ingestion of multiple psychoactive drugs is reported. A 42-year-old man with a history of psychosis was found dead in a blood pool in his room. The forensic autopsy revealed two stab wounds on his chest. However, these wounds could not explain the cause of death. Eighty-six tablets were found in his stomach. Four psychoactive drugs clocapramine (CC), chlorpromazine (CP), promethazine (PM) and clotiazepam (CT) were detected in blood and tissues. The concentrations of CC. CP. PM and CT in the femoral vein (FV) blood were 0.39, 0.61, 1.23 and 0.09 mug/ml. respectively. The cause and manner of death were attributed to suicidal multiple psychoactive drug poisoning.
   Postmortem drug redistribution showed great site-dependent variations with the lowest level in the FV blood. Remarkable variations were observed in CC. CP and PM. but not in CT compared to other three drugs. The variations were dependent on the volume of distribution (Nd) of the drugs. Our human case has demonstrated drugs with higher Vd values showed higher degree of postmortem redistribution of the drug and vice versa. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a relatively new, noninvasive imaging technique that has been used increasingly to diagnose and manage a variety of retinal diseases. Since the axons in retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) are nonmyelinated within the retina, OCT has been used in various neurodegenerative diseases to visualize the process of neurodegeneration. Decreases in RNFL and ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thicknesses were observed in patients with schizophrenia. To date, there is no clinical research investigating OCT parameters in patients with MD. We compared the RNFL thickness, GCIPL thickness in 58 MD patients and 57 healthy controls, and investigated their correlation with clinical variables of depression. Depressed patients were not different from the healthy controls with regard to OCT parameters. GCIPL and nasal RNFL were correlated with the duration of the latest depressive episode. Some measures of OCT were negatively associated with clinical variables like a family history of psychiatric diagnosis and the duration of the latest episode. Larger studies including depressed patients of different severity, including structured interviews and controlling for the effect of antidepressant treatment will provide better results.

AB A-to-I editing is an adenosine-to-inosine modification of mRNA particularly widespread in the human brain, where it affects thousands of genes. A growing body of evidence suggests that A-to-I RNA editing is necessary for normal development and maintenance in mammals and that its deficiencies contribute to a number of pathological states. In this study, we examined whether mRNA editing levels of two mRNA species, CYFIP2 and GABRA3, change with aging. CYFIP2 has been implicated in synaptic maintenance. while GABRA3 is a GABA receptor subunit, a part of the major inhibitory neurotransmitter system in the CNS. The levels of mRNA editing were assessed in cortex samples of 20 subjects 22-102 years old. The data show an age-dependent statistically significant decrease in editing in CYFIP2. GABRA3 editing remained much more stable with age, implying that age-related decline of RNA editing is gene-specific. This is the first report of age-dependent decline in A-to-I editing. Further examination of these and other vulnerable genes may reveal specific RNA editing mechanisms that contribute to the aging phenotype. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Suicidality is common among individuals at risk of psychosis. Emerging findings suggest that mental illness stigma contributes to suicidality. However, it is unclear whether stigma variables are associated with suicidality among young people at risk of psychosis. This longitudinal study assessed perceived public stigma and the cognitive appraisal of stigma as a stressor (stigma stress) as predictors of suicidal ideation among individuals at risk of psychosis over the period of one year. One hundred and seventy-two participants between 13 and 35 years of age were included who were at high or ultra-high risk of psychosis or at risk of bipolar disorder. At one-year follow-up, data were available from 73 completers. In multiple logistic regressions an increase of stigma stress (but not of perceived stigma) over one year was significantly associated with suicidal ideation at one-year follow-up, controlling for age, gender, symptoms, comorbid depression and suicidal ideation at baseline. Interventions to reduce public stigma and stigma stress could therefore improve suicide prevention among young people at risk of psychosis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anthropology features little in published literature about blast injuries. Contributions through case studies and experimental research are beginning to expand our understanding of the effect these injuries have on the human skeleton. This study examines blast injury and gunshot related fractures through multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) with the aim of establishing injury patterns between the two types of trauma. Using a sample of 491 individuals from Bosnia, MCA is employed to identify which body regions differentiate between blast or gunshot related fractures. Cranial fractures were more closely associated with gunshot related cases. Post-cranial fractures were associated with blast-related cases. A differentiation in post-cranial and cranial fractures between gunshot and blast related cases was revealed in the samples. The high prevalence of extremity trauma in blast is similar to previous work, but the smaller amount of cranial blast-related fractures differs from previous studies and from what is found in gunshot-related cases. Differentiation of blast and gunshot wound injuries can be made on the human skeleton and can be used to possibly interpret injury mechanism in large skeletal assemblages as well as single cases.

ID 5-FACTOR MODEL; UNIPOLAR
AB The aim of this study was to determine the differences in personality traits between individuals with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) during a depressive episode, when it can be hard to differentiate them. Data on personality traits (NEO-FFI), mental disorders (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus) and socioeconomic variables were collected from 245 respondents who were in a depressive episode. Individuals with MDD (183) and BD (62) diagnosis were compared concerning personality traits, clinical aspects and socioeconomic variables through bivariate analyses (chi-square and ANOVA) and multivariate analysis (logistic regression). There were no differences in the prevalence of the disorders between socioeconomic and clinical variables. As for the personality traits, only the difference in Agreeableness was statistically significant. Considering the control of suicide risk, gender and anxiety comorbidity in the multivariate analysis, the only variable that remained associated was Agreeableness, with an increase in MDD cases. The brief version of the NEO inventories (NEO-FFI) does not allow for the analysis of personality facets. During a depressive episode, high levels of Agreeableness can indicate that MDD is a more likely diagnosis than BD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Depression and mania have been linked with low cholesterol though there has been limited prospective study of cholesterol and subsequent course of affective illness. We studied the relationship between fasting total cholesterol and subsequent depressive and manic symptoms. A total of 131 participants from a prospective cohort study were identified as having had a fasting total cholesterol evaluation at intake. Participants were predominantly inpatients at index visit and were followed for a median of 20 and up to 25 years. Cholesterol was modeled with age, gender, and index use of a mood stabilizer in linear regression to assess its influence on subsequent depressive symptom burden in participants with unipolar disorder as well as depressive and manic symptom burden in participants with bipolar disorder. Among bipolar participants (N = 65), low cholesterol predicted a higher proportion of follow-up weeks with manic, but not depressive symptoms. Cholesterol did not appear to predict depressive symptom burden among participants with unipolar depression (N = 66). Lower cholesterol levels may predispose individuals with bipolar disorder to a greater burden of manic symptomatology and may provide some insight into the underlying neurobiology.

AB Bipolar disorder and substance use disorders are highly debilitating conditions, and especially when co-occurring, are associated with a variety of negative outcomes. Surprisingly, there is a relative lack of research on feasible and effective psychosocial treatments for individuals with comorbid bipolar and substance use disorder (BD-SUD), and a dearth of literature examining interventions designed specifically to improve outcomes such as symptoms, functioning, and treatment engagement/adherence following psychiatric hospitalization in this population. In the current paper, we report results of a pilot randomized controlled trial (n=30), comparing the recently developed Integrated Treatment Adherence Program, which includes individual and telephone sessions provided to patients and their significant others, versus Enhanced Assessment and Monitoring for those with BD-SUD. Participants who received the Integrated Treatment Adherence Program demonstrated significantly faster and greater improvements in depression, mania, functioning, and values-consistent living than participants randomized to Enhanced Assessment and Monitoring, and there was a trend for increased treatment adherence over time. Results are discussed in light of existing literature and study limitations, and suggestions for future research are proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many individuals die suddenly and unexpectedly outside the hospital or in the emergency department (ED). The aim of this study was to determine the perceptions, needs and mourning reactions of their bereaved relatives and to assess the relationship with the cause of death. Data were collected prospectively in the emergency department of a university hospital by means of an interview and a standardised questionnaire. We registered 339 deaths over a period of 10 months, of which 110 met the inclusion criteria for sudden and unexpected death. The study group included 74 relatives of 53 deceased individuals. The majority of relatives were confronted with a traumatic death outside the hospital. Most frequently reported complaints concerned a lack of information and being left with unanswered questions. Psychological problems related to mourning were mainly associated with a traumatic cause of death. The results of this study highlight the specific needs of relatives in case of a sudden death either outside the hospital or in the ED and may serve as a basis for recommendations for improvement of psychological care of individuals who are suddenly bereaved.

AB Assessments of personality disorder (PD) and conduct disorder (CD) in a random community sample at mean age 13 were employed to predict subsequent substance abuse disorder (SUD), trajectories of symptoms of abuse or dependence on alcohol, marijuana, or other illicit substances, and hazard of initiating marijuana use over the subsequent decade. Personality disorders and conduct disorder were associated with diagnoses and symptoms of SUDS in every model and their effects were independent of correlated family risks, participant sex, and other Axis 1 disorders. Specific elevated PD symptoms in early adolescence were also associated with differential trajectories of already initiated SUD symptoms as well as elevated risk for future onset of SUD symptoms. For several models the greatest of these effects were shown for borderline PD and for conduct disorder, the predecessor of adult antisocial PD. Passive-aggressive PD also showed independent elevation effects on substance use symptoms for alcohol and marijuana. Analyses over 30 years suggest that Cluster B PD (borderline, histrionic, narcissistic) are independent risks for development of SUD and warrant clinical attention. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB The aims of this study were to detect and quantify fluoxetine, an antidepressant, from entomological samples. Larvae, pupae and adults of Dermestes maculatus (Coleoptera, Dermestidae) were reared on pig muscle previously treated with fluoxetine. The concentration selected, 2000 mg/kg, emulates a fluoxetine overdose lethal to humans and laboratory animals. Thirty larvae on the fourth and fifth stages, 50 adults and several exuviae were analyzed for fluoxetine content. Detection of fluoxetine was performed by UV spectrophotometry at 270 and 277 nm. All developmental stages of D. maculatus and exuviae were positive for fluoxetine. We also quantified the drug and no significant differences were found either between the days or the stages in the general model, but at 277 nm a tendency of the concentration to decrease with time was observed. Concentrations of fluoxetine at 277 nm were almost equal or greater than those at 270 nm. This is the first study to detect and quantify fluoxetine from entomological samples and, in particular, from D. maculatus beetles. (C) 2016 The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences.

AB Objectives: To describe and compare current legal procedures for notifying, controlling and evaluating (NCE-procedures) euthanasia in Belgium and the Netherlands, and to discuss the implications for a safe and controllable euthanasia practice.
   Methods: We systematically studied and compared official documents relating to the Belgian and the Dutch NCE-procedures for euthanasia.
   Results: In both countries, physicians are required to notify their cases to a review Committee, stimulating them to safeguard the quality of their euthanasia practice and to make societal control over the practice of euthanasia possible. However, the procedures in both countries differ. The main differences are that the Dutch notification and control procedures are more elaborate and transparent than the Belgian, and that the Belgian procedures are primarily anonymous, whereas the Dutch are not. Societal evaluation is made in both countries through the Committees' summary reports to Parliament.
   Conclusions: Transparent procedures like the Dutch may better facilitate societal control. Informing physicians about the law and the due care requirements for euthanasia, and systematic feedback about their medical actions are both pivotal to achieving efficient societal control and engendering the level of care needed when performing such far-reaching medical acts.

AB Genetic prodrug activation therapy (GPAT) is a form of cancer gene therapy that has potential use against tumours such as colorectal malignancy. The characterization of such therapies using laboratory models provides a basis for clinical trials. In this study the gene encoding Herpes Simplex Virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk) was delivered to colorectal tumour cells using an Adenoviral (wAd) vector in vitro. In this way the cells were made susceptible to killing with the prodrug ganciclovir to various degrees depending on cell infectability with Ad. Bystander killing effect appeared minimal both in vitro and when transduced cells were injected in vivo. Mechanisms of cell death, measured in vitro using anti-BrDU (DNA-break labelling) and propidium iodide staining variously showed a combination of apoptosis in the Gl cell cycle phase and late apoptotic or necrotic sub-GI DNA fragmentation, depending on the tumour cell line. These findings suggest that gene therapy of colorectal cancer by GPAT gives rise to therapeutic forms of direct cell death, but requires improvements in transduction, and possibly immune augmentation.

AB The goal of the study was to estimate the prevalence of current and lifetime mental disorders in a consecutive sample (n=300) of detainees and prison inmates held in an Italian prison and compare it with the prevalence observed in a sample randomized from the community (n=300) within the same age interval (18-55 years) and sex proportion of prisoners, and with a similar socio-economic status. Psychiatric disorders were identified with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Current psychiatric disorders were present in 58.7% of prisoners and 8.7% of the comparison group. Lifetime psychiatric disorders were present in 88.7% of prisoners and 15.7% of the comparison group. Current anxiety disorders and current stress-related disorders were related to prisoners serving their first-ever prison sentence. A variable fraction of prisoners with an ongoing psychopathology is not diagnosed or does not receive proper treatment. The provision of effective treatment to prisoners with psychiatric disorders might have potentially substantial public health benefits. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID CASUALTY NURSES; YOUNG-PEOPLE; SUICIDE; ACCIDENT; PREVENTION;
   MANAGEMENT; WORKING
AB The emergency department is an important gateway for the treatment of self-harm patients. Nurses' attitudes towards patients who self-harm can be negative and often nurses experience frustration, helplessness, ambivalence and antipathy. Patients are often dissatisfied with the care provided, and meeting with positive or negative attitudes greatly influences whether they seek additional help.
   A quantitative design was utilised to measure emergency department nurses' attitudes towards deliberate self-harm. The 'Self-Harm Antipathy Scale', a validated questionnaire, was administered to a random sample of nurses in four emergency departments in the Republic of Ireland. A total of 87 questionnaires were returned (87% response rate). Results reveal that nurses show slightly negative antipathy overall, indicating positive attitudes towards self-harming patients. Attitudes were significantly different in accordance with a nurse's age. Education and social judgment also contribute to the way nurses view, interact and make moral decisions regarding self-harm patients.
   Evidence indicates there is need to improve the training, supervision and support of nurses caring for patients who self-harm, and that practical strategies should be implemented to manage the alienation process and inform practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is characterised by a preoccupation with perceived defects in one's appearance, which leads to significant distress and/or impairment. Although several studies have investigated the prevalence of BDD, many studies have methodological limitations (e.g., small sample sizes and student populations), and studies on the prevalence of BDD in the general population are limited. In the current study, 2510 individuals participated in a representative German nationwide survey. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) criteria for BDD and associated characteristics such as suicidality and the prevalence of plastic surgeries were examined using self-report questionnaires. The prevalence of current BDD was 1.8% (N=45). Further, individuals with BDD, relative to individuals without BDD, reported significantly more often a history of cosmetic surgery (15.6% vs. 3.0%), higher rates of suicidal ideation (31.0% vs. 3.5%) and suicide attempts due to appearance concerns (22.2% vs. 2.1%). The current findings are consistent with previous findings, indicating that self-reported BDD is a common disorder associated with significant morbidity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB The purpose of this study was to co-calibrate items from different deliberate self-harm (DSH) behavioural scales on the same measurement metric and compare cut points and item hierarchy across those scales. Participants included 568 young Australians aged 18-30 years (62% university students, 21% mental health patients, and 17% community volunteers). Six DSH scales (containing 82 items) were administered, namely, Self-Injury Questionnaire Treatment Related (SIQTR), Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviours Interview (SITBI), Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory (DSHI), Inventory of Statements About Self-Injury (ISAS), Self-Harm Information Form (SHIF) and Self-Harm Inventory (SHI). Data were co-calibrated onto an underlying metric using the Rasch measurement model. The resulting calibration shows that the different scales occupy different ranges on the hierarchy of DSH methods with prevalence estimates ranging from 47.7 to 77.1%. A raw score conversion table is provided to adjust prevalence rates and to equate cut points on the six scales. A Rasch-validated hierarchy of DSH behaviours is also provided to inform the development of DSH nomenclatures and assist clinical practice. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We evaluated the impact of brief structured suicidal ideation (SI) assessments on mental health care among new-to-care Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) veterans. National datasets provided military, demographic, and clinical information. For all new-to-care OEF/OIF veterans administered depression screens (PHQ-2: Patient Health Questionnaire-2) and structured SI assessments in primary care or ambulatory mental health settings of three Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Centers between April 2008 and September 2009 (N=465), generalized estimating equations were used to examine associations between SI and number of subsequent-year specialty mental health visits and antidepressant prescriptions. Approximately one-third of the veterans reported SI. In multivariate models, PTSD and anxiety diagnoses, severe depression symptoms, being married, and SI assessment by a mental health clinician were associated with more mental health visits in the subsequent year. Depression, PTSD, and anxiety diagnoses, and SI assessment by a mental health clinician were associated with receiving antidepressants. Presence of SI did not significantly affect subsequent year mental health utilization when adjusting for diagnostic and clinician variables, but inaugural visits involving mental health clinicians were consistently associated with subsequent mental health care.

AB The current study explored the differential roles of dimensions of body image (i.e., affective, cognitive, and behavioral) among a sample of 101 young adults (72.3% female, M=19.45; S.D.=1.28) who reported having engaged in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), and a matched comparison group of young adults who did not. A mediational model of NSSI was tested, based on the hypothesis that emotion dysregulation would mediate the relationship between dimensions of body image and engagement in NSSI. Preliminary examination of the variables revealed that negative attitudes, suicide-related rumination, and behavioral practices associated with physical appearance significantly differentiated young adults who reported having engaged in NSSI and those who did not, regardless of gender. Path analytic modeling provided partial support for the proposed mediational model, with significant direct and indirect effects between dimensions of body image and NSSI through emotion dysregulation. Discussion focuses on the importance of understanding the differential roles of dimensions of body image and emotion dysregulation as intrapersonal risk factors related to NSSI engagement.

AB A fatal case of multidrug poisoning by tramadol and nicotine is reported. Tramadol is a centrally acting analgesic used in the treatment of moderate to severe acute or chronic pain. Nicotine, a lipid-soluble alkaloid, is one of the most readily available drugs in modern society. A 46-year-old man was found dead in his bed, and a suicide note was discovered near the body. He had 25 transdermal nicotine patches attached to his thorax and abdomen. Two half emptied bottles were found on the bedside table; the toxicological examination revealed that they contained tobacco and nicotine as well as other drugs such as diphenhydramine. At autopsy, areas of fresh and old myocardial infarction as well as diffuse pulmonary congestion and edema were present. The tramadol concentration was 6.6 mu g/mL in femoral venous blood, while levels of nicotine and its primary metabolite cotinine were determined to be 0.6 and 2.0 mu g/mL in femoral venous blood. Based on these results, we determined the cause of death to be cardiorespiratory failure induced by the additive effects of tramadol and nicotine shortly after consumption.

AB Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and intrapersonal functions of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) have both been found to have strong relationships with NSSI. The present study examines their role in the lifetime frequency and variety of NSSI methods, taken as indicators of severity of NSSI. We hypothesized that intrapersonal functions would explain frequency and variety of NSSI beyond the effects of interpersonal functions. Further we hypothesized that intrapersonal functions would moderate the effect of BPD characteristics on frequency of NSSI. College students (n=52) who endorsed at least one lifetime act of NSSI completed self-report measures and semi-structured interviews about NSSI behaviors, frequency, variety and functions, and BPD symptoms. Results supported the hypotheses that intrapersonal functions play a role in the lifetime frequency and variety of NSSI behaviors in addition to that of interpersonal functions, but did not support the role of intrapersonal functions as a moderator. Findings are discussed in terms of relative importance of all factors involved in explaining severity of NSSI, measured as lifetime frequency and variety. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Objectives Research largely supports the clinical effectiveness of low-intensity cognitive behavioural therapy (LICBT) for mild-to-moderate anxiety and depression, delivered by psychological well-being practitioners (PWPs). Knowledge regarding the predictors of treatment response, however, is relatively limited. The primary aim of this study was to model the heterogeneity in longitudinal changes in anxiety and depression throughout LICBT provided by PWPs in Northern Ireland (NI), and to explore associations between pre-treatment variables and differences in treatment response. Methods Growth mixture modelling (GMM) techniques were employed to examine changes in psychological status in clients (N = 253) over the first six sessions of treatment, to identify divergent early response trajectories. A series of pre-treatment variables were used to predict class membership using chi-square tests and binary logistic regression models. Results There was one class representing improvement and one representing no improvement for both anxiety and depression. Class membership was predictive of treatment outcome. Pre-treatment variables associated with less improvement included unemployment, risk of suicide, neglect of self or others, using medication, receiving previous or concurrent treatments, a longer duration of difficulties, and comorbidities. Conclusions Findings indicate most of the sample populated an 'improvers' class for both depression and anxiety. Pre-treatment variables identified as predictive of poor treatment response may need to be considered by practitioners in potential triage referral decision policies, supporting cost-effective and efficient services. Further research around predictors of clinical outcome is recommended. Practitioner points
   Most of the sample belonged to an 'improvers' class. Several pre-treatment variables predicted poor treatment response (unemployment, suicide risk, neglect, medication, previous or concurrent treatments, longer duration of difficulties, and comorbidities). Few studies have utilized GMM to determine predictors of outcome following LICBT Regarding pre-treatment variables, the possibility of self-report bias cannot be excluded. The time period was relatively short, although represented the optimum number of sessions recommended for LICBT. The lack of a control group and random allocation were the main limitations.

AB ObjectivesTo investigate the prevalence and associated psychosocial factors of occasional and repetitive direct self-injurious behavior (D-SIB), such as self-cutting, -burning, -biting, -hitting, and skin damage by other methods, in representative adolescent samples from 11 European countries.
   MethodsCross-sectional assessment of adolescents was performed within the European Union funded project, Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE), which was conducted in 11 European countries. The representative sample comprised 12,068 adolescents (F/M: 6,717/5,351; mean age: 14.90.89) recruited from randomly selected schools. Frequency of D-SIB was assessed by a modified 6-item questionnaire based on previously used versions of the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory (DSHI). In addition, a broad range of demographic, social, and psychological factors was assessed.
   ResultsOverall lifetime prevalence of D-SIB was 27.6%; 19.7% reported occasional D-SIB and 7.8% repetitive D-SIB. Lifetime prevalence ranged from 17.1% to 38.6% across countries. Estonia, France, Germany, and Israel had the highest lifetime rates of D-SIB, while students from Hungary, Ireland, and Italy reported low rates. Suicidality as well as anxiety and depressive symptoms had the highest odds ratios for both occasional and repetitive D-SIB. There was a strong association of D-SIB with both psychopathology and risk-behaviors, including family related neglect and peer-related rejection/victimization. Associations between psychosocial variables and D-SIB were strongly influenced by both gender and country. Only a minor proportion of the adolescents who reported D-SIB ever received medical treatment.
   ConclusionThese results suggest high lifetime prevalence of D-SIB in European adolescents. Prevalence as well as psychosocial correlates seems to be significantly influenced by both gender and country. These results support the need for a multidimensional approach to better understand the development of SIB and facilitate culturally adapted prevention/intervention.

AB Background: There is a dearth of studies describing clinical characteristics and outcome of patients who present with mood disorders related to economic recession.
   Aims: To describe a cohort of patients admitted with first-episode depression related to the Irish economic recession and compare this cohort with all other first-episode depressives admitted during the same time period (2009-2010).
   Methods: A cohort of 137 patients admitted with first-episode depression to an independent university teaching hospital was prospectively identified and followed up from admission over 2 years (mean follow-up 430 days, s.d. 176 days). The cohort was divided into "Celtic Tiger" (patients with first-episode depression secondary to the economic recession) and non-Celtic Tiger control patients (other first-episode depressed patients). Both groups were compared in terms of clinical characteristics at baseline and outcome over follow-up.
   Results: The number of admissions clue to first depressive episodes were higher in recession years 2009/10 than in pre-recession years 2008/9. Celtic Tiger patients were predominantly male and more severely depressed with more marked suicidal ideation (x(2), p<0.001) than control patients. They were more likely to recover (x(2), p=0.013), less likely to recur (x(2), p<0.001) and had faster time to recovery (log rank, p<0.001) and slower time to full recurrence (log rank, p=0.001). The Celtic Tiger patients spent more time asymptomatic and less time at full and subthreshold depression levels over follow-up.
   Limitations: Study setting of centre specializing in affective disorders treatment, retrospective nature of follow-up after initial prospective interview and lack of patient follow-up interview.
   Conclusion: The study describes a subgroup of patients with severe depression associated with economic recession with likely high suicide risk but very favourable outcome. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The association between lifetime anxiety disorders, conduct disorder (CD), and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) among adults in the community was explored. Data were drawn from the National Comorbidity Survey (n=5,877), a representative community sample of adults aged 15-54 in the 48 contiguous US states. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association between anxiety disorders, CD and ASPD, and between the co-occurrence of anxiety disorders and ASPD in the likelihood of comorbid substance use and affective disorders, suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempt (SA). Out of the 3.3% of adults with ASPD, over half (54.33%) had a comorbid anxiety disorder (lifetime). Similarly, 42.31% of adults with a history of CD (9.4%) who did not meet criteria for ASPD, had a lifetime anxiety disorder. Social phobia [OR=1.65 (1.01, 2.7)] and post-traumatic stress disorder [OR=2.28 (1.3, 4.0)] were associated with significantly increased odds of ASPD, after adjusting for differences in sociodemographic characteristics and other psychiatric comorbidity. Major depression was no longer significantly associated with ASPD after adjusting for anxiety disorders. The comorbidity of anxiety disorders and ASPD was associated with significantly higher odds of major depression, substance use disorders, and SI and SA compared with odds among those without both disorders. These data provide initial evidence of an association between PTSD and social phobia and an increased likelihood of ASPD among adults in the community, after adjustment for comorbid affective and substance use disorders. Adults with ASPD and comorbid anxiety had significantly higher levels of comorbid major depression, alcohol dependence, and substance dependence and substantially higher rates of lifetime suicidal ideation and suicide attempts compared to adults with ASPD or anxiety disorders alone or with neither disorder. Future studies are needed to replicate this finding using longitudinal data and to investigate the possible mechanisms of the observed links between anxiety disorders and ASPD.

AB Background: Most of the research conducted on people who harm themselves has been undertaken in secondary healthcare settings. Little is known about the frequency of self-harm in primary care patient populations. This is the first study to describe the epidemiology of self-harm presentations to primary care using broadly representative national data from across the United Kingdom (UK).
   Methods: Using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), we calculated directly standardised rates of incidence and annual presentation during 2001-2013. Rates were compared by gender and age and across the nations of the UK, and also by degree of socioeconomic deprivation measured ecologically at general practice level.
   Results: We found significantly elevated rates in females vs. males for incidence (rate ratio -RR, 1.45, 95 % confidence interval -CI, 1.42-1.47) and for annual presentation (RR 1.56, CI 1.54-1.58). An increasing trend over time in incidence was apparent for males (P < 0.001) but not females (P = 0.08), and both genders exhibited rising temporal trends in presentation rates (P < 0.001). We observed a decreasing gradient of risk with increasing age and markedly elevated risk for females in the youngest age group (aged 15-24 years vs. all other females: RR 3.75, CI 3.67-3.83). Increasing presentation rates over time were observed for males across all age bands (P < 0.001). We found higher rates when comparing Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales with England, and increasing rates of presentation over time for all four nations. We also observed higher rates with increasing levels of deprivation - most vs. least deprived male patients: RR 2.17, CI 2.10-2.25.
   Conclusions: Incorporating data from primary care yields a more comprehensive quantification of the health burden of self-harm. These novel findings may be useful in informing public health programmes and the targeting of high-risk groups toward the ultimate goal of lowering risk of self-harm repetition and premature death in this population.

AB The aim of this study was to analyze data from toxic substance-related cases in Northeast China (Heilongjiang Province) reported between 2000 and 2010, and to investigate the associations among the classes of toxic substances detected with gender, age, season, district of occurrence, and type of case. Pesticides, drugs, and alcohol were detected using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or flame ionization detection. Carbon monoxide levels were measured using ultraviolet spectrometry, and levels of cyanides, nitrites, and acid were monitored using the chemical colorimetry method. Among a total of 565 cases, 208 (36.8%) were related to accidental injury/death, 175 (31.0%) to suicide, 80 (14.2%) to homicide, 43 (7.6%) to robbery, 29 (5.1%) to fire or arson, 20 (3.5%) to intentional injury/death, 7 (1.2%) to rape, and 3 (0.5%) to kidnapping. Men constituted 65.3% of the total 565 victims, most of who were between the ages of 31 and 50 years, with the average age being 44 years. The highest number of cases (126) was reported from Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang Province. Pesticide-related cases accounted for 37.9% of the cases, with more cases occurring between April and August. Methomyl (48 cases) and fluoroacetamide (38 cases) were the most common pesticides involved in these cases. Drug-related cases accounted for 19.5% of the total poisoning cases, with benzodiazepines being the most commonly detected drugs (45 cases). More than 70% of alcohol-related cases involved the use of alcohol in crime (or affair) execution, with the blood alcohol concentration being less than 350 mg/100 mL in these cases. Carbon monoxide was detected in 16.1% of the cases, with a higher yearly incidence noted in winter. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide an overall analysis of toxic substance-related cases in Northeast China. Similar to the findings observed in Central China (Hubei), our findings indicated that pesticides were the major cause of poisoning in the Heilongjiang Province of Northeast China.

AB Prefrontal hypoperfusion and decreased glucose uptake in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are found in violent criminal offenders, murderers and aggressive psychiatric patients. These abnormalities may be independent of diagnosis and associated with impulsive-aggression as a personality trait. Impulsive-aggression is a clinical characteristic of borderline personality disorder (BPD) where it is associated with assaultive and suicidal behaviors. We conducted FDG-PET studies in 13 non-depressed, impulsive female subjects with BPD and 9 healthy controls to look for abnormalities in glucose metabolism in areas of the PFC associated with regulation of impulsive behavior. Statistical Parametric Mapping-99 (SPM99) was used to analyze the PET data with Hamilton depression scores as covariate. Significant reductions in FDG uptake in BPD subjects relative to healthy controls were found bilaterally in medial orbital frontal cortex, including Brodmann's areas 9, 10 and 11. There were no significant areas of increased uptake in BPD subjects compared to control subjects. Covarying for measures of impulsivity or impulsive-aggression rendered insignificant the differences between groups. Decreased glucose uptake in medial orbital frontal cortex may be associated with diminished regulation of impulsive behavior in BPD. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The number of empty-nest elderly is on the rise, especially in rural areas of China. The empty-nest elderly were concerned from social and demographic perspective, but researches on mental health issues of the aged were still rare in China. To clarify the prevalence of depression among empty-nest elderly in a rural area of YongZhou, Hunan and evaluate the impact of social support, coping style and socio-demographic factors on depression of the empty-nest elderly, with the goal of decreasing the rate of depression in empty-nest elderly, a questionnaire survey was conducted on 415 elderly persons. The determined prevalence of depressive symptoms was 74.46%. The empty-nest group, in comparison with the non-empty nest group, had higher levels of depression. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed associations between depressive symptoms and negative coping style, support utilization, religious beliefs, economic status, marital status and subjective support. The results suggested that the strategy to alleviate the depression in empty-nest elderly can be considered by the society, village committee, the family members and the empty-nest elderly subjects themselves, which could control effectively the incidence of depression.

AB Hair samples of patients of psychiatry and hair samples of suicide cases were analysed by liquid-chromatography/ionspray-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) for antidepressants and neuroleptics. Electrospray ionisation (ESI) with in-source collision induced dissociation (ESI/CID) and tandem-mass spectrometry (MS/MS) were used for drug and metabolite identification. Mass spectra library searching was performed using an ESI/CID mass spectra library and a MS/MS spectra library. Furthermore, extracted ion chromatograms were used for the detection of N-desmethyl-metabolites, which were also identified by their fragment-ion spectra. Three examples using these methods are shown: The tricyclic antidepressant maprotiline, the selective serotonin receptor inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram and their desmethylmetabolites as well as the neuroleptic pipamperone were detected and identified in hair extracts. For extraction powdered hair was treated by ultrasonication in methanol and solid-phase extraction was used for sample clean-up prior to LC/MS or MS/MS analysis. These examples demonstrate the power of LC/MS and LC/MS/MS for the detection and identification of drugs in hair extracts using full-scan mode and ESI/CID with library searchings or using highly selective LC/MS/MS-analysis with library searching or in multiple reaction monitoring mode.

AB Although many cases of fatal hydrogen sulfide poisoning have been reported, in most of these cases, it resulted from the accidental inhalation of hydrogen sulfide gas. In recent years, we experienced 17 autopsy cases of fatal hydrogen sulfide poisoning due to the inhalation of intentionally generated hydrogen sulfide gas. In this study, the concentrations of sulfide and thiosulfate in blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid and pleural effusion were examined using GC/MS. The sulfide concentrations were blood: 0.11-31.84, urine: 0.01-1.28, cerebrospinal fluid: 0.02-1.59 and pleural effusion: 2.00-8.59 (mu g/ml), while the thiosulfate concentrations were blood: 0-0.648, urine: 0-2.669, cerebrospinal fluid: 0.004-0.314 and pleural effusion: 0.019-0.140 (mu mol/ml). In previous reports, the blood concentration of thiosulfate was said to be higher than that of sulfide in hydrogen sulfide poisoning cases, although the latter was higher than the former in 8 of the 14 cases examined in this study. These results are believed to be strongly influenced by the atmospheric concentration of hydrogen sulfide the victims were exposed to and the time interval between exposure and death.

AB Antidepressants are highly prescribed in youth although most products have not been approved for use in this population. Furthermore, regulatory warnings have led to changes in antidepressant use that might have differed across various countries. Our study aimed at determining factors associated with antidepressant prescribing practices and at assessing trends in use from 1997 to 2005 in Quebec youth. A retrospective cohort study was conducted through claims databases of the Quebec public health care program (RAMQ). The study included 5094 children (age 2-14) and 11,121 adolescents (age 15-19) who were incident users of antidepressant between 1997 and 2005. The characteristics of users and prescribers were the main independent variables.Tricyclics were the most frequently dispensed products among children (50.9%) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors among adolescents (58.8%). Selection of an antidepressant class was associated with patient characteristics and with prescriber specialty. The number of antidepressant users increased from 1997 until 2001 then decreased thereafter.The selection of an antidepressant class was associated with clinical and non-clinical characteristics. Although antidepressant use decreased after regulatory warnings, there appears to be a care gap between the evidence generated by efficacy studies and the products prescribed in a real-life setting.

AB Cell proliferation, cell injury and aging are connected with changes in the cell membrane structure. Apparently these changes activate, in mammalian as well as in plant cells, lipases which liberate polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). PUFAs are the substrates for lipoxygenases which convert them to corresponding hydroperoxides (LOOHs). Lipoxygenases commit suicide by releasing iron ions. LOOHs react with iron ions to generate radicals. Thus, a nonenzymic lipid peroxidation process (LPO) is induced. It is speculated that the change from enzymic to nonenzymic LPO is connected with the switch from apoptosis to necrosis and that LOOHs produced in enzymic reactions are degraded specifically to signal compounds which induce physiological responses, while nonenzymic reactions seem to induce generation of reactive oxygen species, cell death and age related diseases. Enzymic and nonenzymic LPO processes concern all PUFAs not only arachidonic acid. The main PUFA in mammals is linoleic acid. Since these products serve signalling functions, different degradation paths of linoleic-hydroperoxides are described in detail and the physiological properties of LPO products are discussed in relation to aging and age related diseases.

AB Aims Paracetamol-containing combination analgesics are widely prescribed but the use of paracetamol/dextropropoxyphene (co-proxamol) is particularly controversial. We aim to examine the prescribing patterns of the paracetamol-containing analgesics in Ireland.
   Methods A national primary care prescribing database was used to investigate patterns of usage. Twenty-six thousand three hundred and eighteen patients who were new to therapy with paracetamol and paracetamol-containing analgesics between January and June 2002 were identified as follows: no previous analgesic medication in the 6 months prior to enrolment into the study, and followed up for at least 12 months from the time of enrolment. Duration of therapy and the number of prescriptions received post enrolment were analyzed according to age. Odds ratios for receiving long-term (> 1 month) compared with short-term (1 month) prescriptions for co-proxamol, paracetamol only or a paracetamol combination-type analgesic were calculated for women vs. men, and in those aged over 65 vs. those aged under 65 years.
   Results Co-proxamol was the most commonly prescribed analgesic, accounting for 42% of all prescriptions dispensed during 2003. Long-term use of paracetamol-containing analgesic preparations was uncommon, with 56.7% receiving only 1 month's prescription during the study period. However, women (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.07, 1.28, P < 0.0001) and those over 65 years (OR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.57, 1.86, P < 0.0001) were more likely to receive a follow-up prescription for co-proxamol, but also for paracetamol (women, OR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.16, 1.39; over 65 year olds, OR = 2.67, 95%CI 2.44, 2.93) and the paracetamol combinations (women, OR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.20, 1.47; over 65 year olds, OR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.53, 1.87).
   Conclusions Co-proxamol was the most commonly prescribed paracetamol-containing analgesic preparation in Ireland. The results may indicate inappropriate use in primary care.

AB This paper considers the educational implications of the recent emphasis on the mental health and well-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning/queer (LGBTQ) people in Ireland. Operating from the perspective that discourses constitute rather than merely reflect material reality, thereby shaping or structuring' how we think about, and act, in relation to queer experience, the paper critically engages with discourses which position LGBTQ youth as universally at risk of mental health difficulties, including self-harm and suicidality. It also challenges the corresponding preoccupation with homophobic bullying as the primary lens through which queer experience is understood and addressed in schools, arguing that more space needs to be devoted to other, less harrowing narratives of LGBTQ experience and identity. It highlights some of the more problematic effects of LGBTQ mental health research which frame LGBTQ experience primarily in terms of vulnerability and victimhood and makes the case for a more expansive engagement with LGBTQ identities. The article illuminates the potential that after-queer scholarship holds for a re-imagining of queer youth, sexuality and gender within educational and social research, curriculum materials and educational institutions more generally and concludes with a consideration of specific knowledge and skills that educators should be equipped with in order to disrupt normative understandings of gender and sexuality.

AB The aim of this study was to identify predictors of (1) short-term outcome and (2) short-term compliance with treatment (for non-hospitalized patients) in psychiatric emergency patients. Subjects comprised 457 patients referred to the emergency ward of a French general hospital and requiring examination by a psychiatrist. Clinical and therapeutic assessments were carried out at baseline, using DSM-IV diagnoses and overall psychopathological scoring scales [Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Symptom Checklist-90 Revised]. Clinical outcome and compliance were assessed 3 weeks after entry. For each of the two issues assessed, stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed following univariate comparisons. The three best predictors of deterioration at 3 weeks were lack of compliance to treatment, presence of a previous psychiatric history, and a low BPRS hebephrenic factor score. The best predictors of compliance in non-hospitalized patients were a previous psychiatric history, marital status, a low BPRS hostility factor score, and older age. The main predictor of deterioration was non-compliance. Thus, we emphasize the importance of improving compliance, especially among young patients with no previous psychiatric history.

AB Modern imaging technologies, such as computed tomography (CT) techniques, represent a great challenge in forensic pathology. The field of forensics has experienced a rapid increase in the use of these new techniques to support investigations on critical cases, as indicated by the implementation of CT scanning by different forensic institutions worldwide. Advances in CT imaging techniques over the past few decades have finally led some authors to propose that virtual autopsy, a radiological method applied to post-mortem analysis, is a reliable alternative to traditional autopsy, at least in certain cases. The authors investigate the occurrence and the causes of errors and mistakes in diagnostic imaging applied to virtual autopsy. A case of suicide by a gunshot wound was submitted to full-body CT scanning before autopsy. We compared the first examination of sectional images with the autopsy findings and found a preliminary misdiagnosis in detecting a peritoneal lesion by gunshot wound that was due to radiologist's error. Then we discuss a new emerging issue related to the risk of diagnostic failure in virtual autopsy due to radiologist's error that is similar to what occurs in clinical radiology practice.

AB Schizophrenia is a major cause of psychiatric disability in China. In the present study, we estimated total and age-specific prevalence of both schizophrenia disability and associated mortality among Chinese women and men. We further examined whether sex differences in prevalence were attributable to mortality differences between men and women. Data from the Second China National Sample Survey on Disability (2006) and the 2007-2010 follow-up studies were utilized. Possibly psychiatrically disabled individuals were administered the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule, Version II and the ICD-10 Symptom Checklist for Mental Disorders by trained clinical psychiatrists. In total, 0.37% of men and 0.44% of women were living with schizophrenia disability in China. We did not find statistically significant differences in the 4-year cumulative mortality between men and women. Overall standardized mortality ratios for the age groups of 18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, and 70+ years were 120.89, 29.56, 15.06, 9.16, 10.57, and 4.95, respectively. In conclusion, mortality differences between men and women were unlikely to be a major contributor to sex differences in prevalence. Premature death among younger individuals experiencing schizophrenia disability warrants urgent attention. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Medical utilization due to organic sleep disorders has increased remarkably in South Korea, which may contribute to the deterioration of mental health in the population. We analyzed the relationship between organic sleep disorders and risk of hospitalization due to mood disorder. We used data from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) National Sample Cohort 2002-2013, which included medical claims filed for the 15,537 patients who were newly diagnosed with a mood disorder in a metropolitan region, and employed Poisson regression analysis using generalized estimating equation (GEE) models. By the results, there was a 0.53% hospital admission rate among 244,257 patients with outpatient care visits. Patients previously diagnosed with an organic sleep disorder before specific outpatient care had a higher risk for hospitalization. Such associations were significant in females, patients with a longer duration of disease, or those who lived in the largest cities. In conclusion, considering that experiencing a sleep disorder by a patient with an existing mood disorder was associated with deterioration of their status, health policy makers need to consider insurance coverage for all types of sleep disorders in patients with psychological conditions.

AB Blood-cerebrospinal barrier (BCB) dysfunction has previously been shown in subjects with schizophrenia and depressed patients with attempted suicide. Bipolar disorder (BPD) shares clinical features with both these disorders, but it is unknown if the integrity of the BCB is altered also in BPD. To assess if BCB function in BPD we surveyed 134 mood-stabilized BPD patients and 86 healthy controls. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected and analyzed for albumin concentration by immunonephelometry. CSF/serum albumin ratio, an established measure of BCB function, was significantly elevated in BPD patients as compared to controls. After stratifying patients according to diagnostic subtype, BPD I patients had the highest CSF/serum albumin ratios. Moreover, BPD patients on antipsychotic treatment had higher CSF/serum albumin ratio than BPD patients on other treatments. When excluding BPD patients on antipsychotic treatment the difference in CSF/serum albumin ratio between the BPD and control groups disappeared. In conclusion, antipsychotic treatment in BPD is associated with elevated CSF/serum albumin ratio, tentatively as a sign of impaired BCB function. Whether this elevation is caused by antipsychotic treatment or is associated with a certain subtype of BPD, requiring antipsychotic treatment, remains to be determined.

AB South Korea has the highest suicide rate among countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), with a rising trend that contrasts with the trend in most other OECD countries. This study assessed differential associations of socio-demographic factors with suicidal ideation in South Korea. We used five waves of data from the 2010 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Study subjects included 5803 men and women aged >25 years. We analysed weighted percentages with consideration of the complex survey sample design and unequal weights. Surveylogistic regressions were applied. Protective effects against suicidal ideation were found for higher household income, higher educational attainment, and being married. Functional limitations and depressive symptoms were risk factors for suicidal ideation. However, these significant factors may exert different effects on vulnerability for suicidal ideation among different genders and age groups. Thus, household income was mainly protective for women and subjects aged 25-44 years, and educational attainment was protective for individuals aged > 65 years. Our findings suggest the need for extended social protection policies for the less privileged population and special strategies for different groups. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Studies have linked bulimia nervosa (BN) to alterations in brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine: 5-HT) activity and to heightened propensity for parasuicidality and self-injuriousness. The coincidence of self-destructiveness and 5-HT abnormality in BN is of interest, given documentation (in various populations) of an inverse association between 5-HT activity and potential for self-harm. The present study examined the connection between 5-HT status and self-destructiveness in BN. Structured interviews and self-report questionnaires were used to assess 40 bulimic and 21 normal-cater women for: (a) history of parasuicidal or self-injurious acts; and (b) mood and impulse-regulation problems. We then applied tests, presumed to reflect 5-HT function, of serial prolactin (PRO and cortisol (CORT) responses after oral administration of the partial 5-HT agonist., meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP). Relative to non-bulimic women, bulimic women (on average) showed blunting of PRL and CORT following m-CPP. The blunting of neuroendocrine responses was, however, most remark-able in bulimic women with a history of self-destructiveness, These findings suggest that some serotonergic anomalies reported in BN sufferers (i.e. reduced neuroendocrine response after in-UP) may be most characteristic of individuals in the population showing clear-cut self-destructive potential.

AB While perceived support from caregivers in the early stages of life is an aspect of family environment that is increasingly recognized as important for understanding lifetime suicidal behaviors, it is not well understood whether the relationship between perceived support from caregivers during childhood and lifetime suicidal behaviors holds regardless of family structure. This study examined the association between perceived love from caregivers in childhood and lifetime suicidal ideation in the National Co morbidity Survey Replication (N=5,692, 2001-2003). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the association between lifetime suicidal ideation and retrospectively ascertained data on perceived love from caregivers during childhood as well as clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of study participants. Regression analyses were stratified by family structure, namely, whether or not study participants lived with two biological parents during childhood. Regardless of whether or not they lived with two biological parents during childhood, individuals who perceived love from caregivers during childhood had significantly 42-43% lower odds of lifetime suicide ideation as compared with those who did not perceive love from caregivers. Results suggest that perceived support from caregivers during childhood is an important correlate of lifetime suicidal ideation, regardless of family structure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of atypical and non-atypical depression comorbidity on the clinical characteristics and course of social anxiety disorder (SAD). A total of 247 patients with SAD were enrolled: 145 patients with a current depressive episode (unipolar or bipolar) with atypical features, 43 patients with a current depressive episode with non-atypical features and 25 patients without a lifetime history of depressive episodes were compared regarding sociodemographic and clinical features, comorbidity rates, and severity of SAD, depression and functional impairment. Thirty four patients with a past but not current history of major depressive episodes were excluded from the comparisons. 77.1% of current depressive episodes were associated with atypical features. Age at onset of SAD and age at initial major depressive episode were lower in the group with atypical depression than in the group with non-atypical depression. History of suicide attempts and bipolar disorder comorbidity was more common in the atypical depression group as well. Atypical depression group has higher SAD and depression severity and lower functionality than group with non-atypical depression. Our results indicate that the presence of atypical depression is associated with more severe symptoms and more impairment in functioning in patients with SAD. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB This study examined compulsive sexual behavior (CSB) and psychopathology in a treatment-seeking sample of men in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Eighty-six men (26% gay, 17% bisexual, 57% heterosexual) who met diagnostic criteria for excessive sexual drive and sexual addiction completed assessments consisting of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, a structured clinical interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders Clinical Version (segment for Impulse Control Disorder), Sexual Compulsivity Scale (SCS), and questions about problematic CSB. The average SCS score for our sample was above the cut-off score reported in other studies, and 72% of the sample presented at least one Axis I psychiatric diagnosis. There were no differences among gay, bisexual, and heterosexual men on SCS scores and psychiatric conditions, but gay and bisexual men were more likely than heterosexual men to report casual sex and sex with multiple casual partners as problematic behaviors. SCS scores were associated with psychiatric co-morbidities, mood disorder, and suicide risk, but diagnosis of a mood disorder predicted higher SCS scores in a regression analysis. The study provides important data on the mental health needs of men with CSB in Sao Paulo, Brazil. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the Oslo and Copenhagen capital areas, 141 homicides by sharp force were committed in the ten-year period 1985-1994. This method accounted for 33% of the homicides in this period. Thirty-five percent of the victims were female, and most of the victims were between 20 and 50 years of age. The majority of the male victims were killed by an acquaintance, the females by their spouse. Sixty-five percent of the male and 37% of the female victims had alcohol in their blood. The majority of the female victims had lesions in 3-4 anatomical regions, while the males most often had lesions in only one anatomical region. Seventy-nine percent of the females and 36% of the males had self-defence injuries in the upper extremities. In 21 cases (15%) the offender was a woman, 19 of their victims being male; the weapon in these cases was most often a kitchen knife. Seventy-eight percent of the females and 49% of the males were killed in their own home. The most common circumstance was family row when the victim was female, while a fight was the most common circumstance when the victim was male. Three offenders committed suicide after having committed homicide(s) (seven victims; three offenders). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined the relationship between cholesterol levels and impulsivity in a large sample of patients with mood symptoms. Three hundred and one patients with mood, anxiety, and personality disorders completed a battery of psychometric scales including the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-Version 11 (BIS-11) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). On the same day of psychometric assessment, blood samples were analyzed for total cholesterol (TC) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Statistical analysis controlling for the confounding effects of age, gender, diagnosis, and current mood symptoms showed that lower TC levels were associated with increased attentional impulsivity. There was a weak linear correlation between TC and attentional impulsivity across the entire range of TC levels (110-295 mg/dL) but a highly significant difference between participants with TC levels lower than 165 mg/dL and the rest of the sample. The current study adds to the growing body of evidence pointing to the association between serum cholesterol and mental health. Considering that attentional impulsivity is a demonstrated risk factor for suicide, patients presenting with low cholesterol and mood symptoms may warrant increased clinical attention and surveillance.

AB Juvenile offenders are particularly at risk for HIV because of their substantially high rates of risk behaviors, high rates of substance use disorders and psychopathology. Most studies have focused on risk behaviors among incarcerated youth. This study sought to determine if an arrest history could serve as a marker for HIV risk and substance abuse among a community-based sample of high-risk adolescents and young adults. Adolescents (N = 1400; mean age = IS years) who participated in a larger multi-site HIV prevention program in three states (GA, FL and RI) provided baseline data on sexual risk, substance use, attitudes and mental health history. Participants were grouped as arrestees (N = 404) and non-arrestees (N = 996) based on self-reported arrest history. Juvenile arrestees reported more alcohol and drug use, substance use during sex, unprotected sex acts, STI diagnoses, suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations than non-arrestees. Having an arrest history may serve as a marker for adolescent HIV risk and substance abuse. Effectively screening adolescents for legal history and responding to the psychosocial and health needs of these high-risk adolescents could increase necessary engagement in substance use and mental health treatment, reduce HIV risk in the community, and reduce costs to the legal, medical and mental health systems.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate all child homicides for the 25-year period, 1970-1994 in Finland and to analyse the specific characteristics of the filicide cases. A total of 292 child homicides occurred during this period. In 201 (69%) cases the offender was a parent or a stepparent of the child. Altogether, 173 (59%) of the victims were boys and 119 (41%) were girls. For the closer examination of the filicide cases we excluded the neonaticide and homicide-suicide cases. Consequently. we report on 70 filicide victims. Of these victims, 42 (60%) were boys and 28 (40%) were girls. Twenty six (37%) of the children were killed before the age of 1 year and 53 (79%) before the age of 5 years. The offender was the mother in 43 (61%) cases and the father or the stepfather in 26 (37%) cases. The victims of the mothers were younger than those of the fathers. The most frequent causes of death were head injuries, drowning and suffocation. The most common means of assault were battering, drowning and strangulation. One in two of the Fatally battered children had a documented history of previous abuse. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Perinatal opioid exposure has a negative effect on neurogenesis and produces neurological consequences. However, its mechanisms of action are incompletely understood. Buprenorphine, a mixed opioid agonist/antagonist, is an alternative medication for managing pregnant opioid addicts. This study provides evidence of decreased neurogenesis and depression-like consequences following prenatal exposure to buprenorphine and sheds light on mechanisms of action in a rat model involving administration of intraperitoneal injection to pregnant rats starting from gestation day 7 and lasting for 14 days and a cultured neurosphere model. Results of forced swimming test and tail suspension test showed that pups at postnatal day 21 had worse parameters of depression-like neurobehaviors, independent of gender. Neurobehavioral changes were accompanied by reduction of neuronal composition, biochemical parameters of neural stem/progenitor cells, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, tropomyosin-related kinase receptor type B phosphorylation, protein kinase A (PKA) activity, and cAMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation. Results of parallel cell studies further demonstrated a negative impact of buprenorphine on cultured neurospheres, including proliferation, differentiation, BDNF expression and signaling, and PKA activity. Taken together, our results suggest that prenatal exposure to buprenorphine might result in depression-like phenotypes associated with impaired BDNF action and decreased neurogenesis in the developing brain of weanlings.

AB Heightened emotional reactivity is one of the core features of borderline personality disorder (BPD). However, recent findings could not provide evidence for a general emotional hyper-reactivity in BPD. The present study examines the emotional responding to self-relevant pictures in dependency of the thematic category (e.g., trauma, interpersonal interaction) in patients with BPD. Therefore, women with BPD (n=31), women with major depression disorder (n=29) and female healthy controls (n=33) rated pictures allocated to thematically different categories (violence, sexual abuse, interaction, non-suicidal self-injury, and suicide) regarding self-relevance, arousal, valence and the urge of non-suicidal self-injury. Compared to both control groups, patients with BPD reported higher self-relevance regarding all categories, but significantly higher emotional ratings only for pictures showing sexual abuse and interpersonal themes. In addition, patients with BPD and comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder showed higher emotional reactivity in violence pictures. Our data provide clear evidence that patients with BPD show a specific emotional hyper-reactivity with respect to schema-related triggers like trauma and interpersonal situations. Future studies are needed to investigate physiological responses to these self-relevant themes in patients with BPD. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Kai-Xin-San, an ancient formula composed of Ginseng Radix et Rhizo-.ma, Polygalae Radix, Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma and Poria, was frequently applied for major depression disorders for thousands of years. However, its molecular mechanism has not clearly been investigated.
   Aim of the study: We aimed to reveal the action mechanism of KXS on anti-depression on inducing neuronal differentiation on PC12 cells.
   Materials and methods: A chemically standardized water extract of IOCS was applied onto cultured PC12 cells in determining its effect on neurotransmitter regulation enzymes and neurite outgrowth.
   Results: Single KXS treatment showed obvious changes in the expression of neurofilament and neurotransmitter regulation enzymes, which in parallel to treatment of nerve growth factor (NGF). Although KXS by itself did not show significant inductive effect on neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells, KXS could potentiate the NGF induced neurite outgrowth. Among the three ratios, K-652 showed the most powerful effect and cAMP-dependent pathway might play the major role.
   Conclusions: IOCS might exert the anti-depressant-like action of be inducing neuronal differentiation, which supported the clinically usage of this decoction. (C ) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Backgrounds: Although hanging injury is infrequent, its clinical course is usually devastating. Hanging patients usually need cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). However, hanging-associated cardiovascular damage has not been fully established. The aim of this study was to evaluate echocardiographic findings in patients with hanging injury.
   Methods: We enrolled 25 patients (nine males and 16 females with mean age of 33 +/- 15 years) with hanging injury. Echocardiography was performed within 2 weeks after admission. Clinical, demographic, and laboratory data as well as transthoracic echocardiographic findings were analyzed.
   Results: Of the 25 patients, eight (two males and six females with mean age of 34 +/- 13 years) showed left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). Mean LV ejection fraction was 34 +/- 16%. Global hypokinesia was present in one patient. Apical ballooning with sparing of the basal segment was present in two patients. Basal akinesia and apical hyperkinesia were present in one patient. Four patients showed regional wall motion abnormalities unmatched with coronary territories. The duration of suspension or CPR was not significantly different according to the presence of LVSD.
   Conclusion: This study showed the echocardiographic findings in considerable numbers of patients with hanging injury for the first time. Variable patterns of LVSD were present in patients with hanging injury. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the prevalence of intermittent explosive disorder (IED) as well as its comorbidity with other mental disorders in a Japanese community sample. Subjects were 4,134 residents in selected sites in Japan. Diagnoses of mental disorders are based on the World Mental Health Survey Initiative Version of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Lifetime and 12-month prevalence of IED were 2.1% and 0.7%, respectively, whereas those of narrow IED were 1.2% and 0.6%, respectively. Male gender and young age were positively associated with an increased prevalence of IED. Mood and anxiety disorders as well as suicidal ideation were shown to be associated with IED in both genders. The overall association between anxiety disorders and IED was stronger in women than in men. Positive association of substance use problems with IED was also observed. Similar findings were observed between those psychosocial factors and narrow IED. These results suggest that people having those mixed complications might have a high suicidal risk. Further research using psychological measures for anger suppression will lead to more thorough understanding of the effects of IED on psychosocial comorbidity and suicidal risk.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between social anxiety and dissociation among male patients with alcohol dependency. Participants were 176 male patients consecutively admitted to an alcohol dependency treatment unit. The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Spielberger State and Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test, and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised were administered to all participants. The dissociative (N=58, 33.0%) group had significantly higher social anxiety scores than the non-dissociativc participants. Patients with a history of suicide attempt or childhood abuse had elevated social anxiety scores compared to those without. In multivariate analysis, dissociative taxon membership predicted both of the two social anxiety subscale scores consisting of fear/anxiety and avoidance in a highly significant level while trait anxiety was a significant covariant for these subscales. Among dissociative symptoms, only depersonalization and amnesia/fugue were predictors of social anxiety. Dissociation and social anxiety are interrelated among alcohol-dependent men. This relationship may have implications for prevention and treatment of alcohol dependency among men with a childhood trauma history in particular. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study is to evaluate a possible relationship between the level of anticipated discrimination with severity of symptoms and functionality. We included 103 patients with schizophrenia. Severity of symptoms was measured by PANSS and Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia. Quality of life (QL) and functionality were measured by using QLS, PSP and Functional Remission of General Schizophrenia Scale (FROGS). Anticipated/experienced discrimination was evaluated with four selected items from Discrimination and Stigma Scale.
   First, variables related to each item were determined by using t-test and later the variables that have an independent contribution to anticipated discrimination subscale of DISC were evaluated with linear regression analysis. Results showed that those who stated that they felt the need to conceal their diagnosis more had shorter duration of illness, lower PANNS scores, higher scores on professional performance subscale of QLS, a lower number of suicide attempts and higher current employment rates. Participants who reported that they had been avoided or shunned more had higher depression scores. While patients with lower level of functionality tended to stop themselves more, patients with high level of functionality tended to conceal their diagnosis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB The objective of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the relationships of anger, self-esteem, and depression with suicidal ideation. A survey was conducted in a wide range of community areas across Jeollabuk-do Province, Korea. A total of 2964 subjects (mean age=44.4 yr) participated in this study. Hierarchical regression was used to investigate predictors of suicidal ideation in terms of their sociodemographic characteristics, depression, self-esteem, and anger. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that anger and self-esteem were significantly associated with suicidal ideation regardless of age and after controlling for depression. Moderation analysis showed that the impact of anger on suicidal ideation was significantly greater among females than males in adolescents, but not in other age groups. Additionally, there were some differences in sociodemographic predictors of suicidal ideation among age groups. Predictors included gender and family harmony in adolescents, marital status and family harmony in middle-aged individuals, and economic status and family harmony in elderly individuals. Our results revealed that anger and self-esteem play important roles in suicidal ideation beyond the effect of depression. Development and implementation of preventive strategies, including management of anger and self-esteem, could possibly reduce suicidal ideation and subsequent suicide attempts.

AB One of the most common psychiatric diagnoses among adolescents is anxiety disorder. Many of the anxiety symptoms are expressed physiologically, and therefore can mimic other medical conditions. The aim of this study was to examine the association between anxiety disorders and other medical conditions sharing common symptoms with anxiety (MDSCSA: Irritable Bowel Syndrome, asthma, migraine and hyperhidrosis). The study was based on the national database of the candidates for military service in Israel. Data for the years 1998-2013 was retrieved to create the study dataset. The final cohort population was comprised of 1,229,461 military service candidates. Anxiety prevalence and its association with other medical conditions sharing the same symptoms was examined in the cohort. The results showed significant statistical association between anxiety and IBS, asthma, migraine and hyperhidrosis. These findings support the fact that there is a clear association between anxiety disorder and the examined medical conditions. Moreover, in the military setting, the primary care physician has an important role in giving a correct diagnosis for soldiers presenting with symptoms that can be regarded both to anxiety and to other physical illnesses.

AB The aim of this study was to compare the immediate and long-term effect of a cognitive-behavior therapy program for anorexia nervosa inpatients with and without concomitant Major Depressive Episodes (MDE). The program has been adapted from the "enhanced" form of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) for eating disorders. Sixty-three consecutive underweight adult patients with severe eating disorder were treated with inpatient CBT. MDE was assessed with the structured clinical interview for DSM-IV. The Eating Disorder Examination, and the Brief Symptom Inventory were recorded at entry, at the end of treatment, and 6 and 12 months later. MDE was present in 60.3% of participants. No significant differences were observed in the demographic and baseline clinical variables between patients with and without MDE. Significant improvements in weight, and in eating disorder and general psychopathology were showed. There were no differences between participants with and without MDE in terms of treatment outcome, and the severity of depression was not associated with changes in global Eating Disorder Examination score. These findings suggest that a diagnosis of MDE does not influence the outcome of inpatient treatment for anorexia nervosa patients, and that the severity of depression cannot be used to predict the success or failure of such treatment.

AB Background/Objective: Depression is a common mental health disorder and an emerging public health concern. Few studies have investigated prevalence and predictors of depression severity in the Irish context. To investigate the relative contribution of known risk factors that predicts depression severity in a treatment-seeking sample of adults in Ireland. Method: As part of a randomised controlled trial of an internet-delivered intervention for depression participants (N = 641) completed online screening questionnaires including BDI-II and information associated with common predictors of depression. Results: The mean score on the BDI-II was 24.13 (SD=11.20). Several factors were shown to predict greater severity of depression in the sample including female gender, younger age, unemployment, being single or partnered as opposed to married, previous diagnosis of depression, recent experience of life stressors. Alcohol use, recent losses, knowing a suicide completer, education level, type of employment and income level were not found to be significant. Conclusions: The study contributes to the profiling of the incidence and predictors of severity of depression in an Irish context. The results confirm some of the known risk factors and highlight the need for further research to be carried out on screening for depression and increasing access to interventions.

AB In this study, we sought to clarify if and how the functions of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) relate to duration of NSSI or change over time. To accomplish this aim, we analyzed data obtained from routine clinical evaluations completed within a specialized acute-care treatment program for NSSI. Specifically, we examined how functions of NSSI vary between patients by duration of NSSI, how functions changed within patients over time, and how changes in NSSI functions related to treatment outcomes. Neither internal nor social functions were associated with NSSI duration between patients after controlling for relevant covariates. For patients completing two admissions assessments, internal and social functions decreased similarly over time, although the decrease in internal functions was no longer significant after controlling for decreases in NSSI urges. For patients who completed admissions and discharge assessments, internal and social functions decreased over the course of treatment, with larger decreases in internal functions. Decreases in both types of functions related to improved treatment outcomes. In conclusion, our results suggest that NSSI functions are generally stable across time, although decreases in NSSI functions may relate to clinical improvement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB This study examined the association between childhood trauma and clinical features, comorbid anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and suicidal and aggressive behaviors in Chinese patients with schizophrenia. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire - Short Form (CTQ-SF), the Impact of Events Scale - Revised (IES-R), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were administered to 182 Chinese inpatients with schizophrenia. The relationship between the severity and the number of traumic experiences and clinical features were analyzed. Physical neglect (PN) in childhood was reported in 71.7% of this sample, followed by emotional neglect (EN, 58.6%), sexual abuse (SA, 39.9%), emotional abuse (EA, 31.7%) and physical abuse (PA, 22.2%). Significant negative correlations existed between age of onset and the EA scores. Significant positive correlations were found between the subscores of IES-R, STAI and CTQ-SF. Patients with history of suicidal or aggressive behaviors had significantly higher trauma scores than patients without such behaviors. Exposure to childhood trauma is associated with early age of onset, more PTSD and anxiety symptoms, and history of suicidal and aggressive behaviors. A dose-effect may exist between severity, number of trauma experiences, and clinical features. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Overall, previous studies on the prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) behaviors in the general population have stressed the importance of differentiating between occasional and repetitive NSSI, examining different severity levels (e.g., frequency and variety of methods), as well as investigating the diverse psychopathological correlates of NSSI. However, existing NSSI measures have not been explicitly developed by to comply with the NSSI diagnostic criteria proposed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). The purpose of this study is to develop a measure of repetitive NSSI by considering its essential features, as described in the proposed DSM-5 as well as in other clinically relevant aspects emerging from case reports. Two independent samples of participants (N1=383 young adults and 251 adolescents; N2=953 adolescents) belonging to the general population were involved in the present study. The questionnaire showed satisfactory fit statistics and reliably discriminated between occasional and repetitive self-injurers (Area Under Curve, AUC=0.755). The pattern of correlations with psychopathological measures confirmed a more clinically-compromised profile for repetitive rather than occasional self-injurers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB This study examined the narratives of ten Caucasian mothers whose children had been impacted by 'traumatic' events and referred to a specialist trauma service in N. Ireland. The research question was whether the PTSD construct adequately represented the broad 'lived' experience of the impact of trauma on survivors' wellbeing and their family relationships as articulated by mothers post trauma. Narrative Interviewing methodology was employed and the resulting data inductively organised into an evolving thematic framework. A quantitative analysis of the prevalence of particular themes is presented supplemented by qualitative quotations to illustrate the complexity of reported impact. The major components of the mothers' narratives included family and relational distress (35.7%), non-pathological individual distress (24.4%), resilience (16.7%) and a prior history of adversity (16.6%). Prior history of adversity was resent in 8 out the 10 cases including a high level of suicide. PTSD symptomatology constituted a small proportion of the narratives (6.6%) and this suggests that the PTSD construct does not adequately represent the broad 'lived' experience of the impact of trauma. Although a small and heterogeneous study sample, the findings are sufficiently robust to suggest further investigation is required to understand the phenomenological experience of trauma of child victims/survivors and their families.
