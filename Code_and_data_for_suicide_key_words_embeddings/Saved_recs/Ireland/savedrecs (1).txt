AB Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyze the outcomes of patients with hanging-induced cardiac arrest who underwent therapeutic hypothermia (TH).
   Method: In this multicenter, retrospective registry-based study, discharged patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and treatment with TH were enrolled between June 2007 and March 2013. Several prehospital and hospital variables were examined for an outcome analysis with multivariable logistic regression.
   Results: A total of 964 patients who had cardiac arrest were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent TH during post-cardiac arrest care after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Of all patients, 105 were assigned to the hanging group and 859 to the non-hanging group. Six patients (6%) with good neurologic outcomes (Cerebral Performance Category 1 or 2) in the hanging group at the time of discharge were found. A shorter time interval between witnessed arrest and ROSC and a Glasgow Coma Scale over 4 after ROSC are statistically significant variables of good neurologic outcomes after hanging-induced cardiac arrest treated with TH.
   Conclusion: A small number of patients who underwent TH after a hanging-induced cardiac arrest provided good neurologic outcomes, and some variables influenced these outcomes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Previous studies have identified the relationship between parental loss and psychopathology later in life. However, this relationship varied depending on the kind of loss, the parent involved, and the type of psychopathology. In the present study, we examined the association between parental loss (any loss, death, and separation) during childhood and lifetime risk for seven common psychiatric and substance use disorders in a sample of 2605 male twins from the Virginia population-based twin registry. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we also examined the extent to which the influence of parental loss contributes to adult psychopathology. Parental separation was associated with a wide range of adult psychopathology, whereas parental death was specifically associated with phobia and alcohol dependence. Maternal and paternal separations were almost equally associated with most forms of psychopathology. SEM suggested that parental loss accounted for about 10% of the variance of adult psychopathology, of which parental separation had the strongest impacts on risk for depression and drug abuse/dependence (11% of the total variance). Our findings suggest that early parental separation has stronger and wider effects on adult psychopathology than parental death. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. It is not known whether depression in post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients is also serotonin-mediated. In somatically healthy depressed persons, increased brain 5-HT2A receptor binding has been reported in some studies. In animal studies, decreased serotonin activity was found after induction of MI. In the present study, it was hypothesized that depressed post-MI patients would exhibit increased brain 5-HT2A receptor binding compared with non-depressed post-MI patients. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with the radioligand I-123-5-I-R91150, a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, was used to study 5-HT2A receptor binding. SPECT scans were performed in nine depressed post-MI patients, 10 non-depressed post-MI patients and 10 healthy control subjects. Results were analysed using statistical parametric mapping. Depressed post-MI patients showed increased 5-HT2A receptor binding compared with non-depressed post-MI patients, and MI patients showed decreased 5-HT2A receptor binding compared with control persons. Both post-MI depression and MI seem to be associated with changes in 5-HT2A receptor binding. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dropout from anorexia nervosa inpatient treatment programs is frequent and is linked to a poorer outcome. This study aimed to identify predictive factors for dropout among anorexia nervosa inpatients. Between 1988 and 2004, 601 consecutive female inpatients with anorexia, restrictive (AN-R) or binge/purging (AN-B/P) subtype (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV)), were assessed at admission (clinical, socio-demographic, and psychological data). A stepwise logistic model was developed. Dropout rates were respectively 50.0% and 56.2% for AN-R and AN-B/P. Seven predictive factors were identified in multivariate analysis: having one or more children, low desired body mass index (BMI), a low minimum BMI, high scores on the SCL-90 paranoid ideation and the Morgan and Russell eating behavior subscales, and low educational status. Early dropouts had a particular profile: lower desired BMI, higher score on SCL90 paranoid subscale. and more impulsive behaviors (alcohol use, suicide attempts). Dropout appeared as a multifactorial event. In clinical practice, certain factors could serve as warning messages reflecting the severity of the illness (high EDI score and low minimum BMI); while others could be targeted before hospitalization (having at least one child and low desired BMI).

AB The aim of the study was to investigate the frequency and characteristics of suicidal behavior in a cohort of patients with acute transient psychotic disorder (ATPD), diagnosed according to ICD-10 (1723). In a longitudinal study, 42 patients fulfilling the ICD-10 criteria of ATPD were investigated in comparison to matched control groups with 'positive schizophrenia' (PS) and bipolar schizoaffective disorder (BSAD). Suicidal behavior was studied in the index episode and during the long-term course, including a 5-year prospective follow-up. The prevalence of suicidal behavior during the entire course of illness in ATPD was 35.7% compared to 57.1% in BSAD and 40.5% in PS. The difference was not significant when the duration of the illness was taken into account. Suicidal behavior in ATPD was associated with the acute episode, while in PS, suicidal behavior mainly occurred during the longitudinal course. In logistic regression models, suicidal behavior was associated with a higher educational level and lower conscientiousness in the NEO Five-Factor Inventory for patients with PS, but not ATPD. Suicidal behavior in ATPD is frequent, in particular during the acute episode. It seems to be associated with the dramatic psychotic symptomatology during the acute episode.

AB Targeted oncolytic vaccinia viruses are being developed as a novel strategy in cancer therapy. Arming vaccinia viruses with immunostimulatory cytokines can enhance antitumor efficacy. Such engineered oncolytic viruses, like JX-594, a Wyeth strain vaccinia virus modified with human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), have shown promising results and have proceeded rapidly in clinical trials. However, the oncolytic potential of the Chinese vaccine strain Tian Tan (VU) has not been explored. In this study, we constructed a targeted oncolytic vaccinia virus of Tian Tan strain Guang9 (VG9) expressing murine GM-CSF (VG9-GMCSF) and evaluated the antitumor effect of this recombinant vaccinia virus in a murine melanoma model. In vitro, viral replication and cytotoxicity of VG9-GMCSF was as potent as VG9; in vivo, VG9-GMCSF significantly inhibited the growth of subcutaneously implanted melanoma tumors, prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice, and produced an antitumor cytotoxic response. Such antitumor effect may be due to the lytic nature of virus as well as the stimulation of immune activity by GM-CSF production. Our results indicate that VG9-GMCSF induces strong tumoricidal activity, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for combating cancer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB \The primary objective was to assess whether prospectively observed quality of parent-child interaction in infancy and middle childhood contributed to the prediction of borderline symptoms and recurrent suicidality/self-injury in late adolescence. Adolescents (mean 19.9 years) from 56 families participating in a longitudinal study since infancy (retention rate 74%) were assessed on the SCID-II for symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD), including suicidality/self-injury. Early clinical risk was indexed by clinical referral to parent-infant services. Attachment security and parent-child interaction were assessed from videotape at 18 months and 8 years. Severity of childhood abuse was rated from interview and self-report measures. Maternal withdrawal in infancy was a significant predictor of both borderline symptoms and suicidality/self-injury in late adolescence. Disorganized controlling child behavior at age 8 contributed independently to the prediction of borderline symptoms. The effect of maternal withdrawal was independent of, and additive to, variability explained by severity of childhood abuse. Borderline symptoms and suicidality/self-injury may be preceded developmentally by disturbed interactions as early as 18 months of age. A parent-child transactional model is proposed to account for the findings. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Toxicological analysis is indispensable in forensic autopsy laboratories, but often depends on the limitations of individual institutions. The present study reviewed routine drug screening data of forensic autopsy cases (n = 2996) during an 18.5-year period (January 1996-June 2014) at our institute to examine the efficacy of the procedures and findings in autopsy diagnosis and interpretation. Drug screening was performed using on-site immunoassay screening devices and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) in all cases, followed by re-examination using GC/MS and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) at a cooperating institute in specific cases in the last 4 years. GC/MS detected drugs in 486 cases (16.2%), including amphetamines (n = 160), major tranquilizers (n = 72), minor tranquilizers (n = 294), antidepressants (n = 21), cold remedies (n = 77), and other drugs (n = 19). Among these cases, fatal intoxication (n = 123) involved amphetamines (n = 73), major tranquilizers (n = 37), minor tranquilizers (n = 86), antidepressants (n = 3), and cold remedies (n = 9); most cases involved self-administration, alleged suicide and accidental overdose, while homicide was not included. These drugs were also identified in other manners of death, including homicide (n = 40/372), suicide (n = 34/226), accidental falls (n = 27/129), and natural death (n = 72/514). In these cases, on-site immunoassay screening of drugs of abuse showed negative findings in 2440 cases (81.4% in all cases), while GC/MS detected other drugs in 218 cases (7.3% in all cases), including several antipsychotic drugs, acetaminophen and salicylic acid. Further analysis using LC/MS/MS detected low concentrations of benzodiazepines in 32 cases, and also anti-diabetic and hypertensive drugs in a case of fatal abuse. These observations indicate the efficacy of systematic routine toxicological analysis to investigate not only the cause of death but also the background of fatalities in forensic autopsy. The provision of extensive drug screening is needed for forensic and social risk management, considering the marked diversity of medical and illicit drugs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Background: Child homicides are critical medico-legal issues worldwide. Data on the characteristics of these cases in Asia are limited. This study aimed to describe the characteristics of child homicides in Taiwan.
   Methods: A retrospective analysis of forensic autopsy records of child homicide victims (aged 0-17 years) in Taiwan, during a 10-year period between 2001 and 2010, was carried out. The age, sex, relationship with the perpetrator(s), injury patterns of the victims, and causes of death were analyzed.
   Results: In all, 193 child homicide autopsies were identified. There were 38 (19.7%), 82 (42.5%), 25 (13.0%), and 48 (24.9%) homicide victims aged under 1, 1-5, 6-12, and 13-17 years, respectively. One-hundred boys (mean age: 8.4 +/- 7.0) and 93 girls (mean age: 3.7 +/- 4.3) were included. A female predominance was noted among the victims aged 0-5. Blunt force (53.4%) was the most frequent method of injury, followed by suffocation/strangulation (20.2%) and sharp force (13.0%). Bruise (64.8%) and brain injury (45.1%) were the most common types of injuries. The cranium (62.2%) and face (60.6%) were the most frequently injured body regions. The distribution of fatal injuries varied among victims in different age groups. Neurogenic shock, asphyxia, and hemorrhagic shocks were most common in victims aged 0-5, 6-12, and 13-17, respectively. The most frequent causes of death included blunt force head injury (40.4%), suffocation/strangulation (20.2%), and sharp force lung trauma (7.3%). The type of offenders, injury methods, types of injuries, distribution of injuries, mechanism of death, and causes of death were significantly different among victims of different age groups. Eighteen (9.33%) victims displayed no external evidence of trauma.
   Conclusions: The patterns of injuries, mechanism of death, and causes of death were different among victims of different age groups. A female predominance was noted among the victims aged 0-5. Complete forensic autopsy is necessary to identify child homicide. This report will help forensic examiners and forensic pathologists recognize the signs of child homicide and serve as a working basis for these professionals. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB This study investigated patients with Bipolar Disorder's abilities to generate specific past and future events in response to positive and negative cues words as well as emotional intensity related to these ones. The relationships between the number of generated specific events cognitive functioning, interpersonal problems and the ability to problem solving were investigated. Nineteen BD and nineteen healthy controls completed a French version of the AMT to evaluate the past and future events recall, in function of their valence, and emotions related. Furthermore, they completed the Optional Thinking Test, the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems and the neuropsychological measures. Compared to healthy controls, BD recollected (1) fewer specific past negative events and (2) fewer future specific positive and negative events furthermore, (3) they felt more emotional intensity related to future events. These results were explained in the light of theoretical models. Finally, specific past memories deficits in BD were linked with issues in problem solving but not with levels of distress arising from interpersonal problems. In view of AM functions in everyday life, all types of deficits should be taken into consideration, and AM remediation envisaged. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Insight impairment is common early in the course of psychosis. Most studies have focused on the relationship between insight and depression, although manic symptoms are also frequent in psychoses. The main aim of this study was to examine the relationship between insight dimensions and manic and depressive symptoms in first-episode psychosis. A group of inpatients in their first psychotic episodes (n=124) were evaluated using the Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder. Young Mania Rating Scale and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. To study the effect of clinical, manic and depressive symptoms on insight, awareness of mental disorder, awareness of the achieved effects of medication, and awareness of the social consequences of having a mental disorder were modelled using ordinal logistic regression techniques. Results showed that greater awareness of mental disorder was significantly related to higher age at first episode together with higher scores for negative and depressive symptoms. The opposite was found to be true in presentations with a higher severity of disease and manic symptoms. The model fitting unawareness of the achieved effects of medication identified the same significant variables, except in the case of negative symptoms. Finally, the model assessing the social consequences of having a mental disorder showed unawareness to be greater when manic symptoms and disease severity were high. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB An ingestion of an unknown quantity of mirtazapine in a suicide attempt leading to death is described. Sertraline and amitriptyline have been co-ingested. Because mirtazapine is reported to be relatively safe in overdose, body fluids and tissues were investigated for both mirtazapine and desmethylmirtazapine by high-pressure liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry following liquid-liquid extraction. The limit of detection was sufficiently low to also apply the assay in pharmacokinetic studies. The levels of amitriptyline and nortriptyline were very low (38 and 19 ng/mL femoral venous blood) and the amount of sertraline in blood taken from the femoral vein (880 ng/mL) was considerably lower than those seen in overdosage. Accumulation of mirtazapine and N-desmethylmirtazapine was evident in fluids and tissues involved in enterohepatic circulation and excretion. The concentration determined in a brain sample suggests a contribution of the metabolite to the drug's pharmacodynamic activity. Based on literature data, significant adverse or synergistic effects among the drugs detected as well as adverse reactions such as a serotonin reaction appeared less probable. Mirtazapine exhibits alpha(1)-antagonistic properties on the cardiac-vascular system and may cause hyponatraemia. In the face of the cardiac findings at autopsy and the lack of an apparent cause of death, these effects of mirtazapine may have initiated a process leading to death. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB In replicative senescence, cells undergo permanent exit from cell cycle traverse; this is traditionally thought to occur at the end of a culture's in vitro life span, after serial passaging. In general, the checkpoint for replicative senescence is found at the G(1)/S border, controlled by the modulation of a battery of proteins, typified by gaining inhibitors of cell cycle traverse, such as cyclin-dependent kinases or RB hyperphosphorylation, and losing pro-proliferation gene expressions such as c-fos, c-myc, and a cadre of proliferation-dependent kinases. Here, we present evidence that replicatively senescent fibroblasts are resistant to apoptotic death, associated with a lack of key enzyme activities, caspase-3 being the chief executioner. This observation, coupled with our earlier report that senescent fibroblasts maintain persistently high levels of pro-survival factor Bcl-2, suggests that the molecular signaling program present in fibroblasts at the end of their in vitro life span may not only cater to the state of permanent exit from cell cycle traverse, but also dictate an inability to commit cellular suicide. Future experiments will reveal whether replicatively senescent fibroblasts that can neither proliferate nor die contribute to organismic aging, and whether their accumulation over time in tissue becomes detrimental to the normal aging process.

AB Medication non-adherence is one of the major obstacles to recovery in first-episode psychosis (FEP). This study aimed to identify the predictors and rates of medication non-adherence in the first and second year after the start of treatment (baseline) in urban Chinese FEP patients. Relevant information on medication non-adherence and potential baseline predictors, including demographic variables, clinical measures, violence/suicide attempts, stressful life experiences, intervention received, and follow-up attendance, were collected from case records of 1400 FEP patients in Hong Kong. The non-adherence rate was 162% in year 1 and 15.4% in year 2. Regression analyses revealed the predictors for non-adherence in year 1 were no hospitalization at baseline, non-schizophrenia diagnosis, and more years of education. Predictors of non-adherence in year 2 included acute/subacute onset and older age of onset. Predictors common in both years were defaulting from psychiatric follow-up during baseline, standard psychiatric care (no early intervention), and lower positive symptoms severity at baseline. In assessing non-adherence risk and for planning phase-specific early interventions for FEP, particularly in a Chinese context, healthcare professionals should consider the common and specific predictors for non-adherence identified in the first and second years of treatment and should not overlook patients with less clinically severe symptoms.

AB Between 1983 and 2003, 40 accidental autoerotic fatalities have been investigated. in the Institute of Legal Medicine in Hamburg. Only 50% (n = 20) were autopsied (13 legal autopsies, 6 for scientific purposes and I for an insurance company). All the victims were males, aged between 13 and 79 years (among them five children and adolescents, the deceased mainly between 20 and 40 years). The paraphiliacs utilized a great range of devices and props as fetishism, sexual aids or pain-stimulating agents, like intimate feminine garments, ropes, chains, bondages, locks, pornographic magazines, condoms, rubber items, and chemical anaesthetics. The cause of death was strangulation in 20 cases (17 x hanging, 3 x ligature strangulation), I I x suffocation (8 x under plastic bags, 3 x with face-masks, 2 x thoracic compression, I x positional asphyxia, and I x cocaine intoxication). Five cases without autopsy remained unclear because of missing morphological and toxicological findings; it could not be differentiated between asphyxiation/intoxication/natural disease, although the scene characteristics seemed to be typical for autoerotic deaths. It is emphasized that the findings at the scene, the morphological and toxicological examination of the dead body (full autopsy as prerequisite) by experienced investigators and the personal history of the deceased have to be evaluated very carefully and intensely to reconstruct the accidental fatal autoerotic course accurately and undoubtedly (to exclude the possibility of sexual homicide, neglected killing, or suicide).

AB Little is known about mortality among firesetters. However, they hold many risk factors associated with elevated mortality. This study aimed to investigate mortality rates and patterns in the course of a 39-year follow-up of a consecutive sample (n=441) of pretrial male firesetters evaluated in a forensic psychiatric unit in Finland. For each firesetter, four controls matched for age, sex and place of birth were randomly selected from the Central Population Register. Mortality data was obtained from the Causes of Death statistics. By the end of the follow-up period, 48.0% of the firesetters and 22.0% of the controls had died (OR 2.47, 95% CI 2.00-3.05). Altogether, 24.1% of the firesetters and 17.6% of the control subjects had died of natural causes (OR 1.49, 95% Cl 1.16-1.92), whereas 20.9% and 3.8% respectively, died an unnatural death (OR 6.71, 95% CI 4.79-9.40). Alcohol-related deaths were more frequent among firesetters than controls. Our findings confirm that fire-setting behavior is associated with high mortality. More attention must be paid to the treatment of suicidality, psychiatric comorbidities and alcohol use disorders within this group both during and after their sentences.

AB This review evaluates the impact of partial compliance on treatment outcomes in schizophrenia and discusses strategies that may be implemented to enhance compliance. As such, a search of English language articles evaluating compliance in schizophrenia was performed using Medline and EMBASE, with no time limits. Abstracts and posters presented at key psychiatry congresses were also reviewed. Results demonstrated that partial compliance with antipsychotic medication is a significant barrier to achieving optimal outcomes in schizophrenia. The problem increases with the duration of treatment, and is difficult to monitor. The impact of partial compliance is significant, leading to increases in psychotic symptoms, the risk of relapse and rehospitalization, and even suicide. Compliance is a complex phenomenon, influenced by aspects of the illness itself such as cognitive impairment and patients' health beliefs. The patient's environment and therapeutic alliance also influence medication compliance. Behavioural and pharmacological measures should be used together to improve compliance. While atypical antipsychotics have demonstrated improvements in psychotic symptoms, insight and cognition, these may not be enough to ensure compliance with oral daily medication. Long-acting risperidone may therefore bring together the benefits of the atypical antipsychotics with the long-acting injection delivery system required to build a platform for improved outcomes.

AB This study analyzes causes of deaths of 766 patients who died while in methadone treatment in Texas between 1994 and 2002. Compared with deaths in the general population of Texas, deaths of clients in methadone treatment were 4.6 times more likely to be from a drug overdose, 3.4 times more likely to be from liver disease, 1.7 times more likely to be from a respiratory disease, 1.5 times more likely to be from a homicide and 1.4 times more likely to be from AIDS, but less likely to be from suicide, motor vehicle accidents, cardiovascular diseases or cancer. Of the clients, 20% died of liver disease, 18% of cardiovascular disease and 14% of drug overdose. An older cohort had been in treatment longer, had more take-homes, were on higher doses and tended to die of chronic diseases. A younger cohort tended to die from traumas, including drug overdose. Time in treatment was 43.3 months; mean daily dose was 77.3 mg; number of days/month dosed in the clinic was 13.9. Given these rates, the scope of services should include on-site treatment for other medical conditions and staff should be educated about and counsel about the risk of death for new patients.

ID SUICIDE RATES; HEALTH; EPIDEMIC; FARMERS; WORLD
AB Hundreds of thousands of people are dying around the world each year from the effects of the use, or misuse, of pesticides. This paper reviews the different options to reduce availability of the most hazardous chemicals, focusing on issues in developing countries. Emphasis is placed on the fatal poisoning cases and hence the focus on self-harm cases. Overall, it is argued here that restricting access to the most hazardous pesticides would be of paramount importance to reduce the number of severe acute poisoning cases and case-fatalities and would provide greater opportunities for preventive programmes to act effectively. The aim should be to achieve an almost immediate phasing out of the WHO Classes I and 11 pesticides through national policies and enforcement. These short-term aims will have to be supported by medium- and long-term objectives focusing on the substitution of pesticides with safe and cost-effective alternatives, possibly guided by the establishment of a Minimum Pesticide List, and the development of future agricultural practices where pesticide usage is reduced to an absolute minimum. Underlying factors that make individuals at risk for self-harm include domestic problems, alcohol or drug addiction, emotional distress, depression, physical illness, social isolation or financial hardship. These should be addressed through preventive health programmes and community development efforts. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: The purpose of the study was to assess the incidence and type of toxic exposures presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) at Landspitali University Hospital in Iceland over one year and compare the results to another study performed eleven years before.
   Methods: The study was prospective and included all visits due to acute poisoning to the ED between January 1, and December 31, 2012.
   Results: A total of 977 toxic exposures were documented. Females were 554 (57%) and males 423 (43%). The age range was from 2 months to 96 years old. More than half of the patients were under 30 years old. The majority of exposures occurred in private homes and ingestion was the most common route of exposure. Deliberate poisonings accounted for 66% of all the poisonings and 76% had drugs and/or alcohol as their main cause. Exposures to chemicals other than drugs were usually unintentional and 31% of them were occupational exposures. 80% of patients received treatment and were discharged from the ED, 20% were admitted to other departments, thereof 21% to ICU. Two patients died (0.2%).
   Conclusion: A slight but statistically unsignificant increase in incidence was observed. Females outnumbered males. Self-poisonings by ingestion of drugs and/or alcohol accounted for the majority of cases. The age range was wide, but the incidence was higher with young people. Mortality was low.

AB There is a need for a brief measure of emotion dysregulation that can be used in large-scale studies. This study evaluated the construct validity of a short, self-report instrument of emotion dysregulation. Subjects (N=2197) were recruited from primary care clinics of an urban public hospital as part of a study of trauma-related risk and resilience. Emotion dysregulation was measured using the Emotion Dysregulation Scale, short version (EDS-short), a12-item self-report measure assessing emotional experiencing, cognition, and behavior. EDS-short was first compared with the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Then, the construct validity of the EDS-short in predicting depression, posttraumatic stress, substance abuse, borderline pathology, suicide attempts, psychiatric hospitalizations, positive affect, and resiliency was assessed. We found a significant positive correlation between EDS-short and DERS. The EDS-short was significantly predictive of higher reported depressive, posttraumatic stress, substance abuse, and borderline symptoms, and lower reported positive affect and resiliency, over and above demographic characteristics and negative affect. Our results demonstrate that the EDS-short is a useful instrument for measuring emotion dysregulation in traumatized populations. A brief measure of emotion dysregulation is critical as the field moves forward in studying the wide ranging negative effects of emotion dysregulation across psychiatric disorders and outcomes.

AB A potential overlap between bipolar disorder (BD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) has been recently proposed. We aimed to assess similarities and differences of brain structural features in BD and BPD. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in 26 inpatients with BPD, 14 with BD, and 40 age-and sex-matched healthycontrols (HC). Voxel-based morphometry analysis with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) was used to localize and quantify gray (GM) and white matter (WM) abnormalities in BD and BPD compared to HC and to identify those specifically affected in each patient group. Region of interest (ROI)-based analyses were also performed for confirmation. GM density changes in BD are significantly more diffuse and severe than in BPD, as demonstrated in both SPM- and ROI-based analyses. The topography of GM alterations showed some regions of overlap, but each disorder had specific regions of abnormality (involving both cortical and subcortical structures in BD, confined mainly to fronto-limbic regions in BPD). WM density changes were less pronounced in both conditions and involved completely different regions. Although BPD and BD show a considerable overlap of GM changes, the topography of alterations is more consistent with the separate conditions hypothesis and with the vulnerability of separate neural systems.

AB Research suggests that individuals with a history of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) do not have difficulty generating alternatives to social problems but choose more negative solutions, suggesting a deficit in decision-making. However, studies report no significant differences in risky decision-making on a performance-based task among individuals with and without NSSI histories. A limitation of these studies is that decision-making was only assessed at baseline. As individuals with a history of NSSI typically self-injure when experiencing negative emotions, decision-making ability may become impaired specifically in the presence of these emotions. The aim of the current study was to investigate decision-making ability among individuals with and.without NSSI histories both at baseline and following a distressing social exclusion task. We compared individuals with (n=48) and without (n=72) NSSI histories on the Iowa Gambling Task, a behavioral measure of risky decision-making, before and after exclusion or inclusion on the Cyberball task. Results indicated no significant group differences in performance regardless of condition. When participants were grouped by racial/ethnic minority status, results indicated that non-Hispanic White individuals with a history of NSSI exhibited deterioration in risky decision-making ability following social exclusion. Potential explanations for these findings and clinical implications are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Stigmatisation towards depression has previously been reported amongst medical students from a variety of backgrounds. This study explored personal and perceived stigmas associated with depression, and their relationship with demographics, knowledge of depression, levels of personal stress and history of medical illness amongst Australian-trained medical students. A cross-sectional survey was undertaken amongst students enroled June-to-August 2009 across four Australian medical schools. In total, 1010 students completed the survey, a response rate of 29.6%. Approximately 25% of students reported a past history of depression. Higher stress (K-10 scores) was reported by females and those with a past history of depression. On a scale of 0-to-5, the mean (+/- S.D.) personal and perceived stigma depression scores were 1.83 +/- 1.49 and 4.05 +/- 1.42 respectively. In multivariate analysis, higher perceived stigma and K-10 scores, a past history of anxiety and Year 3 of medical school indicated higher personal stigma scores. Perceived stigma was positively associated with K-10 scores, personal stigma scores, and a Caucasian background. Our findings suggest a high level of personal and particularly perceived stigma associated with depression amongst medical students, especially those displaying higher levels of stress. Adequate support and screening for psychological stress may de-stigmatise depression and improve mental health amongst future Australian doctors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to determine predictors of non-fatal overdose (OD) among a cohort of 470 adults after detoxification from heroin, cocaine or alcohol.
   Methods: We examined factors associated with time to OD during 2 years after discharge from an urban detoxification unit in Boston, MA, USA using multivariable regression analyses. Separate analyses were performed for both the total sample and a subgroup with problem opioid use.
   Results: Lifetime prevalence for any OD was 30.9% (145/470) in the total sample and 42.3% (85/201) inpatients with opioid problems. During the 2-year follow-up, OD was estimated to occur in 16.9% of the total sample and 26.7% of the opioid problem subgroup, with new-onset (incidence) OD estimated at 5.7% and 11.0%, respectively. Factors associated with an increased hazard of OD in both samples included white race, more depressive symptoms, and prior OD regardless of intent. Prior suicidal ideation or attempt was not associated with future OD.
   Conclusions: Findings underscore both the high prevalence of non-fatal OD among detoxification patients especially opioid users, and the potency of prior OD as a risk factor for future OD. Depressive symptoms, a modifiable risk factor, may represent a potential intervention target to prevent OD, including some "unintentional" ODs. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Seasonality is one of the key features in subjects with mood disorders and is involved in the multifaceted nature of the clinical course. However, few studies have explored the clinical implications of seasonality in bipolar disorders. We examined the differential effects of seasonality on clinical variables between bipolar I and II disorder (BD I and II). Seasonality was assessed using the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ) in 204 subjects with BD I and 308 with BD II. Following the comparisons between BD I and II groups, clinical characteristics related to seasonality were explored. Next, to predict the presence of seasonality, a logistic regression model was applied. The global seasonality score on the SPAQ was significantly higher in the BD II group than in the BD I group. In the BD I group, seasonality was associated with suicide attempt history. In the BD II group, on the other hand, seasonality was associated with female gender, depressive predominance, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). In the regression models, the presence of PMDD and female gender was significantly associated with seasonality in the BD II group. Our findings suggest that high seasonality tendency, a vulnerability maker for cyclic worsening, may contribute to a differential pattern of clinical characteristics in BD II.

AB Despite obvious clinical need, factors underlying early treatment discontinuation among 'real world' borderline personality disorder (BPD) patients are still unknown. This study investigates individual characteristics that can predict early (<three months) dropout among BPD outpatients at a general psychiatric service. Out of a sample of 1437 consecutively treatment-seeking psychiatric outpatients, 162 BPD subjects have been identified by means of the Structured Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) Personality. Sociodemographic, clinical and personality variables potentially relevant for dropout were assessed for all participants at baseline. Early dropouts (n=54) were compared to continuers (n=108) on all measures. Logistic regression was then used to identify independent predictors of early dropout. A history of suicide attempts predicted early discontinuation, whereas the presence of an eating disorder and of avoidant personality features protected from early dropout. If confirmed, these findings may help clinicians operating in general psychiatric settings with estimating the risk of premature treatment discontinuation, and stress the need to specifically address suicidal behaviours in order to improve treatment retention among borderline outpatients. In this regard, implementing general psychiatric care with specialised, evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions may be deemed necessary. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the aim to characterize patterns in toxicological profile and manner of death in deceased users of anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS), a retrospective autopsy protocol study of 52 deceased users of AAS was undertaken. The AAS users were compared to 68 deceased users of amphetamine and/or heroin who were consecutively tested and found to be negative for AAS.
   Use of AAS was in the majority of cases (79%) associated with concomitant use of psychotropic substances. AAS-related deaths differed in several respects from deaths among users of heroin or amphetamine, most strikingly with regard to: (a) the median age at death, which was significantly lower for AAS users (24.5 years) than for users of heroin and/or amphetamine (34 and 40 years, respectively); (b) the manner of death, with AAS users dying significantly more often from homicide or suicide than users of other drugs; and (c) the body mass index (BMI), with AAS users exhibiting significantly higher BMI than users of other drugs.
   These results support the earlier reported association between use of AAS and use of other psychoactive substances. In addition, the data suggest that AAS users are more likely to become involved in incidents leading to violent death and have a higher risk of dying at a younger age than users of other drugs.

AB Dual diagnosis (DD) is the coexistence of a substance use disorder (SUD) and severe mental illness (SMI). The aim of this study is to determine for the first time if a specific personality pattern exists for DD patients compared to those who only have SUD or SMI. The sample was composed of 102 male, 34 patients in each group (DD, SUD and SMI). DD and SMI groups included 20 schizophrenic and 14 depressed patients respectively. Cloninger's TCI-R was administered together with a structured interview of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. All the temperament dimensions and Self-directedness provided differences among groups. The DD and SUD showed significant higher scores in Novelty Seeking regarding SMI, whereas for Harm Avoidance the SUD subjects scored lower with respect to the DD and SMI group. Persistence was significant lower for the DD and SMI groups compared to the SUD patients. The DD obtained low significant scores in Reward Dependence in relation to the SUD and Self-directedness in relation to the SUD and SMI. Our data highlight the presence of a different personality profiles among DD, SUD and SMI disorders. Taking into account the patients' personality can benefit the clinical course and minimize the DD impact. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Elevated T3 levels have been reported in men with antisocial behavior. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between thyroid hormones and expressed adult interpersonal violence in female patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Furthermore, expressed adult interpersonal violence in female BPD patients was compared to healthy female controls. A total of 92 clinically euthyroid women with BPD and 57 healthy women were assessed with the Karolinska Interpersonal Violence Scales (KIVS). Baseline thyroid function was evaluated by measuring plasma free and bound triiodothyronine (FT3 and T3), thyroxine (FT4 and T4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with immunoassays in patients. Plasma cortisol was also measured. Among females with BPD, expressed interpersonal violence as an adult showed a significant positive correlation with the T3 levels. The mean expression of interpersonal violence as an adult was significantly higher in BPD patients as compared to healthy controls. The multiple regression model indicated that two independent predictors of KIVS expressed interpersonal violence as an adult: T3 and comorbid diagnosis of alcohol abuse. Association between T3 levels and violent/aggressive behavior earlier reported exclusively in male samples may be valid also in females with BPD. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Objectives: To give insight into Dutch nursing staff's attitudes and involvement regarding euthanasia.
   Methods: The sample was recruited from a nation-wide existent research panel of registered nurses and certified nursing assistants. Descriptive analyses and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed.
   Results: 587 respondents (response of 65%) completed the questionnaire. The majority (83%) state that physicians have to discuss the decision about euthanasia with the nurses involved. Besides, 69% state that a physician should discuss a euthanasia request with nurses who have regular contact with a patient. Nursing staff who have religious or other beliefs that they consider important for their attitude towards end-of-life decisions, and staff working in a hospital or home care, are most likely to have this opinion. Being present during the euthanasia is quite unusual: only a small group (7%) report that this has ever been the case in their entire working life. Seven% (incorrectly) think they are allowed to administer the lethal drugs.
   Conclusion: The majority want to be involved in decision-making processes about euthanasia. Not all are aware that they are not legally allowed to administer the lethal drugs. Practice implications: Nursing staff should be informed of relevant existing legislation and professional guidelines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Due to the current economic crisis in Greece, effects on health and healthcare have been reported. The aim of this study was to present a systematic overview of the consequences that the financial crisis has had for health and healthcare in Greece. Methods: Systematic literature review was conducted in order to identify articles that were published from January 2009 to March 2013 and explicitly referred to the effects of economic crisis on health or healthcare, in Greece. Data extraction and synthesis was performed with the use of thematic analysis.
   Findings: Thirty-nine studies were considered for further analyses. Various existing and potential relevant effects were identified, including reductions in public health expenditure and changes in healthcare services and the pharmaceutical market, with an increasing number of admissions in public healthcare sector, and efficiency and organizational-related issues being evident, overall. Indications were found for post-crisis deterioration of public health with increasing rates of mental health, suicides, and epidemics, and deterioration of self-rated health.
   Conclusion: The recent efforts to reform the Greek National Health System have been focusing mainly on short-term effects by reducing expenditure, while the measures imposed seem to have dubious long-term consequences for Greek public health and healthcare.

AB This study examined parental relationship quality, friendship quality, and depression as mediators of the association between child maltreatment (CM) and adolescent suicidal ideation (SI). Participants were 674 adolescents (46% female; 55% African American) involved in the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN). Data were collected via youth self-report at ages 12, 16, and 18. CM before age 12 predicted poor parental relationships and depression, but not poor friendships, at age 16. Age 16 depression was negatively associated with parental relationship quality and positively associated with SI at age 18. An indirect path from CM to SI via depression was significant, suggesting that the early CM affects depression severity, which in turn is associated with SI. Strong friendship quality (age 16) was associated with SI at age 18; however, there was no significant indirect path from CM to SI via friendships. Results suggest that: 1) CM before age 12 affects parental relationships in adolescence; 2) depression and friendships are related to suicide ideation in later adolescence; and 3) depression partially mediates the association between CM and SI. Results highlight the importance of assessing for a history of CM, quality of interpersonal relationships, and depression severity among youth reporting SI. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB This study attempts to assess childhood maltreatment in prison through a hierarchical approach. The hierarchical approach principally aims to disentangle the independent effects of childhood maltreatment upon psychiatric morbidity/personality traits, if any, from the burden that the adverse family conditions have already imposed to the mental health of the maltreated individual-prisoner. To this direction, a conceptual framework with five hierarchical levels was constructed, namely: immutable demographic factors; family conditions; childhood maltreatment (physical abuse, neglect and sexual abuse); personality traits, habits and psychiatric morbidity; prison-related variables. A self-administered, anonymous set (battery) of questionnaires was administered to 173 male prisoners in the Chalkida prison, Greece; 26% of prisoners disclosed childhood maltreatment. Psychiatric condition in the family, parental alcoholism and parental divorce correlated with childhood maltreatment. After adjustment for immutable demographic factors and family conditions, childhood maltreatment was associated with aggression (both in terms of Lifetime History of Aggression and Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire scores), illicit substance use, personal history of psychiatric condition, current smoking, impulsivity and alcohol abuse. In conclusion, childhood maltreatment represents a pivotal, determining factor in the life course of male prisoners. Delinquents seem to suffer from long-term consequences of childhood maltreatment in terms of numerous mental health aspects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The bodies of socially isolated people may remain undiscovered in their own houses for prolonged periods. Occasionally the body is in situ for sufficient time to become skeletonised, or partially so. Medico-legal investigation of these cases is complicated by degradation and contamination of evidence. Thus, a multidisciplinary forensic investigation is recommended. The potential contributions of forensic pathology, anthropology, odontology and entomology are outlined here with reference to two cases that occurred in Victoria, Australia, in 2003. Forensic pathologists are often unable to determine the cause of death in skeletonised bodies, however, they may find evidence to support either a natural or unnatural mode of death, and they may describe skeletal pathology or trauma, and identify skeletal features to support radiological identification of the deceased. Anthropologists can provide supplementary evidence of skeletal trauma. Additionally, they can assess age, sex, stature and racial affiliation from skeletal remains. Odontologists can identify individuals through comparison with ante-mortem dental records; however, potential difficulties exist in identifying the treating dentist of a socially isolated person. Odontologists may also examine the teeth and oro-facial skeleton for trauma. Entomologists may estimate minimum death time and/or season of death.

AB A simple and rapid procedure for the determination of methyl-parathion (m-p) in post-mortem biological samples was developed using headspace solid phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography (GC) with nitrogen-phosphorous detection (NPD). Methyl-parathion was extracted on 85 pm polyacrylate SPME fiber. Salt addition, extraction temperature, and extraction time were optimized to enhance the sensitivity of the method. The linearity (y = 0.0473x - 0.0113, R-2 = 0.9992) and the dynamic range (0.1-40 mug/ml) were found very satisfactory. The recoveries of methyl-parathion were found to be 46% in spiked human whole blood, 53% in spiked homogenized liver tissue, and 54% in spiked homogenized kidney tissue compared with samples prepared in water. The coefficients of variations for 2, 4, and 20 mug/ml of methyl-parathion in blood ranged from 0.9 to 5.1%, whereas the detection limit of the method was satisfactory (1 ng/ml in aqueous samples, 50 ng/ml in whole blood). The developed procedure was applied to post-mortem biological samples from a 21-year-old woman fatally poisoned (suicide) by intravenous injection of methyl-parathion. The intact insecticide was found in the post-mortem blood at a concentration of 24 mug/ml. No methyl-parathion was detected in the liver, kidneys, and gastric contents. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Decreased central serotonergic activity has been associated with aggressive behavior in humans and animals. Whether or not this phenomenon is related to current aggression or to aggressive tendency is debatable. [H-3]paroxetine binding in blood platelets represents the activity of serotonin peripheral binding sites. We investigated a possible association between [H-3]paroxetine binding in blood platelets and current aggression or homicidal history in schizophrenic patients. Blood platelets of 11 aggressive schizophrenic patients were assayed for [H-3]paroxetine binding in blood platelets and compared to findings in 15 non-aggressive schizophrenic patients, 15 presently non-aggressive schizophrenic patients with homicidal history, and 15 healthy volunteers. Clinical evaluation was performed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Clinical Global Impression scale. B-max of [H-3]paroxetine binding in blood platelets of currently aggressive schizophrenic patients was significantly higher than that in platelets of non-aggressive schizophrenic patients, presently non-aggressive patients with homicidal history and healthy volunteers. No difference was found between the last three study groups. No significant correlation was found between scores of all rating scales and the investigated biochemical parameters. An association was found between current aggression among schizophrenic patients and high B-max values of [H-3]paroxetine binding in blood platelets. This association is probably related to present state of aggression rather than to tendency towards aggression. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Major affective disorders are common widespread conditions associated with multiple psychosocial impairments and suicidal risk in the general population. At least 3-4% of all depressive individuals die by suicide. At a molecular level, affective disorders and suicidal behavior are recently associated with disturbances in structural and synaptic plasticity. A recent hypothesis suggested that small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), in particular microRNAs (miRNAs), play a critical role in the translational regulation at the synapse. We performed a selective overview of the current literature on miRNAs putative subcellular localization and sites of action in mature neurons analyzing their role in neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, pathological stress changes, major affective disorders and suicidal behavior. miRNAs have played a fundamental role in the evolution of brain functions. The perturbation of some intracellular mechanisms as well as impaired assembly, localization, and translational regulation of specific RNA binding proteins may affect learning and memory, presumably contributing to the pathogenesis of major affective disorders and perhaps suicidal behavior. Also, miRNA dys-regulation has also been linked to several neuropsychiatric diseases. However, further evidence are needed in order to directly clarify the role of miRNAs in major affective disorders and suicidal behavior.

AB This study assessed potential for suicidal behaviors associated with sociodemographic, predisposing physical and mental health factors and self-reported psychological problems among homeless veterans in a large northeastern region. Data were obtained from a demographic and clinical history interview conducted with 3595 homeless veterans. Odds-ratio (OR) statistics were used to assess potential for suicidal behavior. Statistically significant ratios were similar for ideation and attempts. The highest ratios were for self-report of depression and difficulty controlling violence, but statistically significant ratios were found for reporting sleeping in a treatment facility the night before the interview, receiving VA support for a psychiatric condition, and the diagnoses of Alcoholism, Mood Disorder and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Low but statistically significant odds-ratios were obtained for most of the physical health items. A negative odds-ratio was obtained for African-American ethnicity. Logistic regression results indicated that for ideation and attempts items entered first involved subjective report of trouble controlling violent behavior and experiencing depression. High odds ratios for the interview items concerning experiencing serious depression and having difficulties controlling violence may have strong implications for treatment and management of homeless veterans. There may be up to 14-1 odds that an individual who reports being seriously depressed or having difficulty inhibiting aggression may have a serious potential for suicidal behaviors.

AB We report on the results of a large autopsy study focusing upon the hypothesis that deletion of the Alu insert in the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene is associated with: (a) greater prevalence or extent of atherosclerosis in the aorta and coronary arteries; and (b) microscopic qualities of established atherosclerotic plaques in the coronary arteries. This study was conducted in young US black (n = 290) and white (n = 379) males using available materials and data from the Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth (PDAY) study, a multi-center cooperative autopsy study organized in 1985 to explore the relationships of known cardiovascular risk factors to atherosclerosis in victims of accidents, homicides, or suicides in the age range of 15-34 years.
   The results provide strong evidence that ACE genotype may not be a predictor of either the prevalence or the extent of the lesions of atherosclerosis in the right coronary artery or the aorta of young adults, an observation that confirms previous studies that estimated the prevalence and extent of atherosclerosis using coronary angiography. In addition, the results suggest that ACE genotype does not contribute to the formation of atherosclerotic lesions that have the characteristics of vulnerable plaques in the left anterior descending coronary artery of young adults.

AB This study aimed to identify profiles of functioning and quality of life (QOL) in depression (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and healthy adults, as well as the clinical, demographic and cognitive variables associated with each of these profiles. Participants completed the WHODAS 2.0 and WHOQOL-BREF, which were submitted to latent profile analysis. The four cluster solution provided the best fit for our data. Cluster I consisted mostly of healthy adults, and had the highest functioning and QOL. Clusters 2 contained older patients with subclinical depressive symptoms and psychiatric comorbidities, whose impairments in QOL and functioning were associated with mood symptoms and several cognitive abilities. Patients with MDD, BDI or BDII with mild to moderate depression, such as those in cluster 3, may benefit more significantly from interventions in cognitive flexibility, inhibition, planning, and sustained attention. Lastly, patients with mood disorders and clinically significant levels of depression, as well as a history of suicide attempts, like those in cluster 4, may benefit from interventions aimed at working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility; that is, the three core executive functions. These findings should be further investigated, and used to guide treatments for patients with mood disorders and different patterns of functional impairment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Depression in older adults erodes their health, quality of life and the economy. Existing interventions are not feasible for broad application at the community. Postcard intervention only requires a few resources, and previous studies have shown its effectiveness for patients following drug overdose, self-harm and hospitalisation for major depression. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a postcard intervention. Participants were community-dwelling individuals, aged 65 or older, who eat meals alone and with the score of 4 or higher on the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). We enrolled 184 eligible participants, with 93 in the intervention and 91 in the control arm. Postcards were sent to participants once a month for eight months. Primary outcome was the GDS-15 score at post-intervention. Secondary outcomes were quality of life and activities of daily living. There was no significant difference in primary and secondary outcomes between completers of the intervention and the control arm. However, most of the participants who received intervention thought the intervention was effective. The postcard intervention for depression in community-dwelling elderly people in Japan is neither feasible nor effective. However, the descriptive results suggest that the intervention may be effective given different parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mood instability is underinvestigated but potentially clinically important. This study aimed to describe the prevalence of mood instability in adults living in England and test whether it is important in explaining the extent of symptoms of common mental disorders, suicidality and healthcare use. An analysis of data from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 2007, a household survey of private households in England (N=7403), was completed. The prevalence of mood instability was 13.9%. In univariate analysis it was strongly associated with socio-demographic and clinical variables. In regression modelling mood instability was independently associated with non-psychotic psychopathology, increasing the odds by 9.89. It was also linked with suicidal ideas (odds ratios (OR): 2.04) but not suicidal acts, and associated with being in receipt of medication, counselling or therapy for mental health problems (OR: 1.88), independent of a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. Mood instability is relatively common in the adult population, occurs frequently in common mental disorders and appears to be an important symptom in its own right. It is associated with two important measures in psychiatry, namely suicidal thinking and healthcare service use. It warrants more widespread recognition and further research is required to understand if, when and how to intervene. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the diagnostic validity of four commonly used assessment scales for depression in schizophrenia. The study population consisted of 84 inpatients meeting the DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia. Depression in the study subjects was defined by the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive episode. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Simpson-Angus Rating Scale (SARS) were used to differentiate depression from the negative and extrapyramidal symptom-related depressive phenomena in schizophrenia. The following four depression scales were assessed for their diagnostic validity as measures of depressive disorder in schizophrenia: the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and the depression subscale of the PANSS (PANSS-D). Of 84 patients with schizophrenia, 32 were diagnosed as having comorbid depressive disorder. The areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves of the CDSS, HAM-D, PANSS-D, and BDI were 0.94, 0.89, 0.90, and 0.81, respectively. The area under the ROC curve of the CDSS was significantly greater than that of the BDI and tended to be more favorable than those for the HAM-D and the PANSS-D. Our study suggests that the CDSS may provide the best assessment for depression in patients with schizophrenia. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hypochondriasis is defined as the tendency to worry excessively about having a serious illness. This study aimed to investigate cross-national differences in hypochondriasis symptoms between Korean and American patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). This study examined 1592 Korean and 3744 American MDD outpatients of age >= 18 years using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q-SF). Korean MDD patients exhibited significantly higher scores for hypochondriasis than Americans after controlling for total HAM-D scores and demographic variables (p < 0.0001), even though Americans had significantly higher total HAM-D scores (p < 0.0001). Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that hypochondriasis was significantly associated with somatic and psychic anxiety, insomnia-middle, and suicide for both Korean and American MDD patients after adjusting for demographic covariates. Among all factors, somatic anxiety was the most strongly associated with hypochondriasis in both Korean (AOR=2.14, 95% CI 1.31-3.52) and American (AOR=1.98, 95% CI 1.69-2.31) MDD outpatients. Hypochondriasis symptoms are more prevalent among Korean than American MDD patients but appear to be associated with high levels of somatic anxiety regardless of culture. This suggests that cultural and personal factors play a shared role in the presentation of hypochondriasis symptoms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy among men. Prostate cancer-related deaths are largely attributable to the development of hormone resistance in the tumor. No effective chemotherapy has yet been developed for advanced prostate cancer. It is desirable if a drug can be delivered directly and specifically to prostate cancer cells. Stem cells have selective migration ability toward cancer cells and therapeutic genes can be easily transduced into stem cells. In one form of gene therapy for cancer, the stem cells carry a gene encoding an enzyme that transforms an inert prodrug into a toxic product. Cytosine deaminase (CD) transforms the pro-drug 5-fluorocytosine into highly cytotoxic 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The migration of the genetically modified stem cells was monitored by molecular magnetic resonance imaging, after labeling the stem cells with fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). Human neural stem cells encoding CD (HB1.F3.CD) were prepared and labeled with MNP. In tumor-bearing C57B mice, systemically transplanted HB1.F3.CD stem cells migrated toward the tumor and in combination with pro-drug 5-FC, the volume of tumor implant was significantly reduced. These findings may contribute to development of a new selective chemotherapeutic strategy against prostate cancer. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The finding of human remains in aquatic environments is usually attributed to causes such as work-related or recreational accidents, suicides, discarded homicide victims, and natural disasters. When the point and date of entry in the water is unknown, these findings pose serious challenges to forensic analysis given the difficulty to estimate the drift of the body. In this context, the information retrieved from cases where the point of entry and body recovery sites are known, as well as the timing, is significant. Two drowning accidents in marine coastal waters were analyzed. In both cases the postmortem submersion interval (PMSI) is known, as well as the accident (point of entry) and body recovery sites. Accumulated degree days (ADD) was estimated in both cases using satellite sea surface temperature data. In both cases the bodies were recovered in the vicinity of the accident site (similar to 2 km in case 1 and less than 1 km in case 2). Results were interpreted in terms of oceanographic conditions, physical settings and ADD. The results provide some relevant clues on the fate of human cadavers in coastal marine environments that can be used by officials and agencies involved in the recovery of bodies, as well as by forensic investigators when dealing with these findings.

AB Objective: Public opinion and professional organisations dominate the euthanasia debate, and there is a need to understand the opinions of people confronted with euthanasia. The aim of this study was to investigate whether patients and their GPs talk about euthanasia, and if so, how they communicate about this.
   Methods: Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were held with 20 GPs and 30 of their patients in primary care in the Netherlands, where euthanasia is legalised. The patients had a life expectancy of less than 6 months, and cancer, heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as underlying disease.
   Results: Many patients did not communicate about euthanasia with their GP. Neither the patient nor the GP were clear in formulating their expectations concerning future decision making.
   Conclusion: The initial patient-GP communication consisted of an exchange of opinions about situations in which euthanasia would be desirable. GPs had different opinions about who should initiate communication, and found it difficult to judge the right moment to talk.
   Practice implications: It is essential to pay attention to education in communication about dying and euthanasia and to train the GPs to gain insight in the patient's end-of-life preferences, and to direct care at the best possible quality of life.

AB There is limited information regarding the neurobiology underlying non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) in clinically-referred youth. However, the salience of disturbed interpersonal relationships and disrupted self-processing associated with NSSI suggests the neural basis of social processes as a key area for additional study. Adolescent participants (N=123; M=14.75 years, SD=1.64) were divided into three groups: NSSI plus depression diagnosis (NSSI), depression only (DEP), healthy controls (HC). In the scanner, participants completed an Interpersonal Self-Processing task by taking direct (own) and indirect (mothers', best friends', or classmates') perspectives regarding self-characteristics. Across all perspectives, NSSI showed higher BOLD activation in limbic areas, and anterior and posterior cortical midline structures versus DEP and HC, while HC showed greater activity in rostrolateral, frontal pole and occipital cortex than NSSI and DEP youth. Moreover, NSSI youth showed heightened responses in amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampus, and fusiform when taking their mothers' perspective, which were negatively correlated with self-reports of the mother's support of adolescents' emotional distress in the NSSI group. NSSI youth also yielded greater precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex activity during indirect self-processing from their classmates' perspective. Findings suggest a role for disruptions in self and emotion-processing, and conflicted social relationships in the neurobiology of NSSI among depressed adolescents. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Background: Risk assessment forms a key component in self-harm management. Among self-harm presentations generally, lethality of an index act is a poor predictor of future non-fatal repetition. However, no study has examined whether severity of an index self-cutting episode is associated with prospective repetition.
   Aims: To examine factors associated with severity of self-cutting and in particular the association between severity of self-cutting and prospective repetition of self-harm.
   Methods: All index self-cutting presentations to emergency departments in Ireland over 5 years were grouped by treatment received and compared on the basis of demographic and clinical characteristics.
   Results: Receiving more extensive medical treatment was associated with male gender, being aged more than 15 years, and not combining self-harm methods. Receiving less extensive treatment conferred a higher risk of prospective 12-month repetition, even after controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics. Repeat self-harm presentations by those with more severe self-cutting in an index act were less prevalent but were more likely to involve high-lethality methods of self-harm.
   Discussion: The results indicate that the already-elevated repetition risk among self-cutting patients is further increased for those receiving less extensive wound closure treatment. Severity of self-cutting might also affect suicide risk but such an association has yet to be examined.

AB Deficits in emotion processing, a known clinical feature of major depressive disorder (MDD), have been widely investigated using emotional face paradigms and neuroimaging. However, most studies have not accounted for the high inter-subject variability of symptom severity. Similarly, only sparse research has focused on MDD in adolescence, early in the course of the illness. Here we sought to investigate neural responses to emotional faces using both categorical and dimensional analyses with a focus on anhedonia, a core symptom of MDD associated with poor outcomes. Nineteen medication-free depressed adolescents and 18 healthy controls (HC) were scanned during presentation of happy, sad, fearful, and neutral faces. ANCOVAs and regressions assessed group differences and relationships with illness and anhedonia severity, respectively. Findings included a group by valence interaction with depressed adolescents exhibiting decreased activity in the superior temporal gyrus (STG), putamen and premotor cortex. Post-hoc analyses confirmed decreased STG activity in MDD adolescents. Dimensional analyses revealed associations between illness severity and altered responses to negative faces in prefrontal, cingulate, striatal, and limbic regions. However, anhedonia severity was uniquely correlated with responses to happy faces in the prefrontal, cingulate, and insular regions. Our work highlights the need for studying specific symptoms dimensionally in psychiatric research. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We present a fatal drug poisoning case involving venlafaxine (VEN). The deceased took his medication regularly (including 150 mg VEN twice daily), and nothing in the case or autopsy findings pointed towards suicide. The toxicological assessment concluded that the cause of death was most likely due to a poisoning with a combination of VEN, oxycodone and ethanol, and the manner of death was considered to be an accident. The blood concentration of VEN was high (4.5 mg/kg), and the ratio of the VEN metabolite O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) to VEN was exceptionally low (0.006). Mechanistic pharmacokinetic simulations suggested that the low metabolite ratio was the result of combined poor metabolizer (PM) status of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 and CYP2D6. This hypothesis was confirmed by genetic analysis. Simulations revealed that it was likely that the combined missing CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 activity would cause higher concentrations of VEN, but the simulations also suggested that there could be additional reasons to explain the high VEN concentration found in this case. Thus, it seems likely that the potentially toxic VEN concentration was caused by reduced metabolic capacity. The simulations combined with genotyping were considered very useful in this fatal drug poisoning case. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Depressive episodes are a common and potentially severe occurrence in schizophrenia but are poorly recognised by psychiatrists. Coherent diagnostic criteria are necessary to improve diagnosis and treatment of these conditions. To evaluate the usefulness of the ICD-10 category of post-schizophrenic depression (PSD) and the DSM-IV category of postpsychotic depressive disorder of schizophrenia (PDDS), 80 clinically stable schizophrenic outpatients were evaluated with two independent measures of depression, a dimensional measure and a categorical measure. One rater applied the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive episodes (MDE), and the other applied the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, and the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale. Thirteen patients (16.3%) met criteria for MDE. All of them met the DSM-IV PDDS research criteria, but only two patients matched the ICD-10 PSD criteria, which require that the episode occurred in the 12 months after the last psychotic episode. There was no significant difference in the incidence of depressive episodes within 12 months after an acute psychotic episode and outside this time period. The data suggest that depressive episodes in schizophrenia are not restricted to the first year following the psychotic episode. Useful criteria for depressive episodes in schizophrenia should avoid a temporal relation with the psychotic episode. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Caffeine has long been recognized as an addictive substance that causes autonomic nerve effect, and is known to increase catecholamine secretion from the adrenal glands. In recent years, the risk of ingesting toxic levels of caffeine has increased because of the easy availability of analgesics, CNS (Central Nervous System) stimulant medicine and dietary supplements at shops, health stores and through online purchases. We report the death of a young female resulting from the ingestion for suicide of an online purchased sleepiness-preventing medicine containing caffeine. The autopsy findings included pulmonary edema and congestion plus cutaneous emphysema. The stomach contents included a dark-brown viscous fluid without tablet or food residue. Toxicological examination revealed the presence of caffeine in the right heart blood (154.2 mu g/mL) and stomach contents (197.5 mu g/mL) (lethal blood level, >80 mu g/mL). The highest caffeine content was in the bile (852.3 mu g/mL). Biochemical findings showed that catecholamine concentration in the peripheral blood in the iliac vein was elevated. Immunostaining of catecholamine was weak in the adrenal medulla. We recommend highlighting the toxicity risk of ingesting substances with a high caffeine concentration, and we propose that caffeine concentrations should be included in the comprehensive routine forensic toxicological tests for all cases.

AB The World Health Organization describes geriatric age group as the population aged 65 years or older. Parallel with the development of medical and technological areas, the life expectancy gets longer and geriatric population has been dramatically increasing. In this respect, geriatric deaths are frequently encountered due to increasing risk factors and pathophysiological changes in aging process. The records of the Forensic Medicine Institution Adana Group Authority Morgue Specialty Office were used. Death certificates and autopsy records of 9007 cases autopsied between the years of 1998 and 2007 were examined retrospectively. Seven hundred and twenty-six geriatric age (>65 years) deaths were taken in the scope of the study. All of the cases were analyzed with regard to age, sex, cause of death, incident place, and the place and origin of death. Geriatric deaths comprised 8.1% (726 cases) of all the medicolegal autopsy cases (9007) during these ten years. Of all geriatric deaths, 73.8% (536) were male while 26.2% (190) were female. Ages of cases were between 65 and 96 years, and the mean age was 72.3. Majority (310 cases, 42.7%) of deaths were by natural causes, while this was followed by accidental deaths with 227 cases (31.4%). This study was aimed to discuss the general features of geriatric deaths accepted as forensic cases, in the light of the literature. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The study aimed to determine patterns of major depression (MD) across 36 months, and the relationship to outcomes for the treatment of heroin dependence. As part of a longitudinal cohort study, 429 heroin users were interviewed at 36 month follow-up. MD declined from 23.8% at baseline to 8.2% at 36 months. Females were more likely to have MD at both baseline (31.1 vs. 19.8) and 36 months (11.9 vs. 6.1%). Those with MD at baseline were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with MD at a follow-up interview (40.2 vs. 15.9%) and at 36 months (14.7 vs. 6.1%). Antidepressant use did not decrease across 36 months amongst either gender. Baseline MD was not related to treatment exposure across 36 months. There were large and significant declines in drug use and drug-related problems, and improvements in physical health with no group differences evident at 36 months. Despite improvements in global mental health, at both baseline and 36 months those with MD at baseline had significantly lower SF12 mental health scores.

AB Objectives: To determine whether use of crystal methamphetamine increases HIV risk behaviors beyond the risk associated with use of other recreational drugs among Hispanic men who have sex with men (HMSM).
   Design: We compared the sexual behaviors and psychosocial characteristics of non-recreational drug users (non-users), recreational drug users who did not use crystal (non-crystal drug users), and recreational drug users who used crystal (crystal users).
   Methods: We recruited 294 HMSM from Internet and 272 from community venues. Eligible men completed an ACASI to assess socio-demographic factors, drug use, sexual behaviors and psychosocial factors and received $50.
   Results: In the multivariate model, crystal users were more likely than non-crystal drug users to have lower Hispanicism, higher attachment to the gay community, and history of suicide attempts. Crystal users were not significantly different from non-crystal drug users in number of sex partners; however, differences in unprotected receptive anal sex approached significance.
   Conclusions: The additional risk of crystal above that of other recreational drugs needs to be disentangled from those associated with poly-drug use. Our data suggest that it may depend on how one defines risky sexual behavior and is influenced by psychological, physiologic and social factors. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Self-injury is often motivated by the desire to reduce the intensity of negative affect. This suggests that people who self-injure may have difficulty suppressing negative emotions. We sought to determine whether self-injuring individuals exhibit impaired inhibitory control over behavioral expressions of negative emotions, when responding to images containing aversive emotional content. Self-injuring participants and healthy controls completed a Stop Signal Task in which they were asked to judge the valence (positive or negative) of images. Three types of images depicted emotional content (neutral/positive/negative). A fourth type depicted self-cutting. An unpredictable "stop signal" occurred on some trials, indicating that participants should inhibit their responses to images presented on those trials. Compared to controls, self-injuring participants showed poorer inhibition to images depicting negative emotional content. Additionally, they showed enhanced inhibition to self-injury images. In fact, self-injuring participants showed comparable response inhibition to cutting images and positive images, whereas controls showed worse inhibition to cutting images compared to all other types of images. Consistent with the emotion regulation hypothesis of self-injury, people who self-injure showed impaired negative emotional response inhibition. Self-injuring individuals also demonstrated superior control over responses to stimuli related to self-injury, which may have important clinical implications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Objectives: To describe how Dutch healthcare institutions develop and disseminate institutional practice guidelines on medical end-of-life decisions and policy statements on euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (EAS) to relevant parties, and to describe supportiveness of EAS guidelines experienced by Dutch physicians.
   Methods: Questionnaires to all Dutch health care institutions in 2005. Questionnaire to sample of Dutch clinical specialists and nursing home physicians.
   Results: In most health care institutions, physicians (79%). ethics committees (79%), board of directors (64%) and nurses (61%) were involved in the development of guidelines. The Euthanasia Act and national guidelines were the most frequently reported sources for the development (73% and 71%, respectively). Not all institutions disseminated their written EAS policy statements and practice guidelines on medical end-of-life decisions to all relevant parties. Dutch physicians who reported the presence of a written guideline for EAS in their institution, felt supported by it in their decision-making after a patient's request for EAS.
   Conclusions: It is recommended that more health care institutions pay attention to the dissemination of their policy statements and practice guidelines to relevant parties. This will only lead to improvement in medical practice if this is accompanied by efforts to also stimulate the use of guidelines in practice. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adenosine deaminase-1 and -2 (ADAR-1 and -2) are double-stranded RNA-specific enzymes involved in the editing of genes including serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT2CR) mRNA and ADAR-2 pre-mRNA. We reported that the editing efficacy of 5-HT2CR mRNA altered during brain development in rats. The present study aimed to clarify if changes in the expression of ADAR genes and the editing of ADAR-2 pre-mRNA occur during development. The expression level of ADAR-1 mRNA was constant during development, whereas the expression levels of ADAR-2 mRNA and ADAR-2 pre-mRNA markedly increased during development. ADAR-2 pre-mRNA possesses six editing sites. Editing of these sites did not occur during the embryonic period; however, the number of edited sites and the editing frequency at these sites increased after birth and cultivation period. These results suggest that the increases in ADAR-2 pre-mRNA editing and mRNA expression of the enzyme may play a role in development. We also discuss the relationship between 5-HT2CR mRNA editing and the expression/RNA editing of ADAR-1 and ADAR-2 mRNA. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

AB In order to investigate the association between effects of genetic polymorphisms of GSTT1 and GSTM1 and depression score of individuals chronically exposed to natural sour gas containing sulfur compounds, the present cross-sectional study was done. The study was performed on 124 healthy females living in the polluted area of Masjid-i-Sulaiman (MIS; Khozestan province, southwest of Iran). The GSTT1 and GSTM1 genotypes were determined using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method. Depression and hopelessness scores were determined by means of Beck's depression inventory (BDI) and Beck's hopelessness scale (BHS), respectively. The BHS score was positively correlated to the depression score (beta = 0.687, t = 10.474, p < 0.001). The GSTT1 active genotype decreased the BDI score (P = -0.161, t= -2.451, p = 0.016). Polymorphism of GSTM1 may not be a good predictive factor for BDI (beta = -0.056, t= -0.857, p = 0.393). There is no evidence for additive effect of GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms on BDI score. It is supposed that chronic exposure to natural sour gas may positively associated with DNA strand breaks and apoptosis in brain, especially in GSTT1 null genotype persons; finally living in the contaminated areas of MIS is associated with high BDI score.

AB This study evaluated dissociative symptomatology, childhood trauma and body uneasiness in 118 individuals with gender dysphoria, also evaluating dissociative symptoms in follow-up assessments after sex reassignment procedures were performed. We used both clinical interviews (Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule) and self-reported scales (Dissociative Experiences Scale). A dissociative disorder of any kind seemed to be greatly prevalent (29.6%). Moreover, individuals with gender dysphoria had a high prevalence of lifetime major depressive episode (45.8%), suicide attempts (21.2%) and childhood trauma (45.8%), and all these conditions were more frequent in patients who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for any kind of dissociative disorder. Finally, when treated, patients reported lower dissociative symptoms. Results confirmed previous research about distress in gender dysphoria and improved mental health due to sex reassignment procedures. However, it resulted to be difficult to ascertain dissociation in the context of gender dysphoria, because of the similarities between the two conditions and the possible limited application of clinical instruments which do not provide an adequate differential diagnosis. Therefore, because the body uneasiness is common to dissociative experiences and gender dysphoria, the question is whether dissociation is to be seen not as an expression of pathological dissociative experiences but as a genuine feature of gender dysphoria.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the application of item banking to questionnaire items intended to measure Deliberate Self-Harm (DSH) behaviours. The Rasch measurement model was used to evaluate behavioural items extracted from seven published DSH scales administered to 568 Australians aged 18-30 years (62% university students, 21% mental health patients, and 17% community members). Ninety four items were calibrated in the item bank (including 12 items with differential item functioning for gender and age). Tailored scale construction was demonstrated by extracting scales covering different combinations of DSH methods but with the same raw score for each person location on the latent DSH construct. A simulated computer adaptive test (starting with common self-harm methods to minimise presentation of extreme behaviours) demonstrated that 11 items (on average) were needed to achieve a standard error of measurement of 0.387 (corresponding to a Cronbach's Alpha of 0.85). This study lays the groundwork for advancing DSH measurement to an item bank approach with the flexibility to measure a specific definitional orientation (e.g., non-suicidal self-injury) or a broad continuum of self-harmful acts, as appropriate to a particular research/clinical purpose.

AB This study aimed to investigate a specific relationship between nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and a variety of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) over and above childhood abuse and their impact on frequency, severity, and functions of NSSI. A sample of 125 inpatients (aged 13 to 26) was consecutively recruited within a psychiatric university hospital. Frequency, methods and functions of NSSI were assessed by the Functional Assessment of Self-Mutilation (FASM), ACEs were assessed by the Childhood Experiences of Care and Abuse Questionnaire (CECA.Q). The 12 month prevalence of NSSI in this representative, clinical sample was 60.0%. Engagement in NSSI was significantly related to ACEs with highest associations for maternal antipathy and neglect. Whilst ACEs were not associated with frequency or severity of NSSI, some ACEs were significantly related to the automatic functions of NSSI (e.g., affect regulation, anti-dissociative function or self-punishment) as well as to a peer identification function. NSSI represents a frequent phenomenon among young clinical populations and seems to be specifically related to ACEs with maternal antipathy or neglect commonly featured over and above experiences of abuse.

AB Cyanide is a powerful chemical asphyxiant found in some forensic cases following voluntary (suicide) or involuntary ingestion (fire, accidental exposure). A quantification method for cyanide that is specifically suited to post-mortem forensic purposes was developed. Determination was performed by headspace gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry using a GS-GASPRO column on an HP-6890 gas chromatograph with an HP-5973N mass detector. The biological sample was treated with an internal standard, frozen, glacial acetic acid was added and the sample was then incubated at 60 degrees C for 15 min. The headspace was sampled with a disposable syringe, and analyzed to quantify hydrogen cyanide. Isotopically labeled cyanide ((CN)-C-13-N-15) was used as the internal standard to minimize matrix effect and sampling error. The method produced an extended linear dynamic range (0.07-50 mu g/mL), and a method detection limit of 0.02 mu g/mL. Identical calibration curves were obtained when blood, gastric contents and aqueous solutions were used as the calibration standard matrix. This method was also successful in quantitating cyanide in gastric contents, one of the most variable biological fluids. The method has been validated and is being used for current forensic cases such as fire victims and suicides. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: Cancer patients have generally requested for euthanasia and assisted suicide (EAS) more frequently than others. However, different terminal cancers are accompanied by different clinical courses. This study seeks to explore the relationship, if any, between EAS requesters and cancer types, as relates to the provision of end-of-life care in the Netherlands.
   Methods: Standardized questionnaires were retrospectively sent to all general practitioners (GPs) in 10 of 23 GP-districts in the Netherlands. Of the 3614 respondents (60%), 1442 could describe a most recent EAS request from a cancer patient.
   Results: Compared to all home cancer deaths, lung, pancreas, stomach oesophagus, lip-mouth-throat cancers and melanomas occur more frequently in the group of cancer patients who requested for EAS; while prostate, haemo-lymphatic, urinary tract, bladder and uterus cancer occur relatively less frequently. Vomiting, shortness of breath and anxiousness were symptoms positively associated, and old age was negatively associated with cancers in which patients relatively frequently request for EAS.
   Conclusion: There are differences in the extent to which patients with different cancer types request for EAS. Although shortness of breath, vomiting and anxiousness are associated with cancer types in which patients relatively frequently request for EAS, most symptoms are not associated with this. Possibly a common pathway, including more existential concerns, is important in the last stages of life. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A toxin produced by legumes of the genus Astragalus and Arthrinium fungi, 3-NPA is a suicide inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase and causes acute encephalopathy and late onset dystonia. It has been suggested that dopamine (DA) toxicity plays a role in 3-NPA induced brain damage. In order to simulate natural conditions of toxicant intake, adult, male, Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 3-NPA weekly for 24-h periods at 10 and 20 mg/40 mi in drinking water. This dosing regimen continued for 3 months with animals from both high and low dose groups sacrificed at the end of each month. Dopamine and its metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxylphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), were assessed by HPLC-EC in the frontal cortex (FC) and caudate nucleus (CN). Increases of DA. concentration were seen in both low and high dose groups in the CN after 1 and 3 months of dosing and in the FC after 2 months of exposure. An increase in DA turnover was observed in the CN of the high; dose group following 2 months of dosing. Data suggest an activation of the dopaminergic system after long-term, intermittent exposure to 3-NPA. The production of radical oxygen species associated with DA metabolism may contribute to 3-NPA-induced neurotoxicity. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB Evidence suggests abnormal bioenergetic status throughout the body in psychotic disorders. The present study examined predictors of elevated body mass index (BMI) across diagnostic categories of schizophrenia, schizoaffective and bipolar disorders. In a cross-sectional study, we studied demographic and clinical risk factors for overweight and obesity in a well-characterized sample of 262 inpatients and outpatients with schizophrenia (n=59), schizoaffective disorder (n=81) and bipolar I disorder (n=122). Across the three diagnostic categories, the prevalence of overweight (29.4%) and obesity (33.2%) combined was 62.6% (164/262). Logistic regression analyses, adjusted for age, sex and ethnicity, showed that schizoaffective disorder, lifetime major depressive episode, presence of prior suicide attempt, and more than 5 lifetime hospitalizations were significantly associated with BMI >= 25. Patients with schizophrenia had significantly lower risk for overweight and obesity. Overall, we found that affective components of illness were associated with elevated BMI in our cross-diagnostic sample. Our results show that patients with schizoaffective disorder have a greater risk for obesity. Identifying predictors of elevated BMI in patients with psychotic and mood disorders will help prevent obesity and related cardiovascular and cerebral complications. Future studies are needed to elucidate the mechanistic nature of the relationship between obesity and psychiatric illness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To develop a decision support system (DSS), myGRaCE, that integrates service user (SU) and practitioner expertise about mental health and associated risks of suicide, self-harm, harm to others, self-neglect, and vulnerability. The intention is to help SUs assess and manage their own mental health collaboratively with practitioners.
   Methods: An iterative process involving interviews, focus groups, and agile software development with 115 SUs, to elicit and implement myGRaCE requirements.
   Results: Findings highlight shared understanding of mental health risk between SUs and practitioners that can be integrated within a single model. However, important differences were revealed in SUs' preferred process of assessing risks and safety, which are reflected in the distinctive interface, navigation, tool functionality and language developed for myGRaCE. A challenge was how to provide flexible access without overwhelming and confusing users.
   Conclusion: The methods show that practitioner expertise can be reformulated in a format that simultaneously captures SU expertise, to provide a tool highly valued by SUs. A stepped process adds necessary structure to the assessment, each step with its own feedback and guidance.
   Practice Implications: The GRiST web-based DSS (www.egrist.org) links and integrates myGRaCE self-assessments with GRiST practitioner assessments for supporting collaborative and self-managed healthcare. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Previous studies have shown that various factors, such as genetic and environmental factors, contribute to the development of major depressive disorder (MDD). The aim of this study is to clarify how multiple factors, including affective temperaments, childhood abuse and adult life events, are involved in the severity of depressive symptoms in MDD. A total of 98 participants with MDD were studied using the following self-administered questionnaire surveys: Patient Health Questionnaire-9 measuring the severity of depressive symptoms; Life Experiences Survey (LES) measuring negative and positive adult life events; Temperament Evaluation of the Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego auto-questionnaire (TEMPS A) measuring affective temperaments; and the Child Abuse and Trauma Scale (CATS) measuring childhood abuse. The data were analyzed using single and multiple regression analyses and structural equation modeling (SEM). The neglect score reported by CATS indirectly predicted the severity of depressive symptoms through affective temperaments measured by TEMPS-A in SEM. Four temperaments (depressive, cyclothymic, irritable, and anxious) directly predicted the severity of depressive symptoms. The negative change in the LES score also directly predicted severity. This study suggests that childhood abuse, especially neglect, indirectly increases the severity of depressive symptoms through increased scores of affective temperaments in MDD.

AB Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent and frequently comorbid psychiatric disorder. This study evaluates the development of depressive symptoms, MDD diagnosis, and suicidal ideation in a high-risk sample (N=524) diagnosed with conduct disorder (CD) and substance use disorder (SUD) symptoms as youth and re-assessed approximately 6.5 years later. Dual trajectory classes of both alcohol and other drug use (AOD) and antisocial behavior (ASB), previously identified using latent class growth analyses (LCGA), were used to predict depression outcomes. The Dual Chronic, Increasing AOD/Persistent ASB, and Decreasing Drugs/Persistent ASB classes had higher past-week depression scores, more past-year MDD symptoms, and were more likely to have past-year MDD than the Resolved class. The Dual Chronic and Decreasing Drugs/Persistent ASB classes also had more past-year MDD symptoms than the Persistent AOD/Adolescent ASB class. Youth at highest risk for developing or maintaining depression in adulthood had the common characteristic of persistent antisocial behavior. This suggests young adulthood depression is associated more with persistent antisocial behavior than with persistent substance use in comorbid youth. As such, interventions targeting high-risk youth, particularly those with persistent antisocial behavior, are needed to help reduce the risk of severe psychosocial consequences (including risk for suicide) in adulthood.

AB Social and economic policies are inextricably linked with population health outcomes in Europe, yet few datasets are able to fully explore and compare this relationship across European countries. The European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) survey aims to address this gap using microdata on income, living conditions and health. EU-SILC contains both cross-sectional and longitudinal elements, with nationally representative samples of individuals 16 years and older in 28 European Union member states as well as Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. Data collection began in 2003 in Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Greece, Luxembourg and Austria, with subsequent expansion across Europe. By 2011, all 28 EU member states, plus three others, were included in the dataset. Although EU-SILC is administered by Eurostat, the data are output-harmonized so that countries are required to collect specified data items but are free to determine sampling strategies for data collection purposes. EU-SILC covers approximately 500 000 European residents for its cross-sectional survey annually. Whereas aggregated data from EU-SILC are publicly available [http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/income-and-living-conditions/data/main-tables], microdata are only available to research organizations subject to approval by Eurostat. Please refer to [http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/microdata/eu_silc] for further information regarding microdata access.

AB Apoplastic superoxide radical level in wheat mesophyll protoplasts was evaluated under different light intensities. Conditions that enhanced chloroplastic reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, such as high light intensity, paraquat treatments, or choloplastic Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) overexpression, increased the level of apoplastic superoxide. By contrast, the addition of diphenyl iodonium, a suicide NADPH oxidase inhibitor; DCMU, an herbicide that blocks plastoquinone reduction; and EGTA, a Ca2+ chelator, decreased the superoxide level in the apoplast. Intracellular ROS production was rapidly stimulated by high light intensity and paraquat, and decreased in the presence of DCMU. The association between apoplastic superoxide level and total activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) (E.C.:1.15.1.1), glutathione reductase (GR) (E.C.:1.6.4.2), ascobate peroxidase (APX) (E.C.:1.11.1.11), and catalase (CAT) (E.C.:1.11.1.6) was also evaluated. Changes in apoplastic superoxide level were positively correlated with activities of antioxidant enzymes mainly located in the chloroplasts, but not with CAT activity, which is located in peroxisomes and mitochondria. Regulation of apoplastic superoxide level by chloroplastic ROS and plastoquinone redox state is discussed, as well as its role in modulating antioxidant defense responses under photooxidative stress.

AB Context. Gathering information on the circumstances that give rise to unintentional domestic non-fire related carbon monoxide poisoning and the associated morbidity and mortality is not straightforward because the diagnosis is so often missed in life. Methods. We searched Newsbank and related databases (at least 332 sources, UK and Republic of Ireland) for reports of domestic carbon monoxide poisoning, 1986-end 2011 inclusive. The search terms were 'carbon monoxide AND (house* OR home* OR caravan* OR tent*) NOT (work OR fire OR suicide*)'. Newsbank includes full-text articles from 19 UK national newspapers and over 140 UK & Irish regional and local newspapers and periodicals. Results and discussion. There were reports of 348 incidents (880 victims: 334 male, 352 female, 194 sex not stated). Reports of incidents increased from 1986 (1) to 2011 (28). There were 298 deaths (169 male, 124 female, 5 sex not reported). The likelihood of a fatal outcome increased with age for both males and females (28%, 1-9 years; 71%, 80 + years). The source of carbon monoxide was often a central heating or water boiler (48% of 244 incidents). Many incidents (49%) occurred in private dwellings. However, incidents in caravans, tents, sheds and outhouses had a much higher death rate. If a victim was discovered alive chances of survival were relatively good (87%), even if found unconscious. The estimated duration of carbon monoxide exposure ranged from minutes to years in both fatal and non-fatal incidents. Pets were recorded in 31 incidents (17 died). In 5 cases, carbon monoxide poisoning was identified through illness or death of a pet. Prosecutions were recorded in 49 incidents and at least 7 custodial (prison) sentences resulted, with 34 further convictions resulting in a fine. Charges were preferred against either an installer/maintenance engineer (42%), or the landlord (31%). Conclusion. Deaths and permanent injuries from unintentional domestic non-fire related carbon monoxide poisoning continue. Survival rates are relatively high if poisoning is diagnosed in life, but warning signs are often missed and inappropriate behavior such as placing barbecues in tents and failure to perform proper safety checks by gas appliance fitters still kills.

AB Objectives Comorbidity is a common feature of mental disorders. However, needs assessment surveys focus largely on individual disorders rather than on comorbidity even though the latter is more important for predicting suicidal thoughts and behaviors. In the current report, we take a step beyond this conventional approach by presenting data on the prevalence and correlates (sociodemographic factors, college-related factors, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors) of the main multivariate profiles of common comorbid Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV disorders among students participating in the first phase of the World Health Organization World Mental Health International College Student initiative. Method A web-based mental health survey was administered to first year students in 19 colleges across eight countries (Australia, Belgium, Germany, Mexico, Northern Ireland, South Africa, Spain, United States; 45.5% pooled response rate) to screen for seven common DSM-IV mental disorders: major depression, mania/hypomania, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, alcohol use disorder, and drug use disorder. We focus on the 14,348 respondents who provided complete data; 38.4% screened positive for at least one 12-month disorder. Results Multivariate disorder profiles were detected using latent class analysis (LCA). The least common class (C1; 1.9% of students) was made up of students with high comorbidity (four or more disorders, the majority including mania/hypomania). The remaining 12-month cases had profiles of internalizing-externalizing comorbidity (C2; 5.8%), internalizing comorbidity (C3; 14.6%), and pure disorders (C4; 16.1%). The 1.9% of students in C1 had much higher prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors than other students. Specifically, 15.4% of students in C1 made a suicide attempt in the 12 months before the survey compared with 1.3-2.6% of students with disorders in C2-4, 0.2% of students with lifetime disorders but no 12-month disorders (C5), and 0.1% of students with no lifetime disorders (C6). Conclusions In line with prior research, comorbid mental disorders were common; however, sociodemographic correlates of LCA profiles were modest. The high level of comorbidity underscores the need to develop and test transdiagnostic approaches for treatment in college students.

AB This study sought to identify (a) subgroups among people confronted with unnatural/violent loss characterized by different symptoms profiles of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) and depression, and (b) socio-demographic, loss-related, and cognitive variables associated with subgroup membership. We used data from 245 individuals confronted with the death of a loved one due to an accident (47.3%), suicide (49%) or homicide (3.7%). Latent class analysis revealed three classes of participants: a resilient class (25.3%), a predominantly PGD-class (39.2%), and a combined PGD/Depression-class (35.5%). Membership in the resilient-class was predicted by longer time since loss and lower age; membership in the combined class was predicted by lower education. Endorsement of negative cognitions about the self, life, the future, and one's own grief-reactions was lowest in the Resilient-class, intermediate in the PGD-class, and highest in the combined PGD/Depression-class. When all socio-demographic, loss-related, and cognitive variables were included in multinomial regression analyses predicting class-membership, it was found that negative cognitions about one's grief was the only variable predicting membership of the PGD-class. Negative cognitions about the self, life, and grief predicted membership of the combined PGD/Depression-class. These findings provide valuable information for the development of interventions for different subgroups of bereaved individuals confronted with unnatural/violent loss. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB In forensic research, biomechanical analyses of falls are widely reported. However, no study on falls consecutive to uncontrolled hanging release, when a hanging body is cut down, has ever been published. In such cases, the presence of cranial trauma can raise interpretation issues, and there may be doubt as to whether the fall was an accident or a crime disguised as suicide. The problem remains as to whether or not a fall after a free hanging release can lead to a skull fracture. To address this question, numerical simulations, post-mortem human subject tests and parametric studies were performed. We first recreated the kinematics and velocity of this atypical fall with post-mortem human subject tests and multibody simulations. We then tested the influence of biological variability on fracture production using a finite element model of the head. Our results show that fall severity depends largely on the direction of the fall. The risk of fracture is highest in the occipital region and with a backward fall. Our study also highlights the frequent occurrence of lower limb trauma in a free hanging release. Most importantly, we show that a fracture is produced in only 3.4% of falls that occur in a 10-90 cm height range. The overall findings of this study provide tools for pathologists and magistrates to decide on the most likely scenario and to justify further forensic investigations if required.

AB Cholesterol and uric acid, which might correlate with steroidogenesis and monoamine functions, may change under emotionally stressful conditions and in mental disturbances. Among anxiety disorders, an increase of serum cholesterol has been observed in panic disorder. However, the issue has not been adequately investigated in other anxiety disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The present study investigated serum cholesterols, uric acid and cholinesterase in victims of the Tokyo subway sarin poisoning, 1995, in a series of 5-year follow-ups. Cholinesterase was studied, in relevance with serum lipid changes and symptoms of PTSD, and also in light of a biological effect of satin. Out of 34 victims, eight developed PTSD and two were currently diagnosed with PTSD using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). No significant relationship was observed between PTSD and serum cholesterols or uric acid. Several factors including co-occurrence of other mental disturbances with PTSD, in addition to the limited sample size, might have affected the result. In contrast, serum cholinesterase level was significantly reduced in the victims with the development of PTSD, compared with the matched controls (P < 0.02, t-test). This might partly reflect a long-term remnant effect of satin intoxication, although an effect of the psychological experience could not be totally excluded.

AB Anxiety and depression frequently co-occur with borderline personality disorder. Relatively little research examined the presence of borderline personality features and its main domains (affective instability, identity problems, negative relationships and self-harm) in individuals with remitted and current anxiety and depression. Participants with current (n=597) or remitted (n=1115) anxiety and/or depression and healthy controls (n=431) were selected from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. Assessments included the Personality Assessment Inventory Borderline Features Scale and several clinical characteristics of anxiety and depression.
   Borderline personality features were more common in depression than in anxiety. Current comorbid anxiety and depression was associated with most borderline personality features. Anxiety and depression status explained 29.7% of the variance in borderline personality features and 3.8% (self-harm) to 31% (identity problems) of the variance in the four domains. A large part of the variance was shared between anxiety and depression but both disorders also explained a significant amount of unique variance. The severity of anxiety and depression and the level of daily dysfunctioning was positively associated with borderline personality features. Individuals with a longer duration of anxiety and depression showed more affective instability and identity problems. These findings suggest that patients with anxiety and depression may benefit from an assessment of personality pathology as it may have implications for psychological and pharmacological treatment.

AB Underdeveloped recognition systems or predictors for negative consequences related to depression in the older adult put this population at a significant risk for suicide, medical illness, and poor health status. Research concerning strategies for predicting depression in the older adult population has not until recently focused on the possibility of measuring one's EI as a potential predictive factor. To address an aspect of this neglect, the present quantitative correlational study explored to what extent the total Emotional Quotient (EQ) scale score of EI predicted depression. Two self-report measures were utilized: the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short (GDS-Short), and the Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory: Short (EQ-i:S). A purposive sample of 128 men and women (ages 65 and older) were recruited from local recreation centers and independent living facilities. To determine the extent to which EQ-i:S scaled score predicted depression, multiple logistic regression analysis was carried out. After accounting for age, education, and anti-depressant use, EQ-i:S scaled score had a statistically significant effect OR = 0.94 (0.91, 0.97), p < 0.001. This result indicated that for every 1-point increase in EQ-i: S scaled score, the risk of having depression decreased by 6%. The results indicated that increased EI has a beneficial effect in terms of current depression status. Future longitudinal research in examining EI as a predictor for depression in the older adult population is needed to substantiate and expand upon these findings. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Peroxynitrite is formed in biological systems when superoxide and nitric oxide are produced at near equimolar ratio. Although not a free radical by chemical nature (as it has no unpaired electron), peroxynitrite is a powerful oxidant exhibiting a wide array of tissue damaging effects ranging from lipid peroxidation, inactivation of enzymes and ion channels via protein oxidation and nitration to inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. Low concentrations of peroxynitrite trigger apoptotic death, whereas higher concentrations induce necrosis with cellular energetics (ATP and NAD) serving as switch between the two modes of cell death. Peroxynitrite also damages DNA and thus triggers the activation of DNA repair systems. A DNA nick sensor enzyme, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) also becomes activated upon sensing DNA breakage. Activated PARP-1 cleaves NAD(+) into nicotinamide and ADP-ribose and polymerizes the latter on nuclear acceptor proteins. Peroxynitrite-induced overactivation of PARP consumes NAD(+) and consequently ATP culminating in cell dysfunction, apoptosis or necrosis. This cellular suicide mechanism has been implicated among others in the pathomechanism of stroke, myocardial ischemia, diabetes and diabetes-associated cardiovascular dysfunction. Here, we review the cytotoxic effects (apoptosis and necrosis) of peroxynitrite focusing on the role of accelerated ADP-ribose turnover. Regulatory mechanisms of peroxynitrite-induced cytotoxicity such as antioxidant status, calcium signalling, NFkappaB activation, protein phosphorylation, cellular adaptation are also discussed.

AB The aim of this study was to explore the clinical and family history correlates of depression with racing thoughts, an understudied phenomenon. Consecutive outpatients with a major depressive episode (MDE, N=336; unipolar subtype. n = 130; bipolar-II subtype, n = 206) were interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders-Clinician Version. Depression with racing thoughts was present in 213 patients (63.3%), a subgroup characterized by significantly more patients with bipolar-II disorder, lower age and lower age of onset, more atypical features, psychomotor agitation, diminished ability to think, suicidal ideation, guilt, leaden paralysis, MDE symptoms, and bipolar-II disorder family history than found in the subgroup without racing thoughts. Logistic regression controlled the diagnosis of bipolar-II disorder (which was associated with most of these variables). Comparisons in the separate bipolar-II and unipolar samples of depression with racing thoughts vs. the variables found significantly different in the total group found that associations with depression with racing thoughts were partly related to bipolar-II and partly related to unipolar diagnoses. Limitations of the study include reliance upon a single interviewer, non-blind cross-sectional assessment and bipolar-II diagnosis based on history. Depression with racing thoughts was very common in depressed outpatients, and was associated with suicidal ideation. Possible differential effects of antidepressants vs. mood stabilizers and antipsychotics are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aconite is a well-known toxic-plant containing Aconitum alkaloids such as aconitines, benzoylaconines, and aconins. We describe here the distribution of Aconitum alkaloids detected by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) in three autopsy cases of suicide by aconite poisoning. Case 1: a male in his fifties had eaten aconite leaves. The concentrations of jesaconitine in cardiac blood, urine, and kidney were 12.1 ng/ml, 993.0 ng/ml, and 114.2 ng/g, respectively. Case 2: a female in her fifties had eaten aconite root. The aconite root in the stomach included a high level of mesaconitine. The concentrations of mesaconitine in cardiac blood, liver, and kidney were 69.1 ng/ml, 960.9 ng/g, and 776.9 ng/g, respectively. Case 3: a male in his sixties had drunk liquor in which aconite root had been soaked. The concentrations of mesaconitine and aconitine in cardiac blood were 259.5 and 228.5 ng/ml, respectively. The Aconitum alkaloid levels were very high in the liver. The absorption of ethanol and Aconitum alkaloids might have been increased because of his having undergone total gastrectomy. In all three cases, the Aconitum alkaloid levels were high in the liver and kidney and low in the heart and cerebrum. The level in the cerebrum was lower than that in blood. Data on the distribution of the Aconitum alkaloids in the body in cases of aconite poisoning is useful to elucidate various actions of aconite alkaloids. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Aim: Previous studies indicate that Norwegian physicians hold conservative attitudes towards ethically controversial end-of-life decisions. The present study was undertaken to explore whether in Norway euthanasia may be hidden under labels such as death after analgesic injections and withholding or withdrawing treatment. Methods: A postal questionnaire containing 76 questions on ethical, collegial and professional autonomy issues was sent to a representative sample of 1616 active physicians in Norway in 2000, Results: 83% responded. A total of had terminated life-prolonging treatment based on the resource situation, while 53.5 and 40.1% respectively had stopped life prolonging treatment due to the wish of the patient and the wish of the patient's relatives. Although not significantly. anaesthesiologists more often reported to have stopped treatment due to resource considerations. One percent of the physicians reported to have shortened a patient s life intentionally (other than stopping futile treatment). All of these were men. Logistic regression showed no effect when gender, age and specialty were analysed simultaneously. 10.6%, and male more often than female physicians, had had experience of unintentional patient death in relation to pain treatment. Anaesthesiologists had had experiences of death following an analgesic injection no more than other specialists. Conclusions: Only a small minority of Norwegian physicians has committed euthanasia. Ho ever, patient death has occurred following ethically questionable decisions such as withdrawal of treatment based on resource considerations and requests from the family.

AB Elevated mortality risk in anorexia nervosa has been established, but less is known about the outcomes of bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. In this follow-up study we determined mortality in adults (N=2450, 95% women) admitted to the eating disorder clinic of the Helsinki University Central Hospital in the period 1995-2010. Most of the patients (80.7%) were outpatients. For each patient four controls were selected and matched for age, sex and place of residence. The matching was taken into account by modelling end-point events using Cox's proportional hazard model. The hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality was 6.51 (95% CI 3.46-12.26) in broad anorexia nervosa (AN), 2.97 (95% CI 1.90-4.65) in broad bulimia nervosa (BN), and 1.77 (95% CI 0.60-527) in binge eating disorder (BED). Mortality risk in broad AN was highest during the first years after admission but declined thereafter, while in broad BN the mortality risk started to rise two years after the first admission. The HR for suicide was elevated both in broad AN (HR 5.07; 95% CI 1.37-18.84) and in broad BN (HR 6.07; 95% CI 2.47-14.89). Results show that eating disorders are associated with increased mortality risk even when specialised treatment is available. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Studies demonstrating greater problem severity in substance abuse patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) versus those without have rarely considered other co-occurring psychiatric disorders. This study of 466 male veterans recently admitted to outpatient substance abuse treatment attempts to identify problems associated with PTSD versus those associated with other nonsubstance use Axis I disorders. Problem severity, particularly psychiatric. was examined across four groups of patients with substance use disorders (SUDs). Those with: 1, SUDs only (SU-Only); 2, PTSD, but no other Axis I disorders (SU + PTSID): 3, PTSD and other Axis I disorders (SU + PTSD + Axis 1): and 4, no PTSD, but other Axis I disorders (SU + other Axis 1). Results suggested a hierarchy of psychiatric, and to a lesser extent, other life problem severities associated with these diagnostic groupings. The most severe group was SU + PTSD + Axis 1, followed in decreasing severity by the SU + other Axis 1, SU + PTSD, and SU-Only groups. Additional analyses comparing the SU + PTSD + Axis I patients with a subgroup of Axis I patients with more than one Axis I disorder (SU + multiple Axis 1) revealed few group differences except for more lifetime suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations in the SU + PTSD + Axis I group. The findings suggest that it is not PTSD per se, but the frequent co-occurrence of PTSD and other psychopathology that largely accounts for previously reported greater problem severity of SLID patients with PTSD.

AB The literature on symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in alcoholic patients is scarce and such symptoms can go unnoticed, worsening the prognosis of alcoholism. The objectives were to estimate the prevalence and severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in alcoholics undergoing outpatient treatment and to assess sociodemographic and clinical correlates, including suicidal behaviors. The instruments used in this cross-sectional study were the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory - Revised (OCI-R), the Short Alcohol Dependence Data and the Beck Depression Inventory. After descriptive analyses, bi-variate analyses between the categorical ("probable OCD": OCI-R >= 27) and dimensional (OCI-R total and subscales scores) outcomes and all explanatory variables were conducted. Eleven (20.4%) of the 54 alcoholic patients (37 men and 17 women) presented "probable OCD", which was associated with lower income, more severe dependence, depression, lifetime suicidal thoughts and plans and suicide attempts. OCI-R severity (mean 16.0) was associated with the same predictors and with psychiatric hospitalization. Suicidal behaviors were mainly associated with the Obsession, Hoarding and Washing subscales. It is essential to investigate and treat OCD symptoms in alcoholics, as they are associated with greater severity of dependence, depression and suicidal behaviors. Longitudinal studies are required to assess the impact of OCD treatment on the clinical course of alcoholism. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Transgenic mice with a knock-in (KI) of a tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Tph2) R439H mutation, analogous to the Tph2 R441H single-nucleotide polymorphism originally identified in a late life depression cohort, have markedly reduced levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). These Tph2KI mice are therefore interesting as a putative translational model of low endogenous 5-HT function that allows for assessment of adaptive changes in different anatomical regions. Here, we determined 5-HT2A receptor binding in several brain regions using in vitro receptor autoradiography and two different radioligands. When using the 5-HT2A receptor selective antagonist radioligand H-3-MDL100907, we found higher binding in the prefrontal cortex (10%, P = 0.009), the striatum (26%, P = 0.005), and the substantia nigra (21%, P = 0.027). The increase was confirmed in the same regions with the 5-HT2A/c receptor agonist, H-3-CIMBI-36 (2-(4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethanamine). 5-HT2A receptors establish heteromeric receptor complexes with metabotropic glutamate 2 receptors (mGluR2), but binding levels of the mGluR2/3 ligand H-3-LY341495 were unaltered in brain areas with increased 5-HT2A receptor levels. These data show that in distinct anatomical regions, 5-HT2A receptor binding sites are up-regulated in 5-HT deficient mice, and this increase is not associated with changes in mGluR2 binding.

AB Despite the common use of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) with adolescents, there is limited data supporting its validity with this population. The aims of the study were to investigate the psychometric properties of the GHQ-12 among high school students, to validate the GHQ-12 against the gold standard of a diagnostic interview, and to suggest a threshold score for detecting depressive and anxiety disorders. Six hundred and fifty-four high school students from years 10 to 12 (ages 15-18) completed the GHQ-12 (Liken scored) and the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV-Test Revision (DSM-IV-TR). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted. The mean GHQ-12 score for the total sample was 9.9 (S.D.=5.4). Results from the ROC curve indicated that the GHQ-12 performed better than chance at identifying depressive and anxiety disorders (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.781). A GHQ-12 threshold score of 9/10 for males and 10/11 for females was found to be optimal. Given the significant proportion of mental illness among high school students, there may be a need to introduce screening for mental illnesses as part of the school curriculum. This can assist with the early identification and enable low stigma preventive intervention within the school environment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Psychotic symptoms are distributed along a continuum that extends from normality to diagnosable psychotic disorders and the presence of psychoticism among individuals in the general population may lead to morbidity and social impairment. This study examined a model in which psychoticism leads to several important psychological consequences. The analysis included 134 African Americans with no psychiatric history who were being seen in medical walk-in clinics for non-emergency medical problems. Psychoticism, perceived hassles, depression, hostility, and hopelessness were measured. The Linear Structural Relations Program (LISREL) was used to test the fit of the data to the proposed model, a trimmed hierarchical version, and two alternative models. The data supported a model in which psychoticism has substantial effects on several important characteristics: perceived daily hassles, depression, and hostility. Depression mediated the association between psychoticism and hopelessness. Goodness-of-fit indices for a final trimmed model that eliminated one path from the initial postulated model revealed good fit to the data, and the two alternative models were found not to fit the data. Like psychosis itself, psychoticism appears to cause meaningful dysfunction even among non-psychiatric individuals from the general population. Additional research is needed to further characterize the detrimental effects of psychoticism or self-reported psychotic symptoms in the general, non-psychiatric population.

AB Caustic ingestion with resultant corrosive esophagitis in the pediatric population comprises a heterogeneous group in terms of offending agent, location of burn and the degree of damage. Consequently, the treatment of these injuries has also varied over the years and the optimal management remains controversial. Another area of concern that is seldom reported in the otolaryngology literature is the socioeconomic impact of such injuries both on the child and on the family. We report a 30-year retrospective review of aerodigestive tract caustic injuries at The Hospital for Sick Children. Eighty patients were identified with an age range from 1 month to 16 years. Early and late complications are reviewed including 23 patients (29%) that developed medical complications and 16 patients (20%) that developed severe esophageal strictures. Five of these children required repeat prograde dilatation, while 11 children required gastrostomy and stringing with subsequent retrograde dilatation. All the 11 children required esophageal replacement surgery. The economic and social consequences to the child and family were also noted with particular attention to hospital costs, parental absenteeism from work, and the need for job relocation. A partial cost analysis using a child with a severe injury is presented as an example. Psychological aspects such as attempted murder, jail terms and attempted suicides are also documented. We also present an analysis of those children requiring esophageal replacement surgery, and examine the possible role of esophageal stents in recalcitrant strictures.

AB Risk of suicide has been associated with trauma and negative life events in several studies. Our aim was to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of suicidal ideation, and the population attributable risk among workers after occupational injuries. We investigated workers who had been hospitalized for >= 3 days after occupational injuries between February 1 and August 31, 2009. A self-reported questionnaire including demographic data, injury condition, and the question of suicidal ideation was sent to 4498 workers at 3 months after their occupational injury. A total of 2001 workers (45.5%) completed the questionnaires and were included in final analysis. The prevalence of reporting suicidal ideation was 8.3%. After mutual adjustment, significant risk factors for suicidal ideation higher than "serious" in a self-rated severity scale (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 2.31; adjusted population attributable risk, aPAR = 34.7%), total hospital stay for 8 days or longer (OR = 1.98; aPAR = 20.5%), intracranial injury (OR = 2.30; aPAR = 10.2%), and marriage status of being divorced/separated/widowed (OR = 2.70; aPAR = 10.0%). Three months after occupational injury, a significant proportion of workers suffered from suicidal ideation. Significant predictors of suicidal ideation after occupational injury included broken marriage, intracranial injury, injury severity, and total hospital stay. Identification of high risk subjects for early intervention is warranted. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Few studies to date have been performed to investigate impulsivity and aggressivity in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD); the primary aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of co-morbidity of BPD on impulsivity and aggressivity in patients affected by BD. A total of 57 patients (male = 20, female = 37) affected by BD (BD-I 51%; BD-II 49%) in clinical stable remission were recruited; 28 patients were affected by BD (49.1%), 18 by BD and BPD (31.6%) and 11(19.3%) by BD plus other personality disorders (OPD) (19.3%). They were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)-I and SCID-II, and were evaluated by means of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-severity and Global Assessment Functioning (GAF) scales, the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11) and the Aggression Questionnaire (AQ). Mean total scores were significantly higher among BD/BPD patients with respect to BD and to BD/OPD, both on the BIS-11 and the AQ the rate of attempted suicides was approximately three times higher in BD/BPD patients with respect to BD and 7.6 times higher than in BD/OPD patients. The results of our study suggest that patients with co-morbid BD and BPD are more impulsive and aggressive. Furthermore, this co-morbid condition may be a risk factor for suicidality.

AB Previous in vitro binding studies identified a 7-fluoro derivative of marsanidine, a partial alpha(2)-adrenoceptor (alpha(2)-AR) agonist, to display high affinity and selectivity for alpha(2)-AR over alpha(1)-AR, imidazoline-1 and imidazoline-2 binding sites. In the present study 7-fluoro-marsanidine is further characterised in vivo to investigate its pharmacological effects on extracellular noradrenaline (NA) levels at frontal cortex in conscious freely moving rats using the technique of in vivo brain microdialysis. Peripheral administration of 7-fluoro-marsanidine via intraperitoneal (i.p.) route at the dose of 0.1 mg/kg slightly, but non-significantly, decreased extracellular NA level (maximum by 17% at 20 min) in rat frontal cortex compared to basal level. At a higher dose of 1 mg/kg, 7-fluoro-marsanidine reduced cortical NA level (maximum by 73% at 40 min) significantly as compared to basal level between 20 and 80 min. In addition, systemic administration of 7-fluoro-marsanidine at both the doses produced rapid onset of sedation in rats. These data suggest that 7-fluoro-marsanidine is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and, by acting as an alpha(2)-AR agonist, reduces extracellular NA levels in rat frontal cortex in a dose related manner. Thus, initial studies indicate 7-fluoro-marsanidine to possess favourable functional properties at alpha(2)-AR. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study investigated characteristics of recreational drug users, especially 'ecstasy' (MDMA) users, in 254 undergraduates. All participants completed a drug history questionnaire (DHQ), the impulsiveness venturesomeness and empathy questionnaire, a novel risk-taking task (Bets16), and 59 also completed the tri-dimensional personality questionnaire (TPQ). DHQ responses allocated participants to five groups: non-drug controls, cannabis users, polydrug (no ecstasy) users, low (<20 occasions) ecstasy users and high (>20 occasions) ecstasy users. Eighteen percent of the sample had used ecstasy and of the ecstasy users, only one had not used other substances. A larger proportion of high ecstasy users had also used amphetamines, cocaine and LSD in comparison to the low ecstasy and non-ecstasy polydrug users. High ecstasy users typically took significantly more ecstasy tablets compared with low ecstasy users. Impulsiveness, venturesomeness and novelty seeking behaviour increased from the non-drug users to high ecstasy users. Ecstasy users (low and high) and polydrug (non-ecstasy) users had higher levels of impulsivity, venturesomeness and novelty seeking behaviour compared with non-drug users. Furthermore, high ecstasy users scored hi-her on the Bets 16 risk-taking measure than non-drug users, cannabis users and low ecstasy users. The findings are discussed in relation to: (i) the possibility that increased impulsivity pre-dated drug use; and (ii) the possible link between impulsivity and the putative serotonergic neurotoxicity of ecstasy.

AB Behavioral impulsivity in borderline personality disorder (BPD) is associated with indices of diminished central serotonergic function, independent of suicidal behavior, depression or alcohol use disorder. Many of these studies have been conducted among males in specialized settings. Studies of BPD females, who constitute the majority of BPD patients, are generally conducted in community settings and report inconsistent findings. We studied gender differences in behavioral impulsivity and the prolactin response to D,L-fenfluramine (FEN) in BPD subjects in a community setting. A FEN challenge study was conducted with 64 BPD subjects (20 male, 44 female), and 57 controls (36 male, 21 female). Axis I and II disorders, including BPD, and suicidal histories were assessed by structured interviews. Controls were free of Axis I and II disorders. Impulsivity and aggression were assessed by the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Psychopathic Deviate subscale, and the Brown-Goodwin Lifetime History of Aggression. Male, but not female, BPD subjects had significantly diminished prolactin responses compared to controls. Impulsivity and aggression each predicted prolactin responses. A significant effect of BPD diagnosis on prolactin response was eliminated when impulsivity was co-varied. Impulsivity and aggression were inversely related to delta-prolactin and peak-prolactin responses among male but not female subjects. Gender differences in central serotonergic function may contribute to variations in impulsivity in BPD. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB It has been suggested that abnormal function of the serotonergic system may be implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. In order to examine the role of this system in schizophrenia, we have determined 5-HT2A receptors on human platelets of 20 control subjects and 37 schizophrenic patients by using [H-3]spiperone and ketanserin. The data showed that the maximum number (B-max) of 5-HT2A receptors for schizophrenic patients without neuroleptic therapy was significantly higher than that for control subjects. The B-max values for [H-3]spiperone binding to platelets of schizophrenic patients on butyrophenone, phenothiazine, benzisosazole and thioxanthene therapies were significantly lower than those obtained from the drug-free group, but were comparable to control values. The effect of various medication periods on platelet 5-HT2A receptors was also examined. We found that after 2-4 weeks, 1-4 months, 4-12 months and more than 1 year of neuroleptic treatments, the B-max values were significantly decreased when compared with values in the drug-free group. The present results indicate that treatment with various types of neuroleptics decreases the hypersensitivity of platelet 5-HT2A receptors. Significant clinical improvements occurred in all types of neuroleptic-treated groups and for all different treatment durations in this study. The precise mechanisms of how neuroleptics achieve their therapeutic effects still need to be further delineated. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Depression is a disease that can dramatically lower quality of life. Symptoms of depression can range from temporary sadness to suicide. Embarrassment, shyness, and the stigma of depression are some of the factors preventing people from getting help for their problems. Contemporary social media technologies like Internet forums or micro-blogs give people the opportunity to talk about their feelings in a confidential anonymous environment. However, many participants in such networks may not recognize the severity of their depression and their need for professional help. Our approach is to develop a method that detects symptoms of depression in free text, such as posts in Internet forums, chat rooms and the like. This could help people appreciate the significance of their depression and realize they need to seek help. In this work Natural Language Processing methods are used to break the textual information into its grammatical units. Further analysis involves detection of depression symptoms and their frequency with the help of words known as indicators of depression and their synonyms. Finally, similar to common paper-based depression scales, e.g., the CESD, that information is incorporated into a single depression score.
   In this evaluation study, our depressive mood detection system, Depre SD (Depression Symptom Detection), had an average precision of 0.84 (range 0.72-1.0 depending on the specific measure) and an average F measure of 0.79 (range 0.72-0.9). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Previous studies of postmortem orbitofrontal cortex have shown abnormalities in levels of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in individuals with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder (MOD). We have previously measured PUFA levels in the postmortem hippocampus from patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and control subjects; however, we found no significant differences between the groups except for small changes in n-6 PUFAs. Furthermore, our study of the postmortem amygdala showed no significant differences in major PUFAs in individuals with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or MDD in comparison with controls. In the present study, we investigated whether there were any changes in PUFAs in the entorhinal cortexes of patients with schizophrenia (n=15), bipolar disorder (n=15), or MDD (n=15) compared with unaffected controls (n=15) matched for characteristics including age and sex. In contrast to previous studies of the orbitofrontal cortex and hippocampus, we found no significant differences in major PUFAs. However, we found a 34.3% decrease in docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) (22:5n-3) in patients with MDD and an 8.7% decrease in docosatetraenoic acid (22:4n-6) in those with schizophrenia, compared with controls. Changes in PUFAs in patients with these psychiatric disorders may be specific to certain brain regions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background and objectives: Previous research on the toxicology of homicide has shown that about half of offenders and victims have psychoactive substances in their blood. The purpose of this study was to examine this topic in a Swedish setting.
   Methods: Toxicological data were sought in a database for all victims (n = 273) and perpetrators (n = 257) of homicide in Sweden from 2007 to 2009. Sufficient tests were identified for 97.1% of all victims (n = 265) and 46.7% of all offenders (n = 120). Additional information was obtained from court records and police reports.
   Results: A majority of individuals involved in homicides displayed positive toxicology (57.0% of victims and 62.5% of offenders). The most commonly detected substances, in both victims and offenders, were ethanol (44.9% vs. 40.8%) and benzodiazepines (8.3% vs. 19.2%). The difference between offenders and victims concerning benzodiazepines was statistically significant (OR 2.6; p = 0.002). Perpetrators of homicide-suicide had a lower prevalence of positive toxicology (30.8%) than other homicide offenders (66.4%; p = 0.04) and victims in unsolved cases more often exhibited positive drug toxicology compared to victims in solved cases (36.1% vs. 8.3%; p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: The results of the study support the notion that substance abuse is firmly linked to committing homicide and to becoming a victim thereof. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Depressive disorders represent a significant health concern as they are associated with high social and physical dysfunction and increased risk for suicide. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the most effective treatment for patients with drug-resistant severe depressive disorders. However, the underlying biological mechanisms of ECT are not well characterized. In particular, the regulation of transcription factors upon ECT has only just started to be unveiled. The schizophrenia and bipolar disorder associated bromodomain containing 1 (BRD1) gene is important for the acetylation of histone H3K14 and holds a key role in normal embryonic development and survival. In this study, we have measured Brd1 mRNA in the hippocampus and the frontal cortex of male Sprague-Dawley rats upon acute and repeated electroconvulsive seizures (ECS) over a period of 10 days. We found an increase in the general expression of Brd1 mRNA in the hippocampus after repeated ECS compared to sham (F=8.108, P=0.003). Furthermore, we provide evidence suggesting a decrease in the expression of the Brd1 mRNA variant comprising an extended version of exon 7 (Brd1-L) in the frontal cortex after repeated ECS compared to sham (F=6.225, P=0.023). These findings indicate that regulation of the Brd1 gene is part of the biological response to ECS and that splice variants are induced differentially in different brain regions.

TI Pregnancy-related deaths in four regions of Europe and the United States

AB Objective: We compared official maternal mortality statistics with those from a special study covering all pregnancy-associated deaths in two European countries (Finland and France) and in two US states (Massachusetts and North Carolina) in 1999-2000 to characterize pregnancy-related deaths that are not included in official statistics.
   Study design: We linked the official ICD-10-based maternal mortality data for 84 deaths with study data on 404 pregnancy-associated deaths. Results: Of the pregnancy-associated deaths, 151 were pregnancy-related. We found 69 pregnancy-related deaths that had not been included as maternal deaths. and two deaths coded as maternal deaths that did not meet our definition for a pregnancy-related death. In total, 58 of these 69 deaths were from medical causes and I I were from external causes or injuries (10 postpartum depression-related suicides and one accidental drug poisoning). The unreported deaths due to medical causes included 27 direct, 15 indirect, and two direct/indirect pregnancy-related deaths and 14 possibly pregnancy-related deaths. The most common causes of the unreported deaths due to medical causes were intracerebral hemorrhage (7 deaths), peripartum cardiomyopathy (4), pulmonary embolism (4) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (4). Conclusions: The collection of data on pregnancy-related and pregnancy-associated deaths is useful for countries with low maternal mortality figures. The use of various data-collection methods may substantially increase the quality of maternal mortality statistics. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study was conducted to investigate the mortality rate, causes of death, and standardized mortality ratio (SMR), and to identify the significant predictive factors of mortality in diabetic patients at a medical center in Taiwan. Clinical data were obtained from 1792 diabetic inpatients discharged from the metabolism department of a medical center during the years 1996-2002. Underlying causes of death were determined from death certificates. Predictors of mortality were assessed by uni- and multivariate Cox survival analyses. Of 1792 patients studied, 410 (22.9%) patients died. The crude mortality rate was 93.2/1000 person-years, and the overall SMR was 2.98 (2.71-3.28). The percentages of causes of death ascribed to diabetes, cancer, cardiopulmonary disease, infection, stroke, digestive diseases, nephropathy, accidents, suicide, and disease of arteries, arterioles, and capillaries were 38.0, 13.2, 9.5, 7.8, 7.6, 6.8, 5.1, 2.0, 0.5, and 0.2%, respectively. The independent predictors of mortality were age greater than 65, duration of hypertension more than 5 years, 24 h proteinuria greater than 0.3 g, and estimated creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min. Conclusion: The mortality of diabetic inpatients was about threefold that of the general population. The predictors of mortality included older age, longer duration of hypertension, increased 24 h proteinuria, and decreased creatinine clearance. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Late-life depression is highly prevalent worldwide. In addition to being a debilitating illness, it is a risk factor for excess morbidity and mortality. Older adults with depression are at risk for dementia, coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer and suicide. Individuals with late-life depression often have significant medical comorbidity and, poor treatment adherence. Furthermore, psychosocial considerations such as gender, ethnicity, stigma and bereavement are necessary to understand the full context of late-life depression.
   The fact that most older adults seek treatment for depression in primary care settings led to the development of collaborative care interventions for depression. These interventions have consistently demonstrated clinically meaningful effectiveness in the treatment of late-life depression. We describe three pivotal studies detailing the management of depression in primary care settings in both high and low-income countries. Beyond effectively treating depression, collaborative care models address additional challenges associated with late-life depression. Although depression treatment interventions are effective compared to usual care, they exhibit relatively low remission rates and small to medium effect sizes.
   Several studies have demonstrated that depression prevention is possible and most effective in at-risk older adults. Given the relatively modest effects of treatment in averting years lived with disability, preventing late-life depression at the primary care level should be highly prioritized as a matter of health policy.

AB Literature on the relationship between depression and C-reactive protein (CRP), a biomarker of systematic inflammation, remains inconsistent. Insufficient adjustment for confounders and effect modifiers might be one explanation. We used the data of 6396 men and 6610 women aged 18 or older, who completed a depression screening and had blood collected as a part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2005-2010. Depression was measured using the 9-item depression scale of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The odds ratios (ORs) of depression were 1.00 (reference), 1.89 (95% CI=0.77-4.67) and 3.41(1.25-9.25) respectively for men with low, intermediate and upper quartile of CRP. Adjustment for covariates, mainly body mass index, diminished the association among women, from 1.65(1.00-2.74) to 1.08(0.57-2.03) for intermediate, from 2.44 (1.43-4.16) to 1.05 (0.56-1.98) for upper quartile of CRP. Adjustment for the history of major medical illnesses changed ORs neither among men nor among women. The study concluded that CRP remained significantly associated with depression in a dose-response fashion among men but women after being adjusted for body weight. Abnormal body weight, both under and overweight, explained a substantial part of the relationship between CRP and depression among women. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bipolar disorder has been considered to have a better prognosis than schizophrenia at the very beginning of its definition. However, psychosocial functioning may vary not only because of the characteristics of the disorder, but also of co-morbid conditions, especially regarding substance use disorder (SUD). The purpose of this study was to compare the social adjustment level of patients with bipolar disorder with that observed in patients with schizophrenia, taking into account substance use disorder (SUD). Forty subjects with schizophrenia and 40 subjects with bipolar disorder, in the stable phase of the disorder, were matched for age, gender and presence of SUD (DSM-IV criteria). The social adjustment scale was completed with socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of illness. The global adaptation score of bipolar patients with SUD was poorer than bipolar patients without SUD, but was not observed as being significantly different from that of patients with schizophrenia, with or without associated SUD. Suicide attempts, poor compliance. longer hospitalisation, shorter remissions and criminal activity were also more frequently observed in the group of patients with bipolar disorder and SUD. Presence of substance use disorder seems to have a greater weight than the main diagnostic (schizophrenia versus bipolar disorder) to predict worse social adjustment and poorer outcome.

TI Inorganic mercury intoxication: A case report
SO FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
DE Inorganic Mercury; Intoxication; Mercuric oxide kinetics
AB Mercury is a heavy metal with unique physico-chemical properties, and it is well distributed throughout the environment, being present in soil, water and air. This non-essential element is considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the ten most troublesome chemical to public health. Its toxicity spectrum depends on the chemical form in which it presents: elemental (metallic), organic or inorganic. The known intoxications are mainly occupational (mining, agriculture, incineration) or related to the use of dental amalgams or the consumption of contaminated fish and shellfish. Nowadays, acute exposures to toxic amounts of mercury are increasingly rare, especially those involving inorganic mercury compounds. The rate is even lower if we refer to intentional poisonings.
   Although there is a growing understanding of the toxicokinetics of mercury, there is still a lack of studies that support the emerging theories about its bioavailability in humans. In this manuscript we describe a rare case of an individual who committed suicide by ingesting mercuric oxide. The aim is to offer a medical contribution to the better understanding of the kinetics of this metal, making a discussion based on published literature and analyzing its distribution, metabolism, internal doses, target and reservoir organs.
   The whole case - clinical course of the victim and her fatal destiny, the ante-and post-mortem sample concentrations and the necropsy findings - illustrates a situation that meets specific features of acute poisoning by ingestion of inorganic mercury, thus constituting an important support towards a more realistic and a based on evidence understanding of mercury biodistribution in humans.

AB This study sought to determine the prevalence of dissociative disorders among women in the general population, as assessed in a representative sample of a city in central Turkey. The Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule (DDIS), the Borderline Personality Disorder section of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Personality Disorders (SCID-II), and the PTSD-Module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID) were administered to 628 women in 500 homes. The mean age of participants was 34.8 (S.D.= 11.5, range: 18-65); 18.3% of participants (n = 115) had a lifetime diagnosis of a dissociative disorder. Dissociative disorder not otherwise specified (DDNOS) was the most prevalent diagnosis (8.3%); 1.1% of the population was diagnosed as having dissociative identity disorder (DID). Participants with a dissociative disorder had borderline personality disorder, somatization disorder, major depression, PTSD, and history of suicide attempt more frequently than did participants without a dissociative disorder. Childhood sexual abuse, physical neglect, and emotional abuse were significant predictors of a dissociative disorder diagnosis. Only 28.7% of the dissociative participants had received psychiatric treatment previously. Because dissociative disorders are trauma-related, significant part of the adult clinical consequences of childhood trauma remains obscure in the minds of mental health professionals and of the overall community. Revisions in diagnostic criteria of dissociative disorders in the DSM-IV are recommended. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All tights reserved.

AB Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mental disorder that results from complex interplay between multiple and partially overlapping sets of susceptibility genes and environmental factors. The brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Protein kinase C gamma type (PRICCG) are logical candidate genes in MDD. Among diverse environmental factors, negative life events have been suggested to exert a crucial impact on brain development. In the present study, we hypothesized that interactions between genetic variants in BDNF and PRKCG and negative life events may play an important role in the development of MDD. We recruited a total of 406 patients with MDD and 391 age- and gender-matched control subjects. Gene-environment interactions were analyzed using generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR). Under a dominant model, we observed a significant three-way interaction among BDNF rs6265, PRKCG rs3745406, and negative life events. The gene-environment combination of PRKCG rs3745406 C allele, BDNF rs6265 G allele and high level of negative life events (C-G-HN) was significantly associated with MDD (OR, 5.97; 95% CI, 2.71-13.15). To our knowledge, this is the first report of evidence that the BDNF-PRKCG interaction may modify the relationship between negative life events and MDD in the Chinese population.

ID SUBSTANCE DEPENDENCE; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; ABSTINENCE; DISTINCTION; BASE
AB The purpose of this two part study was to better characterize cocaine users based on self-reported cocaine withdrawal symptoms by examining screening data and response to smoked cocaine in the human laboratory. The first study sample included male and female non-treatment seeking cocaine users who were screened as potential subjects for inpatient studies. Of the 555 subjects, 462 (82%) endorsed symptoms consistent with DSM-IV criteria for cocaine withdrawal. Cocaine users who met criteria for cocaine withdrawal, compared with those who did not, reported a significantly higher amount of cocaine use and a history of medical and psychosocial problems. Cocaine users meeting DSM-IV withdrawal criteria, which included endorsement of depression, were also more likely to have a history of depression, to have seriously considered suicide, and to have had chemical dependency treatment even when amount spent on cocaine was covaried. The second study sample, which was a subset of Study I, included those who participated in human cocaine studies following the phone screening. Cocaine users who met criteria for cocaine withdrawal (n = 34), compared with those who did not (n = 10), had enhanced subjective ratings of 'high' and 'feel the effect of last dose' in response to a single delivery of 0.4 mg/kg of smoked cocaine. These results suggest that history of cocaine withdrawal symptoms may be associated with enhanced cocaine responses and greater severity of cocaine dependence. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB Tapentadol (TAP) is an analgesic agent indicated for the management of different types of pain. It has a novel mechanism of action in that it induces analgesia via both mu-opioid receptor agonism and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition. Although deaths associated with TAP use have been reported, there is a paucity of published literature regarding TAP concentrations in biological samples obtained from TAP-associated fatalities. We report a case of TAP toxicity resulting in death with postmortem peripheral and central blood concentrations, liver, vitreous, urine, and gastric contents. A 41-year-old female was found slumped over a sink at home following a welfare check by police. She was transported to a local hospital where she was pronounced dead despite all resuscitative measures. The autopsy was remarkable only for pulmonary edema and signs of aspiration pneumonia. Postmortem concentrations of TAP were confirmed in peripheral blood at 1.1 mg/L, central blood 1.3 mg/L, liver 9.9 mg/kg, vitreous humor 0.94 mg/L, urine 88 mg/L, and the gastric contained 2 mg. Also of note, oxycodone was found in the decedent's blood at a concentration of 0.58 mg/L. We report a death related to an intentional ingestion of TAP and oxycodone-the cause and manner of death were determined to be mixed drug intoxication; suicide. We hope that the variety of TAP concentrations identified in this case provide valuable points of reference for future cases of TAP intoxication. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Previous research has not considered the influence of the Comorbid Mental Disorder (CMD) among Substance Use Disorders (SUD) patients. We explored the possible differences in personality dimensions among SUD patients taking into account their CMD (Schizophrenia, SZ; Bipolar Disorder, BD; Major Depressive Disorder, MDD); and elucidated clinical factors related to personality dimensions according to the CMD. The Temperament and Character Inventory Revised was used to assess a sample of 102 SUD male patients, considered in three groups according to their CMD: SUD+SZ (N=37), SUD+BD (N=30) and SUD+MDD (N=35). SUD+BD patients had the highest levels of Novelty Seeking and Persistence, SUD+SZ patients showed the highest levels of Harm Avoidance, and SUD+MDD patients reported a lower level of Self-transcendence. Novelty Seeking was positively associated with severity of addiction for SUD+BD; Harm Avoidance was positively associated with psychiatric symptoms for SUD+SZ; and the age of SUD onset was positively linked to Cooperativeness for SUD+BD and to Self -transcendence for SUD+MDD. The different personality characteristics associated to the type of CMD among SUD patients are related to several clinical variables. Interventions in these patients should be tailored according the personality traits that could influence treatment outcomes and patients' prognoses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Background: Recently released prisoners are at markedly increased risk of death and drug-related causes predominate. Non-fatal overdose (NFOD) is considerably more common than fatal overdose, but has received relatively little research attention and most studies of NFOD in this population have suffered from small samples of unknown representativeness. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and correlates of lifetime NFOD among prisoners in NSW and Queensland.
   Methods: Cross-sectional surveys of adult prisoners in two Australian states: New South Wales (n = 972) and Queensland (n = 1316). Use of similar measures and methods in the two states made direct comparison of findings possible.
   Results: In both NSW and Queensland, 23% of participants reported a lifetime history of NFOD and prisoners with a history of injecting drug use were significantly more likely to report lifetime NFOD. The lifetime prevalence of NFOD among prisoners with a history of injecting drug use was significantly higher in NSW than in Queensland (44% vs. 35%; p < 0.01). Independent correlates of lifetime NFOD were similar across the two states and included ever attempting suicide, ever injecting heroin, and ever injecting opioids.
   Conclusions: The risk of NFOD among prisoners with a history of injecting drug use is high. An understanding of the risk factors for NFOD in this population can inform targeted, evidence-based interventions to reduce this risk. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Significant association between sleep disturbances and suicidal ideation and/or attempts is reported in adults and adolescents. However, there is paucity of studies exploring the association between sleep and self-harm behaviors (SHB) in young children and are limited to only subjective sleep measures. We examined the association between SHB and both subjective and objective sleep in a population-based sample of 5-12 yr old. Parents of every student in 3 local school (K-5) districts (n=7312) was sent a screening questionnaire. Randomly selected children from this sample underwent a comprehensive history, physical examination, a 9-h overnight polysomnogram and completed several questionnaires. Among the final sample (n=693), 27 children had SHB with adjusted prevalence of 3%. There was no difference in age, gender, obesity, or socioeconomic status in subjects with or without SHB. Significantly more children with SHB had subjective sleep difficulty and depression. Difficulty maintaining sleep and frequent nightmares were associated with SHB independent of depression or demographics. Polysomnographic %REM-sleep was significantly higher in the SHB group after adjusting for demographics and depression. These data indicate that parent reported sleep disturbances are independently associated with SHB. It is possible that higher REM-sleep is a non-invasive biomarker for risk of self-harm behaviors in young children. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To evaluate longitudinal care needs and health service access among mother-infant pairs after adolescent pregnancy. Methods: In a case-control study, data were analyzed from primiparous adolescent and adult mother-infant pairs who delivered at Reunion Island University Hospital, France, between January 2004 and December 2006, and were followed-up from maternity discharge until December 2011. Infant outcomes were hospitalization during the first 2 years of life, hospital access for "non-medical" reasons, and neuropsychiatric care. Maternal outcomes were number of pregnancies and childbirths, rapid repeat pregnancy (RRP) rate, pregnancy morbidities, and use of health services. Results: Data from 476 cases and 476 controls were analyzed. Adolescent and control offspring did not differ in the measured outcomes. Adolescent and control mothers had, respectively, 2.4 +/- 1.3 and 1.9 +/- 1.1 pregnancies; 1.9 +/- 0.8 and 1.6 +/- 0.7 childbirths; and RRP rates of 7.6% and 2.7% (all P < 0.001). Adolescents had less pregnancy-related pathologies at the index pregnancy and more frequently had natural deliveries (P < 0.05). Younger mothers exhibited higher rates (19.7% versus 6.9%, P = 0.001) of care for psychosocial reasons (suicide attempt, acute alcohol or drug intoxication, road accident, psychiatric problems, physical abuse). Conclusion: Concerns arise from the long-term psychosocial risk among adolescent mothers. (C) 2013 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Organophosphorus (OP) pesticides are a diverse class of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors that are responsible for tremendous morbidity and mortality worldwide, killing approximately 300,000 people annually. Enzymatic hydrolysis of OPs is a potential therapy for acute poisoning. OpdA, an OP hydrolase isolated from Agrobacterium radiobacter, has been shown to decrease lethality in rodent models of OP poisoning. This study investigated the effects of OpdA on AChE activity, plasma concentrations of OP, and signs of toxicity after administration of dichlorvos to nonhuman primates.
   A dose of 75 mg/kg dichlorvos given orally caused apnea within 10 min with a progressive decrease in heart rate. Blood AChE activity decreased to zero within 10 min. Respirations and AChE activity did not recover. The mean dichlorvos concentration rose to a peak of 0.66 mu g/ml. Treated monkeys received 1.2 mg/kg OpdA iv immediately after poisoning with dichlorvos. In Opda-treated animals, heart and respiratory rates were unchanged from baseline over a 240-minute observation period. AChE activity slowly declined, but remained above 25% of baseline for the entire duration. Dichlorvos concentrations reached a mean peak of 0.19 mu g/m1 at 40 min after poisoning and decreased to a mean of 0.05 mu g/m1 at 240 min.
   These results show that OpdA hydrolyzes dichlorvos in an African green monkey model of lethal poisoning, delays AChE inhibition, and prevents lethality. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

   MORTALITY; SUICIDE; PROFESSIONALS; GUIDELINES; RESIDENTS
AB Most anesthesiologists will experience the perioperative death of a patient or a major perioperative catastrophe in the course of their careers. Anesthesia training, however, does not prepare individuals to handle the aftermath of Such a stressful event. Multiple surveys have shown that the death of a patient has a major emotional impact on up to 75% of health care providers involved, regardless of whether the death was expected or whether the patient was well known to the practitioner. Psychological recovery often takes weeks or months and is hampered by lack of emotional and professional support. Data indicate that the majority of anesthesiologists would prefer a more formal support structure, including the option to take time off from clinical work. Although a formal assessment of professional functioning after a perioperative catastrophe has not been done, the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland instituted guidelines recommending support at multiple levels, and the "Adverse Event Protocol" available on the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation website provides a suggested series of steps to minimize patient injury and identify the cause of an adverse anesthesia event after it occurs. The negative consequences of failure to cope well after these events are significant to individuals and health care systems alike. Further study into the short-term and long-term impact of perioperative catastrophes on providers and health systems is needed. Additionally, education on how to handle the aftermath of perioperative catastrophes and formal support structures should be provided to practitioners at all levels of training.

AB In the realm of forensic pathology, beta-tryptase measurement for diagnostic purposes is performed in postmortem serum obtained from femoral blood. This may be partially or completely unavailable in some specific cases, such as infant autopsies and severely damaged bodies. The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of determining beta-tryptase levels for diagnostic purposes in alternative biological samples. Urine, vitreous humor and pericardial fluid were selected and measured in 94 subjects including: fatal anaphylaxis following contrast material administration (6 cases), hypothermia (10 cases), diabetic ketoacidosis (10 cases), gunshot suicide (10 cases), heroin injection-related deaths (18 cases), trauma (10 cases), sudden death with minimal coronary atherosclerosis (10 cases), severe coronary atherosclerosis without myocardial infarction (10 cases) and severe coronary atherosclerosis with myocardial infarction (10 cases). Postmortem serum and pericardial fluid beta-tryptase levels higher than the clinical reference value (11.4 ng/ml) were systematically identified in fatal anaphylaxis following contrast material administration and 6 cases unrelated to anaphylaxis. beta-tryptase concentrations in urine and vitreous humor were lower than the clinical reference value in all cases included in this study. Determination of beta-tryptase in pericardial fluid appears to be a possible alternative to postmortem serum in the early postmortem period when femoral blood cannot be collected during autopsy and biochemical investigations are required to objectify increased beta-tryptase levels.

AB Individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) often receive complex polypharmacy regimens as part of treatment, yet few studies have sought to evaluate patient characteristics associated with this high medication burden. This retrospective chart review study examined rates of complex polypharmacy (i.e., >= 4 psychotropic medications), patterns of psychotropic medication use, and their demographic and clinical correlates in a naturalistic sample of adults with bipolar I disorder (BDI; N=230) presenting for psychiatric hospital admission. Using a computer algorithm, a hospital administrator extracted relevant demographic, clinical, and community treatment information for analysis. Patients reported taking an average of 3.31 (S.D.=1.46) psychotropic medications, and 5.94 (S.D.=3.78) total medications at intake. Overall, 82 (36%) met criteria for complex polypharmacy. Those receiving complex polypharmacy were significantly more likely to be female, to be depressed, to have a comorbid anxiety disorder, and to have a history of suicide attempt. Women were significantly more likely than men to be prescribed antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and stimulants, even after controlling for mood episode polarity. Study data highlight the high medication burden experienced by patients with BD, especially those who are acutely symptomatic. Data also highlight the particularly high medication burden experienced by women with BD; a burden not fully accounted for by depression. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of the study was to explore the relationships between subjective or objective symptoms and mortality in schizophrenia. 310 subjects meeting the ICD-10 criteria for schizophrenia were included in the study between 1998 and 2000. At the initial assessment the following variables were respectively assessed to evaluate subjective and objective symptoms: the Frankfurt Complaints Questionnaire (FCQ) and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). In May 2008, information about the subjects were collected in order to know if they are alive or not and if they are deceased to know the date and the causes of their death. Survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator and standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated. A multivariate Cox regression was done to detect predictive factors associated with mortality. Absolute mortality rates were 10.01%, 4.46% and 5.42% for overall mortality, unnatural causes and natural causes, respectively. SMR for overall mortality was 4.73. Cox regression analyses showed that elevated scores of FCQ was significant predictor of deaths from unnatural causes. High levels of subjective symptoms, as rated by the FCQ were independent predictor of mortality by unnatural causes in schizophrenic subjects. There were several limitations: The causes of death were not determined by autopsy and secondly, the duration of the study could be insufficient to detect significant associations between clinical variables and mortality.

AB Background: In recent years, the non-medical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD) has increased dramatically and has been associated with adverse health outcomes. Prior work has not examined this behavior in large samples of transgender adults.
   Methods: Transgender adults (N = 155) recruited from community venues in the Mid-Atlantic region completed anonymous, self-administered surveys assessing demographic information, NMUPD and other substance use, the non-medical use of hormones, psychosocial factors, and psychiatric symptoms.
   Results: Overall, 26.5% of participants reported lifetime NMUPD with the most commonly reported medications used non-medically being prescription analgesics (23.9%), anxiolytics (17.4%), stimulants (13.5%), and sedatives (8.4%). Non-medical use of hormones was also frequently reported (30.3%). Participants reporting NMUPD were also more likely to report the use of illicit drugs. NMUPD, but not the non-medical use of hormones, was associated with lower self-esteem, more gender identity-based discrimination, and more self-reported symptoms of anxiety, depression, and somatic distress. Psychiatric symptoms remained statistically associated with NMUPD after controlling for demographic factors and other substance use.
   Conclusions: Prescription drug misuse was relatively common in this sample and was robustly associated with emotional distress. Substance use and mental health interventions for this population may benefit from incorporating the assessment and treatment of NMUPD. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We examined the psychiatric morbidities, sleep disturbances, suicidality, quality-of-life, and psychological distress of community-dwelling subjects in Korea who had medically unexplained pain. A total of 6510 subjects (age 18-65 years) participated in this study. A medically unexplained pain symptom (MUS-pain) was defined as pain lasting for 6 months or longer that was sufficiently severe to cause significant distress or to materially interfere with normal activities in the previous year, and that could not be explained by a medical condition or substance use/abuse. Diagnostic assessments were based on responses to the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, which was administered by lay colleagues. The presence of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) disorders, sleep disturbances, suicidal tendency, quality-of-life issues, and psychological distress was determined in subjects with and without MUS-pain. There were significant positive associations between MUS-pain and nicotine dependence and withdrawal, alcohol dependence, major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, and psychotic disorder. In addition, subjects with MUS-pain reported more sleep disturbances, suicidality, psychological distress, and a poorer quality-of-life than did subjects without MUS-pain. The results of this study suggest that clinicians should carefully evaluate and treat comorbid psychiatric problems in individuals with MUS-pain. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP), also called as intensity dependence of auditory evoked potentials (IDAP), has been proposed as a potential marker for central serotonergic tone and has been noticed for its possible clinical implications in depression. However, its distributions in major depressive disorder (MDD) and factors affecting it are largely unknown. In this study, we examined its distribution and relationships with various demographic and clinical variables in MDD patients. In 143 MDD patients, the LDAEP was measured using five intensities of auditory stimulus. The influences of ten independent variables (age, gender, education years, marital status, psychiatric family history, age of onset, suicide attempt history, depression severity, later augmentation of mood stabilizer, and smoking status) on the LDAEP strength were examined using univariate analyses and data mining method. The mean (+/- S.D.) LDAEP was 0.90 (+/- 0.73) mu V/10 dB (-0.78-3.83 mu V/10 dB). Female gender, smoking, and being married were consistently associated with a weaker LDAEP. In the pathway model, sequential combination of being male, living alone, and older age predicted the strongest LDAEP, whereas female gender, older age, and smoking predicted the weakest LDAEP. These variables need to be considered when interpreting the LDAEP. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wolfram disease is a rare genetic disorder frequently accompanying depression and psychosis. Non-symptomatic mutation carriers also have higher rates of depression and suicide. Because WfS1, the causative gene of Wolfram disease, is located at 4p16, a linkage locus for bipolar disorder, mutations of WfS1 were suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. In this study, we performed behavioral and gene expression analyses of Wfs1 knockout mice to assess the validity as an animal model of mood disorder. In addition, the distribution of Wfs1 protein was examined in mouse brain. Wfs1 knockout mice did not show abnormalities in circadian rhythm and periodic fluctuation of wheel-running activity. Behavioral analysis showed that Wfs1 knockout mice had retardation in emotionally triggered behavior, decreased social interaction, and altered behavioral despair depending on experimental conditions. Wfs1-like immunoreactivity inmouse brain showed a similar distribution pattern to that in rats, including several nuclei potentially relevant to the symptoms of mood disorders. Gene expression analysis showed down-regulation of Cdc42ep5 and Rnd1, both of which are related to Rho GTPase, which plays a role in dendrite development. These findings may be relevant to the mood disorder observed in patients with Wolfram disease. (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

AB Nereistoxin(NTX) was originated from a marine annelid worm Lumbriconereis heteropoda and its analogue pesticides including cartap, bensultap, thiocyclam and thiobensultap have been commonly used in agriculture, because of their low toxicity and high insecticidal activity. However, NTX has been reported about its inhibitory neuro toxicity in human and animal body, by blocking nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and it cause significant neuromuscular toxicity, resulting in respiratory failure. We developed a new method to determine NTX in biological fluid. The method involves mixed-mode cationic exchange based solid phase extraction and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry for final identification and quantitative analysis. The limit of detection and recovery were substantially better than those of other methods using liquid-liquid extraction or headspace solid phase microextraction. The good recoveries (97 +/- 14%) in blood samples were obtained and calibration curves over the range 0.05-20 mg/L have R2 values greater than 0.99. The developed method was applied to a fatal case of cartap intoxication of 74 years old woman who ingested cartap hydrochloride for suicide. Cartap and NTX were detected from postmortem specimens and the cause of the death was ruled to be nereistoxin intoxication. The concentrations of NTX were 2.58 mg/L, 3.36 mg/L and 1479.7 mg/L in heart, femoral blood and stomach liquid content, respectively. The heart blood/femoral blood ratio of NTX was 0.76.

AB The soluble protein pancreatic adenocarcinoma up-regulated factor (PAUF) plays an important role in pancreatic tumor progression and has begun to attract attention as a therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer. We herein present PAUF RNA-targeting gene therapy strategies with both targeting and therapeutic function using trans-splicing ribozyme (TSR) in pancreatic cancer. We developed adenoviral PAUF-targeting TSR (Rz) containing a PAUF-specific internal guide sequence (IGS) determined by library screening. This Rz harbors suicide gene, herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) or firefly luciferase (Luc) as a transgene for 3' exon replacement of PAUF RNAs. Ad-Rz-TK, Rz harboring the HSV-tk, showed significant inhibition of tumor growth in vivo as well as PAUF-dependent cell death in vitro via a successful trans-splicing reaction. Selective induction of Rz-controlled transgene in PAUF-expressing pancreatic cancer was confirmed through noninvasive in vivo imaging; a luminescence signal from Rz harboring Luc (Ad-Rz-Luc) was detectable only in pancreatic tumor sites, not in normal mice. In addition, a [I-125] FIAU signal reflecting thymidine kinase expression through SPECT and ex vivo biodistribution was co-localized with the tumor sites when we treated with Ad-Rz-TK in orthotopic xenograft model. Taken together, these results imply that PAUF-targeting TSR can contribute to successful targeted gene therapy for pancreatic cancer. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Epidemiologic research indicates that psychosis and depression most frequently develop during adolescence. Hence, an efficient strategy for improving youth mental health would be to focus on detection of early-stage psychosis and depression in adolescence.
   In this study, 1461 high school students were surveyed using self-report scales. Students who scored equal to or above the cut-off value on any of the scales and who agreed to a further examination proceeded to a second assessment, using the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia and Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States along with self-reporting scales. The estimated prevalence of adolescents at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis and of depression-spectrum disorders was 1.26 and 3.69% respectively. Compared with the normal group, experiences of bullying, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts were significantly higher in these two groups; the subjects at UHR for psychosis were found to have significantly lower academic performance and lower ratings on SCRS; and submissive behavior was more prevalent in the depression-spectrum group. Our results reveal several clinical features of adolescents at UHR for psychosis and with depression-spectrum disorder and underscore the importance of accurate assessment of and early appropriate care for these adolescents.

AB Objectives: To describe the existence of policy statements on euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (EAS) and practice guidelines for all medical end-of-life decisions in Dutch health care institutions in 2005, whether the existence of practice guidelines is related to characteristics of institutions, and to compare the existence of policies in 2005 and 1994.
   Methods: Questionnaires were sent to 566 institutions (all Dutch hospitals, nursing homes, general psychiatric hospitals, institutions for the mentally disabled, hospices) from October 2005 through March 2006.
   Results: Most institutions (70%) had a written policy statement concerning EAS. EAS was usually allowed under specific conditions (75%). Institutions mainly had practice guidelines for EAS and do-not-resuscitate decisions (62% and 63%). A minority had guidelines on palliative sedation (27%), alleviation of symptoms (27%) and withdrawing or withholding treatment (33%). In general, there were more practice guidelines in 2005 than in 1994. Larger institutions and institutions with an ethics committee more often had practice guidelines. Religious affiliation of an institution did not seem to be related to the existence of guidelines.
   Conclusions: Since many institutions still do not have practice guidelines for medical end-of-life decisions. they should be stimulated to introduce practice guidelines, being a first step in improving the quality of the care on institutional level.

AB Strong evidence indicates that central serotoninergic system dysfunction is associated with suicidal behavior. The relationship between the serotonin transporter protein (5-HTT) gene of psychotic patients in Han Chinese with suicidal behavior was studied since the 5-HTT plays an important role in serotoninergic transmission. Two hundred and seventy-two psychotic inpatients with suicidal behavior (suicide group) and 275 psychotic inpatients without suicidal behavior (patient control group) were recruited from six mental health facilities in Shanghai, China. Another 628 healthy adults (healthy control group) without suicidal behavior and mental disorder history were enrolled from Shanghai, China. All subjects were Han Chinese. The genotypes and the alleles of 5-HTT genes of the three groups were examined by PCR amplification. Neither the intron 2 variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism and 5-HTTLPR (5-HTT gene-linked polymorphic region), nor the haplotype frequencies of this gene have significant differences between the suicide group and the two control groups. However, there was a significant difference in 5-HTTLPR polymorphism between inpatients with a first episode of suicidal behavior and those with recurrent suicidal behavior. Except for the possible heterogeneity between inpatients with a first episode of suicidal behavior and those with more than one, the 5-HTT gene was unlikely to be associated with suicidal behavior of psychotic patient in Han Chinese.

AB Little is known about the psychosocial factors associated with sexual assault experienced by males. Men (N = 358), 19-35 years of age, recruited by community outreach, completed questionnaires. Eligibility criteria included: being HIV-negative and self-identifying as gay or bisexual. Lifetime prevalence rates of childhood sexual abuse, juvenile prostitution, and adult sexual assault were determined. The mental health of this population was explored including associations between sexual victimization and mental health disorders (alcohol abuse, suicidal ideation and attempts, mood disorders, and poor self-esteem). Almost 1 in 10 of the men had engaged in juvenile prostitution, 14% were forced into sexual activity before 14 years of age, and 14% were sexually victimized after the age of 14. Those exposed to non-consensual sex were 2.9 (95% CI: 1.8-4.7) times more likely to abuse alcohol than those free of victimization. Those who reported childhood sexual abuse were 3.3 (95% CI: 1.7-6.4) times more likely to have attempted suicide. Juvenile prostitution was associated with current depression (OR = 6.4; 95% Cl: 2.8-14.9). Health professionals have the responsibility to respond competently and sensitively to victims of sexual violence. To do this, many need to recognize the prevalence of mate sexual trauma, to deconstruct their personal beliefs about same-sex sexual violence, and to team to ask sensitive questions in their assessment interviews.

DE Skull fracture; Fall from height; Biphasic; Simulation; MADYMO
AB Fall from height is one of the most common ways of suicide in Korea. Skull fractures are typically accompanied with these cases, but several autopsy cases show absence of skull fracture even with serious body injuries including sternal and vertebral fracture. The mechanism of this pattern of injury can be explained by impact of facial part on chest or abdomen when the back of the body touches the ground first. We tried to figure out the relevance of this pattern of injury to the height of fall using a computer simulation tool (MADYMO 7.5). For this experiment, a condition of initial pose was limited to leaning forward. The simulation showed that when the body rotated forward, the body parts which got injured by the ground depended on the height of fall. For relatively lower height, head got injured, but as the height was set higher, the point of first impact area changed to the back, hip and then legs. When the body struck first around hip area on supine position, the impact made forceful flexion of lumbar, thoracic and cervical vertebrae, leading to folding the body in two, which resulted in collision between the part of face and the anterior part of body. Through the current investigation, it was explained that the biphasic distribution of the number of head injury cases versus the height distribution was attributed to the forward rotation of the body during the fall.

AB To assess the role that adiposity plays in the association between leptin and major depressive episode (MDE), we analyzed the data of 1046 men and 1359 women aged 20-39 years, who completed an interview and had blood collected as a part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 1991 and 1994. Waist-hip ratio (WHR) was used as an indicator of adiposity. MDE was assessed with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. For normal-WHR women, the prevalence of MDE was reversely associated with leptin levels, 13.7(4.4)%, 12.2(4.0)% and 2.3(1.8)% respectively for lower, interquartile, and upper quartile. For abnormal-WHR women, the prevalence of MDE was positively associated with leptin, 6.1(2.3)%, 9.1(2.4)% and 20.0 (3.8) respectively for the three leptin levels. Compared to women with lower quartile of leptin, the odds ratio of MDE for women with upper quartile was 0.09 (0.01-0.98) for normal-WHR women but 4.35 (1.55-12.2) for abnormal-WHR women. No moderating effects were observed among men. Using BMI in place of WHR revealed similar findings. The association between MDE and leptin is moderated by adiposity. High leptin levels are associated with low odds of MDE among women with normal adiposity but high odds among women with abnormal adiposity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In a series of 202 postmortem toxicology cases, the CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genes were genotyped, and the concentrations of amitriptyline (AT) and six metabolites were analyzed. The polymorphic CYP2D6 and CYP209 genes encode enzymes participating in the metabolism of several potentially toxic drugs, and mutations in these genes may lead to adverse drug reactions, possibly even intoxications. AT was chosen as the substrate of interest because it is mainly metabolized by these enzymes, is considered relatively toxic, and ranks among the major causes of fatal drug poisoning in Finland. Our objective was to evaluate genetically determined interindividual variation in conjunction with metabolite ratios of drugs found in toxicological analysis in a series of medicolegal autopsies.
   Positive correlations were found between the proportion of trans-hydroxylated metabolites and the number of functional copies of CYP2D6 and between the proportion of demethylated metabolites and the number of functional copies of CYP2C19. None of the accidental or undetermined AT poisonings coincided with the CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 genotype which predicts a poor metabolizer phenotype. However, an unusually high femoral blood concentration of AT, 60 mg/l, was found in one suicide case with no functional CYP2D6 genes. Our study shows a concordance of AT metabolite patterns with CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 Genotypes in the presence of confounding factors typical for postmortem material. This result demonstrates the feasibility of postmortem pharmacogenetic analysis and supports the dominant role of genes in drug metabolism. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Violence against women and adult femicides are critical medico-legal issues worldwide. Intimate partner violence is one of the leading contributory risk factors. This study aimed to describe the characteristics of femicides in Taiwan.
   Methods: A retrospective analysis of forensic autopsy records of adult femicide victims in Taiwan during a 10-year period was carried out. The age, victim-offender relationship, injury patterns and causes of death were analyzed.
   Results: Among the 220 adult femicide victims recruited, 114 were killed by intimate partners and 106 were killed by non-intimate partner offenders. The average age of victims killed by intimate partners (40.0 y/o) were younger than those killed by non-intimate partner perpetrators (48.6 y/o). The most common site of injuries in the intimate partner group and the non-intimate partner group was the neck and the upper limbs, respectively. The rates of bruise and intracranial injury of non-intimate partner group were significantly higher than that of the intimate partner group. The most common causes of death in both groups were strangulation and sharp force injury. The heart injury was significantly more frequent in victims offended by intimate partners than by other assailants.
   Conclusions: The characteristics of adult femicides, and the patterns of injury in victims killed by intimate partners and non-intimate partner offenders were different. This data is helpful for corpus inspection in forensic casework and for strategic planning of femicides prevention. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE Prescription opioid; Abuse; Aging; Suicide; Surveillance
ID UNITED-STATES; DEATHS
AB Background: Dramatic increases in the prescriptive use of opioid analgesics during the past two decades have been paralleled by alarming increases in rates of the abuse and intentional misuse of these drugs. We examined recent trends in the abuse and misuse and associated fatal outcomes among older adults (60+ years) and compared these to trends among younger adults (20-59 years).
   Methods: Trend analysis using linear regression models was used to analyze 184,136 cases and 1149 deaths associated with abuse and misuse of the prescription opioids oxycodone, fentanyl, hydrocodone, morphine, oxymorphone, hydromorphone, methadone, buprenorphine, tramadol, and tapentadol that were reported to participating U.S. Poison Centers of the Researched Abuse, Diversion and Addiction-Related Surveillance (RADARS (R)) System between 2006-Q1 and 2013-Q4.
   Results: Rates of abuse and misuse of prescription opioids were lower for older adults than for younger adults; however, mortality rates among the older ages followed an increasing linear trend (P < 0.0001) and surpassed rates for younger adults in 2012 and 2013. In contrast, mortality rates among younger adults rose and fell during the period, with recent rates trending downward (P = 0.0003 for quadratic trend). Subanalysis revealed an increasing linear trend among older adults specifically for suicidal intent (P < 0.0001), whereas these rates increased and then decreased among younger adults (P < 0.0001 for quadratic trend).
   Conclusion: Recent linear increases in rates of death and use of prescription opioids with suicidal intent among older adults have important implications as the U.S. undergoes a rapid expansion of its elderly population. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To suggest a behavioural research agenda for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) based on a concise review of seven stages of psychosocial research, a literature review, and current behavioural research in other chronic somatic diseases.
   Methods: Historical behavioural ESRD research was classified. The specialized register of the Cochrane Behavioral Medicine Field was also checked, and additional papers were selected by screening reference lists and related behavioural science journals, to identify promising areas for future research.
   Results: The top-five topics identified via the literature search pertain to (1) psychological aspects and interventions, (2) adaptation, coping, and depression, (3) exercise, (4) counseling and education, and (5) compliance. 'Illness and treatment beliefs', 'sexuality', 'suicide', 'family support', and 'self-management interventions', were identified on the basis of research in other chronic illnesses as topics for future research. Regarding theory, the Common-Sense Model (CSM) was judged to offer useful theoretical perspectives: regarding methods, qualitative methods can be a valuable addition to quantitative research methods.
   Conclusion: Illness beliefs, treatment beliefs, and self-management behaviours are promising concepts in the assessment and clinical care of ESRD-patients. Cognitive-behavioural treatments appear to have potential and should be specified and elaborated for specific categories and problems of ESRD-patients.
   Practice Implications: This research agenda is in line with moves towards patient-centred disease-management to improve the quality of medical care for ESRD-patients. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: In contrast with most developed countries, mortality from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) continues to rise in China. We examined secular trends and age, period, and cohort effects in mortality from AMI in China from 1987 to 2014.
   Methods: Data on deaths from AMI between 1987 and 2014 were obtained from the Chinese Health Statistics Annual Report (1987-2001) and the Chinese Health Statistics Yearbook (2003-2015). We then conducted an age-period-cohort analysis using the intrinsic estimator approach.
   Results: There was an upward trend in AMI mortality in both urban and rural populations that accelerated from 2004 onwards. AMImortality increased 5.6-fold from1987 to 2014. The net age effect on AMImortality increased exponentially. AMI mortality risk in the 80-84 years of age bracket was 220.15 and 190.70 times higher than in the 15-19 years of age bracket in urban and rural populations, respectively. Therewas a V-shaped trend in the net period effect between 1999 and 2009. Meanwhile, although there was a global reduction in the cohort effect in urban and rural AMI mortality, we found a modest increase among urban populations born between 1975 and 1989 and rural populations born between 1990 and 1999.
   Conclusion: The changes in exposure to lifestyle-related risk factors and triggers such as air pollution have contributed to the increase in AMI mortality in China over recent decades. The sharp increase in AMI mortality since 2004 is primarily attributable to population aging and the rise in AMI deaths among younger generations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Although alcohol-related disorders (ARD) have been shown to be accompanied by comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders, and alcohol metabolic enzyme genes, ADH1B and ALDH2 polymorphisms, have been associated with an increased risk of ARD, no studies have been conducted to evaluate the associations between these genetic polymorphisms and anxiety or depression.
   Method: A total of 1944 Japanese workers were interviewed regarding their depressive and anxiety disorders, including suicidality, by a brief psychiatric structured interview (MINI). We investigated the relationship of ADH1B rs1229984 and ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism combinations with mental disorder risks. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the associations between those polymorphisms and anxiety/depressive disorders, adjusting for sex, age, and job rank. The degree of alcohol sensitivity was classified into five groups according to the combination of two enzyme genotypes (Group I-V, in order from the lowest alcohol sensitivity).
   Results: Those with ALDH2 *1/*1 and ADHIB *1/*1 were likely to be at an increased risk of depressive and anxiety disorders as well as ARD. This tendency was more apparent among non-drinkers (OR 9.20, 95% CI 1.66-50.89). No adverse effects of ALDH2 or ADH1B alone were observed with mental disorder risks. Likewise, analyses conducted combining job rank and genetic alcohol sensitivity showed no material associations with such risks.
   Conclusions: Genetic alcohol sensitivity, especially that with the genotype combination of ALDH2 *11'1 and ADH1B *10, was significantly associated with an increased risk of depressive and anxiety disorders as well as ARD. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Alteration of serotonin transmission in the brain of patients with schizophrenia has been reported in postmortem brain studies, cerebrospinal fluid studies, and pharmacological challenges. Although a genetic association of tryptophan hydroxylase isoform 1 (TPH1), the rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin synthesis, with schizophrenia has been suggested by recent systematic meta-analyses, the newly identified neuronal isoform TPH2 is more relevant to the central nervous system and the association of TPH2 gene with schizophrenia has been much less explored. We, therefore, explored the association of TPH2 gene with schizophrenia using a case-control study of 720 Japanese populations and also tried to replicate the association of the TPH1 rs1800532 (A218C) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with schizophrenia. We selected 15 tagging SNPs in the TPH2 gene. We found no significant differences in genotypic distributions (uncorrected P=0.18-0.98) or allelic frequencies (uncorrected P=0.18-0.98) of the 15 SNPs between the schizophrenia and control groups. Haplotypes constructed with these SNPs were also not associated with schizophrenia (uncorrected P=0.12-0.97). The genotypic and allelic distribution of the TPH1 rs1800532 SNP was also not different between the case and control groups in our samples. In addition, a subsequent meta-analysis including our results did not showed a significant association with schizophrenia in Asian populations. Our findings suggest that neither common genetic variations of TPH1 nor TPH2 are likely to contribute to the genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia in Japanese population.

AB Some evidence suggests an association between genetic variants within the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB), CREB binding protein (CREBBP) and cAMP response element-modulator (CREM) and several psychiatric disorders. The present study investigated whether some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within these genes could be associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) and whether they could predict clinical outcomes in Korean inpatients treated with antidepressants and mood stabilizers, respectively. The sample comprised 145 patients with MDD, 132 patients with BD and 170 psychiatrically healthy controls. Participants were genotyped for 14 SNPs within CREB1, CREBBP and CREM. Baseline and final clinical measures, including the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and Young Mania Rating Scale for patients with MDD and BD, respectively, were recorded. All p-values were 2-tailed, and statistical significance was conservatively set at the 0.006 level in order to reduce the likelihood of false positive results. We failed to observe any association of the 14 SNPs genotypes or alleles with clinical improvement, response and remission rates as well as final outcomes in any of such disorders. Our findings suggest that the 14 SNP under investigation in our study do not influence diagnosis and treatment response in patients with MDD and BD. However, taking into account the several limitations of our study, further research is needed to draw more definitive conclusions. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: To test the hypothesis that, with 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) treatment, the co-expression of cytosine deaminase (CD) and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) can lead to greater radiosensitization and bystander effect than CD-expression alone.
   Methods and materials: R3327-AT cell lines stably expressing CD or CDUPRT were generated. The 5-FC and 5-FU cytotoxicity, and the radiosensitivity with/without 5-FC treatment, of these cells were evaluated under both aerobic and hypoxic conditions. The bystander effect was assessed by apoptosis staining and clonogenic Survival. The pharmacokinetics of 5-FU and 5-FC metabolism was monitored in mice bearing CD- or CDUPRT-expressing tumors using F-19 MR spectroscopy (MRS).
   Results: CDUPRT-expressing cells were more sensitive to 54C and 5-FU than CD-expressing cells. CDUPRT-expression further enhanced the radiosensitizing effect of 5-FC, relative to that achieved by CD-expression alone. A 25-fold lower dose of 5-FC resulted in the same magnitude of radiosensitization in CDUPRT-expressing cells, relative to that in CD-expressing cells. The 5-FC cytotoxicity in co-cultures of parental cells mixed with 10-20% CDUPRT cells was similar to that in 100% CDUPRT cells. F-19 MRS measurements showed that expression of CDUPRT leads to enhanced accumulation of fluorine nucleotide (FNuc), relative to that associated with CD-expression alone.
   Conclusion: Out study suggests that CDUPRT/5-FC strategy may be more effective than CD/5-FC, especially when used in combination with radiation. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. Radiotherapy and Oncology 92 (2009) 345-352

   Methods: We study the relationship between birth order and hospitalization related to alcohol and narcotics use before and after the age of 20 using Swedish register data for cohorts born 1987-1994. We apply Cox proportional hazard models and use sibling fixed effects, eliminating confounding by factors shared by the siblings.
   Results: Before age 20 we find that later born siblings are hospitalized for alcohol use at a higher rate than first-borns, and there is a monotonic increase in the hazard of hospitalization with increasing birth order. Second-borns are hospitalized at a rate 47% higher than first-borns, and third-borns at a rate 65% higher. Similar patterns are observed for hospitalization for narcotics use. After age 20 the pattern is similar, but the association is weaker. These patterns are consistent across various sibling group sizes.
   Conclusions: Later born siblings are more likely to be hospitalized for both alcohol and narcotics use in Sweden. These birth order effects are substantial in size, and larger than the estimated sex differences for the risk of hospitalization related to alcohol and drug use before age 20, and previous estimates for socioeconomic status differences in alcohol and drug abuse.

AB A simple and sensitive method for the simultaneous analysis of fenfluramine, amphetamine and methamphetamine in whole blood was developed using a headspace-solid phase microextraction (SPME) and derivatization. A 0.5 g whole blood sample, 5 mu l d(5)-methamphetamine (50 mu g/ml) as an internal standard, and 0.5 mi sodium hydroxide (1 M) were placed into a 12 mi vial, and sealed rapidly with a silicone septum and an aluminum cap. Immediately after the vial was heated to 70 degrees C in an aluminium block heater, the needle of the SPME device was inserted through the septum of the vial, and the extraction fiber was exposed in the headspace for 15 min. First, heptafluorobutyric anhydride was injected into the injection port of the GC-MS, and the compounds extracted by the fiber were then desorbed and derivatized simultaneously by exposing the fiber in the injection port. The calibration curves, using an internal standard method, demonstrated good linearity throughout the concentration range from 0.01 to 1.0 mu g/g. The detection limits of this method were 5.0 ng/g for fenfluramine and methamphetamine, and 10 ng/g for amphetamine. No interferences were found, and the time for analysis was about 30 min for one sample. This method was applied to a suicide case in which the victim ingested fenfluramine. Fenfluramine was detected in the blood sample collected from the victim at the concentration of 7.7 mu g/g. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We report the case of attempted suicide with amlodipine, chlorthalidone and mefenamic acid and subsequent medical intensive care measures which resulted in total recovery of a 42-year-old male. After admission to the medical intensive care unit the intoxicated patient was deeply hypotensive and needed fluid replacement, dobutamine and norepinephrine. Additionally insulin and calcium gluconate were given. Since hypotension persisted and the patient developed oliguria, terlipressin was applied and finally showed an effect on blood pressure and on urinary output. A volume overload of 7 L in the first 24 It resulted in a pulmonary edema. The patient was started on non-invasive ventilation with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and frusemide was added to the therapy with good success. Quantitative determination of amlodipine in plasma samples was performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The highest amlodipine concentrations was measured in the plasma sample collected approximately 8 h after ingestion of the drug, and was 393 mu g/L. Four days later, it was possible to stop the treatment with catecholamines, at that time the amlodipine plasma concentration had declined to 132 mu g/L, still tenfold higher than therapeutic (5-18 mu g/L). Elimination half-life of antiodipine is approximately 55 h. After 6 days in the intensive care unit the patient was transferred to psychiatric treatment. Intensive care management and plasma levels in this intoxication case are compared to data from literature on other cases. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The goal of this study was to examine whether certain subtypes of major depressive episodes (MDEs)-defined by their particular constellations of symptoms-were more strongly associated with substance use disorders (SUDS), compared to other subtypes of MDEs. Participants were adults in the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication sample who met DSM criteria for at least one lifetime MDE (n = 1829). Diagnostic assessments were conducted using structured interviews. The following MDE subtypes were examined: atypical, psychomotor agitation, psychomotor retardation, melancholic, and suicidal. The results indicated that: (1) suicidal MDEs were associated with increased risk for all SUDs; (2) melancholic MDEs were associated with increased risk for alcohol use disorders; and (3) psychomotor agitation was associated with increased risk for alcohol dependence. These associations did not differ significantly by gender. Adjusting for age, the severity of the MDE, the age of onset of the first MDE, and psychiatric comorbidity did not substantially change the results. Supplemental analyses examining only diagnoses that occurred in the year prior to the assessment demonstrated a similar pattern (with MDEs characterized by psychomotor agitation being associated with drug use disorders as well). Exploratory order of onset analyses indicated that participants with lifetime MDEs and SUDs tended to report an MDE onset prior to the SUD onset, and those who experienced a suicidal MDE at some time in their lives were particularly likely to have had their first MDE prior to developing a SUD. Therefore, risk for lifetime SUDs differs according to the particular set of symptoms experienced during MDEs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Singapore is now considered to be a developed country. It also has one of the fastest aging populations in the world. Life expectancy at birth in 2007 was 78.2 years for men and 82.9 years for women. The aging population and change in disease patterns with a consequent increase in chronic diseases and disability present a challenge to the health system.
   The frequently observed disparity between statistics for men's and women's health is also seen in Singapore. Men die younger and suffer more illness. Diseases such as cancer, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, sexually transmitted diseases and injuries are more commonly seen among men in the country. Mental health issues are also significant, with men having higher suicide rates than women. These conditions result in years of productive life lost. The results of the Singapore National Health Survey 2004 suggest that more men than women have unhealthy lifestyles which predispose them to chronic diseases.
   Healthcare policy in Singapore emphasizes building a healthy population through preventive healthcare programs and promoting a healthy lifestyle. The Health Promotion Board Singapore is a key driver of health promotion programs in the country. There are over 2000 primary healthcare clinics including 18 government subsidized ones. The uptake of these services and programs depends on men themselves. Traditional models of gender roles could influence the differing attitude of men and women to health with a consequent impact on differing health outcomes between men and women. Facilities providing healthcare and efforts to promote health among men have to consider this. (C) 2009 WPMH GmbH. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY

DT Article
DE coronary heart disease; life expectancy; sudden death; unexpected death;
   heart failure
AB It is a common practice to perform percutaneous or open coronary artery revascularisation in CHD to prevent sudden or unexpected death. Such a practice assumes that sudden and unexpected death is common in stable patients with uncomplicated CHD. This is a retrospective analysis of 248 patients (199, 80% men, 49, 20% women) who had median age 65.1 when assessed after stabilisation of their CHD and were followed up to 25 years until their death. Myocardial revascularisation was only performed after the patients had stabilised if they developed either progressive clinical disability or acute coronary syndromes. At stabilisation, 181 (73%) were uncomplicated, 59 (24%) had heart failure (HF) and 8 (3%) had other comorbidities. At their last visit before death, 67 (27%) were uncomplicated, 121 (49%) had HF, 41 (17%) had cancer and 19 (8%) had other comorbidities. Their median age at death was 72.4 years. 77 (3 1%) died suddenly, 47 (19%) of HF, 39 (16%) of cancer, 35 (14%) of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and 50 (20%) had miscellaneous modes of dying. Unexpected death occurred in 26 (10%) of cases: sudden 12, AMI 7, stroke 3, suicide 2, abdominal aneurysm 1, motor vehicle accident 1. We conclude that the clinical condition of most patients with CHD deteriorates between their initial stabilisation and their final visit before their death-metamorphosis. Only a small proportion of deaths occur in patients with stable CHD and no HE Intervention in stable patients without CHF is unlikely to reduce sudden or unexpected death in patients with CHD.

AB Mixed antihypertensive drug intoxication poses a significant risk for patient mortality. In tandem to antihypertensives, hypolipidemic medicines (especially statins) are often prescribed. Among their well-known adverse effects belongs rhabdomyolysis. We report a case of fatal multi-drug overdose in a 65-year-old female alcoholic. The patient was unconscious at admission. Empty blister packs indicated the abuse of 250 tablets of urapidil, 42 tablets of verapamil/trandolapril, 50 tablets of moxonidin, 80 tablets of atorvastatin and 80 tablets of diacerein. Standard measures (gastric lavage, activated charcoal, mechanical ventilation, massive doses of vasopressors, volume expansion, diuretics and alkalinization) failed to provide sufficient drug elimination and hemodynamic support and the sufferer deceased on the fourth day. Dramatic elevations of serum myoglobin (34,020 mu g/L) and creatine kinase (219 mu kat/L) were accompanied by rise in cardiac troponin I and creatinine. Gas chromatography revealed ethanol 1.17 g/kg (blood) and 2.81 g/kg (urine). Thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography of gastric content and urine verified verapamil, moxonidin and urapidil fragment (diacerein method was unavailable). Atorvastatin and trandolapril concentrations (LC-MSn) equaled 277.7 mu g/L and 57.5 mu g/L, resp. (serum) and 8.15 mu g/L and 602.3 mu g/L, resp. (urine). Histology confirmed precipitates of myoglobin with acute necrosis of proximal renal tubules in association with striated muscle rhabdomyolysis and myocardial dystrophy. Cardiogenic-distributive shock in conjunction with acute renal failure due to the combined self-poisoning with vasoactive agents and atorvastatin were determined to be this decedent's immediate cause of death. The manner of death was assigned to be suicidal. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Opioids are important medications for pain and opioid maintenance treatment. Increasing use and abuse of prescription opioids has, however, caused worldwide concern. Our aim was to estimate the ratio between prescription opioid abuse and total use, based on representative postmortem toxicology. Our material included all the medico-legally examined deaths in Finland during 2010-2011 involving positive findings involving buprenorphine, codeine, fentanyl, methadone, oxycodone, or tramadol. We studied drug abuse by age group, with "abuse'' meaning licit opioids used illicitly as narcotics. Drug-abuse history, drug injecting, or laboratory findings of illicit drugs defined an abuser case. We then compared abuser cases and other opioid-related cases between the opioids with the number of fatal poisonings, accidents, suicides, alcohol findings, concomitant opioid use, and median postmortem blood opioid concentrations. Opioid findings numbered 2499 in 2088 cases. Drug abuse involved 545 opioid-positive cases, which in Finland represented 0.5% of those deceased. The proportion of abuser cases among all opioid-related cases for buprenorphine was 85.5%, for methadone 82.4%, for tramadol 29.4%, for codeine 16.3%, for fentanyl 14.5%, and for oxycodone 6.9%. Abuse in age-groups >60 was rare. Concomitant other opioid findings were more frequent in abuser- than in other cases for codeine, oxycodone, and tramadol, whereas alcohol findings were more frequent in buprenorphine, codeine, and fentanyl abuse. Buprenorphine and methadone were most often related to drug abuse. Every other opioid studied involved some abuse, and especially tramadol. Abuse and fatal poisonings were concentrated in men aged 20-49. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Even in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, individuals HIV-infected through injecting, drug use (IDUs) are at increased risk of death due to the burden of competing events such as liver disease. overdose and suicide. The objective of this study was to explore the role which life events' experience, in particular drug-related events such as detoxification or withdrawal symptoms, may play on the risk of death in HIV-infected IDUs. Our analysis was based on longitudinal data of 296 HIV-infected IDUs from when they started HAART Data collection included medical records and patient's self-reports detailing, among other information, life events including drug-related problems. Multiple imputations for missing data in the explanatory variables together with Cox models were used to identify predictors of death. During, HAART follow-up, 26 deaths occurred, corresponding to 1.8 deaths per 100 person-years. The majority (N=8) were attributable to liver disease while 5 were from unknown causes (found deceased at home or in a car). After adjustment for age and time-dependent viral load (>10,000 cp/ml) individuals experiencing withdrawal symptoms had a fivefold increased risk of death with respect to the others. Withdrawal symptoms it) IDUs living with HIV reflect physicians' difficulties in managing their patients' opioid dependence. Early detection and increasing substitution dosages or switching to a more adequate treatment could prevent possible drug-related deaths. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined the effects of sodium arsenite treatment on free [Ca2+]i and cell death in mitogen-activated murine lymphocytes. The main findings of this study were that simultaneous sodium arsenite treatment inhibited PHA-but not Con A-induced T cell proliferation, induced a higher increase in free [Ca2+]i and an early increase in the proportion of dead cells in PHA than in Con A activated cells. Sodium arsenite pre-treatment reduced both PHA- and Con A-induced T-cell proliferation. Phorbol myristate ester (PMA) did not prevent the inhibitory effects of both sodium arsenite treatments, suggesting that sodium arsenite did not significantly decreased PKC activation or that its effects occurred on events parallel to PKC activation. Both PHA and Con A increased free [Ca2+]i after stimulation, yet the effect was more pronounced in mitogen-activated cells simultaneously treated with sodium arsenite and particularly in those activated with PHA. The increase in free [Ca2+]i was in agreement with the early cell death induced by sodium arsenite in PHA-activated cells, a finding consistent with the inhibitory effects on PHA-induced proliferation. Sodium arsenite-induced cell death occurred faster in PHA-activated cells. Further studies are needed to ascertain the relationships between the effects of sodium arsenite on free [Ca2+]i levels and the type of cell death induced by sodium arsenite and their relevance for the proliferative response of T cells.

AB Butane is an addictive volatile substance like toluene. We report three forensic autopsy cases of sudden death that occurred while sniffing n-butane and isobutane from portable gas cartridges. n-Butane and isobutane were detected in all three cases. In cases 1-3, n-butane concentrations in heart blood were 54.3, 25.5, and 30.7 mu g/mL, respectively. These concentrations were considered fatal according to the previous reports. In addition, n-butane metabolites (2-butanol and 2-butanone) were detected in cases 1 and 3 but not in case 2. Blood levels of 2-butanol and 2-butanone were 6.5 and 1.8 mu g/mL, respectively, in case 1, and 6.3 and 5.6 mu g/mL, respectively, in case 3. According to the police investigation, the decedent in case 1 had misused butane gas for more than 6 months in the period leading up to death. The decedent in case 3 also had a history of chronic misuse of butane gas. There was no history of chronic misuse of butane gas by the decedent in case 2. It was suspected that he attempted suicide via inhalation of butane gas using a plastic bag, leading to a rapid death. The presence or absence of n-butane metabolites might reflect the way of butane inhalation, such as the frequency and duration. Although additional experimental and case studies are necessary to establish the forensic applications of n-butane metabolite detection, it may be a useful method to understand the decedents' pattern of butane sniffing before death.

AB Most studies in the field of impaired driving have focused on the hazards imposed on society by the impaired drivers, whereas little attention has been paid to the future outcome of the drivers. The aim of the study was to identify mortality rates and causes of death among drunken and drugged drivers during the years after apprehension. Prospective cohort study on apprehended drunken and drugged drivers, follow-up period: 7.5 years, outcome variable: death. Apprehended drivers 20-39 years old who provided samples positive for alcohol (n = 2531) or drugs other than alcohol (n = 918) constituting the total national samples of these two driver categories in 1992. The mortality rate among male drunken drivers was higher than in an age-matched Norwegian population (standardised mortality ratio, SMR = 3.7 (95% CI 2.9-4.7). The SMR for drugged drivers was 18.1 (14.9-21.8) for men and 27.9 (14.4-48.8) for women. In a subgroup of male drugged drivers using heroin, SMR was 39.8 (28.8-53.6). The dominant causes of death among drunken and drugged drivers were drug poisoning/overdose, accidents and suicide. Apprehension for drunken or drugged driving and subsequent analytical verification, is an indicator of increased risk of future premature death in the age group 20-39 years, particularly for drugged drivers. To our knowledge this is a new finding, and studies to confirm it should be carried out in other countries. If verified, the results should lead to the consideration of new public health approaches towards apprehended impaired drivers. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Polydrug use potentially increases the likelihood of harm. As little is known about polydrug use patterns in the general population, it is difficult to determine patterns associated with highest likelihood.
   Methods: Latent class analysis was performed on nine illicit substance groups indicating past year use of cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, ecstasy, LSD, mushrooms, amyl nitrate, tranquillisers and heroin or crack. Analyses were based on data from a large multi-stage probability sample of the population of Great Britain (n=8538) collected in 2000. Multinomial logistic regression was performed highlighting associations between classes, and demographic and mental health variables.
   Results: A three class solution best described patterns of polydrug use; wide range, moderate range, and no polydrug use. For males and young people, there was a significantly increased chance of being in the wide and moderate range polydrug use groups compared to the no polydrug use class. Hazardous drinking was more likely in the wide and moderate polydrug classes with odds ratios of 9.99 and 2.38 (respectively) compared to the no polydrug use class. Current smokers were more likely to be wide and moderate range polydrug users compared to the no polydrug use class with odds ratios of 4.53 and 5.85 respectively. A range of mental health variables were also related to class membership.
   Conclusions: Polydrug use in Great Britain can be expressed as three distinct classes. Hazardous alcohol use and tobacco use were strongly associated with illicit polydrug use, polydrug use appeared to be significantly associated with mental health, particularly lifetime suicide attempts.

AB Background: Sexual violence has become increasingly apparent as a factor determining more complex treatment needs in patients with substance abuse. However, empirical evidence on specific patterns of differences between patients with and without a history of sexual violence is scarce.
   Methods: Our sample consisted of alcohol dependent outpatients treated during a two-year period in a German metropolitan region. The analysis was based on a local case register and included all patients for whom information on lifetime sexual violence was available (N=1981; 33.4% female). In a case-control design, patients with a history of sexual violence were compared to patients without such experiences regarding a wide range of clinical and social factors indicative of potential needs.
   Results: More than 35% of the female patients and 6% of the male patients reported a history of sexual violence. Victims differed from non-victims across a variety of domains, including psychiatric symptoms and suicide attempts, legal problems, financial and family problems, previous use of services, and need for additional services during the current treatment. Patient gender emerged as a significant moderator of several of these associations.
   Conclusions: The findings indicate that an effort needs to be made to link addiction treatment, other parts of the health care system, and further institutions, such as family services and parts of the legal system, so that the complex needs of this vulnerable population can be met in an adequate way.

AB According to the stress-diathesis hypothesis, depression and suicidal behavior may be precipitated by psychosocial stressors in vulnerable individuals. However, risk factors for mental health are often gender-specific. In the present study, we evaluated common risk factors for female depression in association with depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation in a community sample of women. The sample was composed by 415 women evaluated for mood disorders (MDs), depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation by structured interviews and the Beck depression inventory II (BDI II). All women also filled in the Eysenck personality questionnaire to evaluate neuroticism and were interviewed for social contact frequency and stressful life events (SLEs). In the whole sample, 19% of the women satisfied criteria for MD and suicidal ideation was reported by 12% of the women. Though stressful life events, especially personal and interpersonal problems, and poor social network were associated with all the outcome variables (mood disorder, depressive symptomatology and suicidal ideation), neuroticism survived to all multivariate analyses. Social network, together with neuroticism, also showed strong association with depressive severity, independently from current depressive state. Though we were unable to compare women and men, data obtained from the present study suggest that in women neurotic traits are strongly related to depression and suicidal ideation, and potentially mediate reporting of stressful life events and impaired social network. Independently from a current diagnosis of depression, impaired social network increases depressive symptoms in the women. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study examines reasons for adolescent deliberate self-harm. A cross-sectional survey using an anonymous self-report questionnaire was carried out in seven countries (Australia, Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands and Norway). Data on 30,477 school pupils between the ages of 14-17 were analysed. Past year and lifetime deliberate self-harm were assessed, along with the self-reported reasons for deliberate self-harm. The results showed that 'wanted to get relief from a terrible state of mind' and 'wanted to die' were most commonly reported. Principal component analysis indicated two underlying dimensions in the reasons for deliberate self-harm, i.e. a cry of pain motive and/or a cry for help motive. The majority of self-harmers reported at least one cry of pain motive ('to die', 'to punish myself', and 'to get relief from a terrible state of mind') and an additional cry for help motive ('to show how desperate I was feeling', to frighten someone', 'to get my own back on someone', 'to find out whether someone really loved me', and 'to get some attention'). Females reported more reasons than males. Only females showed an age difference, with girls aged 16-17 more frequently reporting a cry for help motive. There was considerable consistency in choice of motives across countries and genders. Systematic assessment of the reasons for deliberate self-harm can help clinicians to better understand the meaning of self harming behaviour, select appropriate treatment, suggest alternative coping strategies, and hopefully prevent future suicidal behaviour.

AB Lindane, a persistent organochlorine pesticide, is recognized as a major public health concern because of its potential toxic effects on human health. Despite observations pointing to the toxicity of lindane, mechanisms underlying its deleterious effects in liver have yet to be understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of lindane on autophagic, apoptotic and necrotic cell death in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. We found that lindane deregulated the autophagic process as demonstrated by (I) the formation of enlarged acidic vesicles labeled with LC3, Rab7 and LAMP1 (specific markers of autophagic vacuole maturation), (2) the conversion of LC3-I (the cytosolic form) into LC3-II (membrane bound). (3) the deregulation of the Beclin 1 protein expression and (4) the enhanced formation of the Bcl-xL/Beclin 1 complex. Lindane induced vacuolization together with the inhibition of spontaneous and intrinsic apoptosis. This disruption of cell suicide was linked to Bcl-xL up-regulation, Bax down-expression, prevention of cytochrome c release, and inhibition of caspase-9 and -3 activities. Lindane-induced disruption of apoptosis and autophagy occurred in parallel with necrosis induction in rat hepatocytes.
   In consequence, we proposed that lindane toxicity in primary rat hepatocytes could be jointly attributed to the disruption of autophagic process, the inhibition of apoptotic cell death and the induction of necrosis. These events account, at least in part, for the involvement of both cytotoxic and carcinogenic signaling pathways in the action of lindane in the liver. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Many studies have been conducted in the developed countries to know the magnitude and factors influencing suicidal ideation among medical students, but such data are sparse in developing countries. This cross-sectional study was therefore conducted to find out the prevalence of suicidal ideation and factors influencing such ideation among students of a medical college in Western Nepal. A total of 206 students were selected using random sampling and questioned about their socio-demographic factors, other risk factors and suicidal ideation using a preformed validated questionnaire. The data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows Version 16.0 and the EPI Info 3.5.1 Windows Version. Descriptive statistics and testing of hypothesis were applied for the statistical methodology. The univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to examine the association between different variables. Suicidal ideation in the last one year was present in nearly one tenth of the study population and in almost one fifth of them life-time suicidal ideation was present. Factors that were associated with suicidal ideation were primarily dissatisfaction with academic performance, being in the clinical semesters, having history of drug abuse and feeling neglected by parents. Most common reason reported for suicidal ideation was family related followed by self-related. Recognition of suicidal ideation among students and their associated factors can help in detecting it on time, making the right interventions and controlling the problem. Understanding the magnitude of the problem and their epidemiology via scientific study like this would be the first step in this process. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT VISITS; DEATHS; CONTACT; TRENDS; ABUSE
AB Background: Opioid abuse and misuse are significant public health issues. The CDC estimated 72% of pharmaceutical-related overdose deaths in the US in 2012 involved opioids. While studies of opioid overdoses have identified sociodemographic characteristics, agents used, administration routes, and medication sources associated with overdoses, we know less about the context and life circumstances of the people who experience these events.
   Methods: We analyzed interviews (n = 87) with survivors of opioid overdoses or family members of decedents. Individuals experiencing overdoses were members of a large integrated health system. Using ICD codes for opioid overdoses and poisonings, we identified participants from five purposefully derived pools of health-plan members who had: 1) prescriptions for OxyContin (R) or single-ingredient sustained release oxycodone, 2) oxycodone single-ingredient immediate release, 3) other long-acting opioids, 4) other short-acting opioids, or 5) no active opioid prescriptions.
   Results: Individuals who experienced opioid overdoses abused and misused multiple medications/drugs; experienced dose-related miscommunications or medication-taking errors; had mental health and/or substance use conditions; reported chronic pain; or had unstable resources or family/social support. Many had combinations of these risks. Most events involved polysubstance use, often including benzodiazepines. Accidental overdoses were commonly the result of abuse or misuse, some in response to inadequately treated chronic pain or, less commonly, medication-related mistakes. Suicide attempts were frequently triggered by consecutive negative life events.
   Conclusions: To identify people at greater risk of opioid overdose, efforts should focus on screening for prescribed and illicit polysubstance use, impaired cognition, and changes in life circumstances, psychosocial risks/supports, and pain control.

AB Background: Although amphetamine-type stimulant (ATS) use is an important issue that has caused growing concerns in China as well as other countries, the knowledge of long-term patterns of ATS use in China is limited. This study explored long-term patterns of ATS use in Shanghai, China, and compared the differences by ATS use trajectory groups, seeking to identify risk factors that have implications for the development of targeted intervention programs.
   Methods: A total of 377 ATS users were recruited from the Compulsory Isolation Center for Drug Rehabilitation in Shanghai. Group-based trajectory modeling was applied to identify distinctive trajectories of ATS use over 8 years at the time of interviews conducted in 2012. The mean number of days using ATS per month over a year from years 2005 to 2012 was analyzed with a censored normal model.
   Results: Three distinctive groups were identified: high-use (19.1%), low-use (66.0%), and increasing-use (14.9%). Relative to the low-use group, the high-use and increasing-use groups were more likely to report having used opiate-type drugs and to have more craving experiences. Psychiatric symptoms following ATS use were frequently reported, with ATS users in the increasing-use and high-use groups more likely to report depression symptoms and suicide behaviors compared to the low-use group. The low-use and increasing-use groups reported more months in drug abuse treatment programs compared to the high-use group.
   Conclusions: Addressing ATS use should take into consideration patients' use-related psychiatric symptoms as well as other risk factors, particularly among those with persistent high-level ATS use trajectories. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Assessing factors associated with non-fatal overdose is important as these could be useful to identify individuals with substance use disorders at high risk of adverse outcomes and consequences. Depression may play an important role in terms of overdose risk. We aimed to test if drug users suffering from a depressive disorder might have significantly higher risk of non-fatal overdose as compared with drug users without depression.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed, Embase and Web of Knowledge were searched. The pooled analyses were based on prevalence rates, risk difference (RD) and odds ratio (OR), reporting 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The combined estimates were obtained weighting each study according to random effects model for meta-analysis.
   Results: Seven articles, involving 12,019 individuals, and run in the US, Canada, Sweden, Norway, and Australia, were included. Pooled analyses comparing depressed with not depressed individuals highlighted a RD (95% CIs) for non-fatal overdose of 7.3% (4.8-9.7%) and an OR (95% CIs) of 1.45 (1.17-1.79). The subgroups analyses based on specific characteristics of included studies confirmed the association between depression and overdose.
   Conclusions: Depressive disorders seem to be important factors associated to the risk of-non-fatal overdose. Longitudinal studies might appropriately clarify causal inference issues. Future research should address the role of depressive disorders as predictors of subsequent non-fatal overdoses. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Emotion-regulation difficulties have been identified as one of the core components in Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), a behaviour often beginning in adolescence. This pilot study evaluated differences in emotion processing between 18 female adolescents with and without NSSI by using verbal responses and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Responses to pictures taken from the International Affective Picture System and slides with reference to NSSI were recorded both by verbal rating of valence and arousal and by fMRI. The NSSI group rated pictures with self-injurious reference as significantly more arousing than controls. For emotional pictures, the NSSI group showed a significantly stronger brain response in the amygdala, hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex bilaterally. Depression explained differences between groups in the limbic area. Furthermore, the NSSI group also showed increased activity in the middle orbitofrontal cortex, and inferior and middle frontal cortex when viewing NSSI picture material. Participants with NSSI showed decreased activity in correlation to arousal in the occipital cortex and to valence in inferior frontal cortex when watching emotional pictures. The fMRI data support the notion that individuals with NSSI show an altered neural pattern for emotional and NSSI pictures. Behavioural data highlight proneness to excitement regarding NSSI topics. This fMRI study provides evidence for emotion-regulation deficits in the developing brain of adolescents with NSSI. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pathological gambling is a relatively prevalent psychiatric disorder that typically leads to severe family, social, legal, and occupational problems and is associated with a high rate of suicide attempts. Understanding the neurobiological basis of pathological gambling is a current focus of research, and emerging data have demonstrated that pathological gamblers may have impaired decision-making because of an inability to inhibit irrelevant information. In this study, we examined pathological gamblers by using the Stroop Color-Word Test, a neurocognitive task used to assess interference control. The "reverse" variant of the Stroop Color-Word Test was administered to a cohort of medication-free pathological gamblers (n=62) and a cohort of age-matched controls (n=83). In the reverse variant of the Stroop task, subjects are asked to read the meaning of the word rather than name the ink color. The reverse Stroop task was chosen because it highly discriminates ability to inhibit interference in a population of psychiatric patients. In our study, performance on the reverse Stroop task in the pathological gamblers was significantly slower and less accurate than in the healthy subjects. A new finding in our study was that for pathological gamblers, the average reaction time in the neutral condition (where the color names are displayed in black letters) was slower than the average reaction time in the incongruent condition (where the meaning of the color name and the color of the printed letters are different). This controlled study extends previous findings by showing that performance on the Stroop task is impaired in a sample of medication-free pathological gamblers. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Low central nervous systems (CNS) serotonin has been linked to aggression, impulsivity and disinhibition in both animal and human studies. Low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 5-hydroxindoleacetic acid (5HIAA) has been reported in violent criminals, arsonists and violent suicide attempters. Reduced prolactin response to fenfluramine has been found in aggressive patients and criminal offenders. Cloninger's dimension of harm avoidance is hypothesised to be related to CNS serotonin levels, but studies have reported contradictory results. Forty-eight men with major depression received a fenfluramine challenge as well as a number of measures of temperament and behaviour: the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ); the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ); the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS); the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (SCL-90); and clinician-rated personality disorder symptoms. The prolactin response to fenfluramine was not related to EPQ or TPQ measures except the TPQ dimension of reward dependence and the EPQ Lie scale. The prolactin response to fenfluramine was not related to BIS measures or to SCL-90 measures except the SCL-90 somatization scale. The prolactin response to fenfluramine was not related to personality disorder diagnoses or to a measure of repeated self-harm. Thus, in a sample of moderately depressed male outpatients, there was very little relationship between personality, behavioural measures and the prolactin response to fenfluramine. We suggest that alterations in serotonin functioning, when measured using the prolactin response to fenfluramine, may be more commonly linked to behavioural abnormalities in personality-disordered or criminal samples.

AB Introduction: Positive psychological phenomena such as increased feelings of belonging linked to hosting the FIFA World Cup were observed in France 1998 and South Africa 2010. Approximately nine months after South Africa hosted the 2010 World Cup the sex ratio at birth increased significantly. Given the similarity of positive psychological phenomena between the two countries, this study sought to determine if the sex ratio at birth increased in France circa nine months after the 1998 World Cup.
   Methods: Anonymized publicly available live birth data from 1994 to 2004 inclusive was obtained from the Insee (Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes/Economiques - National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies). For statistical analysis, chi-squared tests were used.
   Results: The sex ratio at birth for March and April 1999 did not differ significantly from that of the rest of same period from 1996 to 2000 (p = 0.558), there was also no significant difference for February and March 1999.
   Conclusion: The sex ratio at birth did not increase in France after it hosted the 1998 World Cup. Possible reasons why the sex ratio at birth did not increase as it did in South Africa include a higher French prevalence of modern contraceptive use and a different kind/level of excitement for the World Cup in France since it has previously hosted large international sports tournaments. The influence of the World Cup on the sex ratio at birth depends on the context of a specific country. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: We investigate the impact of gaps between socioeconomic status (SES; household income and education) and perceived social class on suicidal ideation.
   Design and methods: Longitudinal data from the 2009 and 2011 Korean Health Panel Survey were used. Our sample consisted of 12,357 subjects included in the 2009 survey and 11,758 subjects included in the 2011 survey. We analyzed rates of suicidal ideation as a function of the gap between SES and perceived social class, defined as the difference between household income and education-high (H; college or higher), medium (M; high school), low (L; middle school or lower)-and perceived social class (H, M, and L).
   Results: Among respondents whose actual and perceived levels of household income (HH: odds ratio [OR] = 0.611 [95% CI [confidence interval]: 0.486-0.768], LL: OR = 1.829 [95% CI: 1.489-2.247]) and education (HH: OR = 0.788 [95% CI: 0.622-0.998], LL: OR 1.853 [95% CI: 1.476-2.328]) were the same, suicidal ideation increased as perceived social class decreased. The adjusted effect of the association between SES and perceived social class on suicidal ideation decreased according to the same pattern.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that the gap between SES and perceptions of one's position in the social hierarchy explains a substantial part of inequalities in suicidal ideation. It is important to consider the impact of the slopes of both gaps on suicidal ideation rather than focus only on perceived social class. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Asphyxia related-death is a common incident in forensic practice, since they can be related to suicide, homicide and accident. The deep structures of the neck can be very difficult to reach using the traditional neck dissection when no certain information about potential injuries are obtained.
   Furthermore in this kind of deaths no specific signs or injuries can be found at the external and internal examination of the body (such as the slight, if any, displacement of a body structure following a infraction and fissures, as well as injuries involving lamellae of the thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage, trachea). In recent years a great contribute to the field of postmortem diagnostics (e.g. gunshot wounds, sharp and blunt forces, etc.) has been given by the introduction of the post-mortem CT (PMCT); that is becoming a standard procedure performed before the traditional postmortem examination.
   In cases of asphyxia related-death (with special regards to homicidal strangulation) the PMCT with 3D documentation can be very helpful in revealing injuries on the small structures of the neck, that can be also masked by soft tissues and surrounding bleedings and provides a useful guide for the pathologist to choose the right dissecting technique and avoid artifacts or iatrogenic injury to delicate structures, such as hyoid bone or thyroid cartilage.
   The case of a homicide by ligature strangulation using two items (electric wire and cotton bed sheet) is presented, in which the PMCT was performed before the autopsy, showing helpful features concerning the mechanism of death. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Acute chloroform intoxication can cause depression of the central nervous system and may lead to death from lethal arrhythmias or respiratory arrest. Thus, the organic solvent is no longer in clinical use as an anaesthetic, but still plays a role in cases of suicide, homicide or inhalation for psychotropic effects. Several cases of lethal arrhythmia after intoxication with chloroform have been described. Pharmacological inhibition of cardiac "human ether-ei-go-go-related gene" (HERG) potassium channels is linked to proarrhythmic effects of cardiac and noncardiac drugs. To further investigate the electrophysiological basis of the arrhythmogenic potential of chloroform, we analysed inhibitory effects of chloroform on cloned HERG potassium channels, heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes and in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK 293) cells using the double-electrode voltage-clamp technique and the whole-cell patch-clamp technique, respectively. In HEK cells, chloroform blocked HERG tail currents with an IC50 of 4.97 mM. Biophysical properties were further investigated in the Xenopus oocyte expression system. Onset and wash-out of block was fast and inhibition was completely reversible. Chloroform did not alter channel activation, however, direct channel inactivation was accelerated significantly. Steady-state-inactivation of HERG was not affected. Chloroform dependent block of HERG channels was voltage dependent with a decrease of inhibition at more positive membrane potentials. No frequency-dependence of block could be observed. In summary, chloroform blocked HERG potassium channels probably in a toxicologically relevant concentration. These findings contribute to the pathophysiology of proarrhythmic effects in acute chloroform intoxication. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Globally, opioid drug use is an important cause of premature mortality. In many countries, opioid using populations are ageing. The current study investigates mortality in a large cohort of opioid users; with a focus on testing whether excess mortality changes with age.
   Methods: 198,247 opioid users in England were identified from drug treatment and criminal justice sources (April, 2005 to March, 2009) and linked to mortality records. Mortality rates and standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated by age-group and gender.
   Results: There were 3974 deaths from all causes (SMR 5.7, 95% Confidence Interval: 5.5 to 5.9). Drug-related poisonings (1715) accounted for 43% of deaths. Relative to gender-and-age-appropriate expectation, mortality was elevated for a range of major causes including: infectious, respiratory, circulatory, liver disease, suicide, and homicide. Drug-related poisoning mortality risk continued to increase beyond 45 years and there were age-related increases in SMRs for specific causes of death (infectious, cancer, liver cirrhosis, and homicide). A gender by age-group interaction revealed that whilst men have a greater drug-related poisoning mortality risk than women at younger ages, the difference narrows with increasing age.
   Conclusion: Opioid users' excess mortality persists into old age and for some causes is exacerbated. This study highlights the importance of managing the complex health needs of older opioid users. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB A substantial body of evidence indicates that dysregulation of the immune system is associated with suicidal behavior in major depressive disorder (MDD). Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 is believed to be an important factor in regulating inflammatory responses and to have anti-inflammatory effects. We aimed to identify the role of TGF-beta 1 on suicidal depression. The TGF-beta 1 polymorphisms at codons 10 and 25 were analyzed in 122 suicidal MDD patients, 61 non-suicidal MDD patients, and 120 control subjects and, among them, in vitro TGF-beta 1 productions were measured in 48 suicidal MOD patients, 47 non-suicidal MOD patients, and 91 control subjects. There was no genetic polymorphism at codon 25 and three genotypes at codon 10. No significant difference in the distributions of the TGF-beta 1 genotypes was found among the three groups. The in vitro TCF-beta 1 productions were significantly higher in suicidal MDD patients (844.3 +/- 329.7 pg/ml) and in non-suicidal MOD patients (853.0 +/- 439.7 pg/ml) than in controls (683.0 +/- 397.0 pg/ml) (P=0.01). In vitro TGF-beta 1 productions were not significantly different among patients with any of the TGF-beta 1 alleles or genotypes. Our findings suggest that in vitro TGF-beta 1 productions play an important role on MDD, but we found no associations between TGF-beta 1 and suicidal behavior. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Background: Inpatient bed numbers are continually being reduced but are not being replaced with adequate alternatives in primary health care. There is a considerable risk that eventually all inpatient treatment will be unplanned, because planned or elective treatments are superseded by urgent needs when capacity is reduced.
   Aims of the study: To estimate the rate of unplanned admissions to inpatient psychiatric treatment facilities in Norway and analyse the difference between patients with unplanned and planned admissions regarding services received during the three months prior to admission as well as clinical, demographical and socioeconomic characteristics of patients.
   Method: Unplanned admissions were defined as all urgent and involuntary admissions including unplanned readmissions. National mapping of inpatients was conducted in all inpatient treatment psychiatric wards in Norway on a specific date in 2012. Binary logit regressions were performed to compare patients who had unplanned admissions with patients who had planned admissions (i.e., the analyses were conditioned on admission to inpatient psychiatric treatment).
   Results: Patients with high risk of unplanned admission are suffering from severe mental illness, have low functional level indicated by the need for housing services, high risk for suicide attempt and of being violent, low education and born outside Norway.
   Conclusion: Specialist mental health services should support the local services in their efforts to prevent unplanned admissions by providing counselling, short inpatient stays, outpatient treatment and ambulatory outpatient psychiatry services. Implications for health policies: This paper suggests the rate of unplanned admissions as a quality indicator and considers the introduction of economic incentives in the income models at both service levels.

AB Objectives: To examine the use of buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid withdrawal (OW) in an emergency department (ED) setting.
   Methods: The medical records of all adult patients who presented to the study ED during a 10 week period for OW were abstracted. Subjects were categorized as receiving buprenorphine, symptomatic treatment or no pharmacologic treatment for their OW. The three groups were compared by patient and service characteristics, withdrawal symptoms and outcomes.
   Results: Of the 11,019 patients who presented to the ED during the 10 week study period, 158 (1.4%) were eligible. Subjects were more likely to receive buprenorphine (56%) compared to symptomatic treatment only (26%) or no pharmacologic treatment (18%). Subjects who received buprenorphine were more likely to have a history of suicide ideation (34% versus 12% p < 0.05) compared to Subjects who received symptomatic treatment(s) and were less likely to present with a gastrointestinal complaint (9% versus 25% p < 0.05). Subjects who received buprenorphine were less likely to return to the same ED within 30 days for a drug-related visit (8%) compared to those who received symptomatic treatment (17%) (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Buprenorphine was a common treatment for OW in this ED without any documented adverse outcomes. Given that it did not result in an increase in drug-related return ED visits and its proven efficacy in other settings, a prospective evaluation of its potential value to ED patients who present with OW is warranted.

   POPULATION; DEPENDENCE; COHORT; ABUSE
AB Background: Mortality in previously incarcerated individuals is known to be elevated, with high proportions of drug-related deaths. However, there is less documentation of whether specific substance use patterns and other clinical characteristics predict increased mortality in the group.
   Methods: This is a follow-up study of mortality and causes of death in ex-prisoners with substance use problems prior to incarceration (N=4081), who were followed during an average of 3.6 years from release from prison until death or until data were censored. Baseline predictors of mortality, derived from interviews with Addiction Severity Index (ASI) in prison, were studied in a Cox regression analysis.
   Results: During follow-up, 166 subjects (4.1%) died. Standardized mortality ratios were 7.0 (3.6-12.2) for females and 7.7 (5.6-9.0) for males. In 84% of cases, deaths were unnatural or due to substance-related disease. Most common causes of death were accidental poisoning (27%), transport accidents (13%), poisoning/injury with undetermined intent (12%), and suicide (10%). Death was positively predicted by heroin use, overdose, and age, and negatively predicted by a history of depression.
   Conclusions: A vast majority of deaths after release from prison in individuals with substance use are due to violent or substance-related causes. Significant predictors identified were mainly related to patterns of drug use, and need to be addressed upon incarceration as risk factors of death. The findings have implications for referral and treatment upon release from prison. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Polysubstance use is common in substance users, and may complicate their clinical course. This study, in a criminal justice setting in Sweden, examines the association between the number of concurrently used substance types and psychiatric symptoms during 30 days before incarceration, while controlling for background variables such as family history (drug and alcohol problems, psychiatric problems, criminality), demographic data and history of emotional, physical or sexual abuse.
   Methods: The data material comprised 5659 criminal justice clients reporting a substance use problem, examined with the Addiction Severity Index. Variables were compared in a multinomial regression analysis, comparing clients reporting one (n = 1877), two (n = 1408), three (n = 956), four (n = 443) and five or more (it = 167) substance types.
   Results: The 30-day prevalence of most psychiatric symptoms included in the study (depression, anxiety, cognitive problems, hallucinations, difficulty controlling violent behaviour, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts) was higher in individuals with a higher number of concurrent substance types used. In multinomial regression analysis, while controlling for background variables, these associations remained for concurrent suicidal ideation, cognitive problems, hallucinations and violent behaviour, with the latter two being associated with the higher numbers of substance types. Binge alcohol drinking, tranquilizers, opioids and the number of substance types reported were associated with several of the psychiatric symptoms.
   Conclusions: In the present criminal justice setting in Sweden, the use of multiple substance types and concurrent psychiatric symptoms appear to be associated, and a sub-group reporting particularly high numbers of concurrent substance types are particularly likely to report potentially severe psychiatric problems.

AB The aim of the present study was to determine the distribution of the presynaptic 5-HT reuptake complex and the 5-HT2A receptors through Brodmann areas from two control subjects, together with the possible existence of laterality between both brain hemispheres. A left laterality was observed in the postsynaptic 5-HT2A binding sites, with significantly higher B-max values in the left frontal and cingulate cortex. In frontal cortex, [H-3]imipramine and [H-3]paroxetine binding showed the highest B-max values in areas 25, 10 and 11. In cingulate cortex, the highest [H-3]imipramine and [H-3]paroxetine B-max values were noted in Brodmann area 33 followed by area 24, while postsynaptic 5-HT2A receptors were mainly distributed through Brodmann areas 23 and 29. In temporal cortex, the highest [H-3]imipramine and [H-3]paroxetine B-max a was noted in Brodmann areas 28 and 34, followed by areas 35 and 38. All Brodmarm areas from parietal cortex (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 39, 40 and 43) showed similar presynaptic and postsynaptic binding values. In occipital cortex no differences were observed with regard to the brain hemisphere or to the Brodmann area (17, 18 and 19). These results suggest the need to carefully define the brain hemisphere and the Brodmann areas studied, as well to avoid comparisons between studies including different Brodmarm areas or brain hemispheres.

AB Background: There is a dearth of research in the published literature on substance use and addiction in the Middle East and Islamic countries. This study was the first to explore whether the biopsychosocial-spiritual model of addiction was relevant to an addicted treatment population in Jordan, an Islamic country.
   Methods: A qualitative study design using semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted with a sample of 25 males in addiction treatment. The sample was drawn from a cohort of in-patients at a treatment centre in Amman, Jordan who had already participated in a quantitative survey. A purposive sample was selected to ensure the inclusion of a range of characteristics that might affect their experience of developing addiction and its consequences, i.e., age, marital status and educational level. Interviews were transcribed and thematic analysis conducted using verbatim quotes to illustrate themes. Themes were mapped onto the biopsychosocial-spiritual model of addiction.
   Results: This study found addiction was associated with a range of health (physical and psychological), social and spiritual factors. Unpleasant physical withdrawal effects, psychological symptoms, such as anxiety and suicide attempts, were experienced. There was breakdown in marital and family relations, loss of employment, involvement in crime and neglect of religious practices, resulting in social isolation.
   Conclusion: This study found that, despite some differences in emphasis, the biopsychosocial, spiritual model of addiction fit well particularly given the relative importance of religion in Islamic culture. Spirituality was not explored and further study of spirituality versus religious practice in this culture is recommended. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Background: Use of sedatives may increase risk of death in opioid users. The aim of the study was to assess whether prescription of sedatives may be associated with mortality in patients in opioid maintenance treatment.
   Methods: This retrospective register-based open cohort study included nation-wide register data including all individuals who were dispensed methadone or buprenorphine as opioid maintenance treatment for opioid dependence between July, 2005 and December, 2012 (N= 4501). Outcome variables were overdose mortality and non-overdose mortality, respectively. Extended Cox regression analyses examined associations between type of sedative prescriptions and death, controlling for sex, age, previous overdoses and suicide attempts, psychiatric in-patient treatment and opioid maintenance treatment status. Opioid maintenance was assumed to last for 90 days (or 30 days in a sensitivity analysis) after the last methadone or buprenorphine prescription.
   Results: Benzodiazepine prescriptions were associated with non-overdose death (HR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.29-3.18) but not significantly associated with overdose death (1.49, 0.97-2.29). Z-drug (1.60,1.07-2.39) and pregabalin prescriptions (2.82, 1.79-4.43) were associated with overdose death. In the sensitivity analysis, all categories of sedatives, including benzodiazepines, were significantly associated with overdose death.
   Conclusions: Caution is advised when prescribing sedative drugs, including benzodiazepines, z-drugs and pregabalin, to patients in opioid maintenance treatment. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Although fairly frequent in psychiatric in-patient, episodes of aggression/violence are mainly limited to verbal aggression, but the level of general health is significantly lower in nurses who report 'frequent' exposure to violent incidents, and there is disagreement between patients and staff concerning predictors of these episodes. We searched the Pubmed, Embase and PsychInfo databases for English, Italian, French or German language papers published between 1 January 1990 and 31 March 2010 using the key words "aggress*" (aggression or aggressive) "violen*" (violence or violent) and "in-patient" or "psychiatric wards", and the inclusion criterion of an adult population (excluding all studies of selected samples such as a specific psychiatric diagnosis other than psychosis, adolescents or the elderly, men/women only, personality disorders and mental retardation). The variables that were most frequently associated with aggression or violence in the 66 identified studies of unselected psychiatric populations were the existence of previous episodes, the presence of impulsiveness/hostility, a longer period of hospitalisation, non-voluntary admission, and aggressor and victim of the same gender; weaker evidence indicated alcohol/drug misuse, a diagnosis of psychosis, a younger age and the risk of suicide. Alcohol/drug misuse, hostility, paranoid thoughts and acute psychosis were the factors most frequently involved in 12 studies of psychotic patients. Harmony among staff (a good working climate) seems to be more useful in preventing aggression than some of the other strategies used in psychiatric wards, such as the presence of male nurses.

AB To examine whether delayed neuropathy is prevented or alleviated when Ca is administered to experimental animals before or after organophosphorus compounds (OPs) dosing, we observed the effects of Calcicol(R) administration as a calcium tonic on delayed neurotoxicity by OPs in hens. The hens (n = 28) were randomly divided into seven groups (four in each group). One group received glycerol formal as vehicle group, two groups received 30 mg/kg leptophos or 40 mg/kg triortho-cresyl phosphate (TOCP) (L group and T group), two groups received 2.4 mg/kg Ca2+ (0.3 ml/kg Calcicol(R)) 24 h before leptophos or TOCP administration, and the last two groups received 2.4 mg/kg Ca after leptophos or TOCP administration, respectively. Although delayed polyneuropathy induced by OPs could not be prevented completely by Calcicol(R), the clinical signs of organophosphorus-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN) in hens that received Calcicol(R) soon before or after OPs administration were less severe than those in hens that received only OPs and there were significant differences in OPIDN score between groups (P < 0.05). This shows that polyneuropathy and the recovery function of nerves and muscles suffering from polyneuropathy can be alleviated, as long as calcium tonic is administered before the clinical signs develop. This study offers hope of recovery to humans who are exposed to these OPs because of work, attempted suicide, accidental ingestion or other accidents, etc. Meanwhile, our results indicate further that there is a relationship between a decrease in Ca2+ concentration in tissues and induction of delayed neuropathy.

AB Background: The aim of this study was to describe the frequency and characteristics of cardiac arrest patients of 35 years and under attended by the London Ambulance Service NHS Trust between April 2003 and March 2007. Few large studies have described the occurrence, mechanism, resuscitation viability and outcome of this Substantial Subset of the cardiac arrest population. By documenting over 3000 cardiac arrests in young people we sought to improve understanding, awareness and ultimately Survival of a condition notorious for high mortality rates.
   Methods and results: Data were analysed for 3084 young cardiac arrest patients and reported retrospectively. Patients were categorised by age, gender, aetiology and whether or not resuscitation attempts were made.
   Over 75% of patients were aged 18-35 years. There were significantly more males in this age group (p<0.001) compared to those aged 17 years or less. The most common cause of cardiac arrest was,an underlying cardiac cause (44.9%). Overdoses, hanging and other suicides were found to be major causes of cardiac arrests of non-cardiac origin in young adult males. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) was the most common known cause of death in infants aged less than I year. This age group received bystander CPR most often. 5.6% of young cardiac arrest patients who were taken to hospital survived to hospital discharge.
   Conclusions: Mortality in young cardiac arrest patients remains high. Focus should be placed on tackling social and psychological causes of cardiac arrest as well as cardiac aetiologies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Buprenorphine at high dosage became available in France in 1996, as a substitution treatment for heroin addicts. Since this date, numerous deaths were attributed to this drug. This paper reports two original series of 39 and 78 fatalities involving buprenorphine observed at the Institute of Legal Medicine of Strasbourg and at 13 other French forensic centers, respectively. The files were recorded from January 1996-May 2000. The first 20 fatalities that were previously published were excluded from this epidemiological study. From these 117 subjects, 96 were male (82%). Buprenorphine and its primary metabolite norbuprenophine were assayed in post-mortem blood by HPLC/MS (n = 11 labs) or by GC/MS (n = 3 labs). Blood levels for buprenorphine ranged from 0.5 to 51.0 ng/ml (mean 10.2 ng/ml) and 0.1 to 76 ng/ml (mean 12.6 ng/ml) in Strasbourg and the other centers, respectively. Blood levels for norbuprenorphine ranged from 0.2 to 47.1 ng/ml (mean 8.2 ng/ml) and <0.1 to 65 ng/ml (mean 10.6 ng/ml) in Strasbourg and the other centers, respectively. The mean values appear to be within the therapeutic range. Buprenorphine was identified in 24 of the 26 hair samples assayed in Strasbourg, at concentrations ranging from 10 to 1080 pg/mg. Intravenous injection of crushed tablets, a concomitant intake of psychotropics (especially benzodiazepines and neuroleptics) and the high dosage of the buprenorphine formulation available in France appear as the major risk factors for such fatalities. In addition, two suicide-related deaths were also observed, with blood buprenorphine, concentrations at 144 and 3276 ng/ml. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Since lethal insulin injection has been used in murder and suicide cases, its non-ambiguous detection in postmortem, mostly hemolytic blood samples is still a problem. In the present study the stability of insulin and reasons for its loss in those blood samples were examined. When incubated with buffer, serum or with intact blood cell suspensions insulin concentrations were found to remain stable over time, but a significant loss of insulin was observed in hemolyzed blood samples. This was not due to an enzymatic cleavage, but predominantly to the presence of hemoglobin. Incubation of insulin with a hemoglobin solution containing the same hemoglobin content as hemolyzed blood caused a dramatic decrease of the insulin concentration. Degradation of insulin reached its maximum after 23 h of incubation. The charge state of the ferric ion of hemoglobin could not be held accountable for the insulin-loss, but rather the protein part of hemoglobin. Alkylation experiments using iodoacetamide suggested that the thiol groups of the globin molecule are involved in the insulin loss preventing degradation at least partially. The same was observed by lowering the pH to 2.7 in the incubation mixture. Two degradation products of insulin were identified by mass spectrometry such as modified insulin A and B chains with 4 (A chain) and 2 Da (B chain) lower masses. These results suggest that thiol groups of hemoglobin cause splitting of the disulfide bonds of insulin which immediately leads to the formation of new intramolecular disulfide bridges, a reaction which occurs in hemolytic blood and may explain the gradual loss of insulin in postmortem blood samples.

AB Autopsies can give valuable information about the cause of death, and represent an important tool for obtaining valid cause of death statistics. In particular, they may shed light on the circumstances of death in ambiguous and criminal cases. To address the need for information on current autopsy practices, forensic autopsy rates in two counties in Central Norway over the period 2007-2009 were assessed. To investigate toxicological findings that could possibly remain undisclosed without the performance of an autopsy, the impact of alcohol and drugs in forensic autopsy cases from this material was evaluated.
   The total forensic autopsy rate in this material was 3%. The forensic autopsy rates were low for natural deaths (1%), accidental falls (12%) and the heterogeneous category "other accidents'' (21%), relatively high for accidental poisonings (84%), and less than adequate for road traffic accidents (57%). For suicides the forensic autopsy rate was 63%, and for recognized homicides 100%. The total forensic autopsy rate was higher for men than for women (5% vs. 2%), and decreased with age, being 38% in the age group <30 years, 23% in the age group 30-59 years, and 1% in the age group >59 years. Despite that Norwegian legislation and regulations regarding forensic autopsy requests are national, the forensic autopsy rates were generally lower in the county of Nord-Trondelag than in Sor-Trondelag, with most striking differences in suicide deaths (11% vs. 91%) and road traffic accidents (46% vs. 67%). This illustrates how autopsy rates, and possibly cause of death registries, might be susceptible to the influence of regional variations in law enforcement, with possible consequences for the quality and validity of cause of death statistics.
   Of the forensic autopsy cases where toxicological analysis was performed (361 of 364 cases) a total of 71% had positive toxicology results; 12% were positive for alcohol only, 44% were positive for drugs only, and 15% were positive for both alcohol and drugs. The toxicology results suggest that alcohol and drugs are important factors in sudden unexpected deaths, and that a thorough and comprehensive toxicological analysis is called for when investigating these deaths. Mean BAC in alcohol positive forensic autopsy cases was 1.7% (median 1.6%, range 0.29-4.1%). The average number of substances detected in toxicology positive cases was 2.6 (median 2, range 1-10). The by far most frequently detected classes of substances were (1) benzodiazepines, (2) opioids and (3) alcohol. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective The specific objectives of this study were to examine variation in the care of self-harm patients in hospital settings and to identify the factors that predict recommended next care following self-harm.
   Methods
   Data on consecutive presentations to Irish emergency departments ( EDs) involving self-harm from the National Self-Harm Registry Ireland from 2004 to 2012 were utilised. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to assess the associations between patients' clinical and demographic characteristics, and recommended next care received.
   Results
   Across the study period a total 101,904 self-harm presentations were made to hospital EDs, involving 63,457 individuals. Over the course of the study there was a declining number of presentations resulting in patient admission following attendance with self-harm. Recommended next care varied according to hospital location, with general admission rates ranging from 11% to 61% across administrative health regions. Multinomial logistic regression identified that the factor which most strongly affected next care was the presenting hospital. Being male, older age, method, repeat self-harm, time of attendance and residence of the patient were all identified as influencing care received. Psychiatric admission was most common when highly lethal methods of self-harm were used ( OR = 4.00, 95% CI, 3.63 - 4.41). A relatively large proportion of patients left the ED without being seen ( 15%) and the risk of doing so was highest for self-harm repeaters ( 1.64, 1.55 - 1.74 for those with 5+ presentations).
   Conclusions
   The extensive hospital variation in recommended next care indicates that management of self-harm patients may be determined more by where they present than by the needs of the patient. The study outcomes underline the need to standardise the clinical management of self-harm patients in general hospital settings.

TI Child deaths: confidential enquiry into the role and quality of UK
   primary care
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
DE avoidable factors; child; death; primary health care
AB Background
   In 2006 the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Perinatal Deaths was extended to pilot a collection of child deaths. This helped optimise data collection for local safeguarding children's boards, which, since April 2008, have a statutory responsibility to review all child deaths. Reviewing primary care records may highlight areas in which systems, skills, and care could be improved.
   Aim
   To review the role and quality of primary care in child deaths.
   Design of study
   Confidential enquiry into child deaths.
   Setting
   Five regions of the UK: North-East, South-West and West Midlands, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
   Method
   The confidential enquiry collected core data for all child deaths (age range 28 days to 17 years) and an age-stratified sample was assessed by multidisciplinary panels for avoidable factors. An independent detailed review was conducted of the primary care records on all children in the North-East region and all children who were reviewed by panel in the other four regions.
   Results
   Primary care records were reviewed for 168 child deaths. There were 25 (15%) deaths from acute infection, 22 (13%) from cancer, and 11 (7%) from asthma or epilepsy. Fifty-nine (35%) deaths were sudden: sudden unexplained death in infancy, suicides, and assaults. Of 149 with immunisation records, only 88 (59%) had been fully vaccinated on time. One or more primary care professionals were involved in the management of 90 (54%) children. Avoidable primary care factors were identified in 18 (20%) of these deaths. Avoidable primary care factors included failure in the recognition and management of serious infection, failure to vaccinate, and inadequate management of asthma and epilepsy.
   Conclusion
   Decisions made about diagnosis and management in primary care may affect the cause, time, and circumstances of a child's death. Maintaining skills in assessing the acutely ill child remains an essential part of good clinical practice.

AB Background: There is concern that medical marijuana laws (MMLs) could negatively affect adolescents. To better understand these policies, we assess how adolescent exposure to MMLs is related to educational attainment.
   Methods: Data from the 2000 Census and 2001-2014 American Community Surveys were restricted to individuals who were of high school age (14-18) between 1990 and 2012 (n = 5,483,715). MML exposure was coded as: (i) a dichotomous "any MML" indicator, and (ii) number of years of high school age exposure. We used logistic regression to model whether MMLs affected: (a) completing high school by age 19; (b) beginning college, irrespective of completion; and (c) obtaining any degree after beginning college. A similar dataset based on the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) was also constructed for confirmatory analyses assessing marijuana use.
   Results: MMLs were associated with a 0.40 percentage point increase in the probability of not earning a high school diploma or GED after completing the 12th grade (from 3.99% to 4.39%). High school MML exposure was also associated with a 1.84 and 0.85 percentage point increase in the probability of college non-enrollment and degree non-completion, respectively (from 31.12% to 32.96% and 45.30% to 46.15%, respectively). Years of MML exposure exhibited a consistent dose response relationship for all outcomes. MMLs were also associated with 0.85 percentage point increase in daily marijuana use among 12th graders (up from 1.26%).
   Conclusions: Medical marijuana law exposure between age 14 to 18 likely has a delayed effect on use and education that persists over time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Excepting "Green Tea" and "Carmilla," Sheridan Le Fanu's fiction is generally neglected by modern-day readers, yet his work reveals much information about the conduct of life in nineteenth century Ireland and England. Le Fanu's works should be appreciated for the insights he provides into the psychology of his characters; his fiction was written prior to what historians of psychology date as the formal establishment of the discipline in 1879, which occurred after his death. His fiction also illustrates the emerging medical specialty of neurology, although Le Fanu's later writings are more illustrative of his interest in the mystical works of Emanuel Swedenborg. His characters frequently suffer from " brain fevers" and other maladies that were the subject of intense debate in England, continental Europe, and America. His male characters in particular suffer from guilty consciences, and suicide is a frequent fate. Each of these aspects of Le Fanu's fiction can be found in the 1872 collection In a Glass Darkly, which purports to contain five case histories of the German metaphysical physician Doctor Martin Hesselius. In this chapter, each of the stories in the collection will be described and analyzed for Hesselius' use of psychological, neurological, or mystical explanations for the events occurring within the story. Hesselius' descriptions of psychological constructs are rather advanced for a physician discussing mental disorders in the nineteenth century. His theories within this collection of stories with respect to neurology and neuroscience, on the other hand, are much more representative of the eighteenth century, something that would be natural given that the stories contained in the collection were purported to have occurred in the latter decades of the eighteenth or early decades of the nineteenth century.

AB The NMDA receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of several diseases including schizophrenia and affective disorders. We have investigated the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor in a well-defined series of psychiatric cases using radioligand binding and quantitative immunoblotting techniques. Saturable radioligand binding of [H-3]L-689,560 to the glycine site on this subunit of the NMDA receptor was undertaken in superior temporal cortex of patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and matched control subjects. A tendency towards an increased receptor density was found in schizophrenia. A significant decrease in NMDA receptor density below control value was found in both bipolar and depressive disorders. The immunoblotting technique was used to identify NR1 protein in the same series of cases of which two bands were identified consistent with NR1 splice variants. A tendency to a decrease in the density of the NR1 upper band below control values was found in bipolar and depressed patients, but not schizophrenics. Consistent with this observation, the ratio between the upper and lower NR1-immunoreactive bands showed a significant decrease in bipolar disorder, although the ratio in depression did not reach significance. No significant difference was found in the NR1 lower band in any patient group compared with control. The finding of an increase NMDA receptor density in schizophrenia is consistent with the previous reports, with a possible compensatory response to glutamatergic deficits in superior temporal cortex in schizophrenia. The findings in affective disorders are interesting in respect of reports of cortical NMDA receptor deficits in suicide victims, although antidepressant drug treatment may contribute to these changes.

AB Between 1978 and 1997 the Institute of Legal Medicine of the Hannover Medical School examined 17 fatal autoerotic deaths. The incidence for the Hannover region was 0.49 cases per million inhabitants per year. The victims included 17 men with an average age of 36.8 years; a peak in the age distribution was seen between 20 and 29 years. Twelve of the men were found by friends or family in a domestic environment, while other situations in which the victims were found included the victim's own car, a hotel room, a canal embankment, a public parking lot as well as the holding cell of the youth detention center. The men were of varying socioeconomic status and held a number of different types of jobs or still attended school. Five of the men were found completely nude, while five were only undressed below the waist. Four men wore women's clothes and two were fully clothed with exposed genitals. Besides women's clothes, other objects found at the scene included various types of sexual aids, including ropes, chains, metal bars, locks, sex magazines, condoms, plastic bags, rubber items, etc. In four cases blood alcohol levels between 0.1 and 2.5parts per thousand (urine alcohol levels between 0.2 and 2.5parts per thousand) were found. Toxicologic examination revealed chloroform, ketamin, a propane-butane gas mixture in one case each, and in two cases cocaine and morphine. Causes of death included central paralysis after strangulation (seven cases), asphyxiation (4), subarachnoid hemorrhage (2), intoxication (1), hypothermia (1), left heart failure (1), and drowning (1). The history, findings at scene, and autopsy findings and, in individual cases, other investigations are of utmost importance to accurately reconstruct a fatal autoerotic accident.

AB In the period 1992-1996 a total of 89 unidentified bodies/skulls found in Danish waters were investigated at the three University Institutes of Forensic Medicine in Denmark. Males constituted 79% of the total material. Open water was the finding place in half the cases. about one-fourth was found on shore and another fourth in a harbor basin. Totally 73 bodies and one skull were identified. Danes constituted 57% of the material. Almost all non-Danes originated from countries with borders to the waters surrounding Denmark. The cause of death was in 71% stated as presumably/possibly drowning, in 5% as severe lesions (precipitation) and in 25% it could not be solved. The manner of death was in non-Danes most often stated as an accident (56%), and according to this the finding place in non-Danes most frequently was the open water (66%). In Danes suicide predominated (71%) and the finding place in Danes was almost equally distributed among open water, shores and harbors. respectively, Among the totally 74 identified cases, 83% of the total material, an initial suggestion of the identity based on effects found on the body was possible in 43 cases (58%). The final identification was performed by means of forensic dental examination in total 58 cases (78%). in Danes in 93% and in non-Danes in 59%. In the remaining 16 cases one or more of the following contributed to the final identification: information about dental condition, clothing, personal papers, X-ray photos. jewelry, tattoos/scars and fingerprints. The importance of a close collaboration between the police, the forensic pathologist and the forensic dental expert in order to reach a fair number of positive identifications is emphasized.

AB Background: Many men's health outcomes are poor at the global level. Men have lower life and healthy life expectancies than women. They are more likely to die from cancer, cardiovascular disease, suicide, road traffic accidents and other major causes of death. They are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol excessively and eat a poor diet. In many countries and for many diseases, men use primary care services less effectively than women.
   Objectives: The purpose of this article was to review the key data on men's health at the global level and explore explanations for men's outcomes, including health practices, use of services and health literacy and masculinities. The response of health organisations, the evidence of the impact of gender-sensitive interventions and the case for action on men's health were also considered.
   Major findings: Despite the problems with men's health, it has been largely overlooked by national and global health organisations. When organisations do focus on gender, action is usually targeted at women and girls rather than both sexes. There is an increasing body of evidence that sex-specific initiatives can also be effective.
   Conclusions: If population health is to be improved, and if good health is a universal right, steps must be taken to improve men's health as well as women's. There is a role for male-targeted health policies (building on the lessons of national men's health policies in Ireland, Brazil and Australia) as well as changes to service delivery. There is not a choice to be made between men's health and women's health: this need not be a zero sum game. Action is needed for both sexes and improving the health of men will also improve the health of women.

AB Free-fall fractures represent a specific form of blunt force trauma that can be hard to interpret because of the numerous factors that affect it. The aim of this study is to focus on skeletal injury patterns resulting from free-falls and to analyse the relationship between specific skeletal fractures, and the height and cause (accidental vs. suicidal) of the fall.
   A total of 179 autopsy reports of fatal free-falls from known heights were analysed at the Department of Forensic Medicine and Criminalistics, in Rijeka, Croatia. The location, type and frequency of fractures, as well as the number and distribution of fractured regions were analysed with regard to height and cause of fall.
   Height was found to be the major factor influencing fracture patterns in free-falls. In our sample, the frequencies of thoracic fractures, fractures to the extremities and those to the pelvis increased with height. Head fractures show no such relationship. However, types of fractures recorded in different anatomical regions, including the cranium, differ between height groups suggesting different injury mechanisms in each. Victims of falls generally sustained fractures in more than one body region, and the number of injured regions correlates significantly with height. Although no statistical difference was found in the number of fractured regions or frequency of fractures between accidental fallers and suicidal jumpers, jumpers showed a significantly higher number of bilateral extremity fractures when compared to victims of accidental falls. Logistic regression analyses also demonstrate a significant relationship between lower extremity fractures, and the cause of the fall.
   Our results highlight the need for further investigations of the influence that behaviour and height have in free-fall fractures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The final diagnosis of death in hypoglycaemic or diabetic coma should always be done as a synopsis of anamnestic response, morphology, biochemical (glucose, lactate, HBA1c, ketonic bodies, insulin, and C-peptide) and toxicological findings.
   High glucose levels in vitreous humour (more than 13 mmol/L, 234 mg/dL) or combined values of glucose and lactate in vitreous humour or in cerebrospinal fluid over threshold values of 23.7 mmol/L (427 mg/dL) and 23.4 mmol/L (422 mg/dL) respectively, can be an indicator of the pre-mortem hyperglycaemic state with fatal outcome. The determination of glycated haemoglobin, acetone and other ketone bodies improve the diagnostic values of the whole procedure. Diabetic ketoacidosis (blood aceton > 0.3 g/L) is more often the cause of death of diabetic patients than the non-ketotic hyperosmolal state.
   Hypoglycaemia is deemed fatal if the combined values are lower than 5.5 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) and can not be excluded if they are lower than 8.9 mmol/L (160 mg/dL).
   Two cases of detected hypoglycaemia are described further.
   A psychiatric patient with diabetes (Hba1c 8.4%) committed suicide with an insulin overdose. The combined values of glucose and lactate in vitreous humour and in cerebrospinal fluid were 3.3 and 4.1 mmol/l, respectively.
   In another case a low combined glucose and lactate value (8.7 mmol/L) in vitreous humour indicated, besides the high concentration of glibenclamide (0.9 mg/L) in the blood of a driver with a poorly controlled diabetic condition (Hba1c = 10.6%), a state of decreasing blood glucose in the time before the accident causing the driver to feel unwell and behave inappropriately.

AB Background: People With substance use disorders (SUDs) have increased risk of mortality but risk in sub-groups is poorly understood.
   Methods: SUD cases, aged 15 years or older, were identified in the South London and Maudsley Case Register which contains over 150,000 specialist mental healthcare and addictions service users linked to regular national mortality tracing. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for the period 2007-2009 were calculated based on expected numbers of deaths for England and Wales in 2008 then stratified by gender, age, ethnicity, and type of substance use disorder. Life expectancies at birth were estimated.
   Results: We detected 10,927 cases with a primary substance use disorder diagnosis prior to 2010, who were active to South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust services between 2007 and 2009. Alcohol and opioid use disorders were the most common disorders (45.4% and 44.2% of the SUD cohort respectively) and were associated with increased mortality (SMRs 4.04 and 4.85 respectively). Subgroups at particularly high risk were women with opioid use disorder (SMR 7.32) and those under the age of 45 years with alcohol use disorder (SMR 9.25). SMRs associated with alcohol and opioid use disorders diminished with age. Life expectancies of individuals with alcohol and opioid use disorders were reduced by 9-17 years compared to national norms.
   Conclusions: Those under 45 years with alcohol use disorder and women with opioid use disorder are at particularly high risk of mortality. More targeted health care is required to address the specific needs of these vulnerable subgroups. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The homozygous NQO1*2 polymorphism results in a null NQO1 phenotype and is a susceptibility factor for occupational benzene poisoning. NQO1 plays an important role in detoxification of benzene-derived quinones but plays a role in numerous other non-metabolic cellular functions. NQO1 is expressed in endothelial cells of bone marrow which form the vascular stem cell niche important in stem cell homing and mobilization. We therefore employed a transformed human bone marrow endothelial cell (HBMEC) line to define the effects of compromising NQO1 on endothelial function. Either inhibition or knockdown of NQO1 led to decreased expression of the adhesion molecules E-selectin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 and decreased functional adhesion of CD34+ progenitor cells after TNF alpha stimulation. Suicide inhibition or knockdown of NQO1 decreased NF kappa B p105 precursor and NF kappa B p50 subunit levels as well as leading to decreased nuclear levels of NF kappa B phospho-p65. An additional function of endothelial cells is tube formation and angiogenesis which was inhibited by the benzene metabolite hydroquinone suggesting that endothelial function may be affected at multiple levels after exposure of NQO1*2 polymorphic individuals to benzene. These data demonstrate that NQO1 plays an upstream role in NF kappa B signaling and adhesion molecule expression in HBMEC and that NQO1 has important regulatory effects in its own right in addition to being a marker for Nrf-2 activation. Metabolic susceptibility factors such as NQO1 have roles in addition to detoxification of reactive intermediates and interrogation of these novel roles can inform both mechanisms of toxicity and human risk assessment.

AB Purpose: Our study aimed to assess the longitudinal association of frequency of contact with non-cohabitating adult children and risk of depression in the elderly.
   Methods: Elderly aged >= 60 years were included from Living Profiles of Older People Survey (LPOPS) in Korea. The baseline assessment, Wave 1, was conducted in 2008, and follow-up assessment, Wave 2, was conducted in 2011. We included participants who completed both waves and excluded those who met the following criteria: no adult children, living with adult children, cognitive impairment at either waves, and depression at baseline (n = 4398). We defined infrequent contact as <1 time per month face-to-face contact or <1 time per week phone contact and classified participants into four groups based on contact method and frequency. Depression was measured using the 15-item geriatric depression scales (SGDS-K).
   Results: In multivariable logistic regression analysis, infrequent face-to-face and phone contact group had adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.86 (95% CI, 1.44-2.42) when compared with frequent face-to-face and phone contact group. Frequent face-to-face contact with infrequent phone contact group and infrequent face-to-face contact with frequent phone contact group had adjusted OR of 1.49 (95% CI, 1.12-1.98) and 1.44 (95% CI, 1.15-1.80), respectively, when compared with frequent face-to-face and phone contact group.
   Conclusion: These results propose that the risk of subsequent depression in elderly is associated with frequency of contact with non-cohabitating adult children. Moreover, the efficacy of face-to-face contact and that of phone contact were similar, while the group lacking both types of contact demonstrated the highest risk of depression.

AB Aims: To estimate the global prevalence of cocaine and amphetamine dependence and the burden of disease attributable to these disorders.
   Methods: An epidemiological model was developed using DisMod-MR, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, using epidemiological data (prevalence, incidence, remission and mortality) sourced from a multi-stage systematic review of data. Age, sex and region-specific prevalence was estimated for and multiplied by comorbidity-adjusted disability weightings to estimate years of life lost to disability (YLDs) from these disorders. Years of life lost (YLL) were estimated from cross-national vital registry data. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were estimated by summing YLDs and YLLs in 21 regions, by sex and age, in 1990 and 2010.
   Results: In 2010, there were an estimated 24.1 million psychostimulant dependent people: 6.9 million cocaine and 17.2 million amphetamines, equating to a point prevalence of 0.10% (0.09-0.11%) for cocaine, and 0.25% (0.22-0.28%) for amphetamines. There were 37.6 amphetamine dependence DALYs (21.3-59.3) per 100,000 population in 2010 and 15.9 per 100,000 (9.3-25.0) cocaine dependence DALYs. There were clear differences between amphetamines and cocaine in the geographic distribution of crude DALYs. Over half of amphetamine dependence DALYs were in Asian regions (52%), whereas almost half of cocaine dependence DALYs were in the Americas (44%, with 23% in North America High Income).
   Conclusion: Dependence upon psychostimulants is a substantial contributor to global disease burden; the contribution of cocaine and amphetamines to this burden varies dramatically by geographic region. There is a need to scale up evidence-based interventions to reduce this burden. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: There is controversy regarding the association between age and being female and survival to hospital discharge after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We hypothesized that younger females (aged 12-49 years) would be independently associated with increased survival after OHCA when compared to other age and sex groups.
   Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of prospectively collected data from 29 United States cities that participate in the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES). Patients were included if they were >12 years of age and had a documented resuscitation attempt from October 1, 2005 through December 31, 2009. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the associations between age and sex groups and survival to hospital discharge.
   Results: Females were less likely to have a cardiac arrest in public, was witnessed, or was treatable with defibrillation. Females in the 12-49 year old age group had a similar proportion of survival to hospital discharge when compared to age-matched males (females 11.6% vs. males 11.2%), while males >= 50 years old were more likely to survive when compared to age matched females (females 6.9% vs. males 9.6%). Age stratified regression models demonstrated that 12-49 year old females had the largest association with survival to hospital discharge (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.20-2.00), while females in the >= 50 year old age group had a smaller increased odds of survival to hospital discharge (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.03-1.35), which only lasted until the age of 55 years (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.97-1.29).
   Conclusions: Younger aged females were associated with increased odds of survival despite being found with poorer prognostic arrest characteristics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the mortality risks, over 20 years of follow-up in a nationally representative sample, associated with illegal drug use and to describe risk factors for mortality.
   Methods: We analyzed data from the 1991 National Health Interview Survey, which is a nationally representative household survey in the United States, linked to the National Death Index through 2011. This study included 20,498 adults, aged 18-44 years in 1991, with 1047 subsequent deaths. A composite variable of self-reported lifetime illegal drug use was created (hierarchical categories of heroin, cocaine, hallucinogens/inhalants, and marijuana use).
   Results: Mortality risk was significantly elevated among individuals who reported lifetime use of heroin (HR = 2.40, 95% CI: 1.65-3.48) and cocaine (HR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.04-1.55), but not for those who used hallucinogens/inhalants or marijuana, when adjusting for demographic characteristics. Baseline health risk factors (smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, and BMI) explained the greatest amount of this mortality risk. After adjusting for all baseline covariates, the association between heroin or cocaine use and mortality approached significance. In models adjusted for demographics, people who reported lifetime use of heroin or cocaine had an elevated mortality risk due to external causes (poisoning, suicide, homicide, and unintentional injury). People who had used heroin, cocaine, or hallucinogens/inhalants had an elevated mortality risk due to infectious diseases.
   Conclusions: Heroin and cocaine are associated with considerable excess mortality, particularly due to external causes and infectious diseases. This association can be explained mainly by health risk behaviors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Impulsivity and aggressiveness are personality traits associated with a vulnerability to suicidal behavior. Behavioral expression of these traits differs by gender and has been related to central serotonergic function. We assessed the relationships between serotonin-2A receptor function, gender, and personality traits in borderline personality disorder (BPD), a disorder characterized by impulsive-aggression and recurrent suicidal behavior. Participants, who included 33 BPD patients and 27 healthy controls (HC), were assessed for Axis I and II disorders with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and the International Personality Disorders Examination, and with the Diagnostic Interview for Borderline Patients-Revised for BPD. Depressed mood, impulsivity, aggression, and temperament were assessed with standardized measures. Positron emission tomography with [F-18]altanserin as ligand and arterial blood sampling was used to determine the binding potentials (BPND) of serotonin-2A receptors in 11 regions of interest Data were analyzed using Logan graphical analysis, controlling for age and nonspecific binding. Among BPD subjects, aggression, Cluster B co-morbidity, antisocial PD, and childhood abuse were each related to altanserin binding. BPND values predicted impulsivity and aggression in BPD females (but not BPD males), and in HC males (but not HC females.) Altanserin binding was greater in BPD females than males in every contrast, but it did not discriminate suicide attempters from non-attempters. Region specific differences in serotonin-2A receptor binding related to diagnosis and gender predicted clinical expression of aggression and impulsivity. Vulnerability to suicidal behavior in BPD may be related to serotonin-2A binding through expression of personality risk factors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved,

AB Aim of the study: Marsilea minuta Linn. (Marsileaceae) has been referred in Indian traditional medicine system (Ayurveda) for the treatment of insomnia and other mental disorders. Marsiline isolated from Marsilea minuta was reported to have sedative and anticonvulsant property. The ethanol extract of Marsilea minuta was standardised for marsiline (1.15%, w/w) and studied for its antidepressant activity.
   Materials and methods: Antidepressant activity was studied using forced swimming test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), learned helplessness test (LHT) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) induced head twitches response in rodents. Standardised extract of Marsilea minuta in doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg/day were administered orally for three consecutive days and evaluated on day 3, 1 It after the last dose treatment. Imipramine (15 mg/kg/day, i.p.) was used as the standard drug. Neurochemical mechanism of antidepressant activity was elucidated by using radioligand receptor binding assays for 5-HT2A and benzodiazepine receptors in rat frontal cortex.
   Results: Immobility time in FST and TST was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced by ethanol extract of Marsilea minuta treated animals. A decrease in number of escape failures in LHT was also observed in Marsilea minuta treated rats. Head twitch response induced by 5-HTP was significantly attenuated by Marsilea minuta (400 mg/kg, p.o.) and imipramine showing the involvement of serotonergic system. This effect was corroborated with radioligand receptor binding study where Marsilea minuta (400 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly (P<0.05) down regulated 5-HT2A receptor in frontal cortex, whereas, no marked effect was observed for benzodiazepine receptor.
   Conclusion: The antidepressant effect exhibited by Marsilea minuta extract may be due to its effect on 5-HT2A density in rat frontal cortex. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: (1) To examine the trends in the incidence of dual diagnosis (DD) of severe mental illness and substance-related disorders among inpatients in Israel, and (2) the demographic and clinical correlates of DD patients.
   Method: Using data from the National Psychiatric Case Register, we identified 56,774 inpatients aged 15-64 whose first psychiatric hospitalization occurred between 1996 and 2010. We compared the characteristics of inpatients having DD with drugs, alcohol or drug/alcohol abuse with those with mental disorder only.
   Results: Over the period, DD with drugs decreased from 8.2% in 1996 to 6% in 2010; DD with alcohol increased from 3% to 4% and DD with drugs/alcohol from 2% to 4%. DD with drugs was highest, whereas DD with alcohol was lowest for the youngest age- group in 1996 but increased to the same as other age-groups in 2006-2010. Male gender, a previous suicide attempt, compulsory hospitalizations and marital status were positive predictors for all DD. Immigrant status was a positive predictor of DD with alcohol, but the opposite for DD with drugs; being Jewish and psychotic diagnosis was a positive predictor of DD with drugs, but negative for DD with alcohol.
   Conclusions: Over the study period, DD with drugs has decreased among young patients, although it is still higher than among older groups. However, DD with alcohol or drugs/alcohol has increased in the younger group. The clinical-demographic profile of DD patients was similar to that from the relevant literature, except for immigrant status that was negatively associated with DD with drugs.

AB Depression is one of the most prevalent mental illnesses, and causes a constant feeling of sadness and lose of interest, which often leads to suicide. Evidence suggests that depression is associated with aberrant MEK/ERK signaling. However, studies on MEK/ERK signaling in depression have only been done in a few brain regions, such as the hippocampus and mesolimbic reward pathways. Recent studies also implicate the involvement of the prefrontal cortex in depression. Thus, we examined the changes in MEK/ERK signaling in subregions of the prefrontal cortex of C57BL/6 mice by immunohistochemistry using phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser 217/221) and ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) antibodies. Mice were subjected to 21 consecutive days of restraint stress (for 2 h daily), and depression-like behavior was evaluated using a sociability test and tail suspension test. The antidepressant, imipramine (20 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally 30 min before restraint stress exposure. Chronic/repeated restraint stress produced depressive-like behavior, such as increased social avoidance in the social interaction test, and enhanced immobility time in the tail suspension test. This depressive behavior was ameliorated by imipramine. The behavioral changes well corresponded to a decrease in MEK/ERK immunoreactivity in the medial orbital (MO) cortex and dorsal endopiriform nuclei (DEn), which was averted by imipramine, but not in cingulate, prelimbic, infralimbic, and motor cortex. These results suggest that MEK/ERK signaling is disrupted in the DEn and MO subregions of the prefrontal cortex in the depressive phenotype, and that blocking a decrease in activated MEK/ERK is inherent to the antidepressant imipramine response.

AB Involvement of dysregulated autophagy in cancer growth and progression has been shown in different tumour entities, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). PDA is an extremely aggressive tumour characterized by a small population of highly therapy-resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs) capable of self-renewal and migration. We examined whether autophagy might be involved in the survival of CSCs despite nutrition and oxygen deprivation typical for the hypoxic tumour microenvironment of PDA. Immunohistochemistry revealed that markers for hypoxia, CSCs and autophagy are co-expressed in patient-derived tissue of PDA. Hypoxia starvation (H/S) enhanced clonogenic survival and migration of established pancreatic cancer cells with stem-like properties (CSChigh), while pancreatic tumour cells with fewer stem cell markers (CSClow) did not survive these conditions. Electron microscopy revealed more advanced autophagic vesicles in CSChigh cells, which exhibited higher expression of autophagy-related genes under normoxic conditions and relative to CSClow cells, as found by RT-PCR and western blot analysis. LC3 was already fully converted to the active LC3-II form in both cell lines, as evaluated by western blot and detection of accumulated GFP-LC3 protein by fluorescence microscopy. H/S increased formation of autophagic and acid vesicles, as well as expression of autophagy-related genes, to a higher extent in CSChigh cells. Modulation of autophagy by inhibitors and activators resensitized CSChigh to apoptosis and diminished clonogenicity, spheroid formation, expression of CSC-related genes, migratory activity and tumourigenicity in mice. Our data suggest that enhanced autophagy levels may enable survival of CSChigh cells under H/S. Interference with autophagy-activating or -inhibiting drugs disturbs the fine-tuned physiological balance of enhanced autophagy in CSC and switches survival signalling to suicide.

AB We examined the prevalence of painful physical symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), clinical correlations therewith, and associations between painful symptoms and depression severity, quality of life, and suicidality, in a clinical sample in Korea. A total of 414 psychiatric outpatients at least 18 years of age, with a primary diagnosis of MDD based on the DSM-IV-TR, were enrolled at the discretion of their treating psychiatrist. Patients were assessed for the presence or absence of painful physical symptoms (PPS+ and PPS-, respectively), defined by a total score >= 5 on the pain subscale (PS) of the Depression and Somatic Symptoms Scale (DSSS). DSSS and the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S) determined depression severity, and the EuroQoL Questionnaire-5 dimensions (EQ-5D) determined perceived quality of life. Questions about suicidality during current depressive episode were also asked to the participants. Overall, 30.4% of patients were classified as PPS+. PPS+ patients were older, less educated, less frequently unmarried, and more frequently widowed/divorced/separated compared to PPS- patients. PPS+ patients showed a significantly greater depression severity (CGI-S mean difference 0.92; 95% CI = 0.68 to 1.16; DSSS mean difference 18.39; 95% Cl = 16.28 to 20.50), a significantly lower quality of life (EQ-5D VAS mean difference -18.15; 95% CI = -22.68 to -13.62), and significantly higher suicidal ideation (OR 1.73; 95% Cl 1.04-2.86) during the current depressive episode. This study suggests that assessment of depressive patients should include detailed questions about painful physical symptoms, and treatment of MDD should involve management targeting painful physical symptoms as well as emotional and non-painful physical symptoms.

AB Many studies support a significant relation between low cholesterol levels and poor impulse, aggression and mood control. Evidence exists also for a causal link between low brain serotonin (5-HT) activity and these behaviors. Mechanisms linking cholesterol and hostile or self-destructive behavior are unknown, but it has been suggested that low cholesterol influences 5-HT function. This study was designed to explore the relationship between plasma cholesterol, measures of impulsivity and aggression, and indices of 5-HT function in personality disordered cocaine addicts. Thirty-eight hospitalized male patients (age 36.8 +/- 7.1) were assessed with the DSM-III-R, the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI), the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) and the Brown-Goodwin Assessment for Life History of Aggression. Fasting basal cholesterol (total, LDL and HDL) was determined 2 weeks after cocaine discontinuation. On the same day 5-HT function was assessed by neuroendocrine (cortisol and prolactin) and psychological (NIMH and 'high' self-rating scales) responses following meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) challenges. Reduced neuroendocrine responses,'high' feelings and increased 'activation-euphoria' following m-CPP have been interpreted as indicating 5-HT alterations in a variety of psychiatric conditions. Significantly lower levels of HDL cholesterol were found in patients who had a history of aggression (P = 0.005). Lower levels of HDL cholesterol were also found to be significantly associated with more intense 'high' and 'activation-euphoria' responses as well as with blunted cortisol responses to m-CPP (P = 0.033, P = 0.025 and P = 0.018, respectively). This study gives further support to existing evidence indicating that in some individuals, the probability of exhibiting impulsive and violent behaviors may be increased when cholesterol is low. It also suggests that low cholesterol and alterations in 5-HT activity may be causally related. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective To compare the drowning mortality rates and proportion of deaths of each intent among all drowning deaths in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in 2012-2014.
   Design A population-based cross-sectional study.
   Setting 32 OECD countries.
   Participants Individuals in OECD countries who died from drowning.
   Main outcome measures Drowning mortality rates (deaths per 100000 population) and proportion (%) of deaths of each intent (ie, unintentional intent, intentional self-harm, assault, undetermined intent and all intents combined) among all drowning deaths.
   Results Countries with the highest drowning mortality rates (deaths per 100000 population) were Estonia (3.53), Japan (3.49) and Greece (2.40) for unintentional intent; Ireland (0.96), Belgium (0.96) and Korea (0.89) for intentional self-harm; Austria (0.57), Korea (0.56) and Hungary (0.44) for undetermined intent and Japan (4.35), Estonia (3.70) and Korea (2.73) for all intents combined. Korea ranked 12th and 3rd for unintentional intent and all intents combined, respectively. By contrast, Belgium ranked 2nd and 15th for intentional self-harm and all intents combined, respectively. The proportion of deaths of each intent among all drowning deaths in each country varied greatly: from 26.2% in Belgium to 96.8% in Chile for unintentional intent; 0.7% in Mexico to 57.4% in Belgium for intentional self-harm; 0.0% in nine countries to 4.9% in Mexico for assault and 0.0% in Israel and Turkey to 38.3% in Austria for undetermined intent.
   Conclusions A large variation in the practice of classifying undetermined intent in drowning deaths across countries was noted and this variation hinders valid international comparisons of intent-specific (unintentional and intentional self-harm) drowning mortality rates.

AB Background: Risk assessments are widely used, but their ability to predict outcomes in opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment remains unclear. Therefore, the aim was to investigate if addiction-specific brief risk screening is effective in identifying high mortality risk groups and if subsequent clinical actions following risk assessment impacts on mortality levels.
   Methods: Opioid use disorder (OUD) patients were identified in the South London and Maudsley Case Register. Deaths were identified through database linkage to the national mortality dataset. Cox and competing-risk regression were used to model associations between brief risk assessment domains and all-cause and overdose mortality in 4488 OUD patients, with up-to 6-year follow-up time where 227 deaths were registered. Data were stratified by admission to general mental health services.
   Results: All-cause mortality was significantly associated with unsafe injecting (HR 1.53,95% CI 1.10-2.11) and clinically appraised likelihood of accidental overdose (HR 1.48,95% CI 1.00-2.19). Overdose-mortality was significantly associated with unsafe injecting (SHR 2.52, 95% CI 1.11-5.70) and clinically appraised suicidality (SHR 2.89, 95% Cl 1.38-6.03). Suicidality was associated with a twofold increase in mortality risk among OUD patients who were not admitted to mental health services within 2 months of their risk assessment (HR 2.03, 95% Cl 1.67-3.24).
   Conclusions: Diagnosis-specific brief risk screening can identify OUD patient subgroups at increased risk of all-cause and overdose mortality. OUD patients, where suicidality is evident, who are not admitted into services are particularly vulnerable. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB This study is situated within the international literature on geographic health inequalities between urban and rural areas. Using data from the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study (ONS LS), this paper assesses the role of residential mobility within England between 1981 and 2001 in explaining geographic inequalities in all-cause mortality between urban and rural Local Authority Districts at the end of the period (deaths occurring between 2001 and 2005). First, the pattern of directly age-standardised death rates (2001-2005) in urban and rural areas of residence in 2001 is examined and compared with the pattern that would have been seen if the observed death/survival of individuals had occurred in their original place of residence in 1981, or in 1991. Secondly, logistic regression is applied to examine whether individuals' residential mobility between urban and rural areas predict the risk of mortality, adjusting for people's socio-demographic characteristics. Findings show that, for this sample, residential mobility 1981-2001 accounts for about 30% of the urban rural inequalities in mortality observed at the end of the period. LS members who were residentially mobile between urban and rural areas were relatively healthier than long-term urban residents, with better mortality outcomes among rural in-migrants. In age-stratified analysis, LS members of working age (20-64 years) moving out of rural areas, and LS members of retirement age (65 years and older) moving into rural areas, were shown to be healthier. Processes of selective migration in and out of rural areas in England are complex and may partly explain urban rural health inequalities. In terms of varying mortality risk, findings also highlight the possible marginalisation and disadvantage of sub-groups of the rural population. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Drug users in clinical samples have elevated mortality compared with the general population, but little is known about mortality among users of drugs within the general population. Aim: To determine whether self-reported use of illicit drugs and non-prescribed sedatives/hypnotics among young men in the general population is related to mortality.
   Methods: A 35-year follow-up of 48 024 Swedish men, born 1949-1951 and conscripted in 1969/1970, among whom drug use was reported by 8767 subjects. Cross-record linkage was effected between individual data from the Swedish conscription and other national registers. Deaths and causes of death/1000 person-years were calculated. Cox PH regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for death with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). An HR was calculated for users of different dominant drugs at conscription compared with non-users by age interval, after adjusting for confounders and hospitalisation with a drug-related diagnosis.
   Results: Drug users showed elevated mortality (HR 1.61, p < 0.05) compared with non-users. After adjusting for risk factors, users of stimulants (HR 4.41, p < 0.05), cannabis (HR 4.27, p < 0.05), opioids (HR 2.83, p > 0.05), hallucinogens (HR 3.88, p < 0.05) and unspecified drugs (HR 4.62, p < 0.05) at conscription with a drug-related diagnosis during follow-up showed an HR approaching the standard mortality ratios in clinical samples. Among other drug users (95.5%), only stimulant users showed statistically significantly increased mortality (HR 1.96, p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: In a life-time perspective, drug use among young men in the general population was a marker of premature death, even a long time after exposure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Deliberate self-harm among young people is an important focus of policy and practice internationally. Nonetheless, there is little reliable comparative international information on its extent or characteristics. We have conducted a seven-country comparative community study of deliberate self-harm among young people. Method: Over 30,000 mainly 15- and 16-year-olds completed anonymous questionnaires at school in Australia, Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands and Norway. Study criteria were developed to identify episodes of self-harm; the prevalence of self-harm acts and thoughts, methods used, repetition, reasons given, premeditation, setting for the act, associations with alcohol and drugs, hospitalisation, and whether other people knew, were examined. Results: Self-harm was more than twice as common among females as males and, in four of the seven countries, at least one in ten females had harmed herself in the previous year. Additional young people had thought of harming themselves without doing so. More males and females in all countries except Hungary cut themselves than used any other method, most acts took place at home, and alcohol and illegal drugs were not usually involved. The most common reasons given were 'to get relief from a terrible state of mind' followed by 'to die', although there were differences between those cutting themselves and those taking overdoses. About half the young people decided to harm themselves in the hour before doing so, and many did not attend hospital or tell anyone else. Just over half those who had harmed themselves during the previous year reported more than one episode over their lifetime. Conclusions: Deliberate self-harm is a widespread yet often hidden problem in adolescents, especially females, which shows both similarities and differences internationally.

AB Background: Recent research on the patterns of self-harm around public holidays is lacking. This study used national data to examine the patterns of hospital-treated self-harm during public holidays, and to examine associated factors.
   Methods: Data on self-harm presentations to all emergency departments were obtained from the National Self Harm Registry Ireland. The association between self-harm presentations and public holidays was examined using univariate and multivariate Poisson regression analyses.
   Results: A total of 104,371 presentations of self-harm were recorded between 2007 and 2015. The mean number of self-harm presentations was 32 on public holidays. St. Patrick's Day had the highest number of presentations compared to all other public holidays, with a daily mean of 44 presentations. Across all years, self-harm presentations during public holidays had a 24% increased risk of involving alcohol consumption compared to all other days and this effect was most pronounced during the Christmas period. The association with alcohol remained significant at a multivariate level. Presentations on public holidays were more likely to attend out of normal working hours. An increase in male presentations involving self-cutting was observed on public holidays and there was an over-representation of males presenting for the first time.
   Limitations: It is likely that extent of alcohol involvement in self-harm presentations reported here is an underestimate, as it was dependent on the information being recorded by the attending clinician.
   Conclusions: Public holidays are associated with an elevated number of self-harm presentations to hospital, with presentations to hospital involving alcohol significantly increased on these days. Hospital resources should be targeted to address increases during public holidays, including during out-of-hours. Involvement of alcohol may delay delivery of care to these patients in emergency settings.

AB The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of dissociative disorders among inpatients with alcohol dependency. The Dissociative Experiences Scale was used to screen I I I alcohol-dependent patients consecutively admitted to the inpatient unit of a dependency treatment center. Subgroups of 29 patients who scored 30.0 or above and 25 patients who scored below 10.0 were then evaluated with the Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule and the Structured Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders. The interviewers were blind to the Dissociative Experiences Scale scores. Of the 54 patients evaluated, 10 (9.0% of the original 111) patients had a dissociative disorder. A considerable number of the remaining patients reported a high level of dissociative experiences. Among the dissociative disorder group, nine patients had dissociative disorder not otherwise specified and one patient had depersonalization disorder. Female gender, younger age, history of suicide attempt, childhood emotional and sexual abuse, and neglect were more frequent in the dissociative disorder group than among non-dissociative patients. The dissociative disorder group also had somatization disorder, borderline personality disorder, and lifetime major depression more frequently. For 9 of the 10 dissociative patients, dissociative symptoms started before the onset of alcohol use. Although the probability of having a comorbid dissociative disorder was not higher among alcohol-dependent inpatients than among the general psychiatric inpatients, the dissociative subgroup had distinct features. Many patients without a dissociative disorder diagnosis (predominantly men) provided hints of subtle dissociative psychopathology. Implications of comorbid dissociative disorders and dissociative experiences on prevention and treatment of alcohol dependency and the importance of gender-specific characteristics in this relationship require further study.

AB The link between borderline personality disorder (BPD) and the affective disorders remains controversial. The aim of this study was to examine the relationships between BPD and major depression (MD) from the perspective of sleep parameters and to contribute to the characterisation of the sleep-EEG in BPD. We compared 20 off-medication BPD in-patients without co-existing MD with 20 sex- and age-matched MD patients without BPD and 20 sex- and age-matched control subjects. BPD patients had a greater prevalence of drug or alcohol abuse and suicide attempts than MD patients. MD patients had higher scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Both BPD and MD patients had less total sleep time, more prolonged sleep onset latency, and a greater percentage of wakefulness than control subjects. BPD patients and control subjects had more stage 2 sleep than MD patients. BPD patients had a longer duration of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and less stage 3, stage 4 and slow wave sleep than MD patients and control subjects. REM latency did not differentiate the three groups. BPD and MD patients shared sleep-continuity characteristics, but sleep architecture differentiated the two groups. BPD patients with a past history of MD had more wakefulness and less slow wave sleep than BPD patients without a history of MD; other sleep parameters, age, sex and HDRS scores were not statistically different in the two BPD subgroups. Although BPD and MD may coexist, the present study offers more arguments favouring the concept that they are not biologically linked and that BPD patients with depressive symptoms often experience an affective syndrome different from that in MD patients without BPD, in terms of quality and duration of symptoms and of the biological substrate.

AB Skeletal metastases present a major clinical challenge for prostate cancer patient care, inflicting distinctive mixed osteoblastic and osteolytic lesions that cause morbidity and refractory skeletal complications. Macrophages are abundant in bone and bone marrow and can influence both osteoblast and osteoclast function in physiology and pathology. Herein, we examined the role of macrophages in prostate cancer bone lesions, particularly the osteoblastic response. First, macrophage and lymphocyte distributions were qualitatively assessed in patient's prostate cancer skeletal lesions by immunohistochemistry. Second, macrophage functional contributions to prostate tumour growth in bone were explored using an immune-competent mouse model combined with two independent approaches to achieve in vivo macrophage depletion: liposome encapsulated clodronate that depletes phagocytic cells (including macrophages and osteoclasts); and targeted depletion of CD169(+) macrophages using a suicide gene knock-in model. Immunohistochemistry and histomorphometric analysis were performed to quantitatively assess cancer-induced bone changes. In human bone metastasis specimens, CD68(+) macrophages were consistently located within the tumour mass. Osteal macrophages (osteomacs) were associated with pathological woven bone within the metastatic lesions. In contrast, lymphocytes were inconsistently present in prostate cancer skeletal lesions and when detected, had varied distributions. In the immune-competent mouse model, CD169(+) macrophage ablation significantly inhibited prostate cancer-induced woven bone formation, suggesting that CD169(+) macrophages within pathological woven bone are integral to tumour-induced bone formation. In contrast, pan-phagocytic cell, but not targeted CD169(+) macrophage depletion resulted in increased tumour mass, indicating that CD169(-) macrophage subset(s) and/or osteoclasts influenced tumour growth. In summary, these observations indicate a prominent role for macrophages in prostate cancer bone metastasis that may be therapeutically targetable to reduce the negative skeletal impacts of this malignancy, including tumour-induced bone modelling.

AB Background: Death due to cardiovascular disease occurs more frequently in prisons than the national average. Due to close surveillance 24h/day, the ability to reach the patient within 3 min and time consuming access for the EMS crews, it was hypothesised that the deployment of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) might make improvements regarding Call-to-the-Fi rst-AED- Prompt (CTP) interval and formed the aim of this study.
   Methods: Our investigation was analysed on an intention to treat basis and conducted in a prospective, open and observational design. As the primary outcome, the CTP-intervals were compared to the arrival intervals of the EMS. As a secondary outcome, an analysis of all deceased inmates was described.
   Results: The average daily population of inmates in Austrian correctional facilities is 7714. During a period of 13 months, 10 instances in which an AED was activated and electrodes attached to a collapsed inmate, were reported. The CTP-intervat (median +/- S.D.) was 2.3 +/- 1.6 S.D. min. It took the EMS 10.0 +/- 4.3 S.D. min. to arrive at the patient's side. Four out of 10 cases of cardiac arrest occurred due to myocardial infarction. Of 39 deceased inmates, a post mortern examination was completed in 34 cases. In 13 cases, cardiovascular disease was the cause of death.
   Discussion: The main finding was a four-fold reduction of the CTP-interval. This fact indicates the potential improvements which could be achieved with the deployment of AEDs. Our secondary objective revealed that death due to cardiovascular disease was found in a high proportion and could be considered to be a strong incentive to initiate programmes to counter cardiovascular death in prison.

AB Objective: College entrance may be a strategically well-placed "point of capture" for detecting late adolescents with suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB). However, a clear epidemiological picture of STB among incoming college students is lacking. We present the first cross-national data on prevalence as well as socio-demographic and college-related correlates for STB among first-year college students.
   Method: Web-based self-report surveys were obtained from 13,984 first-year students (response rate 45.5%) across 19 colleges in 8 countries (Australia, Belgium, Germany, Mexico, Northern Ireland, South Africa, Spain, and the United States).
   Results: Lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts was 32.7%, 17.5%, and 4.3%, respectively. The 12-month prevalence was 17.2%, 8.8%, and 1.0%, respectively. About three-fourths of STB cases had onset before the age of 16 years (Q3 = 15.8), with persistence figures in the range of 41% to 53%. About one-half (53.4%) of lifetime ideators transitioned to a suicide plan; 22.1% of lifetime planners transitioned to an attempt. Attempts among lifetime ideators without plan were less frequent (3.1%). Significant correlates of lifetime STB were cross-nationally consistent and generally modest in effect size (median adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.7). Nonheterosexual orientation (aOR range 3.3-7.9) and heterosexual orientation with some same-sex attraction (aOR range 1.9-2.3) were the strongest correlates of STB, and of transitioning from ideation to plans and/or attempts (aOR range 1.6-6.1).
   Conclusion: The distribution of STB in first-year students is widespread, and relatively independent of socio-demographic risk profile. Multivariate risk algorithms based on a high number of risk factors are indicated to efficiently link high-risk status with effective preventive interventions.

AB We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). a treatment that synthesizes behavioral change with radical acceptance strategies, would be more effective for heroin-dependent women with borderline personality disorder (N = 23) than Comprehensive Validation Therapy with 12-Step (CVT + 12S), a manualized approach that provided the major acceptance-based strategies used in DBT in combination with participation in 12-Step programs. In addition to psychosocial treatment, subjects also received concurrent opiate agonist therapy with adequate doses of LAAM (thrice weekly: modal dose 90/90/130 mg). Treatment lasted for 12 months. Drug use outcomes were measured via thrice-weekly urinalyses and self-report. Three major findings emerged. First. results of urinalyses indicated that both treatment conditions were effective in reducing opiate use relative to baseline. At 16 months post-randomization (4 months post-treatment). all participants had a low proportion of opiate-positive Urinalyses (27%, in DBT: 33% in CVT + 12S). With regard to between-condition differences, participants assigned to DBT maintained reductions in mean opiate use through 12 months of active treatment while those assigned to CVT+12S significantly increased opiate use during the last 4 months of treatment. Second. CVT + 12S retained all 12 participants for the entire year of treatment, compared to a 64%, retention rate in DBT. Third. at both post-treatment and at the 16-month follow-up assessment, subjects in both treatment conditions showed significant overall reductions in level of psychopathology relative to baseline. A noteworthy secondary finding was that DBT participants were significantly more accurate in their self-report of opiate use than were those assigned to CVT + 12S.

TI Mental health status of varenicline and bupropion users during a quit

AB Background: Varenicline and bupropion are commonly prescribed non-nicotine containing smoking cessation agents. Post-marketing reports suggest an increased incidence of psychiatric disturbances associated with varenicline and bupropion. However, pre-existing psychiatric disorders may confound the association between these smoking cessation agents and psychiatric disturbances. We compared the mental health status of individuals using varenicline or bupropion to that of people quitting without medication, current smokers, and non-smokers while controlling for pre-existing conditions.
   Methods: A cross-sectional design was used. Data were from 2006-2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Mental health status was assessed using the mental component summary (MCS) from the 12-item Short Form survey (SF-12v2), 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), and Kessler 6 Scale (1(6). Differences in MCS score were compared using linear regression. Logistic regressions were used to compare positive screenings for depression using PHQ-2 and for psychological distress using K6.
   Results: Of 578 use episodes, 453 (78.38%) were bupropion and 125 (21.62%) were varenicline. After adjusting for potential confounders, mental health status of varenicline users was not different from current smokers or people who quit smoking without medication, but worse than non-smokers; bupropion was strongly associated with lower mental health status relative to all groups across all three measures.
   Conclusion: Varenicline was not associated with worse mental health compared to smokers or those who quit without medication, after adjusting for pre-existing psychiatric disorders. Bupropion was associated with worse mental health status than smokers, former smokers who quit without medication, and nonsmokers, even after adjusting for pre-existing psychiatric disorders.

AB Objective: Meta-analyze all published epidemiologic studies reporting pediatric mania or bipolar disorder to investigate whether pediatric bipolar disorder is becoming more prevalent and whether rates vary significantly by country.
   Data Sources: Searches of PubMed and PsycInfo were conducted through the spring of 2010 using the following search terms: child, pediatric, young, adolescent, epidemiology, prevalence, bipolar, mania, suicide, and psychiatric. We also manually reviewed references in recent reviews of epidemiology of bipolar disorder.
   Study Selection: All studies reporting rates for mania or hypomania in community epidemiologic samples with participants up to 21 years of age.
   Data Extraction: All articles were coded to extract relevant variables. Prevalence rates were calculated from reported number of cases with bipolar disorders, then logit transformed. Twelve studies were included, enrolling 16,222 youths between the ages of 7 and 21 years during a period from 1985 to 2007. Six samples were from the United States; 6 were from other countries (the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Spain, Mexico, Ireland, and New Zealand).
   Results:The overall rate of bipolar disorder was 1.8% (95% CI, 1.1%-3.0%). There was no significant difference in the mean rates between US and non-US studies, but the US studies had a wider range of rates. The highest estimates came from studies that used broad definitions and included bipolar disorder not otherwise specified. Year of enrollment was negatively correlated with prevalence (r=-0.04) and remained nonsignificant when controlling for study methodological differences.
   Conclusions: Mean rates of bipolar disorder were higher than commonly acknowledged and not significantly different in US compared to non-US samples, nor was there evidence of an increase in rates of bipolar disorder in the community over time. Differences in diagnostic criteria were a main driver of different rates across studies. J Clin Psychiatry 2011;72(9):1250-1256 (C) Copyright 2011 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB Objectives: To quantify the population attributable risk of key modifiable risk factors associated with breast cancer incidence in Queensland, Australia.
   Study design: Population attributable fractions (PAFs) for high body mass index (BMI), use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), alcohol consumption and inadequate physical activity were calculated, using prevalence data from a representative survey of women attending mammographic screening at BreastScreen Queensland in 2008 and relative risk estimates sourced from published literature. Attributable cancers were calculated using 'underlying' breast cancer incidence data for 2008 based on Poisson regression models, adjusting for the inflation of incidence due to the effects of mammographic screening.
   Main outcome measures: Attributable burden of breast cancer due to high body mass index (BMI), use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), alcohol consumption and inadequate physical activity.
   Results: In Queensland women aged 45-69 years, an estimated 12.1% (95% CI: 11.6-12.5%) of invasive breast cancers were attributable to high BMI in post-menopausal women who have never used HRT; 2.8% (95% CI: 2.7-2.9%) to alcohol consumption; 7.6% (95% CI: 7.4-7.9%) to inadequate physical activity in post-menopausal women and 6.2% (95% CI: 5.5-7.0%) to current use of HRT after stratification by BMI and type of HRT used. Combined, just over one quarter (26.0%; 95% CI: 25.4-26.6%) of all invasive breast cancers in Queensland women aged 45-69 years in 2008 were attributable to these modifiable risk factors.
   Conclusions: There is benefit in targeting prevention strategies to modify lifestyle behaviours around BMI, physical activity, HRT use and alcohol consumption, as a reduction in these risk factors could decrease invasive breast cancer incidence in the Queensland population.

AB Background: Euthanasia is performed worldwide, regardless of the existence of laws governing it. Belgium became the second country in the world to enact a law on euthanasia in 2002. Healthcare institutions bear responsibility for guaranteeing the quality of care for patients at the end of life, and for ensuring support for caregivers involved. Therefore, institutional ethics policies on end-of-life decision-making, especially on euthanasia, may be useful.
   Methods: A cross-sectional mail survey of general directors of Catholic hospitals and nursing homes in Belgium was used to describe the prevalence and content of written ethics policies for competent terminally ill, incompetent terminally ill, and non-terminally ill patients.
   Results: Of the 298 targeted institutions, 81% of hospitals and 62% of nursing homes returned complete questionnaires. Of these, 79% of hospitals and 30% of nursing homes had a written ethics policy on euthanasia. Of hospitals 83% and of nursing homes 85% permitted euthanasia for competent terminally ill patients only in exceptional cases in accordance with legal due care criteria and provisions outlined by the palliative filter procedure. Euthanasia for incompetent terminally ill patients was prohibited by 27% of the hospitals and by 60% of the nursing homes. For non-terminally ill patients, these figures were 43 and 64%, respectively.
   Conclusions: Catholic healthcare institutions in Belgium (Flanders) made great efforts to develop written ethics policies on euthanasia. Only a small group Of institutions completely prohibited euthanasia. Most of the institutions considered euthanasia to be an option if all possible alternatives (e.g., palliative filter procedure, which contains more rigorous criteria than those in the Belgian Euthanasia Act), have been thoroughly investigated.

AB Objective: Female injection drug users who are also sex workers (FSW-IDUs) occupy a pivotal population in HIV transmission, whereas their mental health problems are largely overlooked. We aimed to investigate prevalence and associated socio-ecological factors of depression, suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts among FSW-IDUs in China.
   Methods: Using snowball sampling methods, 200 FSW-IDUs were recruited from communities in Liuzhou, China. Anonymous face-to-face interviews were administered by trained doctors.
   Results: Thirty-nine percent of participants had severe or extremely severe depression, 44.7% had suicidal ideation in the last six months and 26.8% had suicidal attempts in the last six months. After adjusting for background variables, self-stigma was significantly associated with severe or extremely severe depression (OR = 1.18,95% CI: 1.07-1.31). Self-stigma (OR = 1.08,95% CI: 1.01-1.15), depression (OR = 1.11,95% CI: 1.05-1.18), having completely broken up with family (OR = 2.60, 95% CI: 1.35-5.02) and having been abused by clients or gatekeepers (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.32-3.50) were associated with suicidal ideation in the last six months, while self-stigma (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.10-1.16), depression (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.04-1.20) and being abused by clients or gatekeepers (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.09-4.24) were associated with suicidal attempt in the last six months. In mediation analyses, the associations between self-stigma and the two suicidal outcomes were fully mediated by depression.
   Conclusions: There are unmet mental health needs of FSW-IDUs. Screening of mental health problems should be integrated into current HIV-related services. Psychological intervention efforts should include components such as self-stigma, family support and abuse. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The concentration of free-morphine was determined in peripheral (femoral) blood from heroin-related deaths and compared with the concentration in venous blood from impaired drivers. The presence of 6-MAM in blood or urine served as a biomarker for recent use of heroin. Males dominated over females (p < 0.001) in both the autopsy cases (88%) and the drivers (91%), although their mean age was about the same 33-35 y (p > 0.05). Concentrations of free-morphine in blood were not associated with age of heroin users in Sweden (p > 0.05). The median concentration of free-morphine was higher in autopsy cases (0.24 mg/L, N = 766) compared with apprehended drivers with 6-MAM in blood (0.15 mg/L, N = 124, p < 0.05), and appreciably higher than in drivers with 6-MAM in urine but not in blood (0.03 mg/L, N = 1823, p < 0.001). The free-morphine concentration was above 0.20 mg/L in 65% of autopsy cases, 36% of drivers with 6-MAM in blood but only 1.4% of drivers with 6-MAM in urine. Poly-drug deaths had about the same concentrations of free-morphine in blood (0.24 mg/L, N = 703) as heroin-only deaths (0.25 mg/L, N = 63). The concentration of morphine in drug overdose deaths (median 0.25 mg/L, N = 669) was about the same as in traumatic deaths among heroin users (0.23 mg/L, N = 97). However, the concentration of morphine was lower when the deceased had consumed alcohol (0.18 mg/L, N = 104) compared with taking a benzodiazepine (0.32 mg/L, N = 94). The concentration distributions of free-morphine in blood in heroin-related deaths overlapped with the concentrations in impaired drivers, which makes the interpretation of toxicology results difficult without knowledge about tolerance to opiates in any individual case.

ID SUICIDE
AB In 1984, the Department of Health (DoH) recommended that all patients with deliberate self-harm (DSH) must have a mental assessment before discharge. DSH patients, especially those with lacerations to wrist and forearm, are a regular source of admission to plastic surgery units. In Northern Ireland, the regional plastic surgery service is provided at the Ulster Hospital, which does not have an on-site psychiatric department. Consequently, it was often difficult to arrange a psychiatrist assessment for these patients on the ward even when the assessment was required urgently.
   The objective of this study was to develop and validate a protocol that would ensure that these patients were assessed and followed up for their mental health as recommended by the DoH. In the absence of clear guidelines from the DoH and utilising the existing arrangement between Accident and Emergency (A&E) and the psychiatric services, all referring A&E departments were instructed at the time of referring patients with DSH to wrist and forearm to arrange a psychiatric examination before transferring the patient to the plastic surgery unit.
   Data were collected retrospectively (August 2002-October 2002) and prospectively (November 2002-October 2003) and comprised demographic features, previous history of self-harm, conduct of the patient in A&tE and the ward, length of stay in the hospital and various aspects of psychiatric assessment and follow-up.
   In total, 42 referrals were made during the period studied. The average age was 28 years with a mate to female ratio of 2:1. The average hospital stay was two days. Despite difficulties, our practice was found effective in ensuring psychiatry assessment and follow-up without risking the patient's physical health. The study also highlighted the need for collaboration between plastic surgeons and psychiatrists to improve services in regards to DSH patients. (C) 2005 The British Association of Plastic Surgeons.

AB Human carbonyl reductases 1 and 3 (CBR1 and CBR3) are monomeric NADPH-dependent enzymes of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. Despite 72% identity in primary structure they exhibit substantial differences in substrate specificity. Recently, the endogenous low molecular weight S-nitrosothiol S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) has been added to the broad substrate spectrum of CBR1. The current study initially addressed whether CBR3 could equally reduce GSNO which was not the case. Neither the introduction of residues which contribute to glutathione binding in CBR1, i.e. K106Q and S97V/D98A, nor the exchange C143S, which prevents a theoretical disulfide bond with C227 in CBR3, could engender activity towards GSNO. However, exchanging amino acids 236-244 in CBR3 to correspond to CBR1 was sufficient to engender catalytic activity towards GSNO. Catalytic efficiency was further improved by the exchanges Q142M, C143S. P230W and H270S. Hence, the same residues previously reported as important for reduction of carbonyl compounds appear to be key to CBR1-mediated reduction of GSNO. Furthermore, for CBR1-mediated reduction of GSNO, considerable substrate inhibition at concentrations >5 K(m), was observed. Treatment of CBR1 with GSNO followed by removal of low molecular weight compounds decreased the GSNO reducing activity, suggesting a covalent modification. Treatment with dithiothreitol, but not with ascorbic acid, could rescue the activity, indicating S-glutathionylation rather than S-nitrosation as the underlying mechanism. As C227 has previously been identified as the reactive cysteine in CBR1, the variant CBR1 C227S was generated, which, in comparison to the wild-type protein, displayed a similar k(cat), but a 30-fold higher K(m), and did not show substrate inhibition. Collectively, the results clearly argue for a physiological role of CBR1, but not for CBR3, in GSNO reduction and thus ultimately in regulation of NO signaling. Furthermore, at higher concentrations, GSNO appears to work as a suicide inhibitor for CBR1, probably through glutathionylation of C227. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives To determine the prevalence of burnout in doctors practising obstetrics and gynaecology, and assess the association with defensive medical practice and self-reported well-being.
   Design Nationwide online cross-sectional survey study; December 2017-March 2018.
   Setting Hospitals in the UK.
   Participants 5661 practising obstetrics and gynaecology consultants, specialty and associate specialist doctors and trainees registered with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures Prevalence of burnout using the Maslach Burnout Inventory and defensive medical practice (avoiding cases or procedures, over-prescribing, over-referral) using a 12-item questionnaire. The odds ratios (OR) of burnout with defensive medical practice and self-reported well-being.
   Results 3102/5661 doctors (55%) completed the survey. 3073/3102 (99%) met the inclusion criteria (1462 consultants, 1357 trainees and 254 specialty and associate specialist doctors). 1116/3073 (36%) doctors met the burnout criteria, with levels highest amongst trainees (580/1357 (43%)). 258/1116 (23%) doctors with burnout reported increased defensive practice compared with 142/1957 (7%) without (adjusted OR 4.35, 95% CI 3.46 to 5.49). ORs of burnout with well-being items varied between 1.38 and 6.37, and were highest for anxiety (3.59, 95% CI 3.07 to 4.21), depression (4.05, 95% CI 3.26 to 5.04) and suicidal thoughts (6.37, 95% CI 95% CI 3.95 to 10.7). In multivariable logistic regression, being of younger age, white or 'other' ethnicity, and graduating with a medical degree from the UK or Ireland had the strongest associations with burnout.
   Conclusions High levels of burnout were observed in obstetricians and gynaecologists and particularly among trainees. Burnout was associated with both increased defensive medical practice and worse doctor well-being. These findings have implications for the well-being and retention of doctors as well as the quality of patient care, and may help to inform the content of future interventions aimed at preventing burnout and improving patient safety.

AB Emotion dysregulation in borderline personality disorder (BPD) is associated with loss of cognitive control in the face of intense negative emotion. Negative emotional context may interfere with cognitive processing through the dysmodulation of brain regions involved in regulation of emotion, impulse control, executive function and memory. Structural and metabolic brain abnormalities have been reported in these regions in BPD. Using novel fMRI protocols, we investigated the neural basis of negative affective interference with cognitive processing targeting these regions. Attention-driven Go No-Go and X-CPT (continuous performance test) protocols, using positive, negative and neutral Ekman faces, targeted the orbital frontal cortex (OFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), respectively. A stimulus-driven Episodic Memory task, using images from the International Affective Pictures System, targeted the hippocampus (HIP). Participants comprised 23 women with BPD, who were compared with 15 healthy controls. When Negative > Positive faces were compared in the Go No-Go task, BPD subjects had hyper-activation relative to controls in areas reflecting task-relevant processing: the superior parietal/precuneus and the basal ganglia. Decreased activation was also noted in the OFC, and increased activation in the amygdala (AMY). In the X-CPT, BPD subjects again showed hyper-activation in task-relevant areas: the superior parietal/precuneus and the ACC. In the stimulus-driven Episodic Memory task, BPD subjects had decreased activation relative to controls in the HIP, ACC, superior parietal/precuneus, and dorsal prefrontal cortex (dPFC) (for encoding), and the ACC, dPFC, and HIP for retrieval of Negative > Positive pictures, reflecting impairment of task-relevant functions. Negative affective interference with cognitive processing in BPD differs from that in healthy controls and is associated with functional abnormalities in brain networks reported to have structural or metabolic abnormalities. Task demands exert a differential effect on the cognitive response to negative emotion in BPD compared with control subjects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB ObjectiveAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is associated with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in 14% of cases. Five percent report a family history of ALS, and other ALS patients report a family history of other neurodegenerative diseases. The objective of this study was to conduct a family aggregation study of ALS, and neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions in ALS kindreds and matched healthy controls. The aim was to determine the true rate of familial ALS and the recurrence risk of ALS in family members, and to identify kindreds with increased aggregation of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease in the context of the recently described expanded hexanucleotide repeat in C9orf72.
   MethodsA prospective, population-based, case-control family aggregation study was conducted. Family history information was collected through questionnaires and interviews from ALS patients and matched controls. Cause of death was verified with death certification. The recurrence rate of ALS and the risk in family members of other neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease was calculated using the relative risk (lambda) and cumulative risk using Kaplan-Meier analysis.
   ResultsMedical histories from 9,684 first- and second-degree relatives of 172 ALS probands and 192 controls were obtained. Cause of death was verified in 2,494 cases. Sixteen percent (n = 27) of ALS patients had a family history of ALS. The lifetime hazard ratio (HR) of developing ALS among first- and second-degree relatives was 34.3 (p < 0.0001) in relatives of ALS patients with the C9orf72 repeat expansion, and 2.3 (p = 0.019) in relatives of ALS patients without the expansion. The relatives of ALS patients also had an increased HR of developing a psychotic illness (HR = 4.7, p = 0.004, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6-12.3) and of suicide (HR = 5.6, p < 0.0001, 95% CI = 2.4-12.9)
   InterpretationThe true rate of familial ALS in Ireland is 16%. There is an overlap between ALS, FTD, and neuropsychiatric disease that is pronounced in kindreds with the C9orf72 repeat expansion, but is also present in kindreds of those without the C9orf72 expanded repeat

AB In a previous study early non-psychotic deviant behaviors in US adult schizophrenic patients recruited for a large-scale genetic study were examined (Psychiatry Research, 101, 101). Early deviance characterized a distinct subgroup of patients at rates that were consistent with earlier reports. In addition, specific early non-psychotic deviant behaviors were meaningfully associated with later disease outcomes. In the present study, we examined the demographic, syndrome course, symptom and early deviant behavior history of 109 Afrikaner probands who met criteria for DSM schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and compared them to 109 age- and gender-matched US probands. Consistent with past findings, 68% of Afrikaner probands, as compared to 67% of age- and gender-matched US probands, reported one or more forms of early non-psychotic deviance, including poor socialization, extreme fears/chronic sadness, and/or attention/learning impairment. The remaining 32 and 33% of probands, respectively, were without behavioral deviance until the onset of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The frequency and distribution of individual deviant behaviors were strikingly consistent between the samples. However, logistic regression analyses revealed different patterns of associations between the early deviant behaviors manifested and disease outcome. Afrikaner participants with early fears/chronic sadness were 3 times more likely to attempt suicide, while among US participants, this form of early deviance conferred 3.5 times more risk for later schizoaffective disorder, and 3 times greater likelihood of later sensory (tactile and/or olfactory) hallucinations. Afrikaner participants with attention/learning impairment were 2.5 times more likely to experience later auditory hallucinations, while US participants with these early difficulties were 3 times more likely to experience thought disorder. We concluded that early non-psychotic childhood deviance in this independently collected Afrikaner population distinguished a distinct subtype of patients and that the forms of early deviance manifested were meaningfully linked to later disease outcome. Possible reasons for the association pattern differences in these two populations are considered. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A 31-year-old engineer was found dead in a reaction vessel (diameter 0.8 m, height 1.8 m) of a bulb factory some minutes after he had entered it for repair work. Resuscitation attempts with artificial respiration were unsuccessful. Despite autopsy and usual toxicological analyses, no cause of death could be found. Since in the normal production process, argon was used as a protecting gas, the possibility of suffocation in an argon atmosphere was investigated. This was rendered more difficult because of the natural content of 0.93 vol.% argon in air and since the excessive argon could have been removed by the resuscitation attempts. Gas samples from larynx, esophagus, bronchi, and stomach, separated blood samples from both ventricles of the heart and from the vena iliaca externa as well as tissue samples from lung and liver were collected during autopsy into headspace vials in such a way that the loss of gas and a dilution by surrounding air was avoided as far as possible. The samples were analyzed by headspace GC-MS. The abundance of Ar+ (m/z = 40) was used for quantification with N-2(2+) (m/z = 14) as internal standard. The following argon concentrations were measured (mean values, case under investigation/comparison cases): gas from larynx 1.79/0.96 vol.%, stomach gas 1.58/0.89 vol.%, heart blood (left ventricle) 7.2/2.7 mug/mL, heart blood (right ventricle) 5.8/ 2.7 mug/mL, blood from vena iliaca externa 3.6/2.7 mug/mL. A clearly increased concentration was also found in lung tissue, whereas in liver tissue no significant difference in comparison to other cases was measured. From the results, it follows that the deceased inhaled an increased amount of argon a short time before death. The concentrations are consistent with asphyxia and subsequent resuscitation attempts. They cannot be explained by a long-term inhalation of an atmosphere enriched with argon before the incident as it is likely to have occurred in this factory hall. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB There is growing evidence that blood levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), a major metabolite of noradrenaline, are related to depression-associated personality traits as well as to depressive, suicidal and anxious states. Psychological job stress is well known to lead to symptoms of depression, anxiety and suicide. We have recently reported that psychological job stress among hospital employees altered blood levels of BDNF and MHPG (Mitoma et al., 2008). In the present study, we re-examined the effects of social adaptation and personality traits, as well as those of psychological job stress, on plasma levels of BDNF and MHPG in healthy employees (n = 269, male/female = 210/59, age = 49 +/- 10 years) working in a publishing company in Japan. The values (mean +/- SD) of scores on the Stress and Arousal Check Lists (s-SACL and a-SACL), Social Adaptation Self-evaluation Scale (SASS), plasma MHPG levels and plasma BDNF levels were 6.0 +/- 3.4, 5.7 +/- 23, 33.7 +/- 6.8, 5.8 +/- 4.3 and 4.6 +/- 3.1 ng ml(-1), respectively. A positive correlation was found between plasma MHPG levels and scores on the s-SACL, but not the a-SACL. A positive correlation was also found between SASS scores and plasma MHPG levels and between SASS scores and plasma BDNF levels. A negative correlation was found between plasma BDNF levels and s-SACL scores. Furthermore, a positive correlation between NEO-Five factor Inventory (Openness) scores and plasma MHPG levels was observed, as well as between NEO-Five factor Inventory (Extroversion) scores and plasma BDNF levels. These results suggest that levels of plasma BDNF and plasma MHPG might be associated with psychological job stress and certain personality traits among employees in the publishing industry in Japan.

AB The castor bean plant (Ricinus communis L.) or wonder tree is cultivated in many countries as an ornamental annual plant in gardens. The highest concentration of the lectin ricin is present in the seeds and pods. Ricin is considered as one of the most toxic natural poisons. Ricinine is a piperidine alkaloidal toxin present in castor bean and is described as a biomarker for the exposure to ricin. A case report is presented of a 49-year-old man who committed suicide by intravenous and subcutaneous injection of a castor bean extract. He was brought to the emergency department 24 h after injecting himself. On admission, the patient was conscious and he presented with a history of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspnoea, vertigo and muscular pain. Despite symptomatic and supportive intensive care, the man died 9 h after admission due to multiorgan failure.
   A body external examination was performed. Blood, urine, vitreous humour and the castor bean extract were submitted to the laboratory for toxicological analysis. The identification of ricinine in the extract was performed by solid phase extraction in combination with full-scan gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry operated in the full-scan mode, respectively. An extraction procedure with Oasis HLB solid phase extraction cartridges was applied. Chromatography was achieved using a Symmetry (R) C18 column using a gradient mode with 0.15% formic acid and 0.15% formic acid in acetonitrile as mobile phase.
   Exposure to the castor bean extract was confirmed by identification of the biomarker ricinine in blood, urine and vitreous humour using solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry with electro spray source in positive ionization mode. Multiple reaction monitoring was used for specific detection. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first time that ricinine has been identified in vitreous humour in a case of castor bean poisoning. Based on the clinical symptoms and the results of the toxicological analysis, we concluded that death was caused by intoxication with plant toxins originated from R. communis L.

AB Propofol is a short-acting hypnotic agent that is commonly used to induce and maintain anesthesia. Propofol abuse and its involvement in suicide deaths have increased in recent years, especially among healthcare personnel. An example is the suicide of a 61-year-old nurse found with a propofol drip in his left arm. We describe the postmortem concentration of propofol in various tissues (femoral and cardiac blood, bile, urine, brain, and liver) and in the drip. The toxicological analyses were performed through two analytical methods, differing in derivatization reaction and in instrumentation: silylation for gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS), as routinely performed in our laboratory for this kind of analyses (lower limits of quantification-LLOQ-in urine and blood: 0.3 and 5 ng/ml); for liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) an innovative azo-coupling derivatization (LLOQ: 0.0004 and 0.1 ng/ml). This latter produces an azo-derivative (molecular composition: C18H22ON2; molecular weight: 282 Da) highly ionizable in electro-spray ion source, both in negative and positive ionizations. These two methods were compared to evaluate the effectiveness of this new LC-MS/MS analysis. An acidic hydrolysis (HCl 6 N, 100 degrees C, and 1 h) was performed for the biological samples (1 ml or 1 g) irrespective of the analytical method applied. The drip content was extracted adding phosphate buffer (pH 8) and a dichloromethane/ethylacetate 8: 2 (v:v) mixture. Derivatization steps were: silylation with N, O-bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) + tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) for GC-MS; regarding LC-MS/MS, azo-coupling reaction with the aryl-diazonium salt (0-5 degrees C, and 30 min). The analyses were achieved in selected-ion monitoring for GC-MS (m/z, 235,250,73 propofol''; m/z, 252,267,27 propofol-d17) and in multiple reaction monitoring ([M - H] : m/z 283 -> 241,77, azo-propofol; m/z 299 -> 251,77, azo-propofol-d17) for LC-MS/MS. Autopsy showed no significant findings. Propofol concentrations were (LC-MS/MS vs GC-MS, respectively): 15.1 vs 14.5 mg/ml, drip content; 7.11 vs 6.07 mu g/ml, cardiac blood; 9.50 vs 7.19 mu g/ml, femoral blood; 0.64 vs 1.07 mu g/ml, bile; 0.042 vs 0.051 mu g/ml urine; 4.93 vs 5.89 mu g/g, brain; and 7.88 vs 6.80 mu g/g, liver. These values are comparable with the ones described in literature for death by acute propofol intoxication; the drip content is compatible with a diluted formulation of propofol available in Italy (20 mg/ml injectable emulsion). The comparison shows an excellent fitting of the data (R-2: 0.9362). Toxicological results proved the cause of death as acute propofol intoxication. Furthermore, the new LC-MS/MS method showed an excellent effectiveness and reliability when compared to the routinely used GC-MS method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A serial killer of elderly women: Analysis of a multi-victim homicide

AB Between 1995 and 1997, in the territories of Southern Italy, there were fifteen murders of elderly women over the age of 70 years old. Initially, however, not all the murders were attributed to a single serial killer. The majority of the victims were stabbed multiple times in the neck, except for three cases in which the cause of death was manual strangulation. There was evidence of sexual assault in only one of the cases. All the victims were discovered in their own apartments, which were located on the ground level, with no signs of forced entry. In most of the cases, the offender stole money and/or jewellery. A multi-disciplinary team reviewed the cases during the investigation and created a profile of the killer. The team determined that the method of operation was completely unusual for the local criminal element. They suggested that the perpetrator could be an immigrant, who committed the murders for sexual motivation and who may have been arrested previously for sex-related incidents. On 15th September 1997, a suspect was arrested. He was identified as Ben Mohamed Ezzedine Sebai, a 35-year-old white male, originally from Tunisia. He was charged and convicted of four of the murders and was given a life sentence. In 2005, Sebai confessed to the murders of four additional elderly women, for which nine other people had already been previously tried and convicted, among them, a man who committed suicide in jail. In 2007, Sebai finally confessed to committing fifteen murders that occurred between 1995 and 1997. Sebai also admitted to experiencing sexual gratification at every homicide scene, even though there was no physical proof at most of the crime scenes. The goal of this article is to illustrate a little-known but noteworthy case concerning a serial sexual killer of elderly women that occurred in Southern Italy, highlighting the method of operation, the victim selection process, and the injuries inflicted. The article will also discuss his motivation, the mental health history of the offender, his clinical diagnosis, and his self-reported childhood abuse. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB There have been increasing reports on the adverse reactions associated with herbal consumption. For many of these adverse reactions, the underlying biochemical mechanisms are unknown, but bioactivation of herbal compounds to generate reactive intermediates have been implicated. This minireview updates our knowledge on metabolic activation of herbal compounds, molecular targets and the toxicity relevance. A number of studies have documented that some herbal compounds can be converted to toxic or even carcinogenic metabolites by Phase I [e.g. cytochrome P450s (CYPs)] and less frequently by Phase II enzymes. For example, aristolochic acids (AAs) in Aristolochia spp, which undergo reduction of the nitro group by hepatic CYP1A1/2 or peroxidases in extrahepatic tissues to generate highly reactive cyclic nitrenium ions. The latter can react with macromolecules (DNA and protein), resulting in activation of H-ras and myc oncogenes and gene mutation in renal cells and finally carcinogenesis of the kidneys. Teucrin A and teuchamaedryn A, two diterpenoids found in germander (Teuchrium chamaedrys) used as an adjuvant to slimming herbal supplements that caused severe hepatotoxicity, are converted by CYP3A4 to reactive epoxide which reacts with proteins such as CYP3A and epoxide hydrolase and inactivate them. Some naturally occurring alkenylbenzenes (e.g. safrole. methyleugenol and estragole) and flavonoids (e.g. quercetin) can undergo bioactivation by sequential 1-hydroxylation and sulfation, resulting in reactive intermediates capable of forming DNA adducts. Extensive pulegone metabolism generated p-cresol that is a glutathione depletory. The hepatotoxicity of kava is possibly due to intracellular glutathione depletion and/or quinone formation. Moreover, several herbal compounds including capsaicin from chili peppers, dially sulfone in garlic, methysticin and dihydromethysticin in kava, oleuropein in olive oil, and resveratrol found in grape seeds are mechanism-based (suicide) inhibitors of various CYPs. Together with advances of proteomics, metabolomics and toxicogenomics, an integrated systems toxicological approach may provide deep insights into mechanistic aspects of herb-induced toxicities, and contribute to bridging the relationships between herbal bioactivation, protein/DNA adduct formation and the toxicological consequences.

AB Several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes may be involved in the metabolism of bromo-dichloromethane (BDCM). a drinking water disinfection byproduct. After 4-h inhalation exposures of male F344 rats to BDCM between 100 and 3200 p.p.m., hepatic microsomal methoxyresorufin demethylase (MROD), ethoxyresorufin de-ethylease (EROD) and pentoxyresorufin dealkylase (PROD) activities showed modest increases at low exposure levels and larger decreases at high exposure levels, compared with controls. Western blots for CYP1A2 and CYP2B1 showed similar trends. In addition, p-nitrophenol hydroxylase (PNP) activity was measured and Western blots for CYP2E1 were performed. CYP2E1 and CYP2B1 isoenzymes are known to metabolize BDCM (Thornton-Manning, J.R., Gao, P., Lilly, P.D., Pegram, R.A., 1993. Acute bromodichloromethane toxicity in rats pretreated with cytochrome P450 inducers and inhibitors. The Toxicologist 13: 361). When compared with a multiple gavage study of BDCM in female F344 rats (Thornton-Manning, J.R., et al., 1994. Toxicology 94, 3-18), the results of the two studies for EROD, PROD, and PNP activities were qualitatively the same; PNP activity did not change, while both PROD and EROD activities decreased at high exposures. In the current work. Western blots for CYP2E1, CYP2B1 and CYP1A2 supported the results fr om the PNP, PROD and MROD activities, respectively. The decreases in MROD and PROD activities and in Western blots for CYP1A2 and CYP2B1 at high exposures suggest that BDCM may be a suicide substrate for these CYP isoenzymes. Other important conclusions that can be drawn from the comparison between the current and prior work are that the liver response is similar for both sexes, and it is also similar for inhalation and gavage exposures under these conditions. Finally, the decrease in EROD activity at high doses. found in both studies, may be a further reflection of CYP1A2 activity, since little or no CYP1A1 activity is normally found in uninduced rat liver and CYP1A2 is known to metabolize ethoxyresorufin. although much more slowly than CYP1A1.

AB Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), developed in the 30's by Bini and Cerletti, remains a key element of the therapeutic armamentarium in psychiatry, particularly for severe and life-threatening psychiatric symptoms. However, despite its well-established clinical efficacy, the prescription of ECT has declined constantly over the years due to concerns over its safety (cognitive side effects) and an increasingly negative public perception. As for other treatments in the field of psychiatry, ECT is well suited to a personalized approach that would increment its efficacy, as well as reducing the impact of side effects. This should be based on the priori identification of sub-populations of patients sharing common clinical and biological features that predict a good response to ECT. In this review we have selectively reviewed the evidence on clinical and biological predictors of ECT response. Clinical features such as an older age, presence of psychotic and melancholic depression, a high severity of suicide behavior, and speed of response, appear to be shared by ECT good responders with depressive symptoms. In mania, a greater severity of the index episode, and a reduction of whole brain cortical blood flow are associated with ECT good response. Biological determinants of ECT response in depressive patients are the presence of pre-treatment hyperconnectivity between key areas of brain circuitry of depression, as well as of reduced glutamine/glutamate levels, particularly in the anterior cingulated cortex (ACC). Furthermore, pre ECT high plasma homovanillic acid (HVA) levels, as well as of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and low pre-ECT levels of S-100 B protein, appear to predict ECT response. Finally, polymorphisms within the genes encoding for the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the dopamine 2 receptor gene (DRD2), the dopamine receptor 3 gene (DRD3), the cathechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT), the serotonin-transporter (5-HTF), the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2 A receptor (5-HT2A), and the norepinephrine transporter (NET), appear to predict a good response to ECT. The integration of these data in specific treatment algorithm might facilitate a personalized approach in ECT. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB 4-Hydroxy-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (HPB)-releasing adducts are formed by metabolic activation of N'-nitrosonornicotine and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone and have been proposed as specific biomarkers for exposure to tobacco smoke. However, in several studies hemoglobin adducts releasing HPB were on average less than threefold higher in smokers compared to nonsmokers. Using an improved analytical method we have recently found a sevenfold difference in DNA adduct levels in the lung from smoking and nonsmoking lung cancer patients. In the present study we extended the determination of HPB-releasing DNA adducts by gas chromatography-negative ion chemical ionization-mass spectrometry (GC-NICI-MS) to samples of peripheral lung, lower esophagus and cardia from tumor-free sudden death victims (primarily road traffic accidents, suicide and sudden cardiac arrest). The donors were classified as either current smokers or nonsmokers based on cotinine in either blood or urine (cut-off values for active smoking: >15 ng cotinine/ml blood or >100 ng cotinine/ml urine). Contrary to our expectation, DNA adduct levels (fmol HPB/mg DNA) in lung tissue from tumor-free smokers (N = 32, 92 +/- 148) were not significantly different from values in nonsmokers (N = 56, 61 +/- 66). The values in tumor-free smokers were on average more than fourfold lower compared to smoking lung cancer patients in our previous study. Adduct levels in the mucosa of esophagus (N = 82; 133 +/- 1,60) and cardia (N = 30; 108 +/- 102) of sudden death victims did not show any difference according to the current smoking status. HPB-releasing DNA adduct levels in cardia and esophagus were significantly correlated (N = 29; Spearman r = 0.609; p < 0.001). In contrast, adduct levels in lung did not correlate with either esophagus (77 cases) or cardia (28 cases). Further studies are necessary to elucidate the discrepancies in lung DNA adduct levels in smokers with or without lung cancer and to identify obvious additional sources other than tobacco for these adducts.

AB Imaging studies using region-of-interest morphometry and positron emission tomography have contributed to Our understanding of structural and functional abnomialities in borderline personality disorder (BPD); however, both methods have practical limitations to their usefulness for exploratory studies of brain-behavior relationships. We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in 34 subjects with BPD and 30 healthy control (HQ subjects to study effects of diagnosis, gender, childhood sexual abuse, depressed mood, impulsivity and aggression on group differences. VBM is a computer-based method for whole brain analysis that combines the advantages of a functional study with a structural method. The BPD subjects, diagnosed with the Diagnostic Interview for Borderline Patients, and the International Personality Disorders Examination, were compared with 30 HC Subjects, with age and gender covaried. Analyses were repeated separately by gender and, in women, by histories of childhood sexual abuse. Depressed mood, impulsivity, and aggression were covaried in separate analyses. Compared with HC, BPD subjects had significant bilateral reductions in gray matter concentrations in ventral cingulate gyrus and several regions of the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, and uncus. BPD women (and abused BPD women), but not BPD men, had significant reductions in medial temporal lobe, including the amygdala. BPD men, but not BPD women, showed diminished gray matter concentrations in the anterior cingulate gyrus compared with findings in HC subjects. Covarying for depressed mood rendered group difrerences non-significant in the ventral cingulate but had little effect on difference.,; in medial temporal cortex. Covarying for aggression (LHA) had relatively little effect on group differences, while covarying for impulsivity, as determined by die Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, rendered all previously noted voxel-level group differences non-significant. Diminished gray matter in the prefrontal cortex and die medial temporal cortex may mediate the dysregulation of impulse and affect in BPD. Group differences varied greatly by gender, levels of depression, and impulsivity. VBM is an efficient method for exploratory Study of brain-behavior relationships. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB The number of glyphosate intoxication cases has been increased after the regulation of paraquat. Unfortunately, there are no reports on the potential concentration of glyphosate for those acute intoxicated patients admitted to emergency rooms and the correlation between the concentration of glyphosate and clinical symptoms in Korea up to our knowledge. As a nonselective herbicide, analysis of glyphosate requires derivatization because of its amphoteric and strongly polar nature.
   In order to develop a method to determine the concentration of glyphosate and its metabolite, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) in blood samples without derivatization, liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was utilized with a hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) column. The validation of this method showed that the limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantitation (LOQs) for glyphosate and AMPA were 50 and 100 ng/mL, respectively. In addition, matrix effect, recovery rate, and accuracy and precision in intra and inter-day were evaluated during the validation study of this method. Blood samples acquired from five glyphosate intoxicated patients were analyzed to investigate the correlation between the concentration of glyphosate and clinical symptoms. These patients were previously admitted to the emergency room at a University Hospital in Korea after glyphosate was self-administered in suicide attempts or by accident.
   As results of blood sample study, the concentration of glyphosate and AMPA were found in the range of 1.0-171.1 and 0.2-2.6 mg/mL, respectively. The concentration ratio of glyphosate to AMPA was 55-71. According to the clinical reports for those patients, they were in the age between 47 and 82 years old and administered about 50-400 mL. The blood samples were collected within 2-5 h after administration of glyphosate.
   Among the intoxicated patients, the most common clinical symptom was metabolic acidosis, identified in four patients. The comparison between the concentration of glyphosate and administered dosage did not show the correlation, which suggests further investigation on the effects of surfactants in glyphosate from different vendors.

AB The drug duloxetine (Cymbalta (R)) is a newer antidepressant which has been available in Australia since 2008. Duloxetine is a serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), which is associated with adverse effects in the first 6 weeks of therapy, including tachycardia and worsening symptoms in people with advanced heart failure. It is also associated with serotonin toxicity in combination with certain drugs. Few reports have been published in the toxicology literature regarding duloxetine and its prevalence in coroners' cases. This study documents the prevalence of duloxetine in coronial cases between 2009 and 2012 and seeks to better understand the role of duloxetine in deaths where concomitant use with other drugs may cause adverse outcomes. Duloxetine was analyzed in blood specimens taken for the purpose of assisting the pathologist in determining a cause of death and analyzed using a validated LC-MS/MS method employed for overnight screening. There were 34 cases where duloxetine was detected of which 19 were attributed to drug toxicity. The median femoral blood concentration in the cohort was 0.14 mg/L (range 0.01-1.42 mg/L). Many deaths involved the concomitant use of numerous other medications; up to 13 other drugs were co-detected in a case. Over half of the deaths were attributed to fatal combined drug toxicity. SSRIs and venlafaxine that may have increased the risk of serotonin toxicity in combination with duloxetine were detected in five cases. Metoclopramide, contraindicated with duloxetine use, was detected in two cases. NSAIDs (n = 11), antipsychotics (n = 15) and benzodiazepines (n = 14) were also commonly co-detected. Heart disease was observed in over 40% of the cohort, mostly in the form of coronary artery disease or cardiomegaly. Death involving duloxetine alone was uncommon (n = 4); however with certain comorbidities and co-administered drugs, the risk of a fatal event is increased, particularly in the setting of other proserotonergic agents. In deaths where duloxetine is detected and the cause of death is believed to be natural or unascertained, it is essential that other serotonin drugs or inappropriate drug combinations be examined for their possible contribution to death.

AB Background: Mental health problems and risk behaviours among young people are of great public health concern. Consequently, within the VII Framework Programme, the European Commission funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted in eleven European countries, with Sweden as the coordinating centre, and was designed to identify an effective way to promote mental health and reduce suicidality and risk taking behaviours among adolescents.
   Objective: To describe the methodological and field procedures in the SEYLE RCT among adolescents, as well as to present the main characteristics of the recruited sample.
   Methods: Analyses were conducted to determine: 1) representativeness of study sites compared to respective national data; 2) response rate of schools and pupils, drop-out rates from baseline to 3 and 12 month follow-up, 3) comparability of samples among the four Intervention Arms; 4) properties of the standard scales employed: Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-II), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (Z-SAS), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), World Health Organization Well-Being Scale (WHO-5).
   Results: Participants at baseline comprised 12,395 adolescents (M/F: 5,529/6,799; mean age=14.9 +/- 0.9) from Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain. At the 3 and 12 months follow up, participation rates were 87.3% and 79.4%, respectively. Demographic characteristics of participating sites were found to be reasonably representative of their respective national population. Overall response rate of schools was 67.8%. All scales utilised in the study had good to very good internal reliability, as measured by Cronbach's alpha (BDI-II: 0.864; Z-SAS: 0.805; SDQ: 0.740; WHO-5: 0.799).
   Conclusions: SEYLE achieved its objective of recruiting a large representative sample of adolescents within participating European countries. Analysis of SEYLE data will shed light on the effectiveness of important interventions aimed at improving adolescent mental health and well-being, reducing risk-taking and self-destructive behaviour and preventing suicidality.

AB The identification of X bodies is an everyday preoccupation in forensic pathology. This retrospective analysis studied all methods of identification and characteristics of unidentified bodies arrived in the Department of Forensic Medicine and Pathology (University Hospital R. Poincare, Garches, France) during a 6-years period (2003-2009).
   The aim was to determine the identification methods used during all the forensic investigations, but also to study causes and manner of death in this sample of the population.
   A total of 9.1% of all autopsies were on X cadavers (217 cases out of 2384). On this total, only 134 of them have been included in our series after exclusion of archaeological and animal samples, but also of unidentified individuals or incomplete data available. Almost 28% of them have been identified with molecular biology (DNA), 23% with odontological examination, 7.5% with fingerprinting and 6.7% with autopsy data.
   Manner of death was mainly suicide (40.3%) especially by asphyxia following drowning, then accidental death (17.9%) especially consecutive to multiple trauma after traffic accident, acute carbon monoxide intoxication or carbonization in a fire. A total of 11.9% natural deaths were found (50% of them being of cardio-vascular origin) and 11.2% of homicides (with the use of firearm in a third of them). For 18.7% of X cadavers, the mode of death was undetermined.
   46.4% of all unidentified bodies in our series were only identified by the police investigations, using physical recognition (direct or with photographs) or personal effects or identity documents in close relationship with the body. Our study highlights the fact that quite half of all unidentified bodies are inhumed with an identity not scientifically proved.
   Bodies which remained unidentified after all investigations represent 10.2% of X cadavers (if we consider a group of 176 cases composed of our study sample of 134 cases plus 24 subjects identified just before the autopsy and the 18 cases which remained unidentified) and 0.8% of all autopsies performed in the department.

AB Fluoride, of all inorganic substances, is among the least likely to be identified by a routine toxicological analysis. Acute poisonings with salts of hydrofluoric or fluorosilicic acid, however, although relatively uncommon, may occur. Some fluorosilicates, salts of fluorosilicic acid ( e. g. Al, Zn, Pb, Mg) are used as stone consolidants, others ( e. g. sodium fluorosilicate) - in the production of enamel and milk glass, or as insecticide. In this paper, two fatal cases of poisonings are presented: a suicide involving sodium fluorosilicate of a 39-year-old male who died in his flat, without hospitalization, and an accidental ingestion of zinc fluorosilicate solution ( probably due to mistaking it for mineral water) by a 38-year-old male at his workplace ( building), who died about 3 h after ingestion of the liquid, in spite of intensive care at hospitals. Post-mortem samples were examined by the use of the spectrophotometric method with lanthanum nitrate and alizarin complexone for fluorine ( after isolation of fluoride compounds by the microdiffusion method) and using a flame atomic absorption spectrometry method for zinc ( after mineralization of biological material by sulfuric and nitric acids). In the first case, the results were: blood - 130 mu g F/ml, stomach - 1150 mu g F/g, small intestine content - 19.6 mu g F/g, kidney - 56.0 mu g F/g, and urine - 1940 mg F/ml. In the second case, the contents of fluorine and zinc in blood and internal organs were the following: blood - 6.03 mu g F/ml, 23.8 mu g Zn/ml; brain - 1.39 mu g F/g, 7.54 mu g Zn/g; stomach 152 mu g Zn/g; stomach content - 293 mu g F/g, 84.4 mu g Zn/g; small intestine - 37.5 mu g Zn/g; small intestine content - 63.4 mu g F/g, 19.6 mu g Zn/g; liver - 9.49 mu g F/g, 81.0 mu g Zn/g; kidney - 29.6 mu g F/g, 39.2 mu g Zn/g; and exceeded the normal levels of these elements in biological material many times. In addition, in stomach and liver large amounts of silica were detected. In the paper, a review of acute intoxications with various fluoride compounds (17 cases) is also presented.

AB Three-dimensional surface technologies particularly close range photogrammetry and optical surface scanning have recently advanced into affordable, flexible and accurate techniques. Forensic postmortem investigation as performed on a daily basis, however, has not yet fully benefited from their potentials. In the present paper, we tested two approaches to 3D external body documentation - digital camera-based photogrammetry combined with commercial Agisoft PhotoScan (R) software and stereophotogrammetry-based Vectra H1 (R), a portable handheld surface scanner. In order to conduct the study three human subjects were selected, a living person, a 25-year-old female, and two forensic cases admitted for postmortem examination at the Department of Forensic Medicine, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic (both 63-year-old males), one dead to traumatic, self-inflicted, injuries (suicide by hanging), the other diagnosed with the heart failure.
   All three cases were photographed in 3608 manner with a Nikon 7000 digital camera and simultaneously documented with the handheld scanner. In addition to having recorded the pre-autopsy phase of the forensic cases, both techniques were employed in various stages of autopsy. The sets of collected digital images (approximately 100 per case) were further processed to generate point clouds and 3D meshes. Final 3D models (a pair per individual) were counted for numbers of points and polygons, then assessed visually and compared quantitatively using ICP alignment algorithm and a cloud point comparison technique based on closest point to point distances.
   Both techniques were proven to be easy to handle and equally laborious. While collecting the images at autopsy took around 20 min, the post-processing was much more time-demanding and required up to 10 h of computation time. Moreover, for the full-body scanning the post-processing of the handheld scanner required rather time-consuming manual image alignment. In all instances the applied approaches produced high-resolution photorealistic, real sized or easy to calibrate 3D surface models. Both methods equally failed when the scanned body surface was covered with body hair or reflective moist areas. Still, it can be concluded that single camera close range photogrammetry and optical surface scanning using Vectra H1 scanner represent relatively low-cost solutions which were shown to be beneficial for postmortem body documentation in forensic pathology.

AB Over a 10-year period (1998-2007) all deaths in Sweden classified by forensic pathologists as fatal drug poisonings (N = 6894) were retrieved from a toxicology database (TOXBASE) belonging to the National Board of Forensic Medicine. The deaths were further classified as suicides N = 2288 (33%), undetermined N = 2260 (33%) and accidental N = 2346 (34%). The average age (+/- SD) of all victims was 49.1 +/- 15.9 years and men 47.4 +/- 15.6 years were 5-year younger than women 52.2 +/- 15.8 years (p < 0.01). Most of the deceased (78%) were poly-drug users although a single drug (mono-intoxications) was found in 22% of all poisoning deaths (p < 0.001). The number of drugs in blood samples varied from 1 to 12 with a median of 3-4 per case. Mono-intoxication deaths were mostly ethanol-related (N = 976) and the mean and median blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) was 3.06 g/L and 3.10 g/L, respectively. The BAC decreased as the number of additional drugs in blood increased from 2.15 g/L with one drug to 1.25 g/L with 6 or more drugs. The mean (median) concentrations of non-alcohol drugs in mono-intoxication deaths were morphine (N = 93) 0.5 mg/L (0.2 mg/L), amphetamine (N = 39) 2.0 mg/L (1.2 mg/L), dextropropoxyphene (N = 33) 3.9 mg/L (2.9 mg/L), dihydro-propiomazine (N = 32) 1.6 mg/L (1.0 mg/L) and 7-amino-flunitrazepam (N = 28), 0.4 mg/L (0.3 mg/ L). Elevated blood morphine in these poisoning deaths mostly reflected abuse of heroin as verified by finding 6-monoacetyl morphine (6-MAM) in the blood samples. When investigating drug poisoning deaths a comprehensive toxicological analysis is essential although the results do not reveal the extent of prior exposure to drugs or the development of pharmacological tolerance. The concentrations of drugs determined in post-mortem blood are one element in the case. The autopsy report, the police investigation, the findings at the scene and eye-witness statements should all be carefully considered when the cause and manner of death are determined.

AB Interpretation of the results of psychoactive or other drug measurements in post-mortem blood specimens may not be straightforward, in part because analyte concentrations in blood may change after death. There is also the issue of comparability of plasma (or serum) results to those obtained in whole blood. To investigate these problems with respect to clozapine, this drug (10 mg/kg daily) was given orally to two pigs. Blood was collected 3 h post-dose on day 7, the animals were sacrificed, and blood taken from central and peripheral veins for up to 48 h after death. Tissue samples were also collected immediately after death and at 48 h. Ante-mortem whole blood clozapine/N-desmethylclozapine (norclozapine) concentrations were 0.86/1.07 and 1.11/1.15 mg/l in pigs I and 2, respectively. Blood clozapine and norclozapine concentrations generally increased after death (central vein: clozapine up to 300%, norclozapine up to 460%; peripheral vein: clozapine up to 155%, norclozapine up to 185%). Initial blood and kidney clozapine and norclozapine concentrations were comparable in both animals, but were some two-fold higher in heart, liver and striated muscle in pig 2. In both animals, the heart and striated muscle clozapine and norclozapine concentrations had increased some two- to three-fold at 48 h, whilst the liver and kidney concentrations were essentially unchanged. The reason for the increase in heart and striated muscle concentrations at 48 It is unclear, but could be simple variation in sample site. The plasma:whole blood distribution of clozapine and norclozapine was studied in vitro. In human blood (one volunteer donor, haematocrit 0.50) the plots of plasma versus whole blood concentration were linear for both analytes across the range 0.1-1.5 mg/l, although clozapine favoured plasma (plasma:whole blood ratio = 1.12), whereas norclozapine favoured whole blood (ratio 0.68). In pig blood, the plots of plasma versus whole blood were non-linear in both cases, although clozapine favoured plasma to a greater extent than norclozapine. This may be due to lower plasma clozapine and norclozapine protein binding capacity in the pig as compared to man. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dichloroacetic acid is a common disinfection by-product in surface waters and is a probable minor metabolite of trichloroethylene. Dichloroacetic acid (DCA) liver carcinogenicity has been demonstrated in rodents but epidemiological evidence in humans is not available. High doses of DCA (similar to 50 mg/kg) are used clinically to treat metabolic acidosis. Biotransformation of DCA by glutathione transferase zeta (GSTzeta) in the liver is the major elimination pathway in humans. GSTzeta is also inactivated by DCA, leading to slower systemic clearance and nonlinear pharmacokinetics after multiple doses. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to quantitatively describe DCA biotransformation and kinetics in humans administered DCA by intravenous infusion and oral ingestion. GSTzeta metabolism was described using a Michaelis-Menten equation coupled with rate constants to account for normal GSTzeta synthesis, degradation and irreversible covalent binding and inhibition by the glutathione-bound-DCA intermediate. With some departures between observation and model prediction, the human DCA PBPK model adequately predicted the DCA plasma kinetics over a 20,000-fold range in administered doses. Apparent inhibition of GSTzeta mediated metabolism of DCA was minimal for low doses of DCA (mu g/kg day), but was significant for therapeutic doses of DCA. Plasma protein binding of DCA was assumed to be an important factor influencing the kinetics of low doses of DCA (mu g/kg day). Polymorphisms of GSTzeta may help explain inter-individual variability in DCA plasma kinetics and warrants evaluation. In conclusion, using a previously published rodent DCA PBPK model (Keys, D.A., Schultz, I.R., Mahle, D.A., Fisher, J.W., 2004. A quantitative description of suicide inhibition of dichloroacetic acid in rats and mice. Toxicol. Sci. 82, 381-393) and this human DCA PBPK model, human equivalent doses (HEDs) were calculated for a 10% increase in mice hepatic liver cancer (2.1 mg/kg day). The HEDs for the dosimetrics, area-under-the-concentration-curve (AUC) for total and free DCA in plasma, AUC of DCA in liver and amount of DCA metabolized per day were 0.02, 0.1, 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg day, respectively. Research on the mechanism of action of DCA and the relevance of mouse liver cancer is needed to better understand which dosimetric may be appropriate for extrapolation from animal studies to human.

AB Aim: To determine whether there has been an increase in deaths by overdose in Italy, as elsewhere in the Western world, over the past fifteen years. Method: This study's conclusions are based on analysis of official data on overdose deaths attributed to illicit drug addiction and abuse (ICD-9 codes 304 and 305) from 1984 to 2000, drawn from two archives of drug abuse information: the Direzione Centrale per i Servizi Antidroga (DADE) of the Italian Ministry of the Interior (1984-2000), and the Health Statistics held at the Italian Central Statistics Institute (ISTAT) (1984-1997). Mortality rates have been calculated for both genders in the following age groups: 15-24, 25-34, and 35-44 years. Results: Official data indicate that there has been a steady increase in the number of deaths by overdose in Italy over recent 15 years. This trend has affected both genders, but is more evident among males. Over the whole period females had consistently lower overdose rates than males. In both genders the age group 35-44 was subject to the highest mortality rate increase over the study period.. however, the highest overdose rates for both males and females were observed in the 25-34 age group. Consistently higher rates were witnessed in the northern regions of Italy with an overall increase across all latitudes. However, the greatest increase over the study period occurred in the South. In 5190 cases evaluated by the Italian Forensic Toxicology Group, 95.9% of deaths were attributed to heroin, but in about half of these, mixtures of three or more substances (heroin, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, methadone) were found in the deceased at doses that were likely to have contributed to death. Conclusions: The increase observed in the rates of death by overdose is likely to be a reflection of increased use of illicit drugs in the general population. Reporting practice by forensic pathologists might explain the extent of attribution of cause of death to heroin. Drop-out from addiction treatment is a commonly observed antecedent of fatal opioid overdose, therefore, caution is required when establishing treatment protocol for patients. Interventions that aim specifically at improving patient compliance with medical and psychiatric therapies should be favoured. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ethnopharmacology relevance: Gastrodia elata Blume is a highly valuable traditional Chinese medicine used in the treatment of depression. However, compounds with antidepressant effects in water extracts of G. elata Bl. (WGE) have not been identified. The aims of this study were to determine the major antidepressant compound in WGE and to evaluate the antidepressant effects of WGE and its active compounds which involved the monoaminergic system and neuronal cytoskeletal remodeling.
   Materials and methods: Gastrodin (GAS) and 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (HBA) in WGE, were analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ultraviolet detection. The forced swimming test (FST) was used to induce depression-like symptoms in 9 weeks old male Sprague-Dawley rats. The open field test (OFT) was used to measure anxiety after WGE, GAS, and HBA treatments. The levels of monoamine such as serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and their metabolites 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and homovanillic acid (HVA) were measured using HPL-Celectrochemical detection. Western blotting was used to examine the 5-HT1A receptor and the neuronal cytoskeleton remodeling-related proteins, Slit, dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (DPYSL2, also called CRMP2), Ras homologous member A (RhoA), and profilin 1 (PFN1) in vivo. Slit1 expression was evaluated in Hs683 cell line after treated with WGE (0.5 mg/mL), GAS (50, 100 and 100 mu M), and HBA (50, 100 and 100 mu M).
   Results: Oral administration of WGE (500 mg/kg bw), GAS (100 mg/kg bw), and HBA (100 mg/kg bw) exhibited the anti-depressant effect by significantly reducing the immobility time in FST, monoamine metabolism including the 5-HT to 5-HIAA in the hippocampus and DA to DOPAC and HVA ratios in the frontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. In the hippocampus, the expression of the neuronal cytoskeleton remodeling-related negative regulators Slit1 and RhoA were significantly down-regulated. In addition, the positive regulators CRMP2 and PFN1 were significantly up-regulated following GAS, HBA, and WGE treatments. Moreover, WGE, GAS, and HBA were directly down-regulated Slit1 expression in Hs683 cells.
   Conclusion: WGE, GAS, and HBA exhibited potential anti-depressant effects in rats by decreasing mono amine metabolism and modulated cytoskeleton remodeling-related protein expression in the Slit-Robo pathway. These results suggest that WGE can be used as agent for depressive prevention. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Cost-consequence analysis of cause of death investigation in Finland and
   in Denmark

   Cost-consequence analysis

AB The 1990s 12-16% total autopsy rate in Denmark has until now declined to 4%, while in Finland, it has remained between 25 and 30%. The decision to proceed with a forensic autopsy is based on national legislation, but it can be assumed that the financing of autopsies influences the decision process. Only little is known about the possible differences between health economics of Finnish and Danish cause of death investigation systems.
   The aims of this article were to analyse costs and consequences of Finnish and Danish cause of death investigations, and to develop an alternative autopsy practice in Denmark with another cost profile.
   Data on cause of death investigation systems and costs were derived from Departments of Forensic Medicine, Departments of Pathology, and the National Police. Finnish and Danish autopsy rates were calculated in unnatural (accident, suicide, homicide and undetermined intent) and natural (disease) deaths, and used to develop an alternative autopsy practice in Denmark. Consequences for society were analysed.
   The estimated unit cost (sic) for one forensic autopsy is 3.2 times lower in Finland than in Denmark ((sic)1400 versus (sic)4420), but in Finland the salaries for forensic pathologists working at the National Institute for Health and Welfare are not included in the unit cost. The unit cost for one medical autopsy is also lower in Finland than in Denmark; (sic)700 versus (sic)1070. In our alternative practice in Denmark, the forensic autopsy rate was increased from 2.2% to 8.5%, and the medical autopsy rate from 2.4% to 5.8%. Costs per 10,000 deaths were estimated to be 50% (+/- 25%) higher than now; i.e. (sic)3,678,724 (2,759,112-4,598,336), but would result in a lower unit cost for forensic autopsies (sic)3,094 (2,320-3,868) and for medical autopsies (sic)749 (562-936). This practice would produce a higher accuracy of national mortality statistics, which, consequently, would entail higher quality in public health, an accurate basis for decision-making in health politics, and better legislative safety in society.
   The implementation of this alternative practice in Denmark requires that legislation demands that forensic autopsy be performed if causality between unnatural death and cause of death cannot be clarified or if cause of death remains unknown. The Danish Health and Medicines Authority should provide guidelines that request a medical autopsy in natural deaths where more information about disease as a cause of death is needed. Our study results warrant similar health economic analyses of different cause of death investigations in other countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fentanyl is a potent synthetic narcotic analgesic administered in the form of a transdermal patch for the management of chronic pain. A 78-year-old woman with a history of cancer was found dead in bed. She was lying on her back. The external examination revealed 10 Durogesic (R) transdermal therapeutic systems (100 mu g/h fentanyl) on the body.
   Liquid-liquid extraction and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray source in positive ionization mode was applied for the quantitation of fentanyl and its major metabolite norfentanyl in the post-mortem samples. Fentanyl-d5 and norfentanyl-d5 were used as internal standards. Multiple reaction monitoring was used for specific detection. Calibration was performed by addition of standard solutions to drug-free matrix (blood, urine and liver) prior to extraction. The method showed good linearity for fentanyl and norfentanyl over a concentration range of 5-150 mu g/L in reconstituted extracts with coefficients of determination equal or greater than 0.998. Percent mean within-day precision and accuracy of 0.9-1.0% and 99.4-101.1% for fentanyl and 2.0-4.5% and 93.1-101.0% for norfentanyl were obtained.
   Mean extraction recoveries varied between 95.5% and 100.3% for fentanyl and 39.2-57.4% for norfentanyl. The following fentanyl (norfentanyl) concentration in the post-mortem samples were measured; 28.6 mu g/L (3.0 mu g/L) in right and 28.2 mu g/L (3.5 mu g/L) in left subelavian blood, 21.3 mu g/L (< 2 mu g/L) in right and 20.9 mu g/L (< 2 mu g/L) in left femoral blood, 37.6 mu g/L (4.2 mu g/L) in right and 33.9 mu g/L (4.4 mu g/L) in left ventricular blood, 282.9 mu g/L (121.2 mu g/L) in urine, 688.2 mu g/L in stomach contents, 122.5 mu g/L (25.4 mu g/L) in bile, 19.5 mu g/L (< 2 mu g/L) in vitreous humour, 203.0 mu g/kg (26.6 mu g/kg) in liver and 78.6 mu g/kg (46.3 mu g/kg) in kidney. We concluded that the woman's death was caused by acute intoxication with fentanyl. The manner of death was presumed to be suicide due to excessive administered Durogesic (R) transdermal therapeutic systems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

   determination; cause-of-death coding; mortality statistics
ID DEATH CERTIFICATION; VALIDATION
AB The entire fatal drug poisoning panorama in Finland is considered in terms of three categories: accidental, self-inflicted and undetermined (whether accidental or with intent to harm) deaths. The study material consisted of all 500 deaths in 1997 that medical examiners, after examination(s) at the Forensic Toxicology Division (FTD) of the Department of Forensic Medicine, University of Helsinki, officially certified as resulting from drug poisoning. These deaths were matched with data on the same deaths registered at Statistics Finland (SF), the national mortality statistics office. The SF register included 72 additional instances of deaths resulting from drug poisoning. In all but two of these cases, the cause-of-death determination was based on a medico-legal inquest with autopsy and forensic toxicological examination(s) and was certified, in most of the cases, as due to the alcohol component in multiple-toxicant combinations. Reclassifying these deaths at SF to the category of drug component is in accordance with current International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) regulation of coding "to the medicinal agent when combined with alcohol"; the principle and practice, which is recommended to be amended to equalize the status of alcohol and drug when explicitly stated by a forensic examiner as the principal toxicant in combined poisonings.
   With regard to manner-of-death, the agreement rates between medico-legally proven deaths from drug poisoning and those registered at SF were 79.8% for accidents, 98.5% for suicides and 0% (nil) for undetermined deaths, at the level of three-character external cause codes (E-code). All deaths originally certified as undetermined were re-assigned, most frequently to the category of accidental death. Since within an advanced and sophisticated medico-legal system, a medical examiner's evidence-based statement, even when the conclusion reached is undetermined (as to intent), should be taken as a compelling argument, the practice of reclassification cannot be considered advisable because assembled information is lost.
   Concerning the assigned drug-specific groups, the agreement according to the manner-of-death between certifications and registrations was fairly good. From among the accidents, however, opioid poisonings were re-assigned in 11 (29.7%) cases, mostly to the drug abuse/dependence categories, i.e. they were considered as natural deaths by the statistics office. The drug-specific observations were possible only by using the codes from the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification of drugs. This is why the incorporation of ATC codes into the ICD system, whenever reasonable, is recommended. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Chloroform is still encountered occasionally in clinical and forensic toxicology, hence knowledge of the special problems presented in the detection and measurement of this compound in biological specimens may be required. The aim of this paper is to review the available documentation on this topic in the context of a chloroform-related death.
   Early one morning in February 1999 a 34-year-old female was found dead fully clothed on a path near to a neighbour's garden. Amfetamine intoxication combined with hypothermia was accepted as the cause of the death in the absence of any other identifiable cause. Further investigation 17 months later revealed a blood chloroform concentration of 31 mg/L and the cause of death was revised to chloroform poisoning. A murder trial ensued, the indictment specifying forced inhalation as the route of exposure. The liver chloroform concentration measured 38 months after collection was reported as 1064 mg/kg and opinions were offered at trial that the autopsy findings, which included a gastritis, but no evidence of injury to the inside of the mouth and oesophagus, excluded the possibility of ingestion of a toxic dose of chloroform. It was asserted that the explanation for the high liver concentration was that the liver had concentrated chloroform from blood after death against a concentration gradient. At appeal against conviction 7 years later the conviction was quashed. It was found that the liver concentration should have been reported at trial as 1 mg/kg. Moreover, chloroform found in the stomach contents (162 mg/kg) 86 months after collection was irrefutable evidence that some, if not all, of the chloroform had been ingested.
   Screening for volatile poisons should always be considered if a cause of death is not immediately obvious, especially in young people and in known substance abusers. If the presence of an unstable or volatile analyte is suspected then sample collection, transport, and storage must be performed with the analysis in mind. Quantitative analysis of all available specimens should proceed forthwith once the presence of an unstable analyte is established if the cause of death is in doubt or if prosecution may follow. In the case of chloroform especial precautions are needed: (i) headspace analysis should be performed at 35 degrees C to preclude the possibility of artefactual formation from trichloroacetic acid, (ii) precautions to prevent cross-contamination of biological samples in the laboratory must be taken, and (iii) interpretation of analytical results must take account of the widespread presence of chloroform in the environment on the one hand, and that the toxicity of chloroform varies greatly depending on the circumstances and intensity of exposure on the other.

AB Cells may use multiple pathways to commit suicide. In certain contexts, dying cells generate large amounts of autophagic vacuoles and clear large proportions of their cytoplasm, before they finally die, as exemplified by the treatment of human mammary carcinoma cells with the anti-estrogen tamoxifen (TAM, <= 1 mu M). Protein analysis during autophagic cell death revealed distinct proteins of the nuclear fraction including CST-pi and some proteasomal subunit constituents to be affected during autophagic cell death. Depending on the functional status of caspase-3, MCF-7 cells may switch between autophagic and apoptotic features of cell death [Fazi, B., Bursch, W., Fimia, G.M., Nardacci R., Piacentini, M., Di Sano, F., Piredda. L., 2008. Fenretinide induces autophagic cell death in caspase-defective breast cancer cells. Autophagy 4(4), 435-441]. Furthermore, the self-destruction of MCF-7 cells was found to be completed by phagocytosis of cell residues [Petrovski, G., Zahuczky, G., Katona, K., Vereb, G., Martinet. W., Nemes, Z., Bursch, W., Fesus, L., 2007. Clearance of dying autophagic cells of different origin by professional and non-professional phagocytes. Cell Death Diff. 14 (6),1117-1128].
   Autophagy also constitutes a cell's strategy of defense upon cell damage by eliminating damaged bulk proteins/organelles. This biological condition may be exemplified by the treatment of MCF-7 cells with a necrogenic TAM-dose (10 mu M), resulting in the lysis of almost all cells within 24 h. However, a transient (1 h) challenge of MCF-7 cells with the same dose allowed the recovery of cells involving autophagy. Enrichment of chaperones in the insoluble cytoplasmic protein fraction indicated the formation of aggresomes, a potential trigger for autophagy. In a further experimental model HL60 cells were treated with TAM, causing dose-dependent distinct responses: 1-5 mu M TAM, autophagy predominant; 7-9 mu M, apoptosis predominant; 15 mu M, necrosis. These phenomena might be attributed to the degree of cell damage caused by tamoxifen, either by generating ROS, increasing membrane fluidity or forming DNA-adducts.
   Finally, autophagy constitutes a cell's major adaptive (survival) strategy in response to metabolic challenges such as glucose or amino acid deprivation, or starvation in general. Notably, the role of autophagy appears not to be restricted to nutrient recycling in order to maintain energy supply of cells and to adapt cell(organ) size to given physiological needs. For instance, using a newly established hepatoma cell line HCC-1.2, amino acid and glucose deprivation revealed a pro-apoptotic activity, additive to TGF-beta 1.The proapoptotic action of glucose deprivation was antagonized by 2-deoxyglucose, possibly by stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane involving the action of hexokinase II. These observations suggest that signaling cascades steering autophagy appear to provide links to those regulating cell number.
   Taken together, our data exemplify that a given cell may flexibly respond to type and degree of (micro)environmental changes or cell death stimuli; a cell's response may shift gradually from the elimination of damaged proteins by autophagy and the recovery to autophagic or apoptotic pathways of cell death, the failure of which eventually may result in necrosis.

AB Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) plays a central role in the regulation of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis, i.e., the final common pathway in the stress response. The action of CRH on ACTH release is strongly potentiated by vasopressin, that is co-produced in increasing amounts when the hypothalamic paraventricular neurons are chronically activated. Whereas vasopressin stimulates ACTH release in humans, oxytocin inhibits it. ACTH release results in the release of corticosteroids from the adrenal that, subsequently, through mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors, exert negative feedback on, among other things, the hippocampus, the pituitary and the hypothalamus. The most important glucocorticoid in humans is cortisol, present in higher levels in women than in men. During aging, the activation of the CRH neurons is modest compared to the extra activation observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the even stronger increase in major depression.
   The HPA-axis is hyperactive in depression, due to genetic factors or due to aversive stimuli that may occur during early development or adult life. At least five interacting hypothalamic peptidergic systems are involved in the symptoms of major depression. Increased production of vasopressin in depression does not only occur in neurons that colocalize CRH, but also in neurons of the supraoptic nucleus (SON), which may lead to increased plasma levels of vasopressin, that have been related to an enhanced suicide risk. The increased activity of oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) may be related to the eating disorders in depression. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), i.e., the biological clock of the brain, shows lower vasopressin production and a smaller circadian amplitude in depression, which may explain the sleeping problems in this disorder and may contribute to the strong CRH activation. The hypothalamo-pituitary thyroid (HPT)-axis is inhibited in depression. These hypothalamic peptidergic systems, i.e., the HPA-axis, the SCN, the SON and the HPT-axis, have many interactions with aminergic systems that are also implicated in depression. CRH neurons are strongly activated in depressed patients, and so is their HPA-axis, at all levels, but the individual variability is large. It is hypothesized that particularly a subgroup of CRH neurons that projects into the brain is activated in depression and induces the symptoms of this disorder. On the other hand, there is also a lot of evidence for a direct involvement of glucocorticoids in the etiology and symptoms of depression. Although there is a close association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of CRH and alterations in the HPA-axis in depression, much-of the CRH in CSF is likely to be derived from sources other than the PVN.
   Furthermore, a close interaction between the HPA-axis and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG)-axis exists. Organizing effects during fetal life as well as activating effects of sex hormones on the HPA-axis have been reported. Such mechanisms may be a basis for the higher prevalence of mood disorders in women as compared to men. In addition, the stress system is affected by changing levels of sex hormones, as found, e.g., in the premenstrual period, ante- and postpartum, during the transition phase to the menopause and during the use of oral contraceptives. In depressed women, plasma levels of estrogen are usually lower and plasma levels of androgens are increased, while testosterone levels are decreased in depressed men. This is explained by the fact that both in depressed males and females the HPA-axis is increased in activity, parallel to a diminished HPG-axis, while the major source of androgens in women is the adrenal, whereas in men it is the testes. It is speculated, however, that in the etiology of depression the relative levels of sex hormones play a more important role than their absolute levels. Sex hormone replacement therapy indeed seems to improve mood in elderly people and AD patients.
   Studies of rats have shown that high levels of cumulative corticosteroid exposure and rather extreme chronic stress induce neuronal damage that selectively affects hippocampal structure. Studies performed under less extreme circumstances have so far provided conflicting data. The corticosteroid neurotoxicity hypothesis that evolved as a result of these initial observations is, however, not supported by clinical and experimental observations. In a few recent postmortem studies in patients treated with corticosteroids and patients who had been seriously and chronically depressed no indications for AD neuropathology, massive cell loss, or loss of plasticity could be found, while the incidence of apoptosis was extremely rare and only seen outside regions expected to be at risk for steroid overexposure. In addition, various recent experimental studies using good stereological methods failed to find massive cell loss in the hippocampus following exposure to stress or steroids, but rather showed adaptive and reversible changes in structural parameters after stress.
   Thus, the HPA-axis in AD is only moderately activated, possibly due to the initial (primary) hippocampal degeneration in this condition. There are no convincing arguments to presume a causal, primary role for cortisol in the pathogenesis of AD. Although cortisol and CRH may well be causally involved in the signs and symptoms of depression, there is so far no evidence for any major irreversible damage in the human hippocampus in this disorder.
