AB Objective: To examine trends in suicide rates in Israel over a 13-year period. Method: All cases of autopsy-confirmed suicide in Israel from 1985 to 1997 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: An overall annual increase in suicide rates, with rates in men 3 times higher than those in women, was observed. Suicide rates were highest in the second and third decades of life. Unlike Western countries where gunshot wounds are the most common method of suicide for men and poisoning is most common for women, asphyxiation by hanging was the most common method used by men in Israel, followed by firearm wounds and jumping from heights. In women, however, jumping from heights was the most common method, followed by hanging and poisoning. Conclusion: Increasing rates of suicide may be associated with waves of immigration to Israel, increased substance abuse and depression and the political and social climate. Further study to examine the precipitating factors is warranted.

AB This paper reports the characteristics of suicides which occurred during the existential and the non-existential wars in Israel. It provides a first approximation of whether the suicide patterns in each war are consistent with the findings of Morselli and Durkheim, and whether their theoretical interpretations can serve as a preliminary guideline to explaining the Israeli case, which is characterized by short periods of war, social integration during some of the non-existential wars, and a sharp rise in post-war male suicide rates following all of the existential wars. Implications for further studies on the subject in Israel and elsewhere are discussed.

AB This research investigates the knowledge and myths regarding suicide among students in Israel, and examines whether they are affected by ethnic origin, gender, and religiosity. A random sample of 450 undergraduate students from two colleges was asked to fill out the Suicide Opinion Questionnaire (SOQ). Knowledge was measured by five SOQ items (alpha = 0.57) and myths of suicide by 20 SOQ items (alpha = 0.67)._The level of Israeli students' knowledge about suicide is generally good (X = 3.21; SD = 0.58). There are significant differences, however, between the Jewish (n = 266) and Arab (n = 154) students in knowledge about basic facts of suicide in Israel [(X-Arabs = 3.04; X-JEWS = 3.32; t ((419), (0.95)) = 4.63, p <.001)]. Although both groups share the same educational milieu, the Arab students tend more to believe that suicide rates are higher in Israel, and even more so among people of Asian African origin and minorities. They also perceive suicide by shooting to be the most popular suicide method. There are also significant differences between those groups with respect to their belief in suicide myths [(XArabs = 2.91; SD = 0.40;X-JEWS = 3.17, SD = 0.41; t((419), (0.95)) = 6.31, p < 0.01)]. Arabs tend more to relate suicide to lower religious affiliation, mental illness and chronic tendency, and to believe that the victim's relatives know nothing about the coming suicide. No significant differences were found based on religiosity or gender. Discussion focuses on the influence of the different cultural characteristics of lifestyle and the social control systems among Jews and Arabs in Israel on perceptions toward suicide.

LA English
DT Article
DE Israel; suicide; suicide prevention; biblical psychology
AB Suicide is the ultimate outcome of a tragic and pessimistic view of life, so prevalent in ancient Greek writings. Indeed, over 16 suicides and self-mutilations can be found in the 26 surviving tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides. In contrast, only six suicides can be found in the Hebrew Scriptures. This article examines evidence regarding seven risk factors for suicide. It contrasts biblical and Greek narratives regarding each of these factors respectively: (1) Elijah against Ajax; (2) Job against Zeno; (3) David against Coriolanus; (4) Jonah against Narcissus; (5) Moses against Oedipus; (6) Rebecca against Phaedra; and finally (7) Ruth against Antigone. All these Greek narratives lead to self-destructive behaviours while biblical narratives provide a hopeful positive psychology, and a safe way out these dilemmas. It is high time to develop a biblical psychology and psychotherapy commensurate with the restored land of Israel and a Hebrew civilisation.

AB In recent years, there has been an increase in suicide rates throughout the Western world. However, psycho-social responses to the problem are limited, as is public awareness of suicide and its consequences. This article presents findings from a survey on public attitudes toward suicide in Israel. The survey was conducted among a representative sample, and examined the extent to which the problem is a public priority for developing interventions aimed at preventing and reducing the rates of suicide. The findings revealed that despite the prevalence of suicide in Israel, and even though many of the participants had been personally acquainted with the families of suicide victims, suicide still ranks low on the hierarchy of bereavement. The Israeli public is ignorant about suicide, and does not consider it a problem that calls for government intervention and accountability. The study highlights the need for social workers to play an active role as social agents in an attempt to change the social 'bereavement pyramid' perception and effect on government policy toward suicide.

AB Judaism considers the duty of preserving life as a paramount injunction. Specific injunctions against suicide appear in the Bible, Talmud, and thereafter. Nevertheless, Jewish tradition emphasizes that one should let himself be killed rather than violate cardinal rules of Jewish law. Mitigating circumstances are found for the six deaths by suicide mentioned in the Bible, for example to account for one's sins, or avoid shameful death. Heroic suicide is praised throughout the Jewish history, from the suicide of Samson and the collective suicide in Masada, to the collective readiness of Jews in Medieval times and during the Holocaust to kill themselves rather than succumb to their enemies. Suicide rates for Jews are lower than those of Protestants and Catholics. Similarly, suicide rates in Israel are lower in comparison to Europe and North America, although being higher than those in most Moslem Asian and North African countries. This low rate of suicide is found in Jewish Israelis of all ages, including in adolescents. Elevated suicidal risk may be found in specific sub-populations, including male Israeli soldiers, immigrants from the former USSR and Ethiopia, in particular adolescent immigrants from the former USSR, elderly Holocaust survivors, and young Israel-Arab women. The meaning of these findings is discussed according to different socio-cultural perspectives.

AB Islam prohibits to take your own life, because this way you will interfere with the work of G-d (Allah), which is clear from several places in the Quran. Concerning individual suicide or suicide attempts in various Arab countries the literature is sparse and the incidence low. In this paper we present a review of research from Israel showing that suicide epidemiology among the Arab population of children and adolescents display a low incidence, but an increase has been observed over the past decade, but still much lower than the Jewish population. We believe that there is a need for the development of prevention and intervention strategies in order to keep this incidence low.

ID NATIONAL-HEALTH SURVEY
AB Countries with Muslim populations report relatively lower rates of suicide. However, authors have noted methodological flaws in the data. This study examined reliable rates of completed suicide, suicide ideation, planning and attempts among Muslims as compared to Jews in Israel.
   For completed suicide, information was extracted from death certificates (2003-2007); the National Emergency Room Admissions Database (NERAD) provided data on suicide attempts (2003-2007); and the Israel National Health Survey (INHS) (2003-2004) was used for self reports on lifetime suicide ideation, planning and attempts.
   Completed suicide rates among Muslim-Israelis (3.0 per 100,000) were lower compared to Jewish-Israelis (8.2 per 100,000). Based on NERAD, attempted suicide rates among men were lower for Muslims compared to Jews, while among women aged 15-44 no differences were found. In the INHS, the rate of self-reported lifetime suicide attempts was significantly higher among Muslims (2.8%) compared to Jews (1.2%), while lifetime prevalence rates of suicide ideation (6.6%) and planning (2.1%) in Muslims did not differ from Jews (5.2 and 1.9%, respectively).
   Conceivably, the lower rate of completed suicide among Muslim-Israelis might be explained by the strenuous proscription of suicide by the Koran. However, its extension to suicide attempts is equivocal: attempts were higher among Muslims than among Jews according to self-reports but lower in the NERAD records. Social pressures exerted on the reporting agents may bias the diagnosis of self-harm in both the latter data source and in the death certificates.

ID BRIEF INTERPERSONAL PSYCHOTHERAPY; PSYCHOLOGICAL AUTOPSY; POPULATION;
   CANADA; TRIAL
AB Postpartum suicidality in Israel had not been systematically studied until the recent important investigation by Glasser and colleagues. The authors review rates, trends, and characteristics of postpartum women who considered, attempted, or completed suicide in Israel. This commentary argues that, although postpartum suicidality is relatively rare, it is extremely tragic-not just for the women, but for the entire family and community. The main aim of this commentary is to emphasize that preventive efforts should continue and expand, especially among at-risk groups. At-risk groups include the youngest age group, postpartum Arab women, and postpartum former Soviet Union immigrants. Identification of women at risk or suffering from postpartum depression (PPD) is mandated in Israel. Efforts should include broader screening for various types of suicide ideation and behavior. Assessments should specifically include passive suicide ideation, active suicide ideation with method, intent, and plan, as well as various types of suicide attempts and preparatory behaviors. In addition, specific interventions formulated on evidencebased psychotherapies should be provided in family practice, obstetric, and pediatric settings. These settings are less stigmatized in comparison to mental health settings. Potential therapies can be (among others) Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), which are effective in preventing perinatal depression.

AB An analysis of all emergency department admissions in Israel classified as an attempted suicide in the years 1996-2002 was done to examine attempted suicide rates by age and gender with particular attention to adolescents and young adults. Gender differences in attempted suicide rates were significant only during adolescence and young adulthood, ages 13 to 26. The highest rate for females was 3 years earlier than the highest rate for males. The results lead to the conclusion that women do not attempt suicide more than men, except for 13-26 year olds.

ID SURVIVORS; DISORDERS; SEQUELAE
AB The available literature on the risk of suicides related to the Holocaust (1939-1945) and its aftermath differs in its time periods, in the countries investigated, and in the robustness of its sources. Reliable information seems to indicate that the risk of suicide for Jews in Nazi Germany and Austria during the pre-war period (1933-1939) was elevated, while information on suicide during the internment in the concentration camps is fraught with problems. The latter derives from the Nazis' decision to hide the statistics on the inmates' causes of death, and from the prevailing life conditions that impeded separation between self-inflicted death and murder. Reliable studies conducted in Israel among refugees who entered pre-state Israel, 1939-1945, and post-World War II survivors reaching Israel (1948 on), show a mixed picture: suicide rates among the former were higher than comparison groups, while the latter group shows evidence of resilience.

SO SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: In Israel, some population characteristics and lifestyle patterns make epidemiological research on suicide of particular interest. The Israeli population is characterized by ethnic diversity, with a multi-religious, multi-national mosaic of Jews and Arabs. These subgroups also vary in their suicidal behavior. The aims of the present study were to examine the trends in suicide incidence rates in Israel from 1984 to 1994, to identify sub-populations at high risk for suicide and to identify suicide methods associated with increased risk. Methods: Suicide rate trends in Israel over the period from 1984 to 1994 were examined for four subgroups: Jewish men and women, and Arab men and women. Cases of undetermined external cause (UEC) of death were also considered. Mortality data were obtained from the computerized data files of the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics, which includes cause of death and sociodemographic variables. Suicide was classified according to the ICD-9 codes. Results: Suicide rates were higher for Jews than for Arabs, and higher for men than for women. The rates among both population and sex groups increased directly with age. A significant increase over the years studied was found for Jewish men, particularly in the 18- to 21-year-old age group. An increase in the use of firearms was noted, mainly in the groups in which total suicide rates increased. Conclusions: The findings of this study highlight the need for further studies to identify both sub-populations at high risk for suicide, and societal trends such as lifestyles, immigration, military service, and media exposure to violence, as first steps toward planning of intervention programs to reduce suicide rates.

AB This paper examines the characteristics of suicide bombers as reflected in the Israeli press during the Second Intifada in Israel. The analysis aims to determine whether there were significant differences in the characteristics of suicide bombers with religious motives versus those with nationalist motives. The findings reveal that gender, education level, and organizational affiliation correlated significantly with motives for carrying out suicide attacks. Most of the suicide bombers with religious motives were men with elementary education. In addition, the results show that most of the suicide bombers who were affiliated with the Hamas organization acted out of religious motives. No significant differences were found between suicide bombers with religious and those with nationalist motives with regard to age, marital status, and prior activity in terrorist organizations.

AB The effects of antidepressants on suicide are controversial; on the one hand they decrease the incidence of death by suicide, as reflected in epidemiological studies, and on the other hand, there are claims that they increase the risk of impulsivity and suicide. In 1998, primary care physicians in Israel were not allowed to prescribe selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and in 1999 this prohibition was lifted. We thus evaluated the association between patterns of antidepressant prescribing and the rate of death by suicide in Israel in 1998 compared with that in 2002. Data regarding deaths by suicide were obtained from the Central Bureau of Statistics. Annual rates of antidepressant prescribing were computed from the Intercontinental Marketing Services database. The Intercontinental Marketing Services data covers three out of the four Health Maintenance Organizations in Israel, encompassing 46% of all citizens. Prescribing of all antidepressants increased 2.6-fold between 1998 and 2002. This increase was significantly more pronounced for the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. A shift in prescription practices was noted, with a 1.37-fold increase in prescribing by primary care physicians. While the concomitant decrease in overall national rates of completed suicide did not reach significance (17-14 per 100000), the incidence decreased significantly in men aged 55-74 years (33-22 per 100 000; P=0.029). An overall reduction in suicides, which was significant only in elderly men, was noted in association with increased rates of antidepressant prescription. This study is limited in scope but adds a unique viewpoint related to the possible positive effect of increased antidepressant prescribing in primary care on suicide.

SO PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS

AB It was hypothesized that one of the reasons for the U.S. invasion of Iraq was to stop the payments being made by Saddam Hussein to the families of suicide (homicide) bombers in Israel. The consequences of suicide (homicide) bombing attacks against Israel between March 2001 and August 2004 were evaluated as related to the time of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. On average per month during this period, there were fewer overall casualties after the invasion than before it. As many as nearly 1,100 casualties may have been prevented in Israel as a consequence of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, suggesting that at least one possible goal of the U.S. invasion may have been achieved, at least as averaged over the first 17 months after the invasion.

SO STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM

DT Article
ID TERRORISM
AB This article analyses the results of interaction between suicide operatives and bystanders in the course of 103 suicide attacks in Israel over a recent 3-year period. It shows that bystanders' intervention tended to reduce the casualties arising by numbers that were both statistically and practically significant. When bystanders intervened, however, this was often at the cost of their own lives. The value of a challenge was particularly large for suicide missions associated with Hamas, but Hamas operations were also less likely to meet a challenge in the first place. These findings, although preliminary, may have implications for counterterrorism. More systematic collection of statistical data relating to suicide incidents would be of benefit.

AB Gender and ethnicity are significant factors when evaluating suicidal risk, especially among ethnically diverse populations. In the current study we explored the association between gender, ethnicity, and suicide ideation and attempts among Arab and Jewish vocational education and training high school students in Israel. Students (N=3,554) completed a self-report survey evaluating suicide ideation and attempts, depression, anxiety, somatization, and sense of belonging. Hierarchical generalized linear modeling indicated that female Arab adolescents had elevated levels of suicide ideation, higher rates of suicide attempts, and greater psychological distress than Arab males and Jewish students. Furthermore, female Arab adolescents were found to be more susceptible to suicide ideation when depression levels were high. These results are discussed in the context of the double-jeopardy Arab young women face, as members of a minority ethnic group in Israel and their status as women within the patriarchal Arab culture.

TI Tactical prevention of suicide bombings in Israel
SO INTERFACES
LA English
DT Article
DE military : tactics and strategy; probability : applications
AB Suicide bombings are the leading cause of death from terrorism in Israel. Counterterror tactics, such as the targeted killings or preemptive arrests of terror leaders or suspects, are meant to prevent such attacks. To investigate whether these tactics are successful, we estimated via maximum likelihood a family of shot-noise models from monthly data covering 2001 through 2003 to see whether we could predict the rate of suicide-bombing attacks as a function of prevention tactics over time. Although preventive arrests appear to lower the rate of suicide-bombing attacks, targeted killings seem to be followed by an increase in the number of suicide bombings. In addition, limited evidence suggests that the probability of intercepting a suicide bomber en route to an attack increases with the expected number of suicide-bombing attacks. Such an endogenous relationship could imply an upper limit on the rate of successful suicide bombings.

AB This study investigated associations between indiscriminate media reporting of suicides and later inflated suicide counts among Israel's general population between the years 2008 and 2012. Self-inflicted deaths that received post-suicide media exposure (referred to as "publicized suicides") were selected via Google news search-hit appraisals. Distributions of suicides were inspected and risk ratios (RRs) estimated by comparing population suicide rates 4 weeks before and 4 weeks after each publicized suicide ("reference" vs. "affected" periods, respectively). Poisson time series regression was employed to account also for secular trends and seasonality. A total of 2,119 people died by suicide, 13 of whom received noticeable media attention throughout the study. No meaningful impact following the 13 deaths on subsequent suicide counts during the observation window (affected vs. reference phase) was found. Poisson regression confirmed that suicide counts following publicized suicides were independent of media coverage. Given the pronounced search hits following the publicized suicides developing regulation practices that constrain indiscreet media reporting should officially be included as part of suicide prevention practices. Future research should focus on imitation suicide effects as a function of post-suicide media exposure, while including both risk and protective factors.

AB This paper explores the association between suicidal behavior and immigrant status among Israeli residents from the former USSR (FSU).
   The Israeli component of the World Mental Health Survey (INHS) provided information on suicide ideations, plans and attempts. The INHS samples included Israel-born Jews (n = 2,114) and post-1990 immigrants from the FSU (n = 814). Data on completed suicide were extracted from the countrywide report of the Ministry of Health.
   The controlled lifetime rates of suicidal behavior among FSU immigrants were significantly higher than among their Israel-born counterparts. A higher risk was found in the first years following immigration among young adults with higher education and without a spouse. Completed suicide rates were higher among the FSU immigrants than in the general Israeli population with the largest risk among young-adult immigrant men.
   The findings are consistent with previous studies and are discussed in the context of both suicide rates in the country of origin and migratory stressors. Preventive measures are suggested.

The first workday was associated with a 60% increase in suicide rate among young men. This increase was not observed among female reserve or professional soldiers. This finding might indicate a particular susceptibility of men to contextual and situational factors. The explanation of the increased suicide risk on the first workday stresses such processes as the broken-promise effect as well as difficulty in facing the demands of service and transitions from the weekend to the workweek.

We find evidence that the targeted killings of Palestinian leaders by Israel reduce realized Palestinian violence. We find, however, that intended Palestinian violence is increasing at low levels of targeted killings, but decreasing at higher levels. We find that suicide bombings that kill at least one Israeli lead to a subsequent increase in the incidence and levels of Palestinian fatalities. Our results do not support the notion that suicide attacks and targeted killings follow the "tit-for-tat" pattern that is commonly Postulated In the literature.

AB Completed suicide and suicide attempts among four Arab groups defined by religious affiliation in Israel: Bedouins, Muslims (other than Bedouin), Christians and Druze were investigated using national databases of suicide (1999-2011), and suicide attempts (2004-2012). Age specific and age-adjusted rates and ratio of suicides to suicidal behavior were calculated, and compared with the total Israeli population rates. Age-adjusted suicide rates were lowest among the non-Bedouin Muslims, 2.5, followed in ascending order by Bedouins, 3.2, and Christian Arabs, 3.3 per 100,000 population, respectively. The highest rate was found among the Druze, 8.7, per 100,000 population, particularly for young males. The rates among the Arab groups were lower than for the total Israeli population, 7.9 per 100,000 population, except for the Druze. The pattern of suicide rates by gender, higher for males than females, was similar in all groups. The rates among the Arab Israelis were highest for the 15-24 year old age group, while in the total population the rates increased with age. Age-adjusted suicide attempt rates were higher amongst non-Bedouin Muslims, 84.8 per 100,000 population, followed by the Bedouin, 72.4; Druze. 64.9; and lowest among Christian Arabs, 58.6, all per 100,000 population. In the total Israeli population, the rate was even higher, 89.8 per 100,000 population. Suicide attempt rates were higher for women in all groups, except among the Druze. Rates were higher in most groups for ages 15-24. In this age group, the rates for female Muslims and Bedouins and for male Druze were higher than among the total population. Arab elderly had low rates of both suicide and suicide attempts. The ratio of suicides to suicide attempts increased with age for all groups, except for the Christian Arabs. It was markedly higher for the Druze, compared to 7.3 % for the total population for ages 15 and over. Findings highlight the importance of investigating the differential distribution of suicidal behavior by specific ethno-religious groups.

AB Suicide is universal within the range of human behaviors and is not necessarily related to psychiatric morbidity, though it is considerably more prevalent among psychiatric patients. Considering the limitations of medical knowledge, psychiatrists cope with an unfounded and almost mythical perception of their ability to predict and prevent suicide. We set out to compose a position paper for the Israel Psychiatric Association (IPA) that clarifies expectations from psychiatrists when treating suicidal patients, focusing on risk assessment and boundaries of responsibility, in the era of defensive medicine. The final draft of the position paper was by consensus. The IPA Position Paper established the first standard of care concerning expectations from psychiatrists in Israel with regard to knowledge-based assessment of suicide risk, elucidation of the therapist's responsibility to the suicidal psychotic patient (defined by law) compared to patients with preserved reality testing, capacity for choice, and responsibility for their actions. Therapists will be judged for professional performance rather than outcomes and wisdom of hindsight. This paper may provide support for psychiatrists who, with clinical professionalism rather than extenuating considerations of defensive medicine, strive to save the lives of suicidal patients.

TI What Happened to Suicide Bombings in Israel? Insights from a Terror
   Stock Model
SO STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM
LA English
DT Article
AB An analysis of three years of suicide bombing data in Israel reveals an increase in such attacks through March 2002 followed by a steep decline through the end of 2003. The authors propose a terror-stock model that treats the suicide bombing attack rate as a function of the number of terrorists available to plan and execute suicide bombings. The intent of Israeli tactics such as targeted killings and preemptive arrests is to reduce the capacity of terror organizations to commit attacks. When fit to the data, this model suggests that the targeted killing of terror suspects sparks estimated recruitment to the terror stock that increases rather than decreases the rate of suicide bombings. Surprisingly, only the deaths of suspected terrorists, and not Palestinian civilians, are associated with such estimated recruitment. Although Israeli actions have reduced the rate of suicide bombings over time, it is preventive arrests rather than targeted killings that seem more responsible for this outcome.

AB Some key issues pertaining to Palestinian psychiatry are described. Bearing in mind the geographical location and history of the Palestinian population, the development of psychiatry needs to be seen in the context of the Arab world, on the one hand, and of Israel, on the other. In the Middle Ages, Arab culture and medicine were more developed than in Europe. Aspects of general and forensic psychiatry on the West Bank and Gaza are outlined. Issues pertaining to the death penalty, suicide and suicide bombers are also discussed. The biblically-described relationship between the Arab and Jewish peoples has its resonance today with regard to cohabitation and conflict.

   LOW-INCOME; WOMEN; PREGNANCY
AB Background: Postpartum suicidality, a result of extreme distress or depression, is a tragedy for the woman, infant, and family. Screening for postpartum depression (PPD) is mandatory in Israel, including a question on suicidal ideation. This study presents and analyzes data regarding rates, trends and characteristics of postpartum women who considered, attempted, or completed suicide, to help direct services aimed at preventing these occurrences.
   Methods: Suicidal ideation data based on PPD screening was drawn from various publications and databases. Suicide attempt data was obtained from the Emergency Department database for 2006-2015 and matched with the National Birth Registry. Cause of death from the national database for those years were similarly linked to births to identify postpartum suicides and deaths. Postpartum and non-postpartum suicide attempt rates were computed by year, and by age and ethnic/immigrant group. A multivariate logistic model was used to estimate relative risk for postpartum attempts, controlling for age and ethnic group.
   Results: Suicidal ideation in recent years has been reported as 1% or less, with higher rates found in studies of Arab women. Suicide attempt rates for non-postpartum women were 3-5 times that of postpartum women, rising over the years, while remaining relatively stable for postpartum women. Adjusted risk of suicide attempt for nonpostpartum women was significantly higher; adjusted odds ratio was 4.08 (95% CI 3.75-4.44). It was also significantly higher for Arabs and immigrants from the Former Soviet Union, compared to Israeli-born Jews/veteran immigrants, and for younger women compared to those aged 35-44. Seven postpartum suicides were recorded during 2006-2015, a rate of 0.43 per 100,000 births.
   Conclusion: Postpartum suicidality in Israel is low relative to other countries. Although relatively rare and lower than among non-postpartum women, health professionals should be attentive to risk factors, such as past psychiatric disorders, suicide attempts and current emotional distress, particularly among higher-risk populations. The universal screening program for PPD is a valuable opportunity for this, but increased resources should be allotted to implement and utilize it optimally. Prenatal screening should be added as an Israeli Quality Indicator, and postpartum completed suicides should be thoroughly investigated to guide prevention efforts.

AB Because of frequent wars, mandatory military service, and terror attacks, the Israeli population is intensely exposed to death. During its 60 years of existence the state has created national symbols to commemorate the victims of war and terror. Compensation and rehabilitation legislation is in place and state ceremonies are performed.
   The massive public discussion surrounding death under national circumstances has created a "hierarchy of bereavement" in Israel. At the top of this hierarchy are those who died at war. Suicide is at the bottom of the list.
   This chapter describes the Israeli "hierarchy of bereavement" through examining social attitudes in Israeli society towards various means of death, including perception by the general public and by suicide survivors.

ID SUICIDE
AB The 2011 attempted assassination of a US representative renewed the national gun control debate. Gun advocates claim mass-casualty events are mitigated and deterred with three policies: (a) permissive gun laws, (b) widespread gun ownership, (c) and encouragement of armed civilians who can intercept shooters. They cite Switzerland and Israel as exemplars. We evaluate these claims with analysis of International Crime Victimization Survey (ICVS) data and translation of laws and original source material. Swiss and Israeli laws limit firearm ownership and require permit renewal one to four times annually. ICVS analysis finds the United States has more firearms per capita and per household than either country. Switzerland and Israel curtail off-duty soldiers' firearm access to prevent firearm deaths. Suicide among soldiers decreased by 40 per cent after the Israeli army's 2006 reforms. Compared with the United States, Switzerland and Israel have lower gun ownership and stricter gun laws, and their policies discourage personal gun ownership.

AB Religion impacts suicidality. One's degree of religiosity can potentially serve as a protective factor against suicidal behavior. To accurately assess risk of suicide, it is imperative to understand the role of religion in suicidality. PsycINFO and MEDLINE databases were searched for published articles on religion and suicide between 1980 and 2008. Epidemiological data on suicidality across four religions, and the influence of religion on suicidality are presented. Practice guidelines are presented for incorporating religiosity into suicide risk assessment. Suicide rates and risk and protective factors for suicide vary across religions. It is essential to assess for degree of religious commitment and involvement to accurately identify suicide risk.

AB Man-made disasters such as acts of terrorism may affect a society's resiliency and sensitivity to prolonged physical and psychological stress. The Israeli Tel Aviv stock market TA-100 Index was used as an indicator of reactivity to suicide terror bombings. After accounting for factors such as world market changes and attack severity and intensity, the analysis reveals that although Israel's financial base remained sensitive to each act of terror across the entire period of the Second Intifada (2000-06), sustained psychological resilience was indicated with no apparent overall market shift. In other words, we saw a 'normalisation of terror' following an extended period of continued suicide bombings. The results suggest that investors responded to less transitory global market forces, indicating sustained resilience and long-term market confidence. Future studies directly measuring investor expectations and reactions to man-made disasters, such as terrorism, are warranted.

SO DEVIANT BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
AB Over the last decade, the suicide method became one of the most prevalent tactics of Palestinian Terrorism in Israel. Who are these people, willing to sacrifice their lives in such an act, and what drives them to do such things? In our present analysis, we answer these questions, while relying on the concepts of altruistic and fatalistic suicide from Durkheim's typology of suicide behavior. Based on a newly established database compiled for this purpose-which includes information based on suicide, as well as non-suicide-Palestinian suicide terrorists from 1993 until the beginning of 2002, fit the "altruistic" type as well as some elements from the "fatalistic" and represent a combination of both types; thus they can be labeled under a new category of "fatalistic altruistic" suicide.

AB Objectives: The rate of completed suicide among the elderly continues to be the highest of any age group worldwide. The aim of the present study was to investigate the sociodemographic data, mental and physical health characteristics, and suicide methods of the elderly population who completed suicide in Israel.
   Methods: A national retrospective record-based case series study of consecutive elder (50 years or older) suicide completers who had undergone autopsy over a 10-year period was conducted.
   Results: Three hundred and fourteen consecutive records of suicide completers, 69.6% males, and mean age 64.7 were analyzed. The largest group (38%) emigrated from the Former Soviet Union and 19% emigrated from East Europe. Immigrants from East Europe committed suicide at an older age. Hanging was the predominant suicide method. Jumping from height increased more than threefold in the 'old-old'(older than 75 years) group. Hanging and firearms were more frequently used by males. Females were more likely to employ poisoning and suffocation. A significant minority (30%) had been diagnosed as suffering from psychiatric morbidity. Most common diagnoses were depression and alcohol abuse or dependence. Physical disorders (mainly cardiovascular disease and malignancy) were present in 27% of cases. Subjects with psychiatric illness were more likely to complete suicide at a younger age compared with subjects with physical illness.
   Conclusions: Findings of male predominance, psychiatric morbidity, and physical illness are consistent with previously published studies. Immigrants from East Europe completed suicide at an older age and the older victims had used more lethal methods of suicide. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Suicide attacks are the targeted use of self-destructing humans against a perceived enemy for political ends. After reviewing terrorism and suicide terrorism trends between 1980 and 2003 the paper shows that suicide attacks have increased dramatically between 2004 and 2005 and have become a global phenomenon. Three main sites of suicide terrorism namely, Iraq, Israel and Sri Lanka are examined in some derail including information about the main terrorist groups responsible for sponsoring suicide attacks and some profiles of individuals involved. The paper then examines the main sociological explanations of suicide attacks, including a description of the strategic logic behind these atrocities, and the notion of life being a weapon. It concludes with an overview of the recommendations emerging from studies that seek to prevent suicide terrorism.

AB Background: Suicide Prevention is an ongoing task for mental health services. This article describes a pilot program for suicide prevention that took place in two districts in Israel from 2009 to 2012. The program targeted specific population, patients in high-risk for suicide, without major mental illness or previous association with the mental health system. In that group many suicide attempts were due to stressful life events.
   Methods: Patients who performed a suicide attempt or were considered high-risk for suicide were referred to the project. The first contact took place up to 24 h after the referral and included a phone call with suggestion for further intervention. If he was willing, the patient was invited to a serious of 8-12 meetings with a therapist that focused on "crisis intervention" techniques.
   Results: 212 subjects were referred to the project. Three quarters of the referrals were females. Most of them were of Jewish nationality, however, the percentage of Druze in the program's population was higher than their percentage of general population. Only 137 continued participation after the initial phone call, people of Jewish nationality were more willing to continue the intervention. During the intervention there was a decline in suicide rates in the participating districts.
   Conclusions: The pilot program exhibits promising preliminary results, it is interesting to examine the difference in participation between different ethnic groups. Since the sample size is small, there is a need to continue the program on a larger scale. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE lethality; suicide terrorism; terrorism
ID BOMBERS; LOGIC
AB Many scholars have assumed that suicide terrorism is the most lethal form of terrorism. Increasing lethality is important for the terrorists' expected ability to coerce target states and may explain the increasing popularity of suicide terrorism since the 1980s. This article analyses statistically the lethality of suicide terrorism and suicide bombings with 96,649 terror incidents in the Global Terrorism Database. The results corroborate the hypothesis that suicide terrorism inflicts more casualties than other terrorist tactics. However, suicide bombings are not associated with a greater increase in the casualty rates as compared with non-suicidal terrorist tactics involving, for example, the use of firearms. Moreover, neither suicide terrorism in general nor suicide bombings in particular are associated with an increase in the count of dead when there are many soft targets to choose from, such as in Palestine and Afghanistan. The lethality of suicide bombings is the greatest when there are many hard targets, such as in Israel.

AB Social scientists have explained the rise of suicide bombing since the early 1980s by focusing on the characteristics of suicide bombers, the cultural matrix in which they operate, and the strategic calculations they make to maximize their gains. We offer an alternative approach that emphasizes the interaction between Palestinian suicide bombings and Israeli government actions, analyzing the motivations, organizational rationales and precipitants for the 138 suicide bombings that took place in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza between October 2000 and July 2005. Using several sources, including Arabic newspapers, we find that much of the impetus for Palestinian suicide bombing can be explained by the desire to retaliate against Israeli killings of Palestinians; and that much of the impetus for Israeli killings of Palestinians can be explained by the desire to retaliate for suicide bombings.

AB Objectives: To establish the lifetime prevalence rates of suicide ideations, plans and attempts, and to identify the conditional risks of suicide attempts following the prior onset of suicide ideation or planning. Method: A representative sample extracted from the National Population Register of non-institutionalized residents, aged 21 or older, were interviewed at home between May 2003 and April 2004 using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview which included questions on suicide ideations, plans and attempts The final sample included 4,859 respondents. Results: About 5.5% of the adults reported that they have thought of suicide, and 1.4% that they have attempted to commit suicide during their lifetime. The year following the onset of ideation constitutes the year of highest risk for suicide attempt. Conclusion: The risk of suicide attempt is highest among individuals with mental health disorders, while the transition from suicide ideation to suicide attempt among them is more likely to be planned. The youngest age group has the highest odds of suicide attempts and the highest odds of impulsive suicide attempts.

AB It has been suggested that Protestant culture has become more tolerant towards suicide in the previous century, while Jewish culture has traditionally not condoned suicide. There have been reports that suicide rates are somewhat lower among Jews than among people of Protestant background. We asked whether there were differences between Jews' and Protestants' beliefs about suicide that might relate to these suggestions and reports. Beliefs about suicide were assessed from the Reasons For Living Inventory (RFL), and with questions about the acceptability of suicide in some circumstances. Self-reported suicide ideation and attempts were also assessed. Some religious-cultural differences were found in beliefs about suicide, but not with regard to ideation and behavior. We discussed the relations between differences in belief, and reported differences in suicide prevalence, and suggested that most of the belief differences were consistent with reported patterns of prevalence. Notably, Jews believed more strongly than Protestants that moral-religious objections to suicide were reasons for living, and that suicide was less acceptable in certain circumstances.

AB This article presents the findings of a study on the impact of parental suicide on the surviving children, undertaken in Israel in 1999 by a researcher who is herself a survivor of parental suicide. The method employed was qualitative and in-depth interviews which were analyzed inductively. It was found that parental suicide is a significant event with lasting effects on the children. At the same time, survivors strive to overcome its impact by regaining control over their lives as adults. It was found that the manner in which suicide is perceived by its survivors must be viewed within the Israeli social context as it relates to the specific manner in which death and bereavement are dealt with within that society.

AB This article presents the findings of a study about the impact of parental suicide on the surviving children, undertaken in Israel in 1999 by a researcher who is a suicide survivor herself The method employed was qualitative, and in-depth interviews were analyzed inductively. It was found that parental suicide is a meaningful event for the children, and its impact lasts for many years. At the same time, survivors wish to overcome this impact by regaining control over their lives as adults. It was found that the way suicide is perceived by its survivors is socially and contextually related and had to do with the character of the Israeli state and the way death and bereavement are perceived in it.

AB This paper presents an analysis of data of suicide terrorism attacks (167 case studies) which were carried out by terrorist organizations in the period 1993-2008, in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A description of these events is used as a key to understand a unique Israeli phenomenon, that of the direct influence of terror attacks on internal Israeli politics. In this paper, we will examine the case studies with the help of two methodological approaches. The first, the positivistic approach, will help us to expose the official narrative of the events, namely, the chronological history of the case studies as portrayed in books and in the Israeli mass media. Then, with the help of the interpretive approach, we will show the alternative narrative which represents an attempt to decipher the phenomenon of the Israeli national symbols.

AB Anorexia Nervosa (AN) usually follows a prolonged course accompanied by significant morbidity and high mortality. AN patients have been found to have elevated and attempted suicide rates, with suicide being the second most common cause of death in AN after the complications of the disorder itself. The suicide risk in AN is similar to that in major depression or conduct disorder and linked mainly to longer duration of illness, lower weight, bingeing and purging, impulsivity-related manifestations, comorbid substance abuse, and affective disorder. This paper reviews suicidal tendency and disturbed body image, death and eating disorders, and attachment and death with clinical implications related to AN.

AB Background: There have been very few prospective studies of death by suicide in the general population. Rather, studies of suicide have generally used psychological autopsies, a method that has the potential weakness of recall bias. Aims: To examine correlates of death by suicide among a community-based nonclinical sample prospectively assessed years before death by suicide. Method: We analyzed data from an epidemiological study of a 10-year birth cohort (n = 4,914) conducted in Israel in the 1980s, with follow-up mortality data over 25 years. Results: Eight participants died by suicide during follow-up (6/100,000 per year; mean follow-up to suicide = 18.3 +/- 2.0 years), the majority of whom were rated as functioning relatively well at baseline. Male sex, psychiatric hospitalizations, major depressive disorder, and previous suicide attempts were associated with later suicide. Conclusion: In this nonclinical sample of persons assessed between ages 25 and 34, several correlates of suicide were identified, but the majority of persons who died by suicide were relatively high functioning at baseline. Major precursors of suicide may be more proximal factors of acute or chronic negative changes in life circumstances.

ID NEWSPAPER STORIES
AB Portrayals of suicide in the media are controversial because they may impact on suicide rates and methods. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of the broadcast of a television documentary wherein an adolescent girl is interviewed about her suicide plan and subsequently dies by suicide. National suicide rates during the 8 weeks prior to the program and the 4 weeks following it were compared to the same periods in the previous year. There was no significant difference in the rates of completed and attempted suicides before and after the program. There was a shift toward the method used in the film after the broadcast, but it was found to be nonspecific to that year. A significant decrease was noted in the mean age of suicide attempters in the last promotional week prior to the broadcast compared to the previous year (p = .032). These preliminary findings suggest that the repeated televised promotion of a documentary on suicide may raise the risk of suicide in vulnerable populations. Further investigations in bigger populations are needed.

AB The relationship between traumatic events and suicide risk is well known. Most researches agree that Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) plays a major role in this link. However, less is known about the specific posttraumatic symptom constellation that predicts suicide risk. In the current study we examined the posttraumatic symptom's profile which is associated with suicide risk, in a community sample of men with no known psychopathology. The research population included 103 men aged 25-45. They were administered the 'Traumatic Event Questionnaire', PTSD Scale', 'Suicide Risk Scale' (SRS) and the SCL-90. Results indicated that suicide risk was predicted by high levels of depression and hostility. High levels of arousal symptom and low levels of avoidance added a significant contribution to that prediction, suggesting that avoidance may serve as a buffer against suicide risk, while high levels of arousal may increase suicide risk. These findings may serve mental health professionals to identify high-risk persons also in a non-clinical population. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To examine variations in rates of inpatient suicide and clinical risk factors for this phenomenon.
   Method: The National Israeli Psychiatric Hospitalization Case Registry was used to study inpatient suicide. Clinical risk factors for inpatient suicide were examined in a nested case control design.
   Results: Between 1990 and 2013 there were 326 inpatient suicides, at an average of one inpatient suicide per 1614 admissions. A significant decline in rates of suicide per admission over time (p < 0.001) was associated with a reduced number of beds (p < 0.001) and a decline in nationwide suicide rates (p = 0.001). Clinical risk factors for inpatient suicide were: affective disorders (OR = 5.95), schizoaffective disorder (OR = 5.27), schizophrenia (OR = 3.82), previous suicide attempts (OR = 2.59), involuntary hospitalization (OR = 1.67), and more previous hospitalizations (OR = 1.16,). A multivariate model with sensitivity of 27.3% and specificity of 95.3% for inpatient suicide, showed a positive predictive value of 0.4%.
   Conclusions: The absolute number and rates of inpatient suicide per admission have decreased over time, probably due to the decreased number of beds lowering total time at risk. Patients with affective and psychotic disorders and with previous suicide attempts have the greatest risk of inpatient suicide. However, clinical characteristics do not enable identification of patients who are at risk for suicide. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Scholars have expressed doubts about the ability of counterterrorism to cope with suicide bombings, resulting in tit-for-tat or loop-like and repetitive violence and counter-violence without meaningful, let alone decisive results for the stronger side. Such skepticism may explain why so much of the recent literature on terrorism and insurgency is focused on the factors motivating the challenger rather than upon the insurgent's capabilities. This article demonstrates the extent to which Israeli offensive measures have reduced considerably the impact of Palestinian violence on the Israeli protagonist corroborating research that counterterrorism should adopt an offensive escalating strategy against the insurgent.

AB The aim of the study was to discover whether there are differences in suicide tendency in cancer patients during the various stages of the illness, i.e., diagnosis, adjuvant chemotherapy, and recurrence. The patients were being treated at two oncological medical centers in northern Israel. No statistical differences were found between 30 newly diagnosed cancer patients, 51 cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, and 33 cancer patients with recurrence receiving chemotherapy, as measured by the Israeli Index of Potential Suicide (IIPS). The main findings show a correlation between suicide tendency and depression, as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), although not between suicide tendency and hopelessness, as measured by the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS). The findings also indicate statistical differences between the groups in hopelessness and social support: newly diagnosed patients have more symptoms of hopelessness, while patients in recurrence receive more social support than the other two groups.

TI Use of Age-Adjusted Rates of Suicide in Time Series Studies in Israel
SO ISRAEL JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY AND RELATED SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID INTEGRATION
AB Durkheim's modified theory of suicide was examined to explore how consistent it was in predicting Israeli rates of suicide from 1965 to 1997 when using age-adjusted rates rather than crude ones. In this time-series study, Israeli male and female rates of suicide increased and decreased, respectively, between 1965 and 1997. Conforming to Durkheim's modified theory, the Israeli male rate of suicide was lower in years when rates of marriage and birth are higher, while rates of suicide are higher in years when rates of divorce are higher, the opposite to that of Israeli women. The corrected regression coefficients suggest that the Israeli female rate of suicide remained lower in years when rate of divorce is higher, again the opposite suggested by Durkheim's modified theory. These results may indicate that divorce affects the mental health of Israeli women as suggested by their lower rate of suicide. Perhaps the "multiple roles held by Israeli females creates suicidogenic stress" and divorce provides some sense of stress relief, mentally speaking. The results were not as consistent with predictions suggested by Durkheim's modified theory of suicide as were rates from the United States for the same period nor were they consistent with rates based on "crude" suicide data. Thus, using age-adjusted rates of suicide had an influence on the prediction of the Israeli rate of suicide during this period.

AB Background: Bullying and suicidality are serious worldwide problems with negative effects on the young population and therefore international comparisons in this field are of paramount importance.Aims: To analyze the prevalence of bullying and cyberbullying and their association with suicidal behavior among school-aged children in Israel, Lithuania, and Luxembourg. Method: In total, 3,814 15-year-olds from schools in Israel, Lithuania, and Luxembourg were surveyed in the Health Behavior in School-Aged Children (HBSC) cross-national survey in 2013/2014 using standardized anonymous questionnaires. Data analysis employed logistic regression and structural equation modeling (SEM). Results: In all, 6.5% of the adolescents reported being cyberbullied, 15.6% reported being bullied at school. In the previous 12 months, 38.6% reported experiencing emotions that stopped them from doing their usual activities, 17.8% considered attempting suicide, 12.0% made a suicide plan, and 9.5% attempted suicide. Victims of cyberbullying and school bullying had a significantly higher risk of suicidal ideations, plans, and attempts.The SEM analysis confirmed a significant overall effect of bullying on adolescent suicidality.The strongest effect was seen among Israeli students. Limitations: The prevalence estimates were obtained by self-report. Conclusion: The prevalence of adolescent cyberbullying, school bullying, and suicidal behavior is relatively high in Israel, Lithuania, and Luxembourg. Cyberbullying is a strong predictor of adolescent suicidality.

AB Jewish-Israelis of European origin with cancer have higher suicide rates relative to their counterparts in the general population. We investigated whether this effect results from the high proportion of Holocaust survivors among them, due to vulnerabilities arising from the earlier traumas they sustained. The study was based on all Jewish-European persons with cancer, 60years and over, diagnosed in Israel between 1999 and 2007. The standardized incidence ratios were not significantly different between the exposed and nonexposed groups (men: 0.90, 95% CI 0.60-1.19; women: 0.95, 95% CI 0.55-1.37). Past exposure to maximum adversity did not increase the suicide risk among persons with cancer.

AB This article offers a reading of an image of a child dressed in the uniform of a Palestinian suicide bomber that circulated under the name 'The baby bomber'. The author examines both the claims made about the picture by Israeli and Palestinian authorities, and the reception of the image in the Western media. Focusing on the representation of childhood and the representation of suicide, which come together in this image, the article addresses the emphasis on repetition, temporality and threat that marks the reception of the photograph. Linking the image to debates around the pornographic and September 11, the discussion is informed by the work of Derrida, Barthes, Baudrillard and others.

AB This report investigated the potential role of gender in moderating the effects of terror attack exposure on depression symptoms in middle school students from Dimona, Israel (N = 90). Specifically, the effects of three aspects of terror attacks were investigated: physical exposure, relational exposure, and media exposure. Ninety early adolescents were assessed for terror exposure and depression before and after a suicide bombing in a town market. Results indicate that the effects of relational exposure to the suicide bombing-knowing others directly affected by a suicide bombing-on depression symptoms differed by gender. Adolescent girls who knew people affected by the suicide bombing reacted with higher levels of depressive symptoms while similarly exposed adolescent boys did not. It may be that girls, as compared to boys, express greater sympathy for victims, and are hence more vulnerable to disruptions of their social network, resulting in a heightened depressive vulnerability.

AB The experience of mental pain among female suicide attempt survivors is an under-represented topic in suicide research. The present exploratory study examined the mental pain experience among a culturally diverse sample of four female suicide attempt survivors using in-depth interviews. The findings reveal several characteristic of the mental pain experience including despair, hopelessness, and emptiness. Although the participants came from multi-cultural backgrounds and suffered from different psychiatric disorders, similarities were found in the manner in which they described their pain. Results suggest unique characteristics of mental pain are shared across cultures and that mental pain may be distinguished from the psychiatric symptoms of mental disorders. This study evidences the importance of listening to life stories to gain understanding of the mental pain experience and to identify resilience factors that are present in the lives of female suicide attempt survivors interviewed. Implications for treatment intervention and further research are discussed.

   HUMANITY?
SO JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF RELIGIONS AND IDEOLOGIES
LA English
DT Article
DE Suicide attack; Muslim; Islam; Asia; Middle East; Culture
AB Suicide attack has become a dangerous trend in the contemporary history of some Asian societies. While it has been used by some people as a means of protest, it has been largely rejected by humanity for its severe debilitating effects. Instances of suicide attack can be found in the contexts of the Israel-Palestine conflict, September 11 attacks, Bali bombing, Sunni-Shiite disagreement, struggle of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, as well as the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan by foreign powers. The recent contours of suicide attacks are basically largely related to various groups or organizations. The paper therefore examines the meaning, brief history, and the causes of suicide attack, and analyzes these within the purview of contemporary Islamic thought which is based on the textual arguments of the Qur'an and Sunnah. The paper concludes that though a tiny fraction of the whole Muslim spectrum tries to justify the suicide attack as a "weapon of the weak", the majority of the Muslim scholars has viewed it as a crime against humanity and therefore vehemently rejects this practice in any form.

AB Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of the IDF Suicide Prevention Program, implemented since 2006.
   Design: Quasi-experimental (before and after) cohort study.
   Participants: Two cohorts of IDF mandatory service soldiers: the first inducted prior to (1992-2005, n = 766,107) and the second subsequent to (2006-2012, n = 405,252) the launching of the intervention program.
   Exposure: The IDF Suicide Prevention Program is a population-based program, incorporating: reducing weapon availability, de-stigmatizing help-seeking behavior, integrating mental health officers into service units, and training commanders and soldiers to recognize suicide risk factors and warning signs.
   Main outcome measure: Suicide rate and time to suicide in cohorts before and after exposure to the Suicide Prevention Program.
   Results: Trend analysis showed lower suicide rates in the cohort after intervention. The hazard ratio for the intervention effect on time to suicide was 0.44 (95% CI = 0.34-0.56, P<.001) among males. Lower risk was associated with: male gender; born in Israel; higher socio-economic status; higher intelligence score; and serving in a combat unit (HR = 0.43: 95% CI = 0.33-0.55).
   Conclusions: There was a 57% decrease in the suicide rate following the administration of the IDF Suicide Prevention Program. The effect of the intervention appears to be related to use of a weapon, and being able to benefit from improved help-seeking and de-stigmatization. Future efforts should seek to extend the program's prevention reach to other demographic groups of soldiers. The success of the IDF program may inform suicide prevention in other military organizations and in the civilian sector. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Based on Durkheim's 'Control theory,' we explored the association between frequency of terror attacks in Israel and the frequency of suicide attempts admitted to the Emergency Room of a major general hospital in Tel-Aviv (1999-2004). Analysis of the six-year study period as a whole revealed no significant correlation between the variables, with the exception of one 11-month segment within it (December 2000-October 2001) that did show a statistically significant positive correlation, and in opposition to Durkeim's hypothesis. It is suggested that suicide attempts as a phenomena should be seen as a product of a multivariate model, in which the social context plays a role as well.

   Israeli studies from the past two decades were reviewed. Presented are findings on the prevalence of psychological distress and psychiatric disorders as well as on a number of risk factors among FSU immigrants.
   Higher psychological distress and psychiatric morbidity were consistently found among FSU immigrants compared to the Israel-born. Social support was identified as a major stress-mitigating factor in migration. Most studies reveal the persistence of psychological distress among FSU immigrants during the first 5 years following migration, with a risk period around the second and third years following migration.
   Findings from Israel corroborate some findings on immigrants in other countries but as they are limited to a single immigrant population, replication of these studies is necessary.

SP DIW
AB This paper uses daily data to analyse how Israel's stock and foreign exchange markets reacted to 639 terror attacks that took place between 1990 and 2003 in which 1,212 people in Israel were randomly killed and 5,726 people were randomly injured. The data distinguishes acts of terror by location, type of attack, type of target, number of casualties, and the number of attacks per day. Suicide attacks had a permanent effect on both the stock and foreign exchange market, as did the numbers of people injured and killed. Location of a terror attack had no effect on either market. Markets did not become desensitized to terror attacks. Our principal conclusion is that financial markets continued to efficiently perform their economic functions. Also, market-liberalization policies were not disrupted; the conclusions about market efficiency suggest that the market liberalization policies contributed to coping with terror. Although based on data on terror against Israel, the results have broader implications for the Western world because of Israel's democratic regime, its free market, and its well-developed financial markets.

TI Increased risk of attempted suicide among aging holocaust survivors
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID LIFE; DEPRESSION; EXPERIENCE; BEHAVIOR; IDEATION
AB Objective: Suicide rates are higher in elderly persons than in those at other phase of the life-cycle. The majority of World War II (WWII) veterans and Holocaust survivors still define their war experiences as being the "most significant stressor" of their lives. Aging of survivors is frequently associated with depression, reactivation of traumatic syndromes, physical disorders, loss, and psychological distress, possibly increasing the risk of suicide. The aim of the present study was to investigate, among a large cohort of elderly Holocaust survivors, whether their WWII experiences confer an increased risk of suicidal behavior. Methods: All medical records of elderly patients admitted to a psychiatric hospital in Israel during a 5-year period were retrospectively evaluated. Suicidal patients were compared with patients who had not attempted suicide. Results: Of 921 eligible patients, 374 were Holocaust survivors; 135 (14.6%) had attempted suicide in the month before admission. Ninety Holocaust survivors (24%) had attempted suicide, versus 45 of the 502 patients (8.2%) with no WWII experience. The risk of attempted suicide among Holocaust survivors was significantly increased. Conclusion: Although these findings are from a highly selected sample, we suggest that aging Holocaust survivors are at increased risk of attempting suicide. The growth of the elderly population, of whom many had had traumatic life experiences, emphasizes the need to implement preventive strategies so that suicidal risk may be contained.

AB This article examined suicide attempt rates at first psychiatric hospitalization and risk factors for subsequent suicide attempts over the early course of schizophrenia in national population-based data. Data were extracted from the National Psychiatric Hospitalization Case Registry of the State of Israel that contains all first psychiatric admissions with schizophrenia 1989-1992 and were followed up to 1996 (N = 2293). Attempted suicide rates were: 8.5% (n = 196) at the time of first psychiatric hospitalization and 6.6% (n = 151) over the follow-up period of 4 to 7 years. Of those with a suicide attempt at first admission, 31.6% (n = 62) made a subsequent suicide attempt during the follow-up period (OR = 10.44, 95% CIs = 7.22 to 15.09). Risk profiles were derived using recursive partitioning to predict sub-groups at risk of a subsequent suicide attempt. Those characterized by an attempt at the time of first admission were college educated, female and not married (45.9% (17/37), OR = 13.46, 95% CIs = 6.89 to 26.3). The risk profiles together correctly classified 90.7% (137/151) of subsequent suicide attempts. Suicide attempts at first admission and premorbid years of education have long-term prognostic utility and risk profiles are available. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Israel is a small country with a population of around 7 million. The sole EMS provider for Israel is Magen David Adorn (MDA) (translated as 'Red Shield of David'). MDA also carries out the functions of a National Society (similar to the Red Cross) and provides all the blood and blood product services for the country Nationwide, the organisation responds to over 1000 emergency calls a day and uses doctors, paramedics, emergency medical technicians and volunteers. Local geopolitics has meant that MDA has to be prepared for anything from everyday emergency calls to suicide bombings and regional wars.

AB The study examines the influence of the sense of meaning in life, or its absence, on the suicide potential of disadvantaged adolescent girls in Israel who reside in boarding school (n = 50) compared with adolescent girls in a rehabilitation project (n = 31), and between them and normative adolescent girls (n = 128). The research findings indicate a negative relation between meaning in life and suicide potential, which exists only among the normative adolescent girls and the disadvantaged adolescent girls residing in the boarding school. This relation does not exist among the disadvantaged adolescent girls in the rehabilitation project. The explanation for this unusual finding is, apparently, the early stage of rehabilitation at which the adolescent girls are found. In conclusion, this study joins previous studies that propose prevention, intervention, and therapy programs based on increasing adolescent (disadvantaged and not disadvantaged) strength factors by finding meaning to their lives.

DE consultation-liaison psychiatry; suicide attempts; hospitalization
AB Background: Many tertiary hospitals provide psythiatric services that treat diverse clinical situations. Most patients referred to these services following a serious suicide attempt have psychiatric diagnoses, but their unique characteristics and needs are not known.
   Objectives: To examine the files of patients hospitalized in a tertiary hospital in Israel following a serious suicide attempt. Their mental conditions Were determined and their unique demographic and clinical characteristics and needs compared to the Other patients examined by-the psychiatric service.
   Methods: The study roused On 49 consecutive patients admitted after performing a life-threatening suicide attempt. They were compared to 389 non-suicidal patients assessed by the same psychiatric service during one year.
   Results: Neatly half the patients hospitalized following a serious suicide attempt had only an axis II diagnosis (personality disorder). Non-violent methods of suicide were used predominantly by female, and violent methods mainly by Males. All suicide attempts by Muslims used violent methods, while less than half the attempts by Jews were violent. Compared to the non-suicidal patients, the suicide-attempters group was younger and had greater representation of Jewish females and Muslim Males. Compared to the non-suicidal patients, these patients required more intense psychiatric care, earlier commencement of treatment in the course of hospitalization, more psychiatric visits and treatment hours, and more referrals for further care. Several risk factors appear to be associated with a need for more intense in-hospital care and a greater need for referral: Male gender, religion, Method of suicide attempt (violent vs. non-violent), and the existence of a psychiatric diagnosis.
   Conclusions: Suicide-attempt patients who are in need of hospitalization for further medical treatment have unique clinical characteristics and require more intense treatment provided by the Consultation-Liaison Unit.

   models to explain suicide attacks in Iraq
SO STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM
LA English
DT Article
ID TERRORISM
AB Scholars have developed several rationalist explanations for the use of suicide attacks by terrorist organizations. Using evidence from Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Sri Lanka, Chechnya, and Turkey, these authors have created plausible and rational models for attacks, which many consider to be irrational. Although the conflict in Iraq has, by most accounts, experienced more suicide bombings than any other struggle, its contemporary nature has made research and analysis on the subject difficult. This article analyzes four of these models and their implications with respect to the events in Iraq. Although the evidence is not conclusive, the data suggests that organizations are not using suicide attacks to (1) gain nationalist objectives, (2) signal strength to a foreign government, or (3)outbid rival organizations, as many scholars suggest. Instead, the evidence suggests that these attacks are used for (1) tactical advantages and (2) to aid the global recruiting effort of Al Qaeda-linked organizations.

AB This study proposes a novel methodology for the study of the mindset, motives, and cognitive style of individual suicide bombers in Israel/Palestine, based on a comprehensive corpus of personal farewell letters (which also serve as last wills) that were written by suicide bombers to their family during the Second Intifada (2000-2006). To avoid privileging certain a priori sentiments, motivations, or concepts over others, I used a programmatic bottom-up sequence of quantitative psycholinguistic procedures, in which prominent themes or concepts from one level of analysis are further qualified and contextualized in the next. This afforded a minimally biased view of the cognitive content of Palestinian suicide bombers, including the sentiments, motivations, and concepts that they were more preoccupied with, and the context in which these ideas were expressed. The results are largely consistent with theories of political violence that place pro-social sentiments at the forefront of the motivations for suicide terrorism, and paramount to antisocial sentiments such as hatred and revenge. Since the linguistic patterns that were uncovered in this analysis cannot be controlled consciously, and the farewell letters of suicide bombers have rarely been rigorously analyzed linguistically, this study may provide an unprecedented glimpse into the cognitive style and content of individual suicide bombersa glimpse that is minimally biased by political, partisan, or sectarian preconceptions.

AB French and American research groups have made us aware in modem time of the fetal alcohol syndrome and the damaging effects on the fetus. In recent years, research has shown its life long consequences on physical development, intellectual development behavior, social development, occupation, independence, sexuality or sexual behavior, and increased risk of suicidality. In this review, we found a higher incidence of mental health problems in this population. The only study conducted on suicidal behavior found that fetal alcohol syndrome population had a ten times higher lifetime rate of suicide attempt than the general population. Primary prevention is the obvious intervention, but public health efforts have not been effective, therefore it is important that professionals working with this population also become aware of the risk for suicidal behavior.

AB Background: In the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) as well as in most armies throughout the world, the leading cause of death during peace-time is suicide. This study examines emotional regulation of mental pain as a contributor to suicidal ideation in soldiers.
   Methods: One hundred sixty-eight IDF soldiers (aged 18-21 years, 59% males) completed the following self-report questionnaires: Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI); Orbach & Mikulincer Mental Pain Scale (OMMP); and Emotional Regulation of Mental Pain questionnaire. Participants were divided into 3 groups: soldiers who attempted suicide (AS group, n = 58), soldiers under treatment by a mental health professional and reporting no suicidal behavior (PT group, n = 58), and controls (C group, n = 50).
   Results: Suicide ideation, mental pain, and low emotional regulation were significantly higher in the suicidal group as compared to the two other groups (P < 0.001). Mental pain was significantly related to more suicide ideation in soldiers with low ability to regulate mental pain (P < .001 for the interaction).
   Conclusion: Emotional regulation of mental pain moderates the link between mental pain and suicide ideation. Soldiers with high mental pain and low regulation of mental pain exhibited higher suicidal ideation. These findings may assist in planning prevention programs in the army and similar settings.

DT Article
ID IMPULSIVITY; PREDICTORS; NICOTINE
AB Background: Recent epidemiological studies have reported a world-wide increase in the rates of alcohol use among adolescents. Research has shown a strong link between alcohol abuse and psychiatric disorders. This study explored the clinical and demographic correlates of adolescents with a history of alcohol abuse (AA) compared to adolescents with no history of alcohol abuse (NAA) among a group of adolescent psychiatric inpatients in Israel.
   Method: Two hundred and thirty-eight subjects were screened, all were patients consecutively admitted to an adolescent inpatient unit at a university-affiliated mental health center in Israel during a 4-year period
   Result: Patients in the AA group were more prone to have a history of suicide attempts and self-injury compared to patients in the NAA group. Prevalence of attention-deficit disruptive behavior disorders was more common in the AA group, and these patients were more prone to have a history of criminal activity and drug use. Median length of hospitalization was greater in the NAA group.
   Limitations: Limitations concerning attribution of causality due to the cross-sectional nature of this study.
   Conclusion: Higher prevalence of criminal behavior, self-injury and suicide attempts associated with alcohol abuse may be related to higher levels of impulsivity, indicated by higher prevalence of attention-deficit disruptive behavior disorders. Alcohol-related disorders should be carefully screened and addressed in adolescent psychiatric units and in consequent ambulatory treatment settings.

AB Background: Suicide is the leading cause of death in most armies during peace-time. The recent dramatic rise in suicides in the US Army further focuses attention on the causes of suicidal behavior in the military.
   Methods: This study investigated demographic characteristics, psychological profile and stress-related risk factors associated with suicide attempts in Israelis aged 18-21 years, who served in the Army in 2009. Soldiers who attempted suicide (N=60) were compared to soldiers treated by a mental health professional, but reported no suicidal behavior (N=58), and to controls (N=50).
   Results: Suicide attempters had lower socioeconomic status and less cognitive ability compared with treated soldiers and untreated control soldiers. Only 25% of the suicide attempters had received mental healthcare prior to the attempt. The majority of the attempts were non-lethal (86.2%), and only 5.2% used firearms. Attempters had more previous suicide attempts (37.9%) and deliberate selfharm incidents (19.3%), compared to almost no such behaviors in the other two groups. Following the suicide attempt, 77% were diagnosed with moderate to severe mental disorders, 44.8% personality disorders and 8.6% mood disorders. Attempters reported higher levels of general stress compared to their peers in the other two groups. Being away from home and obeying authority were especially more stressful in attempters.
   Conclusions: Young soldiers are less prone to seek mental health assistance, despite suffering from higher levels of stress. Screening is required to detect soldiers at risk for suicidal behavior and preventive intervention will require active outreach. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE human development; suicide; public health; holistic medicine; Denmark;
   Israel
AB Suicide has been honoured and respected in the Eastern culture, especially in Japan, with the famous tradition of Hara-kiri, or seppuku, while in most western societies suicide has been seen negatively. Many contemporary physicians tend to consider suicide the most self-destructive and evil thing a human being can do and something that should be avoided at all cost. Religions also have different viewpoints on suicide, but from a philosophical point of view we believe that considering the choice of life and death to be extremely relevant for a good living. The choice of life and dead is real, since responsibility for life is necessary in order to live life. Even the best physician cannot keep a patient alive who deep inside wants to die. In this chapter, we present parts of a story of a young girl who had experienced childhood sexual abuse. In holistic existential therapy, it is our experience that when the patient is well supported in the confrontation of the fundamental questions related to assuming responsibility for the coherence, that this confrontation will then almost always lead to a big YES to life. Without confronting the fundamental question of "to be or not to be", life can never be chosen 100% and thus never be lived fully.

ID MENTAL-HEALTH; MIGRATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; IMMIGRANTS; SYMPTOMS; CULTURE
AB In the last few decades, the State of Israel has become a target for work migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and victims of human trafficking, as part of the trend of world immigration. Immigration is a process of loss and change with significant socio-psychological stress, with possible effects on the immigrants' mental health. The Physicians for Human Rights - Israel (PHR) Association operates a psychiatric clinic as part of the Open Clinic for Work Migrants and Refugees. This article will present major clinical issues regarding psychiatry and immigration in Israel according to the data collected at the clinic. Trauma and stress-related psychopathology was found to have a high prevalence in immigrant patients treated at the clinic; prevalence of PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) in immigrants was high (23%) and even higher in refugees (33%). Female immigrants are at higher risk for psychiatric hospitalization. The relative rate of African patients at the clinic is significantly higher than patients from other continents. A significant association was found between psychiatric hospitalization and suicide attempts.
   Immigrant patients present a combination of psychiatric, socio-economic and general medical conditions, which demands a holistic view of the patient. The evaluation of an immigrant patient must take into account the stress related to immigration, gender, culture of origin and the risk for suicide and hospitalization. Treatment recommendations include awareness of cultural diversities, acquiring information regarding the pre-immigration history, preferably using cultural consultants with background in the immigrants' culture and community. Decision-making about medication and diagnostic evaluation should be as inexpensive as possible. Basic human needs (food, shelter) and family support should be included in the decisions about treatment.

AB Suicide is one of the leading causes of death today in the Western world, and most people have had suicidal ideation at some time during their life. In the population of persons with intellectual disability, some researchers have thought that impaired intellectual capacity could act as a buffer to suicidal behavior, but the fact is that the few studies conducted in that population contest this assumption and show that the characteristics of suicidality in this population are very similar to persons without intellectual disability. This paper reviews the studies conducted and describe the symptomatology in this population. Professionals working with this population should, therefore, be aware of and assess for this behavior. Sadness, or depression, are symptoms that could indicate later suicidal behavior.

AB Purpose: To study the incidence and outcome of intentional injuries requiring emergency room (ER) care among children and adolescents in a national sample.
   Method: The population included 0- to 17-year-olds who presented to the ER for injuries in 23 hospitals over a 1-year period. A 6% to 9% random sample of days was selected in each hospital, and for each selected day the relevant ER record was reviewed for cause, nature, and outcome of injuries and sociodemographic information.
   Results: The annual incidence for intentional injuries resulting in ER visits was 19.6 in 10,000 children and adolescents aged 0 to 17 [95% confidence interval (CI) 17.4-21.8 in 10,000]. Fights/assaults constituted 54.1% of the presentations, abuse and rape, 10.3%, and self-inflicted injuries, 10.8%. Overall rates were higher among 10- to 17 year olds than at younger ages. The rates were higher among boys than girls for fights/assaults and abuse, whereas attempted suicide and rape were three times higher among girls than boys. Nearly twice as many Jewish children and adolescents presented to the ER for intentional injuries than Arab children and adolescents, with the ratio becoming even greater for attempted suicide.
   Of all the intentionally injured, 21.7% were hospitalized. The mortality rate was 1.1 in 100,000 (95% CI = .7-1.7/100,00) with no significant gender difference ob-served. No cases of suicide were reported for the Arab population.
   Conclusions: Adolescents aged 10 years and older are at higher risk for intentional injuries than younger children. The ethnic differences evident in this study, especially for attempted and completed suicide, may be real or the result of differential disclosure of information owing to sociocultural norms or differential recording by health professionals.

AB OBJECTIVE. Terrorism is the war of our time, and terrorists push their demands in many ways, leading to great diversity in the number and type of injuries and casualties. Between September 2000 and January 2005, Israel experienced 136 suicide attacks.
   CONCLUSION. We have reviewed the imaging procedures performed on victims of suicide bomber terror attacks that occurred during this period. We have studied the injury patterns encountered in such attacks, their mechanisms, and the dilemmas arising from them. To deal with such multiple trauma events more efficiently, we have established a multidisciplinary trauma team in which radiologists play a major role.

AB Background: Following a suicide bombing attack, scores of victims suffering from a combination of blast injury, penetrating injury, and bums are brought to local hospitals.
   Objective: To identify external signs of trauma that would assist medical crews in recognizing blast lung injury (BLI) and effectively triaging salvageable and non-salvageable victims.
   Design: Retrospective analysis of all 15 suicide bombing attacks that occurred in Israel from April 1994 to August 1997.
   Setting: National survey.
   Patients: One hundred fifty-three victims died and 798 were injured as a result of 15 attacks. Medical records were reviewed for external signs of trauma, such as burns and penetrating injuries, and the presence of BLI.
   Main Outcome Measure: The odds ratio for BLI and death.
   Results: Three settings were targeted: buses, semiconfined spaces, and open spaces. Sixty survivors (7.5%) suffered from BLI, which was more common in buses (37 of 260) than serniconfined spaces (14 of 279) and open spaces (9 of 259) (P <.001). Victims with BLI were more likely to suffer from penetrating injury to the head or torso, burns covering more than 10% of the body surface area, and skull fractures (odds ratios, 4, 11.6, and 55.8, respectively; P <.001). Victims who died at the scene were more likely to suffer from burns, open fractures, and amputations in comparison with survivors (odds ratios, 6.5, 18.6, and 50.1, respectively;, P <.001).
   Conclusions: Following a suicide bombing attack, external signs of trauma should be used to triage victims to the appropriate level of care both at the scene and in the hospital. Triage of salvageable and nonsalvageable victims should take into account the presence of amputations, burns, and open fractures.

TI Suicide bombing as a strategic weapon: An empirical investigation of

LA English

ID POLITICS
AB Using twice-yearly data from 1991 to 2003, it;e analyse the incidents of suicide attacks by Hamas and Islamic Jihad within Israel and the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Given the exploratory nature of the question, we have first estimated the relevant coefficients by using a Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Ratio and then checked their robustness by reestimating the model with the help of a Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) as an interrelated system. The results indicate that the two groups deliberately use suicide bombings as strategic weapons within the larger Israeli-Palestinian political milieu. With the Western world locked in an armed struggle with the militant extremists of Islam based on millenarian ideologies, this study emphasizes the need to develop appropriate analytical capabilities to distinguish among terrorist groups and their motivations, ideologies, and tactics.

AB The association between Holocaust experience, suicide, and psychiatric hospitalization has not been unequivocally established. The aim of this study was to determine the risk of suicide among 3 Jewish groups with past or current psychiatric hospitalizations: Holocaust survivors (HS), survivors of pre-Holocaust persecution (early HS), and a comparison group of similar European background who did not experience Holocaust persecution. In a retrospective cohort study based on the Israel National Psychiatric Case Register (NPCR) and the database of causes of death, all suicides in the years 1981-2009 were found for HS (n=16,406), early HS (n=1,212) and a comparison group (n=4,286). Age adjusted suicide rates were calculated for the 3 groups and a logistic regression model was built to assess the suicide risk, controlling for demographic and clinical variables. The number of completed suicides in the study period was: HS233 (1.4%), early HS34 (2.8%), and the comparison group64 (1.5%). Age adjusted rates were 106.7 (95% CI 93.0-120.5) per 100,000 person-years for HS, 231.0 (95% CI 157.0-327.9) for early HS and 150.7 (95% CI 113.2-196.6) for comparisons. The regression models showed significantly higher risk for the early HS versus comparisons (multivariate model adjusted OR=1.68, 95% CI 1.09-2.60), but not for the HS versus comparisons. These results may indicate higher resilience among the survivors of maximal adversity compared to others who experienced lesser persecution.

   CASUALTIES; SURVIVORS; INJURIES
AB Objective: To review the experience of a large-volume trauma center in managing and treating casualties of suicide bombing attacks.
   Summary Background Data: The threat of suicide bombing attacks has escalated worldwide. The ability of the suicide bomber to deliver a relatively large explosive load accompanied by heavy shrapnel to the proximity of his or her victims has caused devastating effects.
   Methods: The authors reviewed and analyzed the experience obtained in treating victims of suicide bombings at the level I trauma center of the Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem, Israel from 2000 to 2003.
   Results: Evacuation is usually rapid due to the urban setting of these attacks. Numerous casualties are brought into the emergency department over a short period. The setting in which the device is detonated has implications on the type of injuries sustained by Survivors. The injuries sustained by victims of suicide bombing attacks in semi-confined spaces are characterized by the degree and extent of widespread tissue damage and include multiple penetrating wounds of varying severity and location, blast injury, and bums.
   Conclusions: The approach to victims of suicide bombings is based on the guidelines for trauma management. Attention is given to the moderately injured, as these patients may harbor immediate life-threatening injuries. The concept of damage control can be modified to include rapid packing of multiple soft-tissue entry sites. Optimal utilization of manpower and resources is achieved by recruiting all available personnel, adopting a predetermined plan, and a centrally coordinated approach. Suicide bombing attacks seriously challenge the most experienced medical facilities.

AB The objective of this research was to classify the deaths of 98 victims of suicide in Tel Aviv, Israel between the years 2007 and 2010. This was done by examining background features and clinical characteristics among suicide completers with histories of a prior psychiatric hospitalization using logistic regression modeling. 34% of the sample (33/98) was given at least one psychiatric diagnosis upon discharge from a prior psychiatric hospitalization. Throughout their lifetime, those with psychiatric diagnoses were significantly more likely to have histories of mental health treatment (psychotherapy and psychotropic medication), psychopathology and suicidality among family members, prior suicide attempts and familial or emotional crisis as compared with those without a psychiatric diagnosis. During their last life phase, those with prior psychiatric diagnoses were also significantly more likely to have received psychotherapeutic treatment, expressed a lack of desire to live and presented with affective symptoms (e.g. depression, anxiety, adaptation difficulty and nervousness) as compared with those without such histories. Thus, focusing on high risk populations, such as those with psychiatric illnesses and deciphering the role of mental health treatment, familial predisposition, prior suicide attempt and sub-clinical symptoms in relation to suicide can inform future prevention practices.

AB To examine the association between the extent of genocide exposure and subsequent suicide risk among Holocaust survivors.
   Persons born in Holocaust-exposed European countries during the years 1922-1945 that immigrated to Israel by 1965 were identified in the Population Registry (N = 209,429), and followed up for suicide (1950-2014). They were divided into three groups based on likely exposure to Nazi persecution: those who immigrated before (indirect; n = 20,229; 10%), during (partial direct; n = 17,189; 8%), and after (full direct; n = 172,061; 82%) World War II. Groups were contrasted for suicide risk, accounting for the extent of genocide in their respective countries of origin, high (> 70%) or lower levels (< 50%). Cox model survival analyses were computed examining calendar year at suicide. Sensitivity analyses were recomputed for two additional suicide-associated variables (age and years since immigration) for each exposure group. All analyses were adjusted for confounders.
   Survival analysis showed that compared to the indirect exposure group, the partial direct exposure group from countries with high genocide level had a statistically significant (P < .05) increased suicide risk for the main outcome (calendar year: HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.09, 2.90). This effect significantly (P < .05) replicated in two sensitivity analyses for countries with higher relative levels of genocide (age: HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.09, 2.89; years since immigration: HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.14, 3.02). The full direct exposure group was not at significant suicide risk compared to the indirect exposure group. Suicide associations for groups from countries with relative lower level of genocide were not statistically significant.
   This study partly converges with findings identifying Holocaust survivors (full direct exposure) as a resilient group. A tentative mechanism for higher vulnerability to suicide risk of the partial direct exposure group from countries with higher genocide exposure includes protracted guilt feelings, having directly witnessed atrocities and escaped death.

AB Background A reduction in suicide in England and Wales has been reported after the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the USA. it may be plausible therefore to expect a much greater impact on suicide in the UK in response to the events of 7 July 2005, caused by the first suicide terrorist attack by Islamic extremists on British soil.
   Aims To examine the effect of the 7 July 2005 terrorist attacks in London on suicide rates in England and Wales.
   Method Analysis of number of suicide (ICD-10 codes X60-X84) and undetermined injury deaths (ICD-10 codes Y10-Y34) reported in England and Wales in the 12 weeks before and after 7 July 2005. We used Shewhart Control Charts based on Poisson rates to explore adjusted daily and weekly suicide rates and rate differences with respect to 7 July 2005.
   Results A brief but significant reduction in daily suicide rate was observed a few days after the terrorist attack in London on 7 July 2005. Further reduction was also observed on the 21 July 2005, coinciding with the second wave of attacks. No similar reduction in suicide was seen during the same period in the previous 4 years. Poisson regression models with indicator variables for each day in July 2005 revealed a reduction of 40% of the expected daily rate for these 2 days only. We found no evidence of any longer-term effect on suicide.
   Conclusions The study findings are contrary to our expectation and only weakly support Durkheim's theory that periods of national threat lower the suicide rate through the impact on social cohesion. it is possible that previous experience of IRA terrorism in the UK may have limited the effect of the 7 July 2005 attacks on suicide in England and Wales. The shock value of suicide terrorism and its psychological potency appear to diminish over time as the tactic becomes overused.

DE Terrorism; Economics of religion; Club goods; Public goods; Insurgency;
   Sects; Middle East; Suicide attacks; Development economics
AB Can rational models, once theological explanations are discredited, explain why certain radical religious rebels are so successful in perpetrating suicide attacks? The fundamental barrier to success turns out not to be recruiting suicide attackers; there is a rational basis for volunteering. Rather, the barrier is the danger of other operatives defecting. A club model, portraying voluntary religious organizations as efficient providers of local public goods, explains how they weed out potential defectors by requiring sacrifices as signals of commitment. They are thereby able to succeed in risky terrorist attacks. The model has testable implications for tactic choice and damage achieved by clubs and other rebel organizations. Data spanning a half-century on both terrorists and civil war insurgents, much from Middle East sources and Israel/Palestine, reveal that: a) missions organized by radical religious clubs that provide benign local public goods are both more lethal and are more likely to be suicide attacks than missions organized by other terrorist groups with similar aims and theologies; and b) suicide attacks are chosen when targets are "hard," i.e., difficult to destroy. Our results suggest benign tactics to counter radical religious terrorism and insurgency. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rational choice approaches to reducing terrorist violence would suggest raising the costs of terrorism through punishment, thereby reducing the overall expected utility of terrorism. In this article, we argue that states should also consider raising the expected utility of abstaining from terrorism through rewards. We test effects of repressive (or punishing) and conciliatory (or rewarding) actions on terrorist behavior using the newly developed GATE-Israel dataset, which identifies events by Israeli state actors toward Palestinian targets on a full range of counterterrorism tactics and policies from 1987 to 2004. Results show that repressive actions are either unrelated to terror or related to subsequent increases in terror, and conciliatory actions are generally related to decreases in terror, depending on the tactical period. Findings also reveal the importance of understanding the role of terrorists' constituencies for reducing violence.

AB Purpose To explore how oncologists, oncology nurses, and oncology social workers perceive suicidality (suicidal ideation, suicidal acts, and completed suicides) in patients with cancer that they are in contact with. Methods The grounded theory method of data collection and analysis was used. Sixty-one oncology healthcare professionals from two university-affiliated cancer centers in Israel were interviewed. Results The findings resulted in three main categories that included perceptions of suicidality, explanatory models of suicidality, and moral views on suicide. Healthcare professionals considered suicidality in their patients to be a cry for help, a sign of distress, or an attempt at attention seeking. Participants explained suicidality as stemming from a biological disease, from mental illness, as an aberration, or as an impulsive, irrational act. Moral views on suicidality were split among those who were mostly accepting of these patients' actions versus those who rejected it outright. A third group of healthcare professionals expressed ambivalence about suicidality in their patients. Conclusions Healthcare professionals vary greatly in their perceptions on suicide. Some view the act as part of a patient's choice and autonomy while others view it negatively. Healthcare providers should receive support in handling patient's suicidality.

AB OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to present an example of a non-U.S. lawsuit in which a radiologist was found negligent in the case of a psychiatric patient who died by suicide after reading a radiology report sent directly to him.
   CONCLUSION. Although the lawsuit and its outcome do not influence laws in the United States or any country other than the one in which the case was tried, it should stimulate the radiologic community into giving serious thought to the format and manner in which reports of radiologic examinations are communicated to patients.

AB Objectives: (1) To compare the outcome of adolescent subjects who have made a suicide attempt with the outcome of matched controls, using their psychological and psychometric screening tests for military service at age 16.5 years. Their subsequent performance during military service between ages 18 and 21 was also evaluated. (2) To compare the prognosis of those attempters who received intensive psychiatric inpatient evaluation in a general hospital with the prognosis of those who received emergency room treatment only Method: The computerized military records of 216 adolescents, who had been treated between 1987 and 1988 for attempted suicide in a general hospital emergency room, prior to their induction into the army, were evaluated. They were rated on the following tests: cognitive/educational performance and psychosocial adaptation, psychiatric and psychological health diagnoses, and performance during their military service between 1989 and 1992. Results: Although the female attempters had slightly more problems in the military than the controls, their overall prognosis was surprisingly good. The male suicide attempters did very poorly in their subsequent military service. There was no long-term advantage in having had a psychiatric evaluation performed in a hospital over a brief emergency room evaluation. Most differences between attempters and controls were in service performance, rather than in cognitive and psychometric tests. Conclusions: There may be marked differences between the sexes in the significance of attempted suicide and in the indications for intervention. The policy of mandatory general hospitalization for suicide attempters; may need reevaluation.

ID CONSEQUENCES; GROWTH
AB The literature on conflict and terrorism has paid little attention to the economic costs of terrorism for the perpetrators. This article aims to fill that gap by examining the economic costs of harboring suicide terror attacks. Using data covering the universe of Palestinian suicide terrorists during the second Palestinian uprising, combined with data from the Palestinian Labor Force Survey, the authors identify and quantify the impact of a successful attack on unemployment and wages. They find robust evidence that terror attacks have important economic costs. The results suggest that a successful attack causes an increase of 5.3 percent in unemployment, increases the likelihood that the district's average wages fall in the quarter following an attack by more than 20.0 percent, and reduces the number of Palestinians working in Israel by 6.7 percent relative to its mean. Importantly, these effects are persistent and last for at least six months after the attack.

AB The study examines the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among battered women in Israel and the associated psychological distress. This study inquires into the psychological reactions of battered women in comparison to women who experienced other types of traumas by examining PTSD rates and intensity of psychiatric symptoms and suicide risk. The research sample was comprised of 91 battered women, and the control group was comprised of 82 women who underwent other traumas excluding interpersonal traumas. The participants were administered questionnaires relating to type and intensity of domestic violence, PTSD symptoms, intensity of psychiatric symptoms, and suicide risk. The results showed that 51.6% of the battered women had full PTSD. Battered women exhibited significantly higher levels of psychiatric symptoms than the control group. Battered women who were diagnosed with PTSD scored significantly higher than battered women without PTSD on the same indicator. The findings emphasize the toll and severity of domestic trauma.

AB BACKGROUND: Terrorism leads to adolescent depression, but little is known about protective factors. We investigated 90 adolescents (in grades 7-9) residing in Dimona, Israel, before and after their exposure to a suicide bombing.
   OBJECTIVE: To examine the prospective effect of social support from friends, parents, and school personnel on the link between bombing-related perceived stress and adolescent depression.
   METHODS: Seven months prior to the suicide bombing, adolescents completed questionnaires as part of an ongoing investigation of youth risk/resilience under stress. The focus of the present study was on the Perceived Social Support Scale. One month subsequent to the suicide bombing, participants were interviewed by telephone about their bombing-related perceived stress (a 1-item measure) and depression (the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Child Depression Scale). RESULTS: Bombing-related perceived stress was associated with an increase in continuous levels of depression from before to after the bombing (beta = .29; P = .006). Prebombing social support from friends buffered against this effect (beta = .29; P = .010). Adolescents reporting high bombing-related perceived stress evinced an increase in depression if they reported low levels of friends' support (beta = .61; P < .001) but not high levels of friends' support (beta = .00; P < .98). In addition, social support from friends predicted an increase in adolescent depression over time when bombing-related perceived stress was low (beta = .34; P = .026).
   CONCLUSION: In adolescence, social support from friends might protect against the depressogenic effect of terrorism-related perceived stress. Pediatrics 2009;124:e235-e240

It probes the double effect doctrine as it is relevant to the case at hand and the role of the medical profession and of the family in making decisions at the end of life, and it argues that patients who express a wish to die should receive a comprehensive care assessment that addresses their physical and mental condition before rushing to provide lethal medication. The article concludes by offering some guidelines to help practitioners address the intricate questions they face when patients ask to die.

LA English
DT Article

ID SERVICE ATTENDANCE; MENTAL-DISORDERS; RISK-FACTORS; SAMPLE; ADULTS
AB Objective: Data suggest that adherence to religious beliefs is associated with lower rates of suicide. A number of mediating factors have been hypothesized to explain this association, including enhanced social support, less substance abuse, and lower rates of psychopathology.
   Method: We utilized data from a two-phase population-based, epidemiological study of mental disorders among young Jewish Israel born in a 10-year birth-cohort conducted in the 1980s. This study included data on religiosity and suicidal behaviour. Twenty-five years thereafter, mortality data were obtained from a national vital statistics registry.
   Results: Rates of suicidal ideation were similar among secular, partially observant, and religious subjects (9.4%, 6.7%, and 6.2%, respectively; adjusted OR for linear trend: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.58-1.09). Rates of suicide attempts were significantly lower among religious subjects (2.4%, 2.5%, and 0.4% for secular, partially observant, and religious, respectively; adjusted OR for linear trend: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.43-0.88). Of the 4914 subjects, eight died by suicide: Seven of them were secular and one was partially observant (chi(2) = 2.52, P = 0.09). There were no differences in social functioning or rates of psychopathology among the study groups.
   Conclusion: Religiosity has a protective effect against suicide attempts, which is independent of social functioning, psychopathology, and substance use.

AB Background: Psychotic disorders, as well as psychotic symptoms, are associated with a greater lifetime risk of suicidal behavior (SB). It is not known, however, whether psychotic symptoms are independent predictors for short-term SB. Methods: Data were collected from 201 psychiatric inpatients at Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital. Self-reported psychotic symptoms were assessed using the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Postdischarge SB defined as an aborted, interrupted, or actual suicide attempt was assessed using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), during the 4 to 8 weeks following discharge from an inpatient psychiatric unit (n=127, 63% retention). Logistic regressions were performed to assess the relationships between psychotic symptoms and SB, controlling for primary psychiatric disorders. Results: Self-reported psychotic symptoms were associated with subsequent postdischarge SB. There was no significant difference between the SB versus no SB groups on the basis of primary psychiatric disorder. Self-reported psychotic symptoms remained an independent and significant predictor of postdischarge SB when the analysis controlled for primary psychiatric disorder. Conclusions: These results suggest that psychotic symptoms are a dimensional predictor of near-term postdischarge SB and are a necessary component of suicide risk assessment during inpatient hospitalization, independent of psychiatric diagnosis.

AB The objective of this study is examine the similarities and differences between adolescent suicide completers, adolescents with non-fatal suicidal symptoms, and non-suicidal psychiatric controls in an epidemiologic sample. Using the central Israeli military medical registry, 214 18-21 year old males from the same national service cohort were identified, consisting of 43 consecutive completed suicides and 171 consecutive central psychiatric clinic outpatients presenting with near-fatal suicide attempts, serious suicide attempts, para-suicidal gestures, threats, ideation, or other non-suicidal complaints. Systematic pre-induction and service data were available for all subjects, with detailed postmortem inquest data for suicides. Systematic clinical data, including the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS), Hamilton Depression Scale, and Eysenck Personality Inventory were obtained on all clinic subjects. Major depression was present in half of completers, near-lethal attempters, and ideators, but absent in the other clinic groups, whose commonest diagnosis was adjustment disorder. Depression scores increased across groups with increasing intent; ideators also had high scores. Completers and near-lethal attempters had higher I. Q. and medical fitness ratings and were in more demanding assignments than other groups. Prior attempts were commonest in completers, near-lethal attempters, and gesturers. Disciplinary history, ethnicity, family intactness, immigrant status, and Eysenck Personality Inventory scores did not differentiate the groups. The findings may not be generalizable to female adolescents or to other countries or time periods. The findings thus point to contrasts, as well as similarities, between groups of adolescents with different types of suicidal symptoms.

AB Background: On 4 February 2008, two terrorists armed with suicide bombs arrived at the open market in the southern Israeli city of Dimona. One detonated his bomb at approximately 10:30 a.m. causing multiple casualties. Short-term emotional effects and acute stress reactions usually appear among survivors after such incidents.
   Objectives: To compare the differences in emotions and in disturbances of daily life activities that emerge a couple of days following such an event and to identify patterns of stress development among resilient and low-resilient members of the population in Dimona and in the general population of Israel.
   Methods: A telephone survey of two randomly selected representative samples of adults (428 Israeli residents and 250 Dimona residents) was conducted 2 days after the event.
   Results: A higher prevalence of stress and fear and a lower prevalence of joy were reported among the population of Dimona compared to the general population in Israel (P < 0.05). Differences were also recorded when the population of Dimona was categorized by its personal degree of resilience (P < 0.05). A higher prevalence of disturbances in daily life activities and changes in leisure activity was found in the low-resilient population in Dimona (P < 0.01).
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that following a public terror event, self-reported low-resilient subjects have a higher prevalence of disturbances in daily life activities, as well as adverse emotional responses. These differences must be addressed by the relevant social service agencies for immediate public intervention.

ID SUICIDE BOMBINGS; TERRORISM; PEACE; CYCLE
AB Israeli counterinsurgency doctrine holds that the persistent use of credible threat and disproportionate military force results in repeated victories that eventually teach the enemy the futility of aggression. The doctrine thus endorses classical rational choice theory's claim that narrow cost-benefit calculations shape fixed action rationales. This paper assesses whether Israel's strategic practice reflects its counterinsurgency doctrine by exploring the historical record and the association between Israeli and Palestinian deaths due to low-intensity warfare. In contrast to the expectations of classical rational choice theory, the evidence suggests that institutional, cultural and historical forces routinely override simple cost-benefit calculations. Changing domestic and international circumstances periodically cause revisions in counterinsurgency strategy. Credible threat and disproportionate military force lack the predicted long-term effect.

AB Background: Investigation of causes of death can help inform intervention policy aimed at reducing preventable mortality.
   Objectives: To assess mortality causes and trends over time and identify target groups with excessive mortality rates among Israeli youth aged 10-24, in order to formulate an Intervention policy for prevention of adolescent mortality.
   Methods: Mortality data for Israeli residents aged 10-24 were extracted from the Central Bureau of Statistics computerized death certificate file for the period 1984-95. Trends were evaluated by cause of death and demographic characteristics.
   Results: The crude mortality rate among Israeli youth aged 10-24, during 1993-1995, was 39.6 per 100,000. Rates were 2.7 times higher among males, increased with age, and reached a peak among 18-21 year olds. Rates were 1.4 times higher among Arabs than among Jews. The sharp increase in mortality among Jewish males of military service age (18-21 years) was due mainly to motor vehicle crashes and suicide. Although overall mortality decreased by 9.4% from 1984-86 to 1993-95, the gap between the subgroups increased. MVC-related mortality increased over time by 100% among Arab males. The rate of completed suicide among Jewish males increased by 110%. Although injury-related mortality is lower in Israel compared with the U.S., similar demographic differentials and trends were found in both countries.
   Conclusions: Suicide among Jewish males of military service age, as well as MVC fatalities among Arab males, present a growing public health issue. Intervention strategies should therefore be targeted towards these subgroups in order to minimize the rates of preventable death.

AB This paper focuses on representations by and deployments of the four Palestinian women who during the first four months of 2002 killed themselves in organized attacks against Israeli military personnel or civilians in the Occupied Palestinian Territories or Israel. The paper addresses the manner in which these militant women produced and situated themselves as gendered-political subjects, and argues that their self-representations and acts were deployed by individuals and groups in the region to reflect and articulate other gendered - political subjectivities that at times undermined or rearticulated patriarchal religio-nationalist understandings of gender and women in relation to corporeality, authenticity, and community. The data analysed include photographs, narrative representations in television and newspaper media, the messages the women left behind, and secondary sources.

TI THE CONCEPTUAL TRANSFER OF HUMAN AGENCY TO THE DIVINE IN THE SECOND
   TEMPLE PERIOD: THE CASE OF SAUL'S SUICIDE
SO SHOFAR-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL OF JEWISH STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB King Saul was not only Israel's first monarch, but he was also her first sacrilegious ruler, a point on which the two historiographical books in the Hebrew Bible agree. However, each respective corpus delineates Saul's portrayal in uneven and distinctive representations, varying in theological perspective and emphasis. 1 Samuel presents a complex account of Saul's rise to power and his subsequent fall from divine favor, and culminates with Saul's battlefield suicide. 1 Chronicles, however, shows no interest in Saul's life, but begins and ends with his suicide. Though Chronicles uses the antecedent Samuel as a source, the story of Saul's suicide and its ramifications experience a conceptual metamorphosis, resulting in considerable shifts in the perception of human and divine agency. Relatedly, Chronicles is temporally posterior to Samuel, finding its inception following the Judean restoration in the Second Temple period's postexilic milieu. This paper seeks to uncover these shifts manifested in Chronicles by elucidating each account, highlighting the relationship between human and divine agency. Attention to the shifts yields a different sacrilegious Saul and an altered concept of divine transcendence, both birthed in the cradle of the Judean community in the Second Temple period.

AB Background: Evidence indicates that rates of death by suicide are higher among female inmates compared with male inmates and the general population. Despite the high rate of lifetime suicidality, little is known about the predictors of suicidality for these women.
   Objective: The purpose was to examine sociodemographic, criminological, and psychological variables associated with a history of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among incarcerated women.
   Method: This cross-sectional study investigated a history of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in a sample of 46 Israeli incarcerated women. Participants completed a confidential interview that included the Addiction Severity Index, the Renard Diagnostic Interview, self-report measures of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and the presence of symptoms of depression.
   Results: More than half of the women reported a history of suicidal ideation or attempts. Those who reported such a history were characterized by a high prevalence of childhood victimization, early onset of substance abuse, high prevalence of mental health problems, and high prevalence of mental health problems in the family. Child abuse, depression, and family mental health problems are related to suicidal ideation and attempts in incarcerated women.
   Conclusions: As the number of women with mental health concerns entering prison grows, corrections staff are faced with increasing challenges to provide services that mitigate the risk of death by suicide. Inquiring about childhood abuse and symptoms of depression and mental health problems, as well as providing treatment for the emotional impact of trauma exposure, may reduce the risk of suicidality in this population.

AB This study presents a secondary analysis of real-time data of mobile phone usage in Israel during two recent wars - with the Lebanese Hezbollah in 2006 and with the Palestinian Hamas in Gaza in 2008/9. The data, provided by Cellcom Israel, the country's largest mobile operator, enabled an analysis of real behavior patterns rather than relying on memories of people who may have been under stress or traumatized during the hostilities, hence unable to accurately recollect this information later on. During both wars, significant changes were noted in the way people used their mobile phones: There was a substantial decrease of calls originating from within a 10-kilometer region along the Israel-Lebanon border and mobile users also made significantly longer calls. However, the decrease in calls during the Lebanon War was more than double that of the decrease in the comparable region along the Gaza border. There was no significant change in the calling patterns of Israelis living outside the directly affected regions. These supposed differences in reaction to a crisis situation (which are congruent with previous mobile phone usage studies following suicide bombings) are analyzed, and questions regarding the validity of the myth of solidarity and bonding among Israelis are raised.

AB National legislation, as well as arguments of experts, in Germany and Israel represent opposite regulatory approaches and positions in bioethical debates concerning end-of-life care. This study analyzes how these positions are mirrored in the attitudes of laypeople and influenced by the religious views and personal experiences of those affected. We qualitatively analyzed eight focus groups in Germany and Israel in which laypeople (religious, secular, affected, and non-affected) were asked to discuss similar scenarios involving the withholding or withdrawing of treatment, physician-assisted suicide, and euthanasia. In both countries, respect for patient autonomy and patients' wishes to die with dignity found broad consent. Laypeople argued in favor of accepting such wishes when they were put down in an advance directive. Laypeople in non-religious groups in both countries argued on the basis of a respect for autonomy for the possibility of euthanasia in severe cases but, at the same time, cautioned against its possible misuse. National contrast was apparent in the moral reasoning of lay respondents concerning the distinction between withholding and withdrawing treatment. The modern religious laypeople in Israel, especially, argued strongly, on the basis of the halakhic tradition, against allowing the withdrawal of treatment in accord with a patient's wish. We conclude by discussing the emergent notion of shared responsibility and views of professional responsibility, which we connect through relevant cultural themes such as religion and national culture.

AB Through an analysis of Hamas's suicide missions and Israel's strategy of 'shock and awe', this article advances a concept of 'violent dialogue.' Drawing on Gadamer's work, as well as some of the points that emerge out of the Gadamer-Derrida encounter, this concept is meant to explicate how acts of political violence create a certain type of communion between those engaged in violent conflict. It will suggest that the appearance of political violent acts does not represent the end of a dialogue between the violent actors, but rather the emergence of a specific form of dialogue under the subject matter of violence. It is argued that this communion takes place outside the intentions of the protagonists, and despite their attempts to separate from each other. This is significant for academic analysis of political violence in general, and for our perspective and outlook on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in particular.

ID HAMAS
AB In this paper, I deal with representations of Palestinian women and their experiences with Israeli national security. In particular I explore how the political philosophy of Agamben and feminist psychoanalytic ideas of "abjection" could assist in understanding the nature and flexibility of the power relationships between Palestinian women and the Israeli state. I pay specific attention to moments when women carry out suicide attacks or when pregnant women in labour are forced to give birth at the checkpoint. I argue that, from a Western perspective, pregnant and exploding women's leaky bodily boundary embodies Israeli fears about the leakiness of the border between Israel and Palestine, fears which necessitated the construction of a so-called "security fence" in order to create a hermetic border. As such, I emphasize women's capacity to produce, heighten and dissolve boundaries, bodily and political, thereby advancing a radically different kind of political geography.

   ADOLESCENT SUICIDE; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; CHILD; PROGRAM; PARTICIPATION;
   DEPRESSION
AB Background: There have been only a few reports illustrating the moderate effectiveness of suicide-preventive interventions in reducing suicidal behavior, and, in most of those studies, the target populations were primarily adults, whereas few focused on adolescents. Essentially, there have been no randomized controlled studies comparing the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and cultural adaptability of suicide-prevention strategies in schools. There is also a lack of information on whether suicide-preventive interventions can, in addition to preventing suicide, reduce risk behaviors and promote healthier ones as well as improve young people's mental health.
   The aim of the SEYLE project, which is funded by the European Union under the Seventh Framework Health Program, is to address these issues by collecting baseline and follow-up data on health and well-being among European adolescents and compiling an epidemiological database; testing, in a randomized controlled trial, three different suicide-preventive interventions; evaluating the outcome of each intervention in comparison with a control group from a multidisciplinary perspective; as well as recommending culturally adjusted models for promoting mental health and preventing suicidal behaviors.
   Methods and design: The study comprises 11,000 adolescents emitted from randomized schools in 11 European countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden serving as the scientific coordinating center. Each country performs three active interventions and one minimal intervention as a control group. The active interventions include gatekeeper training (QPR), awareness training on mental health promotion for adolescents, and screening for at-risk adolescents by health professionals. Structured questionnaires are utilized at baseline, 3- and 12-month follow-ups in order to assess changes.
   Discussion: Although it has been reported that suicide-preventive interventions can be effective in decreasing suicidal behavior, well-documented and randomized studies are lacking. The effects of such interventions in terms of combating unhealthy lifestyles in young people, which often characterize suicidal individuals, have never been reported. We know that unhealthy and risk-taking behaviors are detrimental to individuals' current and future health. It is, therefore, crucial to test well-designed, longitudinal mental health-promoting and suicide-preventive interventions by evaluating the implications of such activities for reducing unhealthy and risk behaviors while concurrently promoting healthy ones.

ID RISK
AB This paper addresses some of the complexities surrounding the endeavour to create a protected space for children. Based on an ethnographic account of a kindergarten in a small town in the north of Israel during 2001, it explores notions of vulnerability and danger, protection and exposure, as these found expression in daily life at the kindergarten. The paper describes, and links, two sets of ethnographic data: first, the routine ways in which the teacher constructed the children's bodies as ever vulnerable to harm of all sorts, unless well taken core of; and second, the way in which a suicide bomb attack was presented, and mediated, by the teacher to the children. The paper argues that a close look at these two different stances on death and danger reveals a 'discourse of vulnerability' at the kindergarten.

ID SUICIDE ATTACKS; REPRESSION
AB Previous work on the dynamics of conflicts where we see terrorism has tended to focus on whether we see shifts in attack mode following government countermeasures. We contend that many factors other than counterinsurgency can influence whether groups resort to terrorism, including competition between groups, as well as their relationship to public opinion and other political events. Hence, understanding terrorist tactics in prolonged conflicts with multiple actors requires us to consider a more general framework of innovation, imitation, competition and dependence between actors. We use disaggregated data on terrorist attacks, counterterrorism and public opinion in the Israel-Palestine conflict to jointly evaluate predictions derived from several conventional theories of strategic behaviour. We find that the strategic calculus of Palestinian groups is complex and cannot be treated as time invariant. Our results suggest that factors such as the degree of public support, inter-group competition, the anticipation of countermeasures and non-trivial non-violent payoffs have an observable effect on the strategic behaviour of the Palestinian groups, and that structural relationships are often far from constant over time.

ID PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; LIFE-SUSTAINING TREATMENTS; DECISIONS;
   AUTONOMY
AB Sixteen social workers in Israel were interviewed about their experiences with and attitudes towards various forms of euthanasia, as well as the meanings they ascribe to them. Using phenomenological analysis, seven themes were identified, emphasizing individual, interpersonal, organizational, social and therapeutic considerations, and suggesting a holistic and integrative structure of the phenomenon. The themes were arrived at by identifying distinctions and similarities between different forms of euthanasia. Two themes suggesting similarities were revealed: 'diminishing the value of life' and 'a call for help'. Three themes were found to distinguish between passive euthanasia (withholding and withdrawing life-sustaining treatment) and active forms (active euthanasia and assisted suicide): 'legality', 'social acceptance' and 'concern for the sick and dying'. The last two themes distinguished between withholding treatment and assisted suicide, on the one hand, and withdrawing treatment and active euthanasia, on the other: 'the involvement of others as executor' and 'the publicity of the act'. Further research and training is required to better inform social workers in this ethical area. Given their unique position, social workers should actively participate in legal, social and therapeutic discussions concerning end-of-life decisions, for the benefit of clients, their families and health-care providers.

AB The nature of the ongoing bond maintained by a bereaved person with a deceased one has attracted considerable attention in recent years, but studies have generally been limited to a functional viewpoint which examines only the outcomes of the bond. The current study provides a unique view of the ongoing bond which is maintained by the bereaved with the deceased; the characteristics of this bond are examined. The narratives of nine bereaved Israeli sibling suicide survivors formed the basis for the research. It was carried out on the basis of open, inductive research methodology. The results highlighted five characteristics of this post-death relationship. Each characteristic can be plotted along a continuum from(i) concrete-symbolic; (ii) dynamic-static; (iii) conscious-unconscious; (iv) personal-public; and (v) monologue-dialogue. The results address both the content of the post-death relationship and the manner in which the bond was constructed as well as how it is maintained. The application of relational dialectic theory to the results has added a conceptual dimension to our understanding of the subject. Further attention is given to the implications of this research results to social work practice.

AB Background: The worldwide escalation in the volume of suicide terrorist bombing attacks warrants special attention to the specific pattern of injury associated with such attacks. The goal of this study was to characterize thoracic injuries inflicted by terrorist-related explosions and compare pattern of injury to penetrating and blunt thoracic trauma.
   Methods: Prospectively collected database of patients with chest injury who were admitted to Hadassah Hospital Level I trauma centre, in Jerusalem, Israel, from October 2000 to December 2005. Patients were divided into three groups according to the mechanism of injury: terrorist explosions (n = 55), gunshot wounds (GSW; n = 78), and blunt trauma (n = 747).
   Results: There were many female victims after suicide bombing attacks (49.1%) compared with GSW (21.8%) and blunt trauma (24.6%; p = 0.009). The number of body regions injured was significantly higher in the terror group compared with the GSW and blunt groups (median, 4, 2, and 3, respectively, p < 0.0001). The pattern of chest injury after suicide bombing attacks was caused by a unique combination of the effects of the blast wave and penetrating shrapnel. More than half (52.7%) of the terror victims suffered from lung contusion and 25 (45.5%) required tube thoracostomy. Five patients (9.1%) underwent thoracotomy for lung lacerations (n = 3), injury to great vessels (n = 2), cardiac lacerations (n = 1), and esophageal injury (n = 1). Penetrating shrapnel was the mechanism of injury in all these cases.
   Conclusions: Injury inflicted by terrorist bombings causes a unique pattern of thoracic wounds. Victims are exposed to a combination of lung injury caused by the blast wave and penetrating injury caused by metallic objects.

TI Mortality from external causes among ethnic German immigrants from

AB Background: Diaspora migration flows from the former Soviet Union to Western Europe and Israel have increased since the late 1980s. Risk factors responsible for the East-West mortality gap and post-migration factors may lead to higher mortality from external causes of death like suicide amongst such Diaspora immigrants. We investigated whether ethnic German immigrants from the former Soviet Union had increased mortality from external causes compared to native Germans. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 34 393 adults, so-called Aussiedler who arrived in Germany's largest federal state between 1990 and 2001. We ascertained vital status and causes of death from registry data. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated using the native German population as comparison. Multivariate effects were assessed using Poisson regression. Results: 1 657 members (4.8%) died, 88 from external causes. Overall SMR was 1.29 (95% confidence intervals 1.05-1.61). Males had a 39% higher mortality from all external causes and accidents, and a 30% higher mortality from suicide than German males. Females had slightly higher mortality from accidents but comparable mortality from all external causes. Aussiedler aged < 65 years had rate ratios above one for external causes and accidents in multivariate models. SMRs for suicide and all external causes decreased with length of stay. Conclusion: While ethnic German immigrants have a mortality disadvantage compared to the NRW population, it is on a much lower scale than expected if they were representative of their source populations in former Soviet Union countries.

AB It has been assumed that impaired intellectual capacity could act as a buffer to suicidality in the population of children and adolescents with intellectual disability. The few studies that have been conducted contest this assumption, and in fact, the findings showed that the characteristics of suicidality in the population of children and adolescents with intellectual disability are very similar to other adolescents without intellectual disability. This paper reviews the few studies conducted and describes the symptomatology in this population.

ID CRIME-PREVENTION; DISPLACEMENT; DETERRENCE; POLICY
AB Informed by situational crime prevention (SCP) this study evaluates the effectiveness of the "West Bank Barrier" that the Israeli government began to construct in 2002 in order to prevent suicide bombing attacks.
   Drawing on crime wave models of past SCP research, the study uses a time series of terrorist attacks and fatalities and their location in respect to the Barrier, which was constructed in different sections over different periods of time, between 1999 and 2011.
   The Barrier together with associated security activities was effective in preventing suicide bombings and other attacks and fatalities with little if any apparent displacement. Changes in terrorist behavior likely resulted from the construction of the Barrier, not from other external factors or events.
   In some locations, terrorists adapted to changed circumstances by committing more opportunistic attacks that require less planning. Fatalities and attacks were also reduced on the Palestinian side of the Barrier, producing an expected "diffusion of benefits" though the amount of reduction was considerably more than in past SCP studies. The defensive roles of the Barrier and offensive opportunities it presents, are identified as possible explanations. The study highlights the importance of SCP in crime and counter-terrorism policy.

ID INFORMATION; PHOTOVOICE
AB Objective: This study evaluated the six-phase Global Youth Voices model (EIPARS) for engaging youth in community health promotion in the Middle East: 1) engagement, 2) issue identification, 3) planning, 4) action, 5) Rs; research, reflect, reward and 6) sustainability.
   Participants and Setting: 20 Grade 9 students 0 0 boys, 10 girls) from two Bedouin communities: 10 from Tuba-Zangaria in North Israel; 10 from Segev Shalom in the Negev South Israel.
   Intervention: Using low-end (photo-voice, photography) and high-end internet-based technology, youth identified and documented the strengths and weaknesses of their communities, and then undertook a community action project focusing on one important issue. Workbooks including process guides and tools for each step of the EIPARS model are available online at: http://www.globalyouthvoices.org/resources.html
   Outcomes: Similar issues were identified in each community: e.g., smoking, injuries, friendships, Bedouin culture. Unique issues identified were suicide at Tuba and industrial pollution at Segev Shalom. Students at Tuba selected Suicide Prevention for a community project and prepared a PowerPoint presentation for educating their peers, teachers and parents. Youth from Segev Shalom created a video and photo exhibit on Violence Prevention. Photo-essays and their action projects were uploaded to the Global Youth Voices website for virtual discussion and sharing with youth globally (www.globalyouthvoices.org/middle-east/greetings-en.html).
   Conclusion: This project demonstrated that the EIPARS model can be used successfully for engaging youth and creating youth-driven community action in the Middle East. This public health intervention provides a positive approach for building cooperation in conflicted regions.

AB Objective. To assess the short-(3-9 months) and medium-term (30 months) occurrence and severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in civilian survivors of suicide bombing terrorist attacks. Method. We evaluated 129 injured survivors of nine attacks in Israel who were treated in our emergency room between June 2000 and September 2002. Data on demographics, physical injuries and psychiatric symptoms were collected by both a structured clinical interview and standard assessment scales for depression, anxiety, and sleep quality. Diagnosis of PTSD was based on a Hebrew-validated DSM-IV SCID-PTSD rating scale. Results. At the first assessment (short-term), 20 survivors (15.5%) met the criteria for full-blown PTSD and 54 (42%) for sub-clinical PTSD, while 55 (42.5%) evidenced no symptoms of PTSD. Two years later, only 54 patients could be located: 19 (35%) of them had either persistent or de novo PTSD and none had residual sub-clinical PTSD. Conclusions. Relatively few survivors of suicide bomb attacks had full-blown PTSD, while a substantial number of survivors had short-term sub-clinical PTSD. Two-year follow-up evaluations revealed that a significant a number of the patients available for testing (35%) had full-blown PTSD. These findings imply that medium-term follow-up of survivors is needed in order to establish the actual prevalence of PTSD.

AB A probabilistic game-theoretic model is developed within both a static and a dynamic framework to capture adversary-defender conflict in the presence of backlash. I find that not accounting for backlash in counteradversary policies may be costly to the target government. But to minimize adversarial backlash requires understanding how backlash emerges and if, and how, adversaries strategize to goad target governments into policies that induce backlash. The dynamic version of the model shows that when backlash occurs with a time lag, an escalation of the conflict is likely to occur.

AB To review the frequency, different patterns, anatomic severity, management, and prognosis of abdominal injuries in survivors of explosions, according to the main mechanism of injury.
   A MEDLINE search was conducted from January 1982 to August 2013, including the following MeSH terms: blast injuries, abdominal injuries. EMBASE was also searched, with the same entries. Abdominal blast injuries (ABIs) have been defined as injuries resulting not only from the effects of the overpressure on abdominal organs, but also from the multimechanistic effects and projectile fragments resulting from the blast. Special emphasis was placed on the detailed assessment of ABIs in patients admitted to GMUGH (Gregorio Maran University General Hospital) after the Madrid 2004 terrorist bombings, and in patients admitted to HYMC (Hillel Yaffe Medical Centre) in Hadera (Israel) following several bombing episodes. The anatomic severity of injuries was assessed by the abdominal component of the AIS, and the overall anatomic severity of casualties was assessed by means of the NISS.
   Abdominal injuries are not common in survivors of terrorist explosions, although they are a frequent finding in those immediately killed. Primary and tertiary blast injuries have predominated in survivors from explosions in enclosed spaces reported outside of Israel. In contrast, secondary blast injuries causing fragmentation wounds were predominant in suicide bombings in open and/or semi-confined spaces, mainly in Israel, and also in military conflicts. Multiple perforations of the ileum seem to be the most common primary blast injury to the bowel, but delayed bowel perforations are rare. Secondary blast injuries carry the highest anatomic severity and mortality rate. Most of the deaths assessed occurred early, with hemorrhagic shock from penetrating fragments as the main contributing factor. The negative laparotomy rate has been very variable, with higher rates reported, in general, from civilian hospitals attending a large number of casualties.
   The pattern, severity, management, and prognosis of ABI vary considerably, in accordance with the main mechanism of injury.

AB This article deals with the issue of perceived social support among 40 bereaved parents who have lost a child in a terrorist attack in Israel. The aim is to gain a better understanding of the nature and quality of the formal and informal support that the parents received. The parents were interviewed using semistructured in-depth interviews. The content analysis revealed that alongside the positive aspects, the parents also emphasized the negative side of the encounter with the social environment. The positive aspects included feeling of appreciation for the assistance in the coping process. The negative aspects included a sense of abandonment and distress. The dialectic nature of the domain, together with a recognition of its importance, points to the need to reconcile between the desire on the part of the social environment to assist the bereaved parent on one hand and ways to implement it on the other hand.

AB The Internet can be efficiently exploited to help people in severe emotional distress, including those contemplating suicide. Based on this premise and guided by various psychological principles that characterize Internet communication and behavior, on the one hand, and by factors related to the provision of emotional support, on the other, an Israeli project with the Hebrew acronym SAHAR was established. The idea behind SAHAR was to initiate an anonymous, confidential online environment that would attract people in a crisis situation and offer them a listening ear, mental support, and warmth, provided by anonymous, skilled helpers. At the heart of this exclusively online service is a content-rich Hebrew website (http://www.sahar.org.il) that provides relevant and continuously updated information for people in need. Accessed through the site, SAHAR offers, in addition, personal communication to users through synchronous and asynchronous support. For group communication, SAHAR provides online forums (a chat room will soon be launched). The website is accessed more than 10,000 times a month, or 350 times a day, a considerable number relative to Israel's small population. Approximately 1000 personal contacts with SAHAR itself take place, each month, of which at least a third of the distressed users are clearly suicidal. The forums receive over 200 new messages a day. SAHAR on numerous occasions has participated in rescue operations of individuals who threatened to commit suicide or were actually in the process of trying. In many other cases, a supportive conversation or a referral to appropriate help resources prevented hasty decisions by highly distressed, desperate people contemplating suicide. Feedback by users also indicates the success of SAHAR as a unique psychological application on the Internet. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Mortality in terrorist attacks: A unique modal of temporal death

AB Background: Terror-related multiple casualty incidents (MCI) in Israel since September 2000 have resulted in a new pattern of injury as a result of the mechanisms of trauma. The objective of this study was to asses the temporal death distribution among the civilian casualties in the Jerusalem vicinity during a 3-year period.
   Methods: All terrorist attacks in the Jerusalem district from September 2000 to September 2003 were included in this study. The data of all deaths were processed including the time of the attack, the evacuation time to the hospitals, and the time of death.
   Results: During the study period 28 terror-related MCI occurred. A total of 2328 victims were injured and 273 died, for an overall fatality rate of 11.7%. A unique temporal death distribution was identified; 82.8% of the deaths occurred immediately, at the scene of the attack (scene death); of the remaining 17.2% of patients who died in the hospital, half died within 4 hours of arrival (immediate death), one quarter within 5-24 hours (early death), and one quarter later than that (late death). The temporal death distribution was significantly different when classifying the mechanism of trauma to suicide bombings versus shooting. The scene mortality was higher in the suicide bombings than in shooting attacks (86.7% versus 77%, P = 0.039 ). In contrast, the mortality within 1-24 hours was higher in the shooting attacks (17% versus 6.3%, P = 0.05).
   Conclusions: Terror-related MCI occurring in civilian settings have a unique temporal death distribution. A very high scene mortality is seen compared to the classical description of Donald Trunkey1 in 1983. The late deaths, which composed 30% of the mortality in civilian settings, comprise only 4.4% of the total mortality in MCIs. A rough estimate of the in-hospital mortality could be achieved after the first 4 hours, allowing the assessment and distribution of hospital resources. Futile care should be identified early and availability of ICU beds can be calculated according to the immediate mortality.

AB The association between periods of genocide-related exposures and suicide risk remains unknown. Our study tests that association using a national population-based study design. The source population comprised of all persons born during 1922-1945 in Nazi-occupied or dominated European nations, that immigrated to Israel by 1965, were identified in the Population Register (N = 220,665), and followed up for suicide to 2014, totaling 16,953,602 person-years. The population was disaggregated to compare a trauma gradient among groups that immigrated before (indirect, n = 20,612, 9%); during (partial direct, n = 17,037, 8%); or after (full direct, n = 183,016, 83%) exposure to the Nazi era. Also, the direct exposure groups were examined regarding pre- or post-natal exposure periods. Cox regression models were used to compute Hazard Ratios (HR) of suicide risk to compare the exposure groups, adjusting for confounding by gender, residential SES and history of psychiatric hospitalization. In the total population, only the partial direct exposure subgroup was at greater risk compared to the indirect exposure group (HR = 1.73, 95% CI, 1.10, 2.73; P < .05). That effect replicated in six sensitivity analyses. In addition, sensitivity analyses showed that exposure at ages 13 plus among females, and follow-up by years since immigration were associated with a greater risk; whereas in utero exposure among persons with no psychiatric hospitalization and early postnatal exposure among males were at a reduced risk. Tentative mechanisms impute biopsychosocial vulnerability and natural selection during early critical periods among males, and feelings of guilt and entrapment or defeat among females.

AB Acculturative stress and social support play important roles in suicide-related phenomena among adolescent immigrants. To examine their contributions, measures of acculturative and general life stress and a measure of multiple sources of social support were used to predict psychological distress and suicidal ideation among Korean-born high school students residing in the US. Korean students who were sojourning without both parents were compared to Korean students who immigrated with both parents, Korean students who remained in Korea, and American high school students in the US (total N = 227; 56.8% female). The sojourning group reported higher levels of life stress, distress, psychological symptoms, and suicidal ideation than the other groups. Within the two acculturating groups, levels of distress, symptoms, and suicidal ideation were associated with life stress, lack of parental support, and not living with both parents. The findings have important implications for suicide prevention among immigrant adolescents, and imply that parental support is particularly protective.

AB Dominant theories fail to explain the use of terror during the Second Palestinian Intifada. Notably, they fail to explain Hamas's abandonment of suicide attacks by 2005. We classified the universe of fatalities on both sides and examined the conflict's patterns of lethal violence. Our analysis of fatality ratios and rates of change by fatality category supports a dual-arena theory of terror. Noting a rapid increase of indiscriminate Israeli civilian deaths and a relative evening out within this category in the conflict's initial phase, we demonstrate that externally Hamas aimed to improve the balance of forces to compel Israel to negotiate on equal terms using the out-suffering mechanism. Internally, Hamas used terror to build confrontational capacity by attracting Palestinian factions to a resistance pole and isolating conciliatory elites. When their continued deployment became too costly relative to emerging options, the campaign was swiftly called off. In the end, while based on strategic calculations, Hamas's use of terror proved to be a failure.

AB Modern Psychiatry is challenged by two major problems related to the dramatic upsurge of activity of suicidal terrorism: the effectively increased incidence of post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) and the need of exploring modern suicidal kamikaze's mentality.
   Nowadays, PTSD appears no longer confined amongst front-line combats or veterans, but it is spread amongst the general population and, as such, requires appropriate recognition, beyond the classical rigid nosological systems, and proper treatments.
   The second problem is really difficult to resolve, but psychiatrists should, at least, start to propose the need of an international debate on the possibility that suicide bombers may suffer from one or more psychopathological disorders which could benefit from psychiatric interventions. To accomplish this goal, Western and Eastern society should try to overcome some of their current cultural constraints and adopt a more neutral approach to reduce distances and reciprocal diffidence, and begin to find the means of setting up reliable studies in this sense. Such a debate is not necessary for the survival of the most powerful societies, but of the entire world.

ID DEPRESSION
AB Isotretinoin (Accutane) ranks in the top 10 of the US Food and Drug Administration's database of drugs associated with reports of depression and suicide attempts. However, this association is still controversial because up to 5.6% of patients with moderate acne may have pre-existing suicidal ideations, improvement of acne often reduces associated depression, and isotretinoin users are reportedly no more likely than those taking antibiotics for acne to have depression or commit suicide. We describe a series of cases of manic psychosis that developed in a 1-year period (2003) in association with isotretinoin treatment and resulted in suicidality and progression to long-standing psychosis. Cases were drawn from 500 soldiers who had been evaluated in a military specialists dermatology clinic for severe acne. Data were summarized from medical records of five severe acne patients treated by isotretinion during their compulsory military service, Data from their draft board examinations and service records, as well as repeated clinical assessments by certified psychiatrists at the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Mental Health Department clinic, were evaluated. Five young adults developed manic psychosis within a mean of 76 months of exposure to isotretinoin. In three cases, this was accompanied by a suicide attempt, and in three cases, psychosis lasted for longer than 6 months. Either a personal history of obsessive-compulsive disorder, neurological insult or family history of a major psychiatric illness were present in all cases. The present case-series is suggestive of an increase in the likelihood of an association between exposure to isotretinion and manic psychosis. Associated risk factors were both family and personal history of psychiatric morbidity. Further studies are needed to establish our findings. (C) 2005 Lippincott Williams Wilkins.

AB Aim: Migrants have increased risk for psychiatric hospitalizations. Over the last decades Israel has become a destination for migration of migrant workers and asylum-seekers. Methods: The current retrospective study retrieved socio-demographic, clinical and migration-related chart data for 117 migrants admitted to a major Israeli psychiatric hospital between 2005?2011, to delineate characteristics and risk-factors for psychiatric hospitalizations. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to predict re-hospitalization. Results: Of the study sample, 61% were single men, 20% had been exposed to trauma, 15% had prior psychiatric hospitalizations and 24% had attempted suicide. Approximately, 76% were involuntarily hospitalized and diagnosed with psychosis. None were diagnosed with PTSD. Approximately, 20% were re-hospitalized. Factors significantly associated with re-hospitalization were male gender (OR?=?15.2, 95%, CI 1.8?126.9, p?=?0.012), prior psychiatric hospitalization (OR?=?15.4, 95% CI 2.1?111.9, p?<?0.01), being single (OR?=?5.96, 95% CI1.14?31.07, p?=?0.03) and traumatic exposure (OR?=?4.75, 95% CI: 1.17?19.36, p=?0.03). Shorter duration in Israel, unemployment, asylum-seekers, no temporary-visa and use of restraints were more prevalent among those re-hospitalized. Conclusion: Identification of migrants at risk and trauma-informed, culturally relevant services can reduce hospitalizations.

TI Could hamas target the West?
SO STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM
LA English
DT Article
AB A violent Islamist organization, Hamas, is also a nationalist movement that holds resistance" to Israel as its highest goal. Unlike global terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda, Hamas has traditionally confined its violent activities to the local arena comprising Israel, the Gaza Strip, and the West Bank. While citizens of Western countries have been killed in Hamas' indiscriminate suicide bombings, Hamas has not taken its violent campaign abroad targeting Israeli diplomats or Western allies. Indeed, several layers of disincentives mitigate against Hamas targeting Israeli interests abroad or targeting Western interests. But under what conditions might Hamas be prepared to target Western interests? The answer to this question requires a level of analysis approach that considers Hamas as an organization, as a conglomerate of semi-independent cells, and as a wellspring for rogue cells and independent actors, with these last two entities posing the greatest future threat. Contrary to conventional wisdom, there is precedent for Hamas considering the attacks on Israeli interests abroad and on Western interests themselves. In final analysis, the author believes Hamas unlikely to attack Western interests in the short term. But the following analysis reveals that under certain conditions Hamas' attack calculus could change in the future.

AB It is hypothesized that ratings of emotional stimuli are affected by a constant threat of traumatic events. Ratings of valence and arousal on the International Affective Picture System from young adults in the United States were compared to those of young Israeli adults. Israelis rated the pictures as less negative and less positive than did participants from the United States. Israeli women gave higher arousal ratings compared to the American women. These differences may be due to compulsory military service in Israel, during which exposure to traumatic events is more likely to occur, and to the timing of the study which followed a year of frequent suicide bomb attacks. The authors suggest that these findings may reflect mild symptoms of stress disorders.

SO MEDIA CULTURE & SOCIETY

DT Article
DE ethnicity; everyday life; Israel; nationalism; television; terrorism
AB This article explores the ways in which television news broadcasts represent and construct nationhood in circumstances of protracted political and often military conflict. Such circumstances can lead to an affirmation of nationhood by foregrounding civil society rather than the state or organized politics: media representations turn the resilience of everyday interpersonal relationships into a conspicuous national value, and ultimately into a myth of national character. Analysing an extreme instance of news discourse in crisis conditions (Israeli television coverage of a suicide bombing of a bus in Jerusalem), the article identifies several discursive strategies for constructing an overall image of national civil society, focusing in particular on the ways in which these intertwine both ethnic and civic conceptions of nationhood.

AB To screen and clinically interview European adolescents reporting current suicidality (suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) and investigate attendance at the clinical interview.
   The Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) Project was carried out in 11 European countries. A baseline questionnaire was completed in school by 12,395 adolescents (mean age 14.9; SD 0.9). Those who screened positive for suicidality (attempting suicide and/or serious suicidal ideation or plans) in the past 2 weeks were invited to a clinical interview with a mental health professional.
   Of the 12,395 adolescents, 4.2 % (n = 516) screened positive for current suicidality. The prevalence ranged from 1.1 % in Hungary to 7.7 % in Israel (p < 0.001). 37.6 % (n = 194) of those who screened positive subsequently attended the clinical interview. Female students were more likely to attend for interview (42.0 % versus 30.6 %, p = 0.010). The attendance rate varied considerably across countries, from 5.7 % in Italy to 96.7 % in France (p < 0.001). Improved attendance was associated with using school as the only interview setting (Mean attendance rate, MAR = 88 vs. 31 %, p = 0.006) and arranging the interview within 1 week of contacting the student (MAR = 64 vs. 23 %, p = 0.013). The greater the travel time to interview, the lower the attendance rate (Pearson's r = -0.64, p = 0.034). Independent of the variation by country, at the individual level, adolescents with more depressive symptoms and a recent suicide attempt more often attended for interview.
   A high rate of current suicidality was found amongst European adolescents. However, the majority of these displayed limited help-seeking behaviour. Future studies should investigate ways of making screening programmes and other interventions more acceptable and accessible to young people, especially young males.

AB The incidence of suicide attempts [Deliberate Self Harm (DSH); ICD-10: X60-X84] and psychotic attacks (PsA; ICD-10, F20-F29) in association with atmospheric states, typical for areas close to big deserts, was analyzed. A retrospective study is based on the 4,325 cases of DSH and PsA registered in the Mental Health Center (MHC) of Ben-Gurion University (Be'er-Sheva, Israel) during 2001-2003. Pearson and Spearman test correlations were used; the statistical significance was tested at p < 0.1. The influence of temperature and humidity on suicide attempts (N (SU) ) and psychotic attacks (N (PS) ) was weakly pronounced (p > 0.1). Correlation coefficients between N (SU) and N (PS) and speed WS of westerly wind reaches 0.3 (p < 0.05), while their dependence on easterly WS was weaker (p > 0.09). Variations in easterly wind direction WD influence N (SU) and N (PS) values (p < 0.04), but no corresponding correlation with westerly winds was found (p > 0.3). Obviously ,in transition areas located between different regions ,the main role of air streams in meteorological-biological impact can scarcely be exaggerated. An unstable balance in the internal state of a weather-sensitive person is disturbed when the atmospheric state is changed by specific desert winds, which can provoke significant perturbations in meteorological parameters. Results indicate the importance of wind direction, defining mainly the atmospheric situation in semi-arid areas: changes in direction of the easterly wind influence N (SU) and N (PS) , while changes in WS are important for mental health under westerly air streams. Obviously, N (SU) and N (PS) are more affected by the disturbance of weather from its normal state, for a given season, to which the local population is accustomed, than by absolute values of meteorological parameters.

AB Purpose: Few studies have investigated the association between religiosity and self-injurious thoughts and behaviors specifically in adolescents, yielding inconsistent results. To date, no study has examined this relationship in a Jewish adolescent cohort.
   Methods: Self-injurious thoughts and behaviors, as well as depression, were assessed in a nationally representative sample of Jewish adolescents (n = 620) and their mothers, using the Development and Well-Being Assessment Inventory (DAWBA) structured interview. Degree of religiosity was obtained by a self-report measure.
   Results: Using multivariate analysis, level of religiosity was inversely associated with self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (Wald chi(2) = 3.95, P = 0.047), decreasing the likelihood of occurrence by 55% (OR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.2-0.99), after adjusting for depression and socio-demographic factors. This model (adjusted R-2 = 0.164; likelihood ratio chi(2) = 7.59; df = 1; P < 0.047) was able to correctly classify 95.6% of the patients as belonging either to the high or low risk groups.
   Conclusion: This is the first study demonstrating religiosity to have a direct independent protective effect against self-injurious thoughts and behaviors in Jewish adolescents. This finding has clinical implications regarding risk assessment and suicide prevention. Further research can potentially elucidate the complex relationship between religiosity, self-injury and suicide in this population. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB This article paints a broad canvas of Hamas after almost four years of intifada and a relentless multipronged Israeli-US. assault against it. The movement's views and strategies are discussed with regard to suicide attacks, the intra-Palestinian dialogue and ceasefire negotiations, and conditions for a peace settlement. While Israel's assassination of leadership cadres has unquestionably dealt the movement a serious blow, the author argues that Hamas has nonetheless made three significant strategic gains: its "resistance project"-contrasting with PLO negotiations policies-has gained ground as a "national agenda "; Arab and Muslim support, fueled by rising outrage at US. and Israeli policies, has grown; and, most importantly, Palestinian support at the grassroots level has never been greater, resulting in increased political weight even as the movement's military strength has declined.

AB The aim of the present study was to examine the impact of the Rehabilitation Law 2000 in Israel (which provides a basket of rehabilitation services for every mentally disabled patient) on the survival in the community of a population of long-stay psychiatric patients released from psychiatric hospitals. A naturalistic follow-up study was performed on long-stay patients discharged ("key discharge") from two Israel psychiatric hospitals closed before (in 1997) and after (in 2000) introduction of the Rehabilitation Law 2000. The data source was the National Psychiatric Hospitalization Registry. The study population consisted of 611 patients. The percentage of patients who, at closure of hospital, were discharged directly into the community was eightfold higher following the Rehabilitation Law 2000 than before. There was also a trend for a lower readmission rate for those patients who were discharged into the community in the post-law period, both for those whose key discharge was directly to the community and for those who were later discharged after being transferred to another hospital at key discharge. Concerning the mean duration of inpatient stay, there was no difference between the two cohorts, whether hospitalizations followed transfer to another hospital from key discharge or rehospitalization from the community. Interestingly, the Rehabilitation Law did not have a significant effect on patients' mortality after key discharge. The Rehabilitation Law 2000 has a beneficial effect on the opportunities of long-stay psychiatric patients to resettle in the community without increasing risk of death.

AB Study objectives: This study examined working conditions, reported morbidity, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) and depression and their relation to an index of occupational health risk among women working in brothels in Israel.
   Design: Personal structured interviews with a scale of occupational risk that included seven self report items reflecting past and present morbidity and symptoms.
   Participants and setting: A purposive sample of 55 women in three cities in Israel, between the ages of 18 - 38.
   Main results: Most (82%) women were trafficked into Israel to work illegally in prostitution, effectively deriving them of access to discretionary health care. A third of the sample (32%) had a high score ( between 3 to 6) on the index of occupational risk factors. A high score was not related to recent physician or gynaecological visits and was more common among illegal workers than those with residence status. A set of regression analyses showed that the most significant predictors of reporting a high level of occupational risk symptoms were starting sex work at an early age, the number of hours worked in a day, a history of suicide attempts and PTSD symptoms.
   Conclusions: High occupational risk was found to be unrelated to recent physician or gynaecological visits, indicating that these visits were most probably controlled by the brothel owners and not by medical need as perceived by the women themselves. Furthermore, occupational risk factors were associated with some of the working and background conditions reported by women brothel workers. There is an urgent need for medical care for this high risk group.

   CONTEXT; STRESS
AB Ethiopian immigrant women in Israel are overrepresented as victims of femicide; they are killed at more than 16 times the rate of the general population. This article suggests integrating current theoretical and empirical models to explain Ethiopian femicide, and stresses that considering psychological or sociocultural explanations as risk factors alone is not enough to understand this phenomenon. We distinguish between risk factors and triggers for femicide against Ethiopian women. While sociocultural and even psychological changes are risk factors for femicide, one, two, or three main triggers may activate such potential risk factors, such as the woman's willingness (WW) to leave the intimate relationship, sexual jealousy (SJ), and formal complaints against the abusive partner. The first two triggers are jealousy oriented. To analyze this phenomenon in Israel, we examined all court decisions on intimate partner homicide (IPH) from 1990 to 2010. After reading former studies on IPH and identifying important variables that could explain the phenomenon, we first catalogued the data in every decision and verdict according to main independent variables mentioned in the literature. The study population consists of first-generation immigrants, N = 194: native Israelis (47%), new immigrants from the former Soviet Union (FSU; 31%), and Ethiopians (16%). Our analysis of court decisions reveals that triggers containing jealousy components are responsible for 83% of femicide cases committed by Ethiopian men, in comparison with native Israelis (77%) and immigrant Russian men (66%) who murdered their intimate partners. In addition, there is a significant correlation among motive (jealousy), method of killing (stabbing), and overkilling (excessive force).

SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIOLOGY

DT Article
DE communal violence; military sociology; political sociology; violence
ID SUICIDE BOMBINGS; HUMAN-RIGHTS; TERRORISM; COUNTERTERRORISM; STRATEGY;
   VIOLENCE; CYCLE
AB Extant theories explain reasonably well why the Israeli state exercises a given level of violence against substate actors. Based on economic or sociological models of human action, these theories attribute the level of state violence, respectively, to the narrow cost-benefit calculations of state officials or the institutionally embedded norms that govern their deliberations. The strength of such theories notwithstanding, this article argues that they fail to account for the willingness of Israeli officials to order the assassination of high-ranking political opponents during the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising against Israel. This article's analysis of published sources concerning the assassination of Hamas leaders Ahmed Yassin and Ismail Abu Shanab and of interviews with 74 Israeli counterterrorist experts suggests that the decision to engage in state-directed political assassination in the period 2000-5 was based less on narrow calculations and institutionally specific norms than on identifiable political contingencies. Specifically, the second intifada appears to have led many Israeli decision-makers to favour creating chaos in the Palestinian political system, a goal that was well served by the policy of political assassination. The policy's effect was to forestall the founding of a viable, independent Palestinian state.

TI Suicide bombers form a new injury profile
SO ANNALS OF SURGERY
LA English
DT Article
ID TERRORIST; ACTS
AB Background: Recent explosions of suicide bombers introduced new and unique profiles of injury. Explosives frequently included small metal parts, increasing severity of injuries, challenging both physicians and healthcare systems. Timely detonation in crowded and confined spaces further increased explosion effect.
   Methods: Israel National Trauma Registry data on hospitalized terror casualties between October 1, 2000 and December 31, 2004 were analyzed.
   Results: A total of 1155 patients injured by explosion were studied. Nearly 30% suffered severe to critical injuries (ISS >= 16); severe injuries (AIS >= 3) were more prevalent than in other trauma. Triage has changed as metal parts contained in bombs penetrate the human body with great force and may result in tiny entry wounds easily concealed by hair, clothes etc. A total of 36.6% had a computed tomography (CT), 26.8% had ultrasound scanning, and 53.2% had an x-ray in the emergency department. From the emergency department, 28.3% went directly to the operating room, 10.1% to the intensive care unit, and 58.4% directly to the ward. Injuries were mostly internal, open wounds, and bums, with an excess of injuries to nerves and to blood vessels compared with other trauma mechanisms. A high rate of surgical procedures was recorded, including thoracotomies, laparotomies, craniotomies, and vascular surgery. In certain cases, there were simultaneous multiple injuries that required competing forms of treatment, such as bums and blast lung.
   Conclusions: Bombs containing metal fragments detonated by suicide bombers in crowded locations change patterns and severity of injury in a civil population. Specific injuries will require tailored approaches, an open mind, and close collaboration and cooperation between trauma surgeons to share experience, opinions, and ideas. Findings presented have implications for triage, diagnosis, treatment, hospital organization, and the definition of surge capacity.

AB Community and nationwide surveys on adolescent suicidal behaviors using clinical interviews are not abundant. Rates of self-reported suicide attempts in community samples vary greatly between 1 and 20 %. In general, adolescent and parental agreement in child psychiatry practice is low, and their agreement with regard to suicidal behavior is unknown. The current study assesses the rates of suicidal ideation and behaviors as well as the rate of agreement between adolescents and their mothers in a representative nationwide sample. The survey included a representative and randomized community sample of 14- to 17-year-old adolescents (n = 957), and their mothers who were interviewed using the Development and Well-Being Assessment Inventory (DAWBA). The prevalence of suicidal ideation and self-initiated behaviors was 4.9 and 1.9 %, respectively. The concordance between mothers' and adolescents' reporting on ideation was low (7.3 %). There was no concordance between mothers' and adolescents' reports of suicidal acts. Adolescents reported self-initiated behaviors nearly three times more frequently than their mothers. Paternal unemployment, care by welfare agencies and having a psychiatric disorder, specifically depression or post-traumatic stress disorder, was associated with a higher risk for both suicidal ideation and attempts. In this nationwide community study, by evaluating information gathered by clinical interviews, it was found that the lifetime rates of suicidal ideation were moderate. The rates of suicide attempts were lower than have been previously reported. The concordance between the reports of adolescents and their mothers was low for ideation and nonexistent for attempts. Thus, clinicians should interview adolescents separately from their mothers regarding their suicidality.

AB The present study tests the applicability of the consensus versus the conflict model of criminal law in the case of homicide, and euthanasia, in particular. Although most criminal statutes consider euthanasia to be a serious homicide, many studies have revealed increasing public support for it. A survey of a national sample of Israeli respondents, based on a factorial design methodology, was conducted to determine the extent to which the criminal law reflects general or particular public attitudes toward euthanasia. The findings revealed that although social groups varied in their views on the seriousness of euthanasia, the public at large perceived it as significantly less serious than any other type of homicide. These findings are compatible with calls for reassessment of the criminal law with regard to euthanasia.

AB Objective: The Israel Survey of Mental Health among Adolescents (ISMEHA) aimed to ascertain the prevalence of selected mental disorders and patterns of comorbidity; service utilization and unmet needs; health and sociodemographic covariates; and risk and protective factors. This paper reviews the methods used and discusses the strengths and limitations of the survey.
   Method: The ISMEHA was a cross-sectional survey that included 957 Israeli adolescents, representative of the adolescent population aged 14-17 years. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, Hebrew version (SDQ-H), the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) inventory, services utilization, health status and sociodemographic questions were administered to adolescents and their mothers at the respondents' homes between January 2004 and March 2005.
   Results: The overall response rate was 68.2%, and it varied by gender and type of locality. Among boys, 71.3% responded, as compared to 65.2% among girls. The response rate among adolescents living in a Jewish or mixed city was 62.5% as compared to 89.6% among adolescents living in an exclusively Arab-populated city.
   Conclusions: The ISMEHA allows the creation of a unique and comprehensive database informing on the prevalence, burden, services utilization and unmet needs of adolescents with psychiatric disorders. These data will enable policymakers to more rationally plan services and prevention programs for the target population.

AB Seedless grapes are generally preferred by consumers for fresh consumption. The development of new seedless selections utilizing stenospermy, has been recognized as a key factor in Vitis vinifera breeding programs throughout the world. The Department of Fruit Tree Breeding and Genetic at the Volcani Center is actively involved in breeding of early and late seedless grapes. Special emphasis is given to the time of ripening, firmness, high sugar content, special aromas, loose and uniform bunches, natural big berries, good shelf life and reduced labor costs. We utilized advanced techniques for embryo rescue and hardening in order to improved the efficiency of our cross hybridization program.
   Several years ago we have developed, registered and released for commercial growth several new selections. Some of these cultivars were found to be rather promising: Results obtained from the testing of "Prime", "Mystery", Spring Blush and "Black-finger" under different climatic conditions in Chile, South Africa and Israel are presented. The role of the seeded East-European cultivar "Yantar" in the inheritance of early ripening will be discussed.
   In parallel to the conventional breeding studies, we have established a biotechnological approach for the improvement of table grapes.
   Using seed-coat and embryo specific promoters we have overexpressed the egg avidin in transformed grapes. Ablation of seeds indicated that avidin can be utilized successfully as a suicide gene.

AB Background:
   The development of epidemiological instruments has enabled the assessment of mental disorders in youth in countries that plan policy according to evidence-based principles. The Israel Survey of Mental Health among Adolescents (ISMEHA) was conducted in 2004-2005 in a representative sample of 957 adolescents aged 14-17 and their mothers.
   Methods:
   The aims of this study were to estimate prevalence rates of internalizing and externalizing mental disorders and their socio-demographic and health correlates. Disorders were ascertained with the Development and Well-Being Assessment inventory and verified by child psychiatrists.
   Results:
   The prevalence rates were 11.7%, 8.1% and 4.8% for any disorder, internalizing disorders and externalizing disorders, respectively. Distinct risk factors were associated with the different types of disorders: internalizing disorders were associated with female gender, chronic medical conditions and being cared for by a welfare agency. Risk factors for externalizing disorders were male gender, having divorced or single parents, being an only child or having only one sibling. Learning disability was associated with both types of disorders.
   Conclusions:
   The risk and protective factors related to internalizing and externalizing disorders are interpreted within the framework of family composition in this multicultural society.

TI Darier disease in Israel: combined evaluation of genetic and

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ATP2A2 MUTATIONS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PHENOTYPE
AB Background Darier disease (DD) is a rare genodermatosis caused by heterozygous mutations in the ATP2A2 gene. It has been associated with neuropsychiatric manifestations.
   Objectives To investigate the genetic basis of Israeli patients with DD, and its association with the neuropsychiatric phenotype.
   Methods A cohort of 32 families comprising 74 affected individuals and 13 unaffected family members was recruited from the Haemek Dermatology Department and other dermatology clinics in Israel. The individuals were evaluated by detailed questionnaires, physical examination and genetic analysis. The main outcome measures were genetic mutations, psychiatric profile and their association.
   Results Twenty-three mutations in ATP2A2 were scattered over the entire gene, 14 of them novel. Two families shared the same mutation. Twenty-one patients (28%) had a history of psychiatric disorders, most of them mood disorders. Another seven patients (9%) were highly suspected of having a psychiatric disorder; 21 (28%) reported suicidal thoughts and five (7%) had attempted suicide. The psychiatric phenotype demonstrated inter-and intrafamilial variability, and was not associated with disease severity, family history of psychiatric disease or mutation location.
   Conclusions The cohort demonstrated genetic heterogeneity with no mutation cluster along the gene, and a high prevalence of psychiatric disorders. Although no clear genotype-phenotype correlation was found, the results point to a major effect of genetic background on psychiatric phenotype, together with other modifiers.

AB Purpose: Little is known about the clinical characteristics and motivations for engaging in non-suicide self-injury (NSSI) behaviors in adolescence. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence, characteristics and functions of NSSI among adolescents in community settings, and to explore risk factors related to this behavior.
   Subjects and methods: Two hundred and seventy-five adolescents aged 12 to 17 were recruited randomly from different High Schools in Israel. They completed self-report questionnaires assessing NSSI (Ottawa Self-Injury Inventory), depression (Children's Depression Inventory - CDI) and impulsivity (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale - BIS-II).
   Results: In the past year, 20.7% of the participants reported engaging NSSI at least once. Among them, 42.1% declared they are still engaging in NSSI at the present. Motives for NSSI were internal emotion regulation reasons, external emotion regulation reasons for social influences. In addition, the NSSI group reported significantly higher levels of depressive, impulsivity and suicidal ideations. Depressive symptoms were found as significant predictors of NSSI in the future.
   Discussion and conclusions: High rates of NSSI among community adolescents were found. Depression, impulsivity and suicidal ideation were found significantly related to NSSI. Mental health professionals in schools and in primary care should routinely assess NSSI among adolescents. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide bombing attacks have emerged as a lethal weapon in the hands of terrorist groups. Our aim was to review the medical experience acquired in Israel, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States in managing terrorist attacks, and prepare medical systems for the difficult task of managing these events. EMS protocols are amended to deal with a large number of victims in an urban setting who must be rapidly evacuated to a medical center where resuscitative as well as definitive care is delivered. A combination of extensive soft tissue damage caused by penetrating injuries, blast injury to the lungs and tympanic membranes, and burns are common among survivors. Preparation must include establishment of a clear chain-of-command lead by a general surgeon who manages the event and is responsible for decisions regarding OR preferences and ICU admissions. The emergency department is re-organized to handle the influx of numerous severely injured casualties. Professional personnel and resources are recruited and re-directed away from routine tasks towards treating the victims. This is achieved by deferring non-urgent operations, procedures and imaging studies. Victims are frequently re-assessed and re-evaluated to control chaos, minimize missed injuries and ensure delivery of an adequate level of care.

AB Israel represents a complex and pluralistic society comprising two major ethnonational groups, Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs, which differ in terms of religious and cultural values as well as social constructs. According to the so-called "diversification hypothesis", within the framework of e-health and in the era of new information and communication technologies, seeking online health information could be a channel to increase health literacy, especially among disadvantaged groups. However, little is known concerning digital seeking behavior and, in particular, digital mental health literacy. This study was conducted in order to fill in this gap. Concerning raw figures, unadjusted for confounding variables (time, population size, Internet penetration index, disease rate), "depression" searched in Hebrew was characterized by 1,5 times higher search volumes, slightly declining throughout time, whereas relative search volumes (RSVs) related to "depression" searched in Arabic tended to increase over the years. Similar patterns could be detected for "phobia" (in Hebrew 1.4-fold higher than in Arabic) and for "anxiety" (with the searches performed in Hebrew 2.3 times higher than in Arabic). "Suicide" in Hebrew was searched 2.0-fold more than in Arabic (interestingly for both languages search volumes exhibited seasonal cyclic patterns). Eating disorders were searched more in Hebrew: 8.0-times more for "bulimia", whilst "anorexia" was searched in Hebrew only. When adjusting for confounding variables, association between digital seeking behavior and ethnicity remained statistically significant (p-value < 0.0001) for all psychiatric disorders considered in the current investigation, except for "bulimia" (p = 0.989). More in details, Israeli Arabs searched for mental health disorders less than Jews, apart from "depression". Arab and Jewish Israelis, besides differing in terms of language, religion, social and cultural values, have different patterns of usage of healthcare services and provisions, as well as e-healthcare services concerning mental health. Policy- and decision-makers should be aware of this and make their best efforts to promote digital health literacy among the Arab population in Israel.

SO JOURNAL OF PALLIATIVE CARE
LA English
DT Article
ID MEDICINE
AB Israel, like many other countries, is struggling with numerous bioethical dilemmas due to its cultural and religious diversity. Until recently there was no legal guidance for how to deal with end-of-life issues. However, in 2005 a law was passed regulating the treatment of dying patients. Its most controversial aspect is the distinction it makes between withholding therapy (which is allowed) and withdrawing continuous therapy (which is not allowed). In this formulation, the law attempted to strike a balance between respecting the autonomy of the patient and respecting the sanctity of life. The law respects autonomy by establishing the right of the patient to refuse treatment; it respects the sanctity of life by prohibiting active euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. However, this compromise was not acceptable to all members of the public advisory body that framed the law. Some argued that there was no moral basis for the distinction between withholding and withdrawing treatment.

SO ISRAEL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE children; adolescents; poisoning; poison center
ID MULTICENTER SURVEY; CHILDHOOD; CHILDREN
AB Background: Poisonings are a significant cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality. The Israel Poison Information Center provides clinical consultations on poisonings and drug information 24 hours a day.
   Objective: To evaluate the epidemiologic characteristics of pediatric poison exposures in Israel.
   Methods: We reviewed computerized queries and performed a descriptive analysis of the Poison Center database pertaining to patients under 18 years old during 2007.
   Results: A total of 15,005 pediatric poison exposures were recorded, 80.3% of them occurring in children under 6 years old. Of the calls to the Poison Center, 78.6% were made by the public, 20.7% by physicians, and in 74.4% the call was within 2 hours of exposure. Most exposures occurred at home (89.3%) and were unintentional (89.5%). Among adolescents, most exposures were intentional (49.3%, 38.2% suicides), the time lapse until consultation was longer (37% > 2 hours), and more physicians (54.8%) consulted the Poison Center. Most cases were asymptomatic or mildly affected (92.3%), 54.4% in adolescents. The commonest substances involved in single poison exposure were detergents, anti-microbials, topical preparations, acetaminophen and scale removers; in adolescents the most common substances were acetaminophen, methylphenidate, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, atropine and ethanol. Moderate to severe toxicity was commonly associated with organo-phosphates, alkali, ethanol, Vipera palaestinae and neuro-leptics. Most patients could be observed at home (66.6%), while more adolescents were referred to emergency departments (42.2% vs. 9.9%) or hospitalized (14.5% vs. 1.9%).
   Conclusions: Pediatric poisonings are a significant health problem. The magnitude of the problem is greater in the young age group but more severe in adolescence, probably due to deliberate self-poisoning. Greater national efforts should be directed towards improved poison prevention, rational management of pediatric poisoning, and creating a national poisoning registry. (MA) 2010; 12: 554-559

AB Objectives: (1) To examine the trends in the incidence of dual diagnosis (DD) of severe mental illness and substance-related disorders among inpatients in Israel, and (2) the demographic and clinical correlates of DD patients.
   Method: Using data from the National Psychiatric Case Register, we identified 56,774 inpatients aged 15-64 whose first psychiatric hospitalization occurred between 1996 and 2010. We compared the characteristics of inpatients having DD with drugs, alcohol or drug/alcohol abuse with those with mental disorder only.
   Results: Over the period, DD with drugs decreased from 8.2% in 1996 to 6% in 2010; DD with alcohol increased from 3% to 4% and DD with drugs/alcohol from 2% to 4%. DD with drugs was highest, whereas DD with alcohol was lowest for the youngest age- group in 1996 but increased to the same as other age-groups in 2006-2010. Male gender, a previous suicide attempt, compulsory hospitalizations and marital status were positive predictors for all DD. Immigrant status was a positive predictor of DD with alcohol, but the opposite for DD with drugs; being Jewish and psychotic diagnosis was a positive predictor of DD with drugs, but negative for DD with alcohol.
   Conclusions: Over the study period, DD with drugs has decreased among young patients, although it is still higher than among older groups. However, DD with alcohol or drugs/alcohol has increased in the younger group. The clinical-demographic profile of DD patients was similar to that from the relevant literature, except for immigrant status that was negatively associated with DD with drugs.

TI Profound long-term effects of Nazism on patient care in gastroenterology
SO ISRAEL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL

DT Editorial Material
DE Holocaust; antisemitism; gastroenterology; medical history; medical
   ethics
AB It is common knowledge that in addition to the slaughter of millions of innocent civilians, Nazism caused direct damage to patient care by euthanasia of the handicapped, gruesome human experimentation, and ethnic cleansing of German medical schools. In gastroenterology, 53 prominent academicians living in Nazi-occupied Europe were persecuted by the Nazis. Prior studies analyzed this persecution as it related to gastroenterologists rather than to patient care. This study reports, however, that Nazi persecution led to a delay of more than one generation in the clinical application of major inventions by these gastroenterologists. These included flexible fiberoptic endoscopy, which was delayed from 1930 to 1957. Fiberoptic transmission was invented by Heinrich Lamm in 1930. Lamm was exiled from Nazi Germany in 1936, and this technique was clinically applied to endoscopy by Hirschowitz only in 1957. Another innovation was fecal occult blood testing for early colon cancer detection, which was devised by Ismar Boas before 1938. Boas committed suicide under Nazi oppression in 1938 and this modality was clinically applied by Greegor only in 1967. The acceptance of refugees from Nazi Germany or Austria into America or into the future State of Israel helped mitigate some of this damage. For example, eight eminent academic gastroenterologists who fled Nazi-occupied countries to then mandatory Palestine made major contributions to the development of academic gastroenterology in the soon-to-be established State of Israel.

AB Introduction: Knowledge of patterns of blood use in the care of mass casualty settings is important for preparedness of medical centre resources and for maximising survival when blood supplies are limited. Our objectives were to review of our experience with the use of blood products and define the utilisation of blood transfusion following suicide bombing attacks.
   Patients and methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of blood and blood product transfusion following civilian bombing attacks at a level I trauma centre in Jerusalem, Israel from 2000 to 2005. The study group consisted of 137 patients who were admitted following 17 suicide bombing attacks which were carried out in Jerusalem during the 5-year period. Demographic data, number of units of blood and blood products transfused and the need for massive transfusions were recorded and analyzed.
   Results: Fifty-three patients received blood transfusions (38.7%). There were 33 males (62.2%) with a median ISS of 13 (range 4-25). These 53 patients received 524 PRBC, 42 WB, and 449 FFP. The mean number of PRBC transfused/admitted patient was 3.82 units (range 0-59). Thirty patients (21.9%) received 236 PRBC (45% of total PRBC) at the first 2 h. The ratio of ordered to transfused blood was 946:524. The FFP: PRBC ratio for all transfused patients was 1:1.17. The number of PRBC transfused per attack correlated with the number of patients admitted per attack. The most commonly transfused blood type was A (52.3%). Only 18 units of uncrossed-matched blood were transfused (3.3% of total). 14 patients (10.2%) received massive transfusions. These patients received 399 PRBC (76.1% of total units transfused) and the average number of PRBC transfused was 28.5/patient (10-59).
   Conclusions: More than 1/3 of casualties admitted following civilian bombing attacks received transfusions, most in the first 2 h. Large-scale attacks will require more blood and blood products than small-scale attacks. Twice the number of PRBC ordered than transfused reflects a known trend for over-triage during the initial assessment following bombing attacks. One tenth of patients received massive transfusion.

AB This paper presents adolescent aggression as mediated by the level of differentiation of self. No research has directly addressed Bowen's notion that level of differentiation impacts child functioning including aggression. Level of differentiation is discussed in conjunction with social, gender and cultural norms as manifested in aggressive behavior. Female adolescent aggression is described as mainly relationship focused and expressed via verbal threats, intimidation and manipulation, while male aggression is described mainly as overt physical violence involving dominance and competitiveness. Research on differentiation focuses mainly on Western cultures that tend to be individualistic. Jewish-Israeli society is in transition from collectivistic to individualistic cultural values in the midst of ongoing hostilities. These processes create conflict regarding togetherness and individuality needs among adolescents, who are exposed to contradictory messages regarding separating and staying close. External as well as internal expressions of aggression (depression, suicide) are presented as coping strategies in the service of a wounded self-negotiating with the world. Guided mindfulness meditation is a powerful technique for facilitating healing and growth toward autonomy by helping adolescents connect to their inner voice. This technique may be especially useful in the adolescent search for self-awareness, meaning and life purpose. Bodily, cognitive and emotional experiences are treated as informative regarding the 'self' and facilitate expansion of self-perception and individuality.

AB Background: Negative attitudes towards patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) may affect their treatment. We aimed to identify attitudes toward patients with BPD.
   Methods: Clinicians in four psychiatric hospitals in Israel (n = 710; psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and nurses) were approached and completed questionnaires on attitudes toward these patients.
   Results: Nurses and psychiatrists reported encountering a higher number of patients with BPD during the last month, and exhibited more negative attitudes and less empathy toward these patients than the other two professions. The whole sample evaluated the decision to hospitalize such a patient as less justified than the decision to hospitalize a patient with Major Depressive Disorder. Negative attitudes were positively correlated with caring for greater numbers of patients with BPD in the past month and in the past 12 months. Nurses expressed the highest interest in studying short-term methods for treating patients with BPD and a lower percentage of psychiatrists expressed an interest in improving their professional skills in treating these patients.
   Conclusions: The findings show that nurses and psychiatrists differ from the other professions in their experience and attitudes toward patients with BPD. We conclude that nurses and psychiatrists may be the target of future studies on their attitudes toward provocative behavioral patterns (e.g., suicide attempts) characterizing these patients. We also recommend implementing workshops for improving staff attitudes toward patients with BPD.

AB Backgroutid: Deliberate self-harm (DSH) increases the danger of future suicide death and the risk increases with age. Self harm in older adults is often associated with greater suicidal intent and lethality.
   Objectives: To investigate the clinical and psychosocial variables of older patients (age 65 years) assessed due to DSH, compared with younger adults.
   Methods: Patients admitted to the Emergency Department following 051-1 during an 8 year period were included.
   Results: Of 1149 participants, 187 (16.6%) were older adults (age 65) and 962 (83.4%) were younger adults (< 65). The older adults reported DSH occurring closer to mid-day (P < 0.01) and suffered more frequently from adjustment disorder and depression than did younger adults. Personality disorders and schizophrenia were less commonly diagnosed (P < 0.001). Prescriptinn medication (sedatives and hypnotics) were a more frequent means (88% vs. 71%) of DSH among Older patients. Younger patients with DSH used over-the-counter medications (21.9% vs. 6.4%) three times more than did the older patients (P < 0:01). Past DSH was significantly mote frequent in younger adults. Following DSH the older patients were frequently admitted for further general hospitalization (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Older adults with DSH are a unique group with different clinical characteristics. There is a need for targeted prevention strategies and education of caregivers regarding DSH in older adults.

AB To evaluate the relationship between Plasma serotonin (p5-HT) levels and psychometric measures in suicidal adolescents vs. controls, 211 adolescents from three sites in Israel were divided into four groups: suicidal psychiatric inpatients (n=35); non-suicidal psychiatric inpatients (n=30); adolescents referred to the emergency room (ER) due to a suicide attempt (n=51); and a community-based control group from 4 high schools in the same catchment areas (n=95). All were interviewed and assessed for violence, aggression, depression, impulsivity, anger, anxiety, and p5-HT. p5-HT levels were significantly lower in the control group compared to all other groups. A significant negative correlation was found between p5-HT level and suicidal behavior severity among the suicidal inpatients. p5-HT did not discriminate between the psychiatric diagnostic categories and was significantly tower in ER violent compared to non-violent subjects. Gender, depression, and anger were associated with suicidal behavior in all four groups. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores together with p5-HT levels discriminated between healthy controls and other groups. p5-HT level in combination with some of the psychometric scales may serve as a safe and inexpensive peripheral marker of psychopathology, and may help to differentiate between sub-populations of suicidal adolescents. The biological mechanism behind the serotonin dysregulation in suicidal adolescents requires further investigation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.

AB Fifteen inmates from Ayalon prison, a maximum-security prison in Israel, who were convicted of murder, attempted murder, or manslaughter of their female intimate partner, have participated in a study designed to examine integrated variables-personal, interpersonal, and environmental-familial-connected with this phenomenon. Analyses of the in-depth interviews demonstrate that despite the different motivations the perpetrators displayed with regard to the murder, they share some common themes. On the basis of these themes, three primary types of female intimate partner murderers have been identified; each of them represents a personal narrative as follows: the betrayed, the abandoned, and the tyrant. The proposed typology might be used for establishing a common language among researchers, scholars, and workers in this field. It can also contribute to the existing clinical tools in terms of prediction, prevention, and treatment initiatives that currently focus on violence.

AB The objectives of this study were to identify how oncologists respond to mental health distress in their patients, what specific strategies they use in treating this distress, and what barriers they report responding to their patients' emotional distress. Twenty-three oncologists at two cancer centers were interviewed. The grounded theory method of data collection and analysis was used. Oncologists varied in their response to patients' emotional distress. Strategies used in responding to patients' distress included creating supportive relationships and prescribing medications, while barriers included patient reluctance, a lack of protocol on how to respond to patients, limited psychosocial resources, and a lack of time. Developing and adopting clear guidelines to addressing mental health distress among cancer patients is critical in assuring quality care for the whole patient and reduce the risk for poor quality of life and potential disease-related morbidity and mortality.

AB The main objective of the present study was to enrich our understanding regarding the role of personality traits in the explanation of suicidal ideation among psychiatric patients. It employed Cloniger's Tridimensional Personality Theory in order to draw a personality profile that predicts suicidal ideation among this population. A total of 172 psychiatric outpatients participated in the study. Subjects were randomly selected from a psychiatric clinic in northern Israel. All subjects were evaluated individually with three measures: the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (Cloninger, 1987; TPQ); the Beck Suicide Inventory (Beck, Steer, Handerson, Skeie, 1991; BSI); and the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis I DSM-IV Disorders (SCID; First, Spitzer, Gibbon, & Williams, 1994). Data analysis was conducted using the Linear Structural Relations (LISREL VI) program. The findings of the present study indicate that among psychiatric patients, suicidal ideation can be explained by the combination of five personality traits: impulsiveness, stoic rigidity, confidence, disorderliness, and, indirectly, pessimism through confidence and rigidity.

TI Multiple-casualty incidents in explosion
SO UNFALLCHIRURG
LA German
DT Article
AB Because of the intifada, the Israeli - Palestinian conflict has become characterized by violence against civilians on both sides. Since the early 1990s, this conflict has seen directed operations performed by suicide attackers,whose goal is to kill civilians who are not direct participants in the confrontation. For urban and local hospitals this means that they must always be aware of being confronted with limited multiple-casualty incidents. This has required a restructuring of emergency plans at the scene and in the hospital. At the scene the incident is classified according to the number and degree of injury of the victims. The accumulation of such incidents made it necessary in Israel to change views of the system of triage, which has essential differences from the central European system. Apart from changing preclinical and clinical management algorithms, the surgeons specialized in casualties must be prepared for a new quality of injuries. Barotrauma of the lung and multiple, seemingly superficial injuries often only emerge later as life-threatening and lead to the paralysis of intensive care and surgical capacity.

TI Genericness: The passage from a word mark to a lexeme
SO SEMIOTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB Linguists as well as lexicographers mention word (trade) marks as a possible source for expanding the lexicon. This phenomenon manifests genericness. We show here that the process of genericness is counter to the economic-legal essence of trademarks. And this is 'the ultimate horror for any trademark owner': The linguistic success of a mark become its economic suicide. After we investigate the economic-legal nature of trademarks and the setting that enables genericness to emerge we examine the linguistic stages of genericness. The study was conducted in Israel. it is based on Israeli legalistic data: legislation and verdicts. It is based on corpora such as Hebrew daily newspapers, literature, ads, and circular letters, and on examination of monolingual: Hebrew-Hebrew dictionaries as well as bilingual English-Hebrew and Hebrew-English dictionaries. The Israeli (Hebrew) cases serve as examples to what is a general phenomenon common to the process of genericness in all countries where the economy and market are judicially controlled (such as by 'trademark' acts, 'Law of passing-off', etc.).

AB During the Second Intifada in Palestine (2000-2004), old elements symbolising resistance against Israel reappeared in the streets. However, this time they were configured in new ways. Posters of Palestinian martyrs (suhada) martyrs killed during the conflict, as well as video tapes and cassettes containing their final statements and wills, had been distributed during the First Intifada, although not extensively. Nevertheless, during the Second Intifada it was the Islamist nationalist movement, Hamas, that used the posters for its own benefit, to serve its cause. By analysing the primary religious and cultural elements that Hamas used to construct its propaganda along with the martyr's photographs, we identify consistent patterns. The movement constructed new posters using old elements with emphasis not on the people martyred, but rather on Hamas' struggle and resistance. As a result, the individual stories and lives of those pictured in their posters were usurped for the sake of the Islamic Resistance Movement.

DE Palestinians; Hamas; suicide attacks; treason; collaborators
AB The participation of the Palestinian Authority's (PA's) security agencies in the armed struggle against Israel in the second Palestinian uprising (2000-2005) is analyzed in this article as a response to the demand of Palestinian society, thus as a unique case of armed forces which, in the lack of political directive, became more attentive to public opinion. The article shows how Palestinian public discourse in the late 1990s-early 2000s, that was shaped by the Islamic movement of Hamas, portrayed the PA's security officials as traitors. Members of the PA security agencies (mainly Fatah members) sought to reposition themselves in the "national camp," and this motivated them to raise their weapons against Israeli targets. By doing so, they also removed the mental burden of turning their weapons against fellow Palestinians that was one of the major sources for their image as collaborators.

ID TRAUMA; DISASTER; CARE
AB Two suicide bombings in and around Taba, Egypt, on 7 October 2004 created a complex medical and organisational situation. Since most victims were Israeli tourists, the National Emergency and Disaster Management Division handled their evacuation and treatment. This paper describes the event chronologically, as well as the organisational and management challenges confronted and applied solutions. Forty-nine emergency personnel and physicians were flown early to the disaster area to reinforce scarce local medical resources. Two hundred casualties were recorded: 32 dead and 168 injured. Eilat hospital was transformed into a triage facility. Thirty-two seriously injured patients were flown to two remote trauma centres in central Israel. Management of mass casualty incidents is difficult when local resources are inadequate. An effective response should include: rapid transportation of experienced trauma teams to the disaster zone; conversion of local medical amenities into a triage centre; and rapid evacuation of the seriously injured to higher level medical facilities.

ID VIOLENCE; STUDENTS
AB This article presents the results of an ethnographic case study of an Israeli Arab middle school whose staff and students are Arab Israelis from the Moslem, Druze, and Christian population sectors. Against the Israeli backdrop of multiculturalism, political tensions, and terrorism, this school has created a multi-faceted curriculum for teaching students the values of non-violence and peaceful co-existence, as well as creating a school culture that supports this curriculum. In essence, the explicit curriculum and implicit elements of the school culture together form a highly effective program for teaching non-violence. The elements of this program are identified as the integration of values education across the curriculum; immediate application of non-violent problem solving in any situation of conflict between students; the expectation that staff and students will not engage in gossip or slander against one another; staff speaking openly with students about difficult issues such as suicide bombings, and engaging them in thinking about the terrible consequences of violence; ongoing professional development for teachers in relevant areas; and strong, visionary leadership by the school's principal. The principal's status as a Druze in Israel is characterized through Collins' "outsider within" conceptualization, and this status, together with a dramatic incident of violence in the town, are seen as key factors motivating and animating the school's program. The author reflects on the complexities of insider-outsider status in regard to the school principal and to her own status as a Canadian, Jewish immigrant to Israel, researching an Israeli Arab school.

   CYCLE; WARS
AB Ending violent international conflicts requires understanding the causal factors that perpetuate them. In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Israelis and Palestinians each tend to see themselves as victims, engaging in violence only in response to attacks initiated by a fundamentally and implacably violent foe bent on their destruction. Econometric techniques allow us to empirically test the degree to which violence on each side occurs in response to aggression by the other side. Prior studies using these methods have argued that Israel reacts strongly to attacks by Palestinians, whereas Palestinian violence is random (i.e., not predicted by prior Israeli attacks). Here we replicate prior findings that Israeli killings of Palestinians increase after Palestinian killings of Israelis, but crucially show further that when nonlethal forms of violence are considered, and when a larger dataset is used, Palestinian violence also reveals a pattern of retaliation: (i) the firing of Palestinian rockets increases sharply after Israelis kill Palestinians, and (ii) the probability (although not the number) of killings of Israelis by Palestinians increases after killings of Palestinians by Israel. These findings suggest that Israeli military actions against Palestinians lead to escalation rather than incapacitation. Further, they refute the view that Palestinians are uncontingently violent, showing instead that a significant proportion of Palestinian violence occurs in response to Israeli behavior. Well-established cognitive biases may lead participants on each side of the conflict to underappreciate the degree to which the other side's violence is retaliatory, and hence to systematically underestimate their own role in perpetuating the conflict.

ID ORGANO-PHOSPHATE; CARBAMATE
AB Background: Organophosphates are frequently used as insecticides in the household and in agricultural areas, thus posing a risk for accidental exposure.
   Objectives: To describe the characteristics, clinical course and outcome of 97 patients admitted to emergency rooms with a diagnosis of acute OP poisoning.
   Methods: The clinical details of 97 patients were collected from 6 different hospitals in Israel. Diagnosis of intoxication was based on clinical findings, butyrylcholinesterase levels and, in several cases, the material brought to the hospital. Demographic, intoxication and clinical data were analyzed.
   Results: The study group comprised 64 men and 33 women whose age range was 1-70 years (mean 19.8 +/- 17.1); more than one-third of the patients were less than 10 years old. Accidental exposure was the cause of intoxication in 51.5% of the patients, and suicide in 20.6% of exposures. Intoxication occurred at home in most patients (67%), and the route of intoxication was oral in 65% of them. The patients arrived at the hospital 20 minutes to 72 hours after intoxication. Nine patients were asymptomatic, 53 presented with mild intoxication, 22 with moderate, and 13 had severe intoxication, 5 of whom died. There was a direct correlation between the degree of inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase levels and the severity of intoxication. Treatment included decontamination and antidotal medication. Duration of hospitalization ranged between 1 and 14 days (average 2.9 days).
   Conclusions: Organophosphates may cause severe morbidity and mortality. Medical staff should therefore be aware of the clinical manifestations and the antidotal treatment for this poisoning.

AB Background: Burns are a major public health problem, with long hospitalization stay in both intensive care units and general wards. In Israel about 5% of all hospitalized injuries are burn injuries. There are no long-term epidemiological studies on burn injuries in adults in Israel.
   Objectives: To identify risk factors for burn injuries and provide a starting point for the establishment of an effective prevention plan.
   Methods: We analyzed the demographic, etiologic and clinical data of 5000 burn patients admitted to the five major hospitals with burn units in Israel during a 7 year period (1997-2003). Data were obtained from the records of the Israeli National Trauma Registry. The differences between various groups were evaluated using the chi-square test.
   Results: Male gender was twice as frequent as female gender in burn patients (68.0% vs. 31.9%), and non-Jewish ethnicity was more common when considering their proportion in the total population (62.3% vs. 36.8%). Second and third-degree burns with body surface areas less than 10% constituted the largest group (around 50%). The largest age group was 0-1 years, constituting 22.2% of the cases. Inhalation injury was uncommon (1.9%). The most common etiologies were hot liquids (45.8%) and open fire (27.5%). Children less than 10 years old were burnt mainly by hot liquids while the main cause of burns for adults > 20 years old was an open flame. The majority of burns occurred at home (58%); around 15% were work related. The mean duration of hospitalization was 13.7 days (SD 17.7); 15.5% were in an intensive care unit with a mean duration of 12.1 days (SID 17.1). Surgical procedures became more common during the period of the study (from 13.4% in 1998 to 26.59% in 2002, average 19.8%). The mortality rate was 4.4%. We found a strong correlation between burn degree and total body surface area and mortality (0.25% mortality for 2nd to 3rd-degree burns with less than 10% TBSA, 5.4% for 2nd to 3rd-degree burns with 20-39% TBSA, and 96.6% for burns > 90% TBSA). The worst prognosis was for those over the age of 70 (mortality rate 35.3%) and the best prognosis was for the 0-1 year group (survival rate 99.6%).
   Conclusions: The groups at highest risk were children 0-1 years old, males and non-Jews (the incidence rate among non-Jews was 1.5 times higher than their share in the general population). Those with the highest mortality rate were victims of burns > 90% TBSA and patients older than 70. Most burns occurred at home.

AB BackgroundMedicine has undergone substantial changes in the way medical dilemmas are being dealt with. Here we explore the attitude of Israeli physicians to two debatable dilemmas: disclosing the full truth to patients about a poor medical prognosis, and assisting terminally ill patients in ending their lives.MethodsAttitudes towards medico-ethical dilemmas were examined through a nationwide online survey conducted among members of the Israeli Medical Association, yielding 2926 responses.ResultsClose to 60% of the respondents supported doctor-assisted death, while one third rejected it. Half of the respondents opposed disclosure of the full truth about a poor medical prognosis, and the others supported it. Support for truth-telling was higher among younger physicians, and support for doctor-assisted death was higher among females and among physicians practicing in hospitals. One quarter of respondents supported both truth-telling and assisted death, thereby exhibiting respect for patients' autonomy. This approach characterizes younger doctors and is less frequent among general practitioners. Another quarter of the respondents rejected truth-telling, yet supported assisted death, thereby manifesting compassionate pragmatism. This was associated with medical education, being more frequent among doctors educated in Israel, than those educated abroad. All this suggests that both personal attributes and professional experience affect attitudes of physicians to ethical questions.ConclusionsExamination of attitudes to two debatable medical dilemmas allowed portrayal of the multi-faceted medico-ethical scene in Israel. Moreover, this study, demonstrates that one can probe the ethical atmosphere of a given medical community, at various time points by using a few carefully selected questions.

AB Can we die from shame? In what way is shame a feminist issue? How have contemporary artists explored the theme? Prompted by a news item that reported the death of a leading Korean actress, which was attributed to the shame of a role she had played in a recent movie, The Scarlet Letter, this article explores shame initially through a re-reading of Sigmund Freud's challenging theory of exuality (1905) in which he plots out the ways in which shame and disgrace come into being and specifically inflect the social management of women's adult sexuality. It then offers three case studies of ways in which contemporary artists from South Africa, Zanzibar/UK and Israel/France have explored aspects of historically created shame (apartheid and truth/reconciliation, enslavement, genocide and the Holocaust) through a variety of forms of art practice, not to submit their subjects to re-shaming, but to challenge the world to be ashamed of what has been done to diminish the humanity of those who are othered for gender, ethnicity, religion.

AB Introduction: Critical hospital resources, especially the demand for ICU beds, are usually limited following mass casualty incidents such as suicide bombing attacks (SBA). Our primary objective was to identify easily diagnosed external signs of injury that will serve as indicators of the need for ICU admission. Our secondary objective was to analyze under-and over-triage following suicidal bombing attacks.
   Methods: A database was collected prospectively from patients who were admitted to Hadassah University Hospital Level I Trauma Centre, Jerusalem, Israel from August 2001-August 2005 following a SBA. One hundred and sixty four victims of 17 suicide bombing attacks were divided into two groups according to ICU and non-ICU admission.
   Results: There were 86 patients in the ICU group (52.4%) and 78 patients in the non-ICU group (47.6%). Patients in the ICU group required significantly more operating room time compared with patients in the non-ICU group (59.3% vs. 25.6%, respectively, p = 0.0003). For the ICU group, median ICU stay was 4 days (IQR 2 to 8.25 days). On multivariable analysis only the presence of facial fractures (p = 0.014), peripheral vascular injury (p = 0.015), injury >= 4 body areas (p = 0.002) and skull fractures (p = 0.017) were found to be independent predictors of the need for ICU admission. Sixteen survivors (19.5%) in the ICU group were admitted to the ICU for one day only (ICU-LOS = 1) and were defined as over-triaged. Median ISS for this group was significantly lower compared with patients who were admitted to the ICU for > 1 day (ICU-LOS > 1). This group of over-triaged patients could not be distinguished from the other ICU patients based on external signs of trauma. None of the patients in the non-ICU group were subsequently transferred to the ICU.
   Conclusions: Our results show that following SBA, injury to >= 4 areas, and certain types of injuries such as facial and skull fractures, and peripheral vascular injury, can serve as surrogates of severe trauma and the need for ICU admission. Over-triage rates following SBA can be limited by a concerted, focused plan implemented by dedicated personnel and by the liberal utilization of imaging studies.

TI "There are no chickens in suicide vests': the decoupling of human rights
   and animal rights in Israel
SO JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL ANTHROPOLOGICAL INSTITUTE
LA English
DT Article
ID POLITICS
AB In this article, I consider the shifting politics of animal rights activism in Israel in relation to human rights activism. I find that whereas in the past, human and animal rights activism were tightly linked, today they have become decoupled, for reasons I explore in this article. Although human and animal rights activism once shared social and ideological foundations in Israeli society, today much of the current animal rights activism is assertive and explicit in its disregard for human rights issues, such as the ongoing occupation of Palestine and the treatment of Palestinians. This decoupling has been heightened by the appropriation of animal rights politics by a right-wing state for the purposes of ethical legitimation. This article considers the dilemmas of ethical responsibilities towards humans and animals as it plays out in one of the most vexed political environments in the world. I consider the shifting politics of human and animal rights activism, and demonstrate how they implicate and entangle each other in the context of the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I further consider what the decoupling of the human and animal rights movements might suggest regarding the ongoing academic critique of human rights and humanism.
   << Pas de poulets sous les ceintures d'explosifs >>: dissociation des droits de l'homme et des droits de l'animal en IsraelResumeDans cet article, l'auteure examine la politique changeante des mouvements militant pour la protection des animaux en Israel en relation avec ceux qui militent pour la defense les droits de l'homme. Elle montre que les droits de l'homme et ceux des animaux etaient etroitement lies dans les mouvements activistes par le passe mais sont aujourd'hui dissocies, pour des raisons qui sont explorees dans l'article. Bien que ces militantismes aient eu autrefois des bases sociales et ideologiques communes en Israel, les defenseurs des droits des animaux affirment aujourd'hui explicitement leur desinteret pour les questions de droits de l'homme, notamment l'occupation de la Palestine et le sort des Palestiniens. Cette dissociation a ete renforcee par la mainmise d'un Etat de droite sur la politique de la protection des animaux, a des fins de legitimation ethique. L'article examine les dilemmes de la responsabilite ethique vis-a-vis des humains et des animaux dans l'un des environnements politiques les plus bouleverses au monde. Il examine la politique changeante de l'activisme pour les droits humains et animaux et montre comment les uns et les autres s'impliquent mutuellement et sont entremeles dans le contexte du conflit chronique israelo-palestinien. L'auteure etudie egalement les implications du decouplage entre les mouvements pour les droits de l'homme et pour la protection des animaux dans le cadre de la critique universitaire actuelle des droits de l'homme et de l'humanisme.

AB The on-going Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a cause of exposure to traumatic events for many people in the affected area. The present study investigated the prevalence and psychological impact of traumatic events among adolescents living in the Tel Aviv-area. 494 9th and 10th grade students (M = 15.6 years) reported exposure to 20 potentially traumatizing events and distress symptoms. The findings suggest that the prevalence of traumatic events was considerable among Israeli youth. Eighty-five percent of the students had been exposed to at least one traumatic event, and the two most common events recorded were almost being injured or killed (exposed students: 45%) and war (exposed students: 44%). Exposure to multiple traumatic events, the presence of recent exposure, and a number of specific events, in particular humiliation or persecution, attempted suicide, and childhood neglect, were associated with an increase in symptomatology. However, exposure to war, terrorist attacks, and not knowing if family members/friends were alive, did not increase the level of symptomatology. The apparently limited psychological impact of exposure to war-like events is discussed.

AB OBJECTIVESTo assess the causal directions of interaction between depression and decline in will to live (WTL) over 2 years in community-dwelling older adults.
   DESIGNCommunity-based longitudinal study.
   SETTINGThree large cities in Israel.
   PARTICIPANTSIndividuals aged 75 and older (N=870).
   MEASUREMENTSWe tested a cross-lagged structural equation model in which WTL and depressive symptoms (DS) were tested as latent variables at each of three annual points of measurement.
   RESULTSOf the health and sociodemographic covariates examined, only self-rated health predicted WTL and DS, and age predicted WTL. WTL predicted DS at each point of measurement. In addition to these cross-sectional effects, WTL also predicted DS 12 months later at the second and third year. In other words, the direction of prediction was exclusively from WTL to DS, concomitantly and over time.
   CONCLUSIONOur results indicate that WTL predicts DS rather than vice versa, suggesting that decline in WTL contributes and leads to depression at present and in future. Health strategies designed to promote WTL in older adults may help forestall depression. Moreover, psychotherapeutic interventions targeting WTL might be effective in the treatment of depression.

TI Mass casualty incident management, triage, injury distribution of
   casualties and rate of arrival of casualties at the hospitals: lessons
   from a suicide bomber attack in downtown Tel Aviv
SO EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Terrorist attacks in Israel cause mass events with varying numbers of casualties. A study was undertaken to analyse the medical response to an event which occurred on 17 April 2006 near the central bus station, Tel Aviv, Israel. Lessons are drawn concerning the management of the event, primary triage, evacuation priorities and the rate and characteristics of casualty arrival at the nearby hospitals.
   Methods: Data were collected both during and after the event in formal debriefings. Their analysis refers to medical response components, interactions and main outcomes. The event is described according to the DISAST-CIR methodology ( Disastrous Incidents Systematic AnalysiS Through - Components, Interactions and Results).
   Results: 91 casualties were reported in this event; 85 were evacuated from the scene including 3 already dead on arrival, 9 severely injured, 14 moderately injured and 59 mildly injured. Six were declared dead at the scene. Emergency medical service ( EMS) vehicle accumulation was rapid. The casualties were distributed between five hospitals ( three level 1 and two level 2 trauma centres). The first evacuated casualty arrived at the hospital within 20 min of the explosion and the last urgent victim was evacuated from the scene after 1 h 14 min. Evacuation occurred in two phases: the first, lasting 1 h 20 min, in which most of the patients with evident trauma were evacuated and the second, lasting 8 h 15 min, in which most patients presented with tinnitus and symptoms of somatisation. The most common injuries were upper and lower limb injuries, diagnosed in 37% of the total injuries, and stress-related disturbances ( anxiety, tinnitus, somatisation) diagnosed in 41%.
   Conclusion: Rapid accumulation of EMS vehicles, effective primary triage between urgent and non-urgent casualties and primary distribution between five hospitals enabled rapid conclusion of the event, both at the scene and at the receiving hospitals.

   Euthanasia; Cultural diversity; Focus groups

AB Background: End-of-life decision making constitutes a major challenge for bioethical deliberation and political governance in modern democracies: On the one hand, it touches upon fundamental convictions about life, death, and the human condition. On the other, it is deeply rooted in religious traditions and historical experiences and thus shows great socio-cultural diversity. The bioethical discussion of such cultural issues oscillates between liberal individualism and cultural stereotyping. Our paper confronts the bioethical expert discourse with public moral attitudes.
   Methods: The paper is based on a qualitative study comprising 12 focus group discussions with religious and secular persons in the USA, Germany, and Israel (n = 82). Considering the respective socio-political and legal frameworks, the thematic analysis focuses on moral attitudes towards end-of-life decision making and explores the complex interplay between individual preferences, culture, and religion.
   Results: Our findings draw attention to the variety and complexity of cultural and religious aspects of end-of-life decision making. Although there is local consensus that goes beyond radical individualism, positions are not neatly matched with national cultures or religious denominations. Instead, the relevance of the specific situatedness of religious beliefs and cultural communities becomes visible: Their status and role in individual situations, for example, as consensual or conflicting on the level of personal perspectives, family relationships, or broader social contexts, e.g., as a majority or minority culture within a political system.
   Conclusions: As the group discussions indicate, there are no clear-cut positions anchored in "nationality," "culture," or "religion." Instead, attitudes are personally decided on as part of a negotiated context representing the political, social and existential situatedness of the individual. Therefore, more complex theoretical and practical approaches to cultural diversity have to be developed.

TI Managing burn victims of suicide bombing attacks: outcomes, lessons
   learnt, and changes made from three attacks in Indonesia
SO CRITICAL CARE
LA English
DT Article
ID EXTERNAL SIGNS; INJURIES; MANAGEMENT; ISRAEL
AB Introduction Terror attacks in Southeast Asia were almost nonexistent until the 2002 Bali bomb blast, considered the deadliest attack in Indonesian history. Further attacks in 2003 ( Jakarta), 2004 ( Jakarta), and 2005 ( Bali) have turned terrorist attacks into an ever-present reality.
   Methods The authors reviewed medical charts of victims evacuated to the Singapore General Hospital ( SGH) Burns Centre during three suicide attacks involving Bali ( 2002 and 2005) and the Jakarta Marriott hotel ( 2003). Problems faced, lessons learnt, and costs incurred are discussed. A burns disaster plan drawing on lessons learnt from these attacks is presented.
   Results Thirty-one patients were treated at the SGH Burns Centre in three attacks ( 2002 Bali attack [ n = 15], 2003 Jakarta attack [ n = 14], and 2005 Bali attack [ n = 2]). For the 2002 Bali attack, median age was 29 years ( range 20 to 50 years), median percentage of total burn surface area ( TBSA) was 29% ( range 5% to 55%), and median abbreviated burn severity index ( ABSI) was 6 ( range 3 to 10). Eight of 15 patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. For the 2003 Jakarta attack, median age was 35 years ( range 24 to 56 years), median percentage of TBSA was 10% ( range 2% to 46%), and median ABSI was 4 ( range 3 to 9). A large number of patients had other injuries. Problems faced included manpower issues, lack of bed space, shortage of blood products, and lack of cadaver skin.
   Conclusion The changing nature of terror attacks mandates continued vigilance and disaster preparedness. The multidimensional burns patient, complicated by other injuries, is likely to become increasingly common. A burns disaster plan with emphasis on effective command, control, and communication as well as organisation of health care personnel following a 'team concept' will do much to ensure that the sudden onset of a crisis situation at an unexpected time does not overwhelm hospital manpower and resources.

AB Background: Deliberate self-poisoning (DSP) is recognized as a major health problem worldwide with significant morbidity. After DSP, a substantial number of patients require intensive care unit (ICU) care, but little is known about how these patients differ from patients admitted to a general medical ward.
   Methods: From January 2001 to December 2002, all adult patients admitted to Soroka University Hospital after DSP were identified by ICD-9 coded diagnoses. Demographic data, previous psychiatric illness, laboratory tests, medication used in the DSP, presenting syndromes, treatment, and time elapsed after ingestion until emergency department presentation were obtained retrospectively from the patients' charts.
   Results: Out of a total of 217 patients, 34 (15.7%) were admitted to the ICU. Their mean age was 35.9 years and 65.4% of the patients were female. In multivariate analysis, the risk factors for ICU admission were suicide attempt with an antihypertensive medication (OR=12.2, 95% CI 2.3-65.8), coma on presentation (OR = 15.8, 95% CI = 4.9-50.7), and arrival at the emergency department less than 2 h after ingestion as compared to arrival after 2 h (OR = 8.4, 95 % CI 2.6-26.7). Previous psychiatric disease had no impact on ICU admission, and a recurrent attempt was protective of ICU admission.
   Conclusions: We have shown that ingestion of antihypertensive medication, coma upon presentation, and emergency department admission less than 2 It after ingestion are predictive of ICU admission after a deliberate overdose with medication. These variables may help emergency department physicians to identify high-risk patients more quickly and, thereby, to improve patient care. (C) 2006 European Federation of Internal Medicine.

AB PURPOSE: To identify how oncology nurses address mental health distress and suicidality in patients, what strategies they employ in treating this distress, and the barriers they face in addressing distress and suicidality in patients with cancer.
   PARTICIPANTS & SETTING: 20 oncology nurses at two cancer centers in Israel were interviewed.
   METHODOLOGIC APPROACH: The grounded theory method of data collection and analysis was employed.
   FINDINGS: Strategies used in addressing patients' mental health distress were being emotionally available, providing practical support, treating physical symptoms. and referringto counseling. Strategies in addressing suicidality were assessing the situation, offering end-of-life or palliative care, treating physical symptoms, and referring for assessment. Barriers to addressing distress were lack of training. stigma. workload or lack of time, and limited availability and accessibility of mental health resources. Barriers in addressing suicidality were lack of knowledge and training, patient reluctance to receive care, and lack of protocol.
   IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Developing guidelines for addressing and responding to mental health distress and suicidality is essential to improving patients' quality of life and reducing disease-related morbidity and mortality. Reducing mental healthcare stigma for patients is critical.

AB Background: Depression is a common, under-recognized disorder that causes a great burden on the individual, the family and the community. Depressive symptomatology has serious effects on the psychological and medical condition of patients, and also disrupts their well-being and daily activities. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of depressive symptomatology in the Israeli population, and its relation to demographic variables and perceived health. Methods: A random sample of 937 Israeli adults filled out the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) together with a demographic questionnaire. Results: 21.5% scored positively for depressive symptomatology (BDI > 9). 3.8% reached a BDI score in the range of severe depression. Female gender, old age, lower education, immigrant status, manual work and lower income were associated with increased rates of depressive symptomatology. Poor perceived health was also associated with depressive symptomatology. Conclusions: The rates of depressive symptomatology in this study are similar to those found in other studies, performed mostly in Western countries. Despite several methodological limitations, we conclude that the rate and the demographic risk factors of depression in Israel are similar to that of other developed and Western countries.

AB Loneliness has been recognized as a public health problem that requires the attention of clinicians and researchers both as a condition in itself and in its relation to other conditions. This study sought to examine the relationship between self-reported loneliness, psychological distress, and social support among immigrants. A community survey of 386 recent immigrants to Israel from the former Soviet Union was conducted using the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (R-UCLA-LS), Talbieh Brief Distress Inventory (TBDI), and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). A cross-sectional design, and correlation and factor analyses were used to study the relationship between the studied variables. The distress-related and distress-free patterns of loneliness were distinguished as independent constructs, each with a specific sphere of influence. Distress-related loneliness accounted for 56.3% and distress-free for 18.2% of the total variance in individual loneliness scores. Distress-related loneliness is a generalized negative experience embedded in an array of distress symptoms, while distress-free loneliness appears to be a normal psychological reaction to dissatisfaction with current friend support. An important implication of this study in mental health practice is the sensitivity to these differences when treating recent immigrants. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Prisoners are at risk of self-harm during incarceration, yet national estimates of the rate and risk factors of self harm are rare. We aimed to examine the rate and risk factors of self-harm on aggregate and by sex using a national population-based study design. Israel Prison Service data were examined on all persons incarcerated for a criminal offense 2009-2015 (N = 263,794). Self-harm was ascertained from real-time recorded observations. The study covariates were: demographic, criminal history, and prison environment factors. The association between the risk of self-harm and study covariates was estimated with relative risks and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals fitted with a Poisson regression model. During the seven-year study period of 237,945 (91%) males and 25,849 (9%) females, 1761 inmates (0.7%) inflicted self-harm. In the total population, among females and males the relative risk of self-harm was statistically significantly (FDR P < 0.05) consistently associated with: involvement in prison misconduct, violent behavior, and verbal threats of self-harm. Risk factors that occur during incarceration may offer immediate information to assess the risk of self-harm and to develop prevention strategies.

AB Patient organizations are increasingly involved in national and international bioethical debates and health policy deliberations. In order to examine how and to what extent cultural factors and organizational contexts influence the positions of patient organizations, this study compares the positions of German and Israeli patient organizations (POs) on issues related to end-of-life medical care. We draw on a qualitative pilot study of thirteen POs, using as a unit of analysis pairs comprised of one German PO and one Israeli PO that were matched on the basis of organizational category. Bioethical positions that emanated from the interviews concerned advance directives-general views, recent legal framework, and formalization; as well as active and passive euthanasia, withholding and withdrawing of treatment, and physician-assisted suicide. In addition to the unifying, within-country impact of cultural factors, we found that constituency-based organizations and partner organizations in both countries often share common views, whereas disease-based support organizations have very heterogeneous positions. We conclude by discussing how organizational contexts provide a source of uniformity as well as diversity in the positions of POs.

AB The ESSEX system (Extremely Sensitive and Selective Explosives detector) is a system that can be used for standoff or remote detection of suicide bombers at a distance of up to a few meters via the trace amounts of explosives present in vapor phase around explosives with a high vapor pressure. The ESSEX detection method is based on laser ionization mass spectrometry (LI-MS). Direct sampling of air with explosives in vapor phase will allow detection of explosives with relatively high vapor pressure, such as TATP (suspected to have been used in the recent suicide bombings in London as well as numerous suicide bombings in Israel) and EGDN (normally found in dynamite explosives such as the ones used in the Madrid bombings). The LI-MS method has a potential to detect all or nearly all explosives. For explosives with low vapor pressure (e.g. RDX, HMX, PETN, AN) it is probably necessary to sample particles as well. Other aspects of the future potential for this method are that the number of explosives that the method targets can be increased as needed. The method is very suited for data fusion and processing, making it possible to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) into the system. The uniqueness of LI-MS methods lies in its low detection limit, possibility of real-time detection, its versatility regarding the number of possible substances to detect and its unique selectivity, leading to very few false alarms. The ESSEX concept is appropriate for indoor and outdoor applications, it is benign to humans and property and can be applied in an unnoticeable way. Laser ionization mass spectrometry and specifically resonance enhanced multi photon ionization (REMPI) is an ultra-sensitive, highly selective analytical technique that can identify and quantify vapor-phase constituents at parts-per-trillion (ppt) levels. The REMPI technique combines the principles of optical spectroscopy and mass spectrometry to provide a two-dimensional detection scheme that yields a high degree of chemical sensitivity and selectivity. This method has proven effective for the detection of one trace compound at ppt levels in the midst of others. The sensitivity and specificity for REMPI can be dramatically improved by using cooling with a supersonic jet based inlet. This cooling greatly simplifies the spectra, producing narrower and stronger electronic transitions and allows sampling directly from air. This paper describes the principles of LI-MS for standoff detection the trace amounts of explosives present in vapor phase around explosives with a high vapor pressure as well as the future potential of the method.

AB ObjectivesTo investigate the prevalence and associated psychosocial factors of occasional and repetitive direct self-injurious behavior (D-SIB), such as self-cutting, -burning, -biting, -hitting, and skin damage by other methods, in representative adolescent samples from 11 European countries.
   MethodsCross-sectional assessment of adolescents was performed within the European Union funded project, Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE), which was conducted in 11 European countries. The representative sample comprised 12,068 adolescents (F/M: 6,717/5,351; mean age: 14.90.89) recruited from randomly selected schools. Frequency of D-SIB was assessed by a modified 6-item questionnaire based on previously used versions of the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory (DSHI). In addition, a broad range of demographic, social, and psychological factors was assessed.
   ResultsOverall lifetime prevalence of D-SIB was 27.6%; 19.7% reported occasional D-SIB and 7.8% repetitive D-SIB. Lifetime prevalence ranged from 17.1% to 38.6% across countries. Estonia, France, Germany, and Israel had the highest lifetime rates of D-SIB, while students from Hungary, Ireland, and Italy reported low rates. Suicidality as well as anxiety and depressive symptoms had the highest odds ratios for both occasional and repetitive D-SIB. There was a strong association of D-SIB with both psychopathology and risk-behaviors, including family related neglect and peer-related rejection/victimization. Associations between psychosocial variables and D-SIB were strongly influenced by both gender and country. Only a minor proportion of the adolescents who reported D-SIB ever received medical treatment.
   ConclusionThese results suggest high lifetime prevalence of D-SIB in European adolescents. Prevalence as well as psychosocial correlates seems to be significantly influenced by both gender and country. These results support the need for a multidimensional approach to better understand the development of SIB and facilitate culturally adapted prevention/intervention.

AB Background: Deliberate self-poisoning (DSP) is a major health problem with increasing incidence mainly among young people. Objective: To examine the clinical and toxicological characteristics of DSP, it is compared to unintentional (non-DSP) exposures and those characteristics which might be associated with increased toxicological risk are identified. Methods: Two-year retrospective poison centre chart review. Statistics: x 2 analysis. Results: 3802 DSP cases were reported. Most calls (95%) were made by physicians compared to 51% in non-DSP exposures, P< 0.0001. There were almost twice as many females as males, contrary to unintentional exposures (P< 0.001). Peak frequency involvement was at the age of 15 - 20 years for females and older for males. Only 19.8% of DSP calls were made within the first hour of exposure compared to 46% of the non-DSP calls (P< 0.001). Younger patients tended to present earlier. The vast majority of exposures occurred by ingestion and at home. Pharmaceuticals and chemicals were involved in 86% and 12% of DSP cases, respectively ( compared to 29% and 44% in non-DSP exposures, respectively, P< 0.001). Psychiatric drugs were more commonly used in older age groups and analgesics among the younger. Insecticides, sodium hypochlorite and rodenticides were the most frequently used chemicals. Neurological involvement was observed in 48.2% of DSP patients compared to 16.9% in non-DSP exposures. DSP was associated with greater severity than non-DSP exposures ( 21% and 10% had moderate to severe toxicity, respectively, P< 0.001). Severity was greater among males, aged older than 45 years, with time from exposure to consultation 8 hours or longer and with exposure to chemicals, psychiatric drugs or combinations. Conclusions: Most DSP patients were females, aged 15 - 20 years, used pharmaceuticals and had neurological involvement. Males, aged over 45 years, with longer time to toxicology consult and the use of chemicals were associated with increased severity. These parameters should alert the treating physician to the possibility of a poor course and hence to a more aggressive therapeutic approach.

TI Short-term Focused Inpatient Treatment Combined with Sensory Regulation
   of Sexual Trauma Victims - Summary of 100 First Hospitalizations
SO ISRAEL JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY AND RELATED SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID ABUSE; WOMEN; YOUTH
AB Background: Treatment of sexual trauma victims may be fraught with crises. In situations of de-compensation, the frequency of suicide attempts is high, and ambulatory treatment may not always provide the required response. In extreme cases, either in close proximity to the sexual offence or even years later, a more intense intervention is needed. This includes removing sexual trauma victims from their daily lives and hospitalization. Caregivers debate the type of hospitalization needed and the best type of treatment in times of decompensation and dissociation.
   Method: This paper depicts a hospitalization model in Israel that has been created to provide a unique and focused solution for sexual trauma victims. The psychological principle of the hospitalization is based on Mann's short-term dynamic psychotherapy method. The patients are integrated in an acute psychiatric ward in which a variety of psychopathologies, men and women, are treated.
   Results: The paper summarizes findings and understandings from the first 100 hospitalizations. The author's main conclusion is that sexual trauma victims need a focused specialized treatment plan to best deal with their complex issues and that hospitalization should be minimized to two weeks.
   Conclusions: The author's main recommendation is that funding must be allocated for hospital beds for sexual trauma victims in each region in the country to produce adequate continuity of care for these patients.

AB Based conceptually on Problem Behavior Theory, Normalization Theory and theories of adolescent ethnic identity formation this study explores relationships between individual and cumulative multiple risk behaviors and suicidal ideation and behavior among mid-adolescents in three different populations in the Middle East. Data from the 2004 Health Behavior in School-Aged Children in the Middle-East (HBSC-ME) study included 8345 10th-grade pupils in three populations: Jewish Israelis (1770), Arab Israelis (2185), and Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank (4390). We considered risk behaviors and factors including tobacco use, bullying, medically-attended injuries, excessive time with friends, parental disconnectedness, negative school experience, truancy and poor academic performance. Substantial population differences for suicidal tendency and risk behaviors were observed, with notably high levels of suicidal ideation and behavior among Arab-Israeli youth and higher levels of risk behaviors among the Jewish and Arab-Israeli youth. For all populations suicidal tendency was at least 4 times higher among adolescents reporting 4+ risk behaviors, suggesting that similar psychosocial determinants affect patterns of risk behaviors and suicidal tendency. Results highlight the importance of understanding cultural contexts of risk behaviors and suicidal ideation and behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rubidium and lithium are rather rare elements in environmental research, despite their affiliation with a group of chemically active metals and the abundance of Rb in the environment. A growing body of evidence, although controversial, has indicated that both elements possess unique essential and neurophysiological characteristics in biota and humans. Both elements may concentrate in soil and vegetation of sub-arid environments. We investigated the content and (potential) availability of Rb and Li in the soils and natural waters of Galilee, the Coastal Plain, and the northern Negev of Israel. A newly developed chromatographic technique for the separation of truly dissolved Rb and Li compounds has been applied. High concentrations of Rb, together with high values of the potentially vital Rb-to-K ratio, were found in the soils, the soil solutions, rainwater, throughfall water, and the plant litter leachates, but not in the surface and spring waters. This may indicate a sequestration of Rb in the local soils and a semi-closed Rb turnover in the soil-plant system with a major input from sea aerosols. Low Li bulk and available concentrations were determined in all the natural compartments. Possible implications of such specific environmental features on the local population health were discussed.

TI The Death of Judas in Matthew: Matthew 27:9 Reconsidered
SO JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE
LA English
DT Article
AB The account of Judas's death in Matthew's Gospel yields opposite readings. In the traditional reading, Judas's death is damning: his suicide enacts his self-exclusion from the salvation promised in Jesus. More recently, scholars have sought to rehabilitate Judas. Far from cementing his condemnation, Judas's death is a sign of his repentance, even heroism, and points toward redemption. Matthew's use of Scripture is, I propose, illuminating for the debate. Matthew 27: 9 applies to the episode a quotation from Zechariah attributed (famously) to Jeremiah. Scholarly attention has focused on the problem of (mis)attribution. I argue, rather, that the "mistake" is useful: in calling up both Zech 11 and Jeremiah, Matthew sets the death of Judas within a particular scriptural history. A close reading of Jer 19 together with Zech 11 reveals a dense interweaving of vocabulary and themes, an intertextuality that informs Matt 27. Themes of innocent blood and defilement emerge in all three, and Judas's problematic "repentance" finds in LXX Zechariah's use of a precursor that opens up the debate. Against this scriptural background, Judas's death unfolds as a story not of one man only but of a people and a land, a story set within Israel's larger story in which both devastation and hope-indeed restoration-may, in the blood of Jesus, be true.

AB The influence of the changes in atmospheric state, typical for areas close to big deserts, on acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was analyzed. Under test was the group of 3256 patients (77 % males, 23 % females), hospitalized in the Cardio-Surgical Department of Soroka Medical Center at Ben-Gurion University (BGU, Israel) during 2000-2008. To explore the relationship between atmospheric parameters and AMI, multivariate regression analysis has been performed. AMI was most frequent in winter to spring and least in summer. The highest number of cases was recorded in December and the lowest in September. Hospital admissions showed a higher prevalence in men than in women; the ratio is 3.3/1.0. About 60 % of males were aged between 45 and 65 years old with maximum similar to 55 (21 %), whereas 60 % of women hospital admissions were aged between 65 and 80 years old with maximum similar to 72 (24 %). The result suggested that the monthly mean relative humidity at daytime and its overall daily differences, wind speed, and respirable fraction of particulate concentration are associated with the admission for AMI. The results of the study confirm the importance of atmospheric state variability for cardiovascular diseases.

AB One of the most common psychiatric diagnoses among adolescents is anxiety disorder. Many of the anxiety symptoms are expressed physiologically, and therefore can mimic other medical conditions. The aim of this study was to examine the association between anxiety disorders and other medical conditions sharing common symptoms with anxiety (MDSCSA: Irritable Bowel Syndrome, asthma, migraine and hyperhidrosis). The study was based on the national database of the candidates for military service in Israel. Data for the years 1998-2013 was retrieved to create the study dataset. The final cohort population was comprised of 1,229,461 military service candidates. Anxiety prevalence and its association with other medical conditions sharing the same symptoms was examined in the cohort. The results showed significant statistical association between anxiety and IBS, asthma, migraine and hyperhidrosis. These findings support the fact that there is a clear association between anxiety disorder and the examined medical conditions. Moreover, in the military setting, the primary care physician has an important role in giving a correct diagnosis for soldiers presenting with symptoms that can be regarded both to anxiety and to other physical illnesses.

AB Aim: Research on the east-west health divide has provided extensive evidence of poorer health in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union than in Western Europe. This study focuses on immigrants from Eastern to Western Europe and analyses whether they have an increased risk of self-reported poor health compared with the host population and what determines that. Methods: This cross-sectional study is based on 373 immigrants from Poland, other East European countries, and the former Soviet Union, aged 25-84, who arrived in Sweden after 1944 and were interviewed during 1993 2000 along with their 35,711 Swedish counterparts. Results: Age- and sex-adjusted unconditional logistic regression showed in general a 92% higher risk of reporting poor health among immigrants than among Swedish-born respondents. The risk also persisted after adjustment for several potential confounders (living singly, having a poor social network, low socioeconomic status, and smoking) and after an additional adjustment for acculturation (language at home), and years in Sweden. Conclusions: Being born in Eastern Europe or the former Soviet Union was an independent risk factor for reporting poor health. It is therefore suggested that it is important for primary and public care services to be aware of the health status and needs of immigrants from these countries.

TI Voice and silence: Why groups take credit for acts of terror
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE competition; credit taking; Israel; ITERATE; terrorism
AB Terrorism is designed to draw attention to particular issues and causes. Yet, the incidence of credit-taking (announcing one's responsibility for acts of terror) varies even though anonymity can undermine the clarity of the intended messages. This article offers an explanation of the variation in credit-taking that emphasizes how the competitive context in which groups operate shapes terrorists groups' need to cultivate support for their activities. Increasing numbers of terrorist organizations make it difficult for the supporters of terrorism to reward the perpetrators of particular attacks with their backing. Since such support is critical to the proper functioning of terrorist organizations, groups use claims of responsibility to distinguish themselves from those that had no hand in the violence. Consequently, variation in the probability of credit-taking fluctuates as a function of the number of active terrorist groups in a given theater of operations. This argument is contrasted with theories that suggest credit-taking is influenced by: the ideological mix of terrorist organizations; the willingness of governments to respond to terrorism using military force; state sponsorship; the depth of communal grievances; and the use of suicide attacks. The results, based on an analysis of transnational terrorism events conducted in the Israeli theater of operations between 1968 and 2004, suggest that competitive context is a consistently strong predictor of credit-taking. By implication, the results point to the utility of counter-terrorism strategies that interfere with the transmission of information between terrorist organizations and their supporters.

AB Terror exposure has become commonplace in Israel, with civilians needing to develop appropriate coping mechanisms. This study investigated coping mechanisms of those who are able to return to leisure activity at sites of previous terror attacks. A specially designed questionnaire, exploring knowledge of the terror event, previous terror exposure, coping mechanisms, state of anxiety, and mood, was administered to 93 restaurant attendees at sites of well-known recent terror attacks (2001-2005). Most respondents were aware of the previous terror attack (92.3%) and most reported no fear at revisiting (70.3%), with 20.9% reporting some anxiety and 5.5% reporting moderate or severe anxiety. Sixty percent reported that they have no fear that a terror attack will reoccur at the same place. Some (27.7%) reported change in practices or decrease in one or more activity, especially use of public Uunsport (18%). The most helpful reported resource for facilitating stress coping following a suicide bombing was to "call or be in touch with friends or relatives," and least helpful was "medicines." Over half of respondents (53%) reported that the current security climate affected their mood. Older individuals and females were more affected by terror events. Study observations confirm that resilience develops in the general population in response to ongoing terror attacks. Response to terror is heterogeneous with a range of coping mechanisms expressed.

AB Background Many physicians treat themselves despite established guidelines against such practice.
   Aims To examine whether general practitioners (GPs) are satisfied with their personal primary care and how this could be improved.
   Methods We sent a questionnaire to GPs in Israel. We examined the gap between preference to use formal medical care and use in practice, satisfaction with physicians' primary healthcare, self-prescribing and ways to improve physician access to care.
   Results There were 203 respondents (response rate 203/985; 21%). Sixty-one per cent reported not having a GP. Older respondents were less likely to have their own GP. Thirty-seven per cent of physicians reported receiving less formal medical care than they desired. This gap was higher in those reporting self-prescription of benzodiazepines and anti-depressants (P < 0.05) and was significantly associated with dissatisfaction with primary healthcare. Odds for being satisfied with personal care was reduced by more than 85% in GPs who reported receiving less formal medical care than they desired (odds ratio 0.146; 95% confidence interval 0.064-0.333).
   Conclusions Our findings inform the profile of physician self-treatment and the dissatisfaction associated with it. Dissatisfaction was associated with a gap between desired and actual care rather than with having or not having a personal GP. There was no consensus regarding what would assist physicians to access GPs.

AB Background: Self-injurious behaviors in adolescence are a serious public health concern. Aims: The current study aims to expand our understanding of motives for direct self-injurious behaviors (D-SIB). We examined the explicit motives but also the actual antecedents and consequences of D-SIB over time. Method: As part of the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) study, adolescents between the ages of 14 and 18 years from Israel completed self-report questionnaires at baseline, 3-month, and 12-month follow-ups. Results: Decreases in social support predicted later increases in D-SIB, an effect mediated by negative affect. Both peer and parental support also exerted quadratic effects on D-SIB. Thus, low as well as high support predicted subsequent D-SIB. In turn, D-SIB was followed by increased peer and parental support. Limitations: Our methodology relies on self-reports, affected by social desirability and recall biases. Conclusion: The findings support a causal path for the development of D-SIB: from interpersonal distress to emotional distress and then to D-SIB. They also point to interesting avenues regarding subgroupings of adolescents who self-injure depending on their motives. Finally, our results reveal that D-SIB, although of negative import, might paradoxically be effective in serving certain functions such as gaining support from parents and peers.

AB The study examined news media coverage of Israeli female political criminals to determine how the media construct and portray women who commit ideological crimes against the state, ultimately to discern what these framing choices suggest about women involved in political crimes. Studies show that the media tend to rely on stereotypical gender frames to portray female criminals and their motivations to the public. These frames depict women perpetrators as motivated to commit political crime for personal reasons as opposed to political reasons, which are often cited for male criminal behavior. The study examined the Israeli news media's use of stereotypical gender news frames when reporting on three Israeli women who committed ideological crimes against the state. The study compared the coverage of these cases among three Israeli newspapers representing different political affinities. As a country with a long history of political conflict, Israel offers a unique opportunity to examine gender bias in the media's coverage of female actors in the public sphere. The study's theoretical contribution lies in its analysis of Israeli female political criminals who, by definition of their crime, acted within the political sphere. The study confirms previous research on the subject - mainly that the media rely on gender frames and explanations of personal motive in its portrayals of female criminals.

LA English
DT Article
DE international security; national security; terrorism; resiliency;
   counterterrorism
AB This article is a qualitative analysis of nation-state population "resiliency'' to several spectacular and/or highly symbolic terrorist assaults that were watershed events. It draws heavily from qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) frameworks to isolate and identify the presence of what Goertz calls the "secondary dimensions'' of a "primary concept'' such as resiliency to terrorist assaults. In turn, the presence of those secondary dimensions and their strength presuppose and derive from "tertiary indicators'' that are the basic metrics and concrete manifestations of those secondary dimensions. The nation-states under consideration include the London bombings of 2005, the United States for 9/11, the Madrid bombings of 2004, the first suicide bombings within pre-1967 boundaries of Israel, and the Russian Federation in the case of the 2002 terrorist assault against the Dubrovka Theater in Moscow. The results serve as the basis for the development of a "resiliency continuum'' of nation-states where placement of those countries on the continuum reflect "nonresilient,'' "semiresilient,'' and "resilient'' conditions, themselves defined by the number of secondary dimensions found in each case study. In the process, the analysis illuminates possible interconnections between "context specific'' factors, such as a country's historical experience with terrorism and population characteristics (e. g., education levels, degree of heterogeneity) to the resiliency or nonresiliency condition, and describes possible links between exogenous "systems factors'' such as war and power ranking to the resiliency condition.

AB In this second installment of his interview for JPS, Khalid Mishal, Hamas politburo chief since 1996 and head of the movement since the assassination of Shaykh Ahmad Yasin in 2004, continues his discussion of Hamas's evolution and strategy. Whereas the focus of part I was Mishal's personal background, political formation, and the founding of the movement, here Hamas's more recent history is foregrounded. From the unfolding conflict and troubled relations with Fatah since the mid-1990s, Mishal recounts the thinking behind the decision formally to integrate into the Palestinian political system born of Oslo by participating the 2006 legislative elections and joining the Palestinian Authority government. He also delves into the ongoing repercussions of these decisions, including the splits within the Palestinian movement culminating in Hamas's seizure of power in the Gaza Strip in June 2007. In the course of the more than three-hour interview, Mishal's straightforward manner is on display, as well as his willingness to be challenged on matters as sensitive as Hamas's suicide bombings and the targeting of Israeli civilians, the utility of armed resistance, and the morality of the struggle.
   Two themes underlying the interview were Mishal's preoccupation with the need to repair the intra-Palestinian split ("our greatest priority") and the devastating impact of the ongoing siege of the Gaza. Since our interview in early March 2008, two potentially significant developments with relevance to these concerns have taken place. On the internal Palestinian front, Mishal repeatedly emphasized the need for intra-Palestinian dialogue without preconditions, with all subjects on the table including controversial topics like early elections. A first step toward reconciliation was made on 24 March 2008, when Hamas and Fatah representatives signed the "Sana'a Declaration," negotiated in the Yemeni capital, which outlined points of consensus on various domestic issues including security and political institutions. Though the declaration quickly ran aground, with Fatah demanding that Hamas immediately cede control of Gaza before implementation of other aspects would be discussed, by June 2008, Hamas and Fatah were once again considering national unity talks on the basis of the Yemeni initiative. As for alleviating the extreme external pressures on the Hamas-led Gaza Strip, indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel mediated by Egypt produced a bilateral cease-fire that went into effect on 18 June. Though initially confined to Gaza, the understandings also call for a gradual reversal of the siege as well as renewed negotiations on a prisoner exchange, including the release of captured IDF soldier Gilad Shalit.
   Hovering over both Hamas-Israel and Hamas-Fatah relations is Washington, which remains opposed to any deals through which the Palestinian Islamists can emerge from their enforced isolation. Yet whatever the ultimate success of either development, the reality is that Mishal and Hamas are increasingly central players in the intraPalestinian, Israeli-Palestinian, and broader regional equations. Indeed, it was Mishal, not Abbas, whose movement reached an agreement with Israel before the expiration of the Bush administration.

TI Long bone fractures caused by penetrating injuries in terrorists attacks
SO JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE
LA English
DT Article
ID BLAST INJURIES; GUNSHOT WOUNDS
AB Background: High-energy penetrating injuries are increasingly common in the civilian setting. During the years 2000 to 2003, more than 70 suicide bombing attacks occurred in Israel. These were characterized by high numbers of casualties, primarily caused by blast injuries. Injury caused by a blast can be either a primary blast effect of acceleration-deceleration of the blast wave or a secondary effect of metal fragments deliberately placed in explosives, causing severe penetrating injuries. The latter type of injury may result in severe open limb fractures.
   Methods: We identified and reviewed 91 patients with 117 long bone fractures caused by penetrating terror-related injuries treated in our institution during 2000 to 2003. The patients were divided according to the mechanism of injury, i.e., either gunshot injury or blast injuries; several parameters were compared.
   Results: Patients in the blast injury group included more children and elderly patients than the gunshot injury group did. This group also had a significantly higher Injury Severity Score and a higher number of associated injuries, including multiple fractures and mortality. The treatment modalities for the fractures were similar for both groups, as was the fracture final outcome. Local soft tissue injury was more severe in the gunshot injury group, as demonstrated by a higher number of type IIIC fractures, as well as more nerve injuries.
   Conclusion: Terror attacks may produce several modes of severe penetrating injuries causing high-grade open fractures. These should be aggressively treated by physicians remaining cognizant of other systemic and general implications of such a severe trauma.

ID TERRORIST BOMBINGS; EXPLOSIONS; ATTACKS; TRAUMA; MANAGEMENT; SEVERITY;
   PATTERN; ISRAEL; CARE
AB Objective: To present the radiological features of blast-related injuries in the victims of the 10 October 2015 Ankara bombing and emphasize the importance of imaging.
   Methods: This retrospective descriptive study included a total of 28 patients who underwent CT scan or radiographic imaging within 6 h after the bombing on 10 October 2015. CT scans and plain radiographs were evaluated regarding mechanisms of injuries. Injuries were categorized as primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary. The number of shrapnel and distribution of injuries were noted. Injury Severity Score (ISS) was used to rank the severity of the injury.
   Results: Primary blast injuries consisted of only tympanic membrane rupture. A high rate of patients (21/28 patients) in the study group suffered from secondary blast injuries. Tertiary injuries were detected in only three patients. Of the severely injured patients, five had abdominal injuries, three had thoracic injuries and six had extremity injuries. ISS was significantly higher in patients with thoracic and abdominal injuries.
   Conclusion: Our results after the suicide bomb attacks showed that the most common injury pattern was secondary blast injury. The torso was the most commonly injured body region, followed by the extremities. This specific injury pattern requires the use of immense radiological imaging. Hence, radiologists should be aware of the mechanisms and spectrums of blast-related injuries.
   Advances in knowledge: Both the unique injury pattern and the following chaos make blast-related injuries a challenge in terms of triage, diagnosis and management. Radiologists should be familiar with the wide spectrum of these unique injuries.

AB Introduction: This study investigated the long-term effects of different traumatic environments on adolescents. Environments were characterized by different threats that varied in predictability, duration, and the extent to which the threat can be defended against. The research examined: 1) Jerusalem during the Second Intifada (2001-2004), 2) Israel's northern cities during the Second Lebanon War (2006), and 3) cities that suffered neither the suicide bombings (that occurred in Jerusalem) nor the rocket bombardments (that occurred in the north).
   Method: Data was collected from surveys administered to 115 subjects aged 19-28 who were adolescents in the aforementioned cities at the relevant times but were not directly affected by terror. Participants were administered the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) and the Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R).
   Results: No significant differences were found between subjects who lived in different traumatic environments as adolescents in levels of depression, posttraumatic symptoms (PTS) or posttraumatic growth (PTG). In fact, a pattern in the data indicates that adolescents in Jerusalem were less negatively impacted by their environment than were the other groups, even though Jerusalem experienced an unpredictable threat that could not be defended against, a chronic chaotic environment.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that the effects of a chronic chaotic environment did not produce significantly more symptoms than other environments when examined several years later. Reactions to terror, including parental attitude towards adolescents' daily routine, are also discussed.

ID MARKOV POPULATION PROCESSES; MODELS; LIMITS
AB This article presents the first models developed specifically for understanding the infiltration and interdiction of ongoing terror plots by undercover intelligence agents, and does so via novel application of ideas from queueing theory and Markov population processes. The resulting "terror queue" models predict the number of undetected terror threats in an area from agent activity/utilization data, and also estimate the rate with which such threats can be detected and interdicted. The models treat terror plots as customers and intelligence agents as servers. Agents spend all of their time either detecting and infiltrating new terror plots (in which case they are "available"), or interdicting already detected terror plots (in which case they are "busy"). Initially we examine a Markov model assuming that intelligence agents, while unable to detect all plots, never err by falsely detecting fake plots. While this model can be solved numerically, a simpler Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion approximation yields some results in closed form while providing nearly identical numerical performance. The transient behavior of the terror queue model is discussed briefly along with a sample sensitivity analysis to study how model predictions compare to simulated results when using estimated versus known terror plot arrival rates. The diffusion model is then extended to allow for the false detection of fake plots. Such false detection is a real feature of counterterror intelligence given that intelligence agents or informants can make mistakes, as well as the proclivity of terrorists to deliberately broadcast false information. The false detection model is illustrated using suicide bombing data from Israel.

AB Although many plans for peace in the Middle East have been proposed over the years, none have seriously considered the psychological needs that promote conflict and violence, and thus, far none have been successful. This chapter uses Terror Management Theory, which is a general theory of the role of culture and self-esteem in providing psychological security, to shed light on forces that motivate and perpetuate the ongoing cycle of violence in this region. From this perspective, threats to one's cultural worldviews and self-esteem promote violence because they undermine the ability of these psychological entities to provide the protection from anxiety that is needed for psychological well-being and effective functioning. Consequently, people disparage and lash out at those who threaten their worldviews and self-esteem. Research exploring the role of worldviews and self-esteem in providing security and the impact of threats to this security in promoting violence is reviewed, with special emphasis on the operation of these processes in promoting support for violence against perceived enemies in Israel, Iran, and the United States. This analysis also suggests factors that reduce support for violence; research demonstrating the impact of activating compassionate religious values, a sense of shared humanity, close interpersonal attachments, and removing the association between lofty values and violence is discussed.

AB Objective: To suggest guidelines for hospital organization during terror-related multiple casualty incidents (MCIs) based on the experience of 6 level I trauma centers.
   Summary Background Data: Most terror-related MCIs are bombings. The sporadic nature of these events complicates in-hospital preparation.
   Methods: Data were collected at all level 1 Trauma centers during/ after MCIs for the Israel National Trauma registry. Patients were included if they were admitted or died in hospital following injury in suicide bombings (October 1, 2000 to June 30, 2003), which fulfilled Ministry of Health suggested criteria for MCIs (number of admissions, severity of injury).
   Results: Included were 325 casualties from 32 events, 34% of which had an Injury Severity Score > 16. A third of the admissions arrived within 10 minutes and 65% within 30 minutes. Forty percent of the patients underwent CT scans directly from the ED. Operative procedures were performed on 60% of patients and 36% were transferred directly from the ED to the OR. Initiation of surgical procedures peaked at 1 to 1.5 hours, mainly multidisciplinary abdominal, thoracic, and vascular surgery. Orthopedic and plastic surgery predominated later. A third of the patients were admitted to ICUs, often (31%) directly from the ED.
   Conclusions: High staffing demands for ED, OR, and ICU overlap. Anesthesiologists, general, thoracic, and vascular surgeons are in immediate demand. ICU admissions occur simultaneously with ongoing patient arrival to the ED. Most patients operated within the first 2 hours require multidisciplinary surgical teams. Demand for orthopedic and plastic surgery and anesthesiology services continues for > 24 hours.

TI Contemplating Medicine During the Third Reich: Scaffolding Professional
   Identity Formation for Medical Students
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB Problem
   The moral failures of physicians and the medical establishment in Germany and Austria during the Third Reich challenge medicine and medical education in a way few other events do. They compel medical educators to ensure that lessons learned from contemplating medicine during the Third Reich be integrated into current and future physicians' professional identities. Most health professions education programs, however, have not adopted this study domain in their curricula.
   Approach
   The authors describe a new curriculum module-" The Holocaust and Medicine"-and its implementation in October 2013 at Bar-Ilan University Faculty of Medicine in the Galilee, Safed, Israel, as a requirement for all medical students (starting with the class of 2017). This innovative module integrates historical facts, guided reflection, flipped classroom pedagogy, and program evaluation efforts. It spans 20 months of the preclinical curriculum, embedded within a doctoring course and a medical humanities longitudinal course and integrated within the clinical sciences blocks.
   Outcomes
   The evaluation approach will seek to measure changes in learners' knowledge and attitudes, capture their experience with the module, and assess the module's contribution to their identities as future healers.
   Next Steps
   This module aims to sensitize learners to medicine's fundamental dilemmas (e.g., prejudice, assisted reproduction and suicide, physicians in war), ideally enhancing critical reflection on the potential danger of "slippery slopes." The authors propose that contemplation of medicine after the Holocaust and the implications for contemporary practice should be an integral component of health professions education to promote humanistic, ethically responsible practice.

AB Based on notions posited by problem behavior theory, the primary goal of the current study was to examine the possibility that adolescents who engage in NSSI are not a homogeneous group but are rather divided into 2 subgroups: (a) adolescents who exclusively engage in NSSI, and (b) adolescents who are involved in NSSI alongside other problem behaviors (e.g., drug abuse, unprotected sexual intercourse). Participants were a school sample of 436 adolescents from 6 high schools across Israel, who completed self-report questionnaires during school hours on engagement in NSSI and other problem behaviors, self-esteem, self-criticism, ego clarity, coping strategies, self-efficacy to regulate affect, and sociodemographic information. Findings indicated that 22% of the sample reported engaging in NSSI. Adolescents who reported engaging in NSSI had higher prevalence rates of involvement in other problem behaviors compared to those who did not report engaging in NSSI. However, a comparison between those who exclusively engaged in NSSI and those who were involved in NSSI alongside other problem behaviors indicated that lower ego clarity, lower self-esteem, and poorer self-efficacy to regulate affect, alongside higher self-criticism and greater use of disengagement coping mechanisms characterized exclusive engagement in NSSI. Distinct theoretical models are needed to characterize different forms of NSSI: NSSI, which is an exclusive and singular phenomenon, for which problems related to the self are prominent, versus NSSI, which is accompanied by other problem behaviors. Accordingly, the implications related to school psychologists' work in the assessment, treatment, and prevention of NSSI are suggested.

TI Differences between soldiers, with and without emotional distress, in
   number of primary care medical visits and type of presenting complaints
SO ISRAEL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE emotional distress; medical officer; primary care; somatic complaints
ID PSYCHOLOGICAL ILLNESS; FREQUENT ATTENDERS; DEPRESSION; PREDICTORS;
   MORBIDITY; SYMPTOMS; MILITARY; ANXIETY
AB Background: In 2003 a total of 43 soldiers in the Israel Defense Forces committed suicide; only 20% of them were known to the IDF mental health services. Somatic symptoms are often the only presentation of emotional distress during the primary care visit and may be the key to early identification and treatment.
   Objectives: To examine whether the information in the medical records of soldiers can be used to identify those suffering from anxiety, affective or somatoform disorder.
   Methods: We conducted a case-control study using the information in the electronic medical records of soldiers who during their 3 year service developed affective disorder, anxiety, or somatoform disorder. A control group was matched for recruitment date, type of unit and occupation in the service, and the Performance Prediction Score. The number and reasons for physician visits were collated.
   Results: The files of 285 soldiers were examined: 155 cases and 130 controls. The numbers of visits (mean +/- SD) during the 3 and 6 month periods in the case and control groups were 4.7 +/- 3.3 and 7.1 +/- 5.0, and 4.1 +/- 2.9 and 5.9 +/- 4.6 respectively. The difference was statistically significant only for the 6 month period (P < 0.05). The variables that remained significant, after stepwise multivariate regression were the Performance Prediction Score and the presenting complaints of back pain and diarrhea.
   Conclusions: These findings may spur the development of a computer-gene rated warning for the primary care physician who will then be able to interview his or her patient appropriately and identify mental distress earlier.

   disorder; Kindling; Neurologic; Depression
ID BORDERLINE PERSONALITY-DISORDER; RISK-FACTORS; DEPRESSION; SCALE
AB Background: A large body of evidence supports the importance of genetic risk factors in bipolar disorder (BPD), but less is known about the role of stressful life events (SLE). This study assessed the role of SLE in childhood, adulthood and one year prior to first episodes of both depression and mania in BPD.
   Methods: Three groups of 50 matched subjects each were assessed: patients with BPD, with borderline personality disorder (BLPD) and healthy controls. Structured clinical interviews were used for diagnoses. The Coddington Life Events Schedule and the Israel Psychiatric Epidemiology Research Interview Life Event Scale measured life events and were confirmed with a semi-structured interview for subjective experience for each SLE.
   Results: In BPD, the total number of SLE was lower during childhood and higher in the year preceding the first depression compared to controls and the proportion of loss-related events in childhood was higher. In the year preceding the first depressive episode, BPD subjects had more total, negative uncontrolled and independent but not positive SLE. In the year preceding the first episode of mania, the total number of uncontrolled, negative SLE were higher in BPD, whereas positive and separation-related SLE were not. After the first episode, BPD subjects had less SLE than controls.
   Conclusions: Negative and loss-related SLE are common in BPD subjects, occur in the year preceding the first episodes of depression and mania and are less common in childhood or after the onset of the disorder. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   HOSPITALIZATION; PREDICTORS; INPATIENTS; PLACEMENT; PATTERNS
AB Objectives: To examine the characteristics of patients whose first admission to Israel's psychiatric units was involuntary, and to identify a specific profile of the patients at increased risk for future readmissions. Our hypothesis was that when the first admission of a patient was involuntary, the number and duration of future hospitalizations would be greater. Method: We used information extracted from the National Psychiatric Case Registry on all patients admitted for the first time during 1991 (N=2,150) and on their follow-up over the next ten years. Chi-square statistics were used to test for significance differences in demographic and clinic variables between patients hospitalized voluntarily and those hospitalized involuntarily. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify a specific profile of risk of recidivism during a ten-year period (1991-2000). Results: Compared with patients admitted voluntarily, those who were admitted involuntarily had a significantly greater number and duration of rehospitalizations. They were more likely be diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia while the voluntarily admitted patients were more likely be diagnosed as having an affective disorder. Risk factors for the number of readmissions included: young age, legal status (involuntary) of the first admission, as well as period of residence in the country. Risk factors affecting the duration of readmissions were single/widowed status, native born and a suicide attempt in the two months prior to the first admission. Conclusions: Two distinct profiles for the number of readmissions and inpatient days were identified. A diagnosis of schizophrenia and selected demographic variables were better at predicting risk of recidivism than the involuntary legal status of the first admission.

AB Objective: Evaluation of the demographics, features, and outcomes of musculoskeletal injury patterns caused by terrorism in the civil setting and comparing injuries from explosions with gunshot injuries.
   Design: Retrospective cohort analysis of a prospective database.
   Setting: National trauma registry consisting of all the six Level I and four Level II trauma centers.
   Patients: A total of 1245 casualties with terror-related musculoskeletal trauma. Five hundred fifty-one had high-velocity gunshot wound and 694 blast wounded (BW) caused by explosion.
   Main Outcome Measurements: Demographic and injury data analyzed for age, gender, New Injury Severity Score, and associated injuries. Outcome of were analyzed according to length of hospital stay, intensive care unit stay, surgical procedures, and mortality.
   Results: Severe injuries (New Injury Severity Score 16 or greater) were more common in the BW group (P < 0.01). In the BW group, a significantly higher proportion of casualties had associated injuries (73% versus 43%), intensive care unit care, longer length of stay, and mortality. Orthopaedic injuries were similar among the two groups with more open extremity fractures in the gunshot wound group and less significant injuries in the BW group. With casualties matched to the same New Injury Severity Score groups, the ones with the musculoskeletal injuries had longer hospitalization than those without.
   Conclusions: Musculoskeletal injury caused by blast is associated with multiple penetrating injuries, differing from more "conventional'' penetrating trauma such as caused by gunshot injuries. Although the treatment of specific injuries caused by both mechanisms is essentially similar, the systemic effect of the blast must be taken into consideration in anticipation of an increased overall injury severity.

TI Terror-inflicted thermal injury: A retrospective analysis of burns in
   the Israeli-Palestinian conflict between the years 1997 and 2003
SO JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE
LA English
DT Article
DE burns; terror; trauma
AB Background: Terror attacks have changed in the past decade, with a growing tendency toward explosives and suicide bombings, which led to a rise in the incidence of thermal injuries among victims. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict of October 2000 marked a turning point when an organized terror campaign commenced. This article presents data of terror-associated burns from the Israeli National Trauma Registry (ITR) during the years 1997 to September 2000 and October 2000 to 2003.
   Methods: We analyzed demographic and clinical characteristics of 219 terror-related burn patients and 6,546 other burn patients admitted to hospitals in Israel between 1997 and 2003. Data were obtained from the ITR.
   Results: Burns contributed about 9% of all terror related trauma and about 5% of all other trauma (p < 0.0001). These percentages have not changed significantly before and after October 2000. Terror-related burns afflict Jewish males more than predicted by their percentage in the population, whereas other burns afflict non-Jewish males more than predicted. Adults and young adults (15-59 years) are the predominant group in terror-related bums (80%), whereas children younger than 15 years are the predominant group in other burns (50%). Large burns (20% to 89% total body surface area) are more common in terror casualties, with greater mortality (6.4% in terror-related versus 3.4% in others; p = 0.0258).
   Conclusion: Although the incidence of burns has risen because of an organized campaign, this change was noticeable in other trauma forms as well in similar proportions. Terror-related burns afflict a targeted population, and generally take on a more severe course with greater mortality rates, thus requiring appropriate medical treatment.

   SYMPTOMS; DISORDER; IMPACT; CANCER
AB Background Numerous studies have indicated that comorbid anxiety and depression are associated with a more severe course of illness. Yet generally, the study of the effect of psoriasis on patients' mental health has considered anxiety and depression to be separate states. Objective To measure the association between psoriasis and anxiety, depression and anxiety-depression co-occurrence among patients according to their socioeconomic statuses (SES). Methods A nationwide population-based study of psoriasis patients and age and gender frequency-matched controls (n = 255 862) was designed. Diagnostic data were obtained from Clalit Health Services, the largest managed care organization in Israel. This database was established using continuous real-time input from healthcare providers, pharmacies, medical care facilities and administrative computerized operating systems. Results After controlling for demographic and clinical variables, psoriasis was associated with anxiety (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01-1.23, P < 0.05), depression (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.08-1.26, P < 0.001), and anxiety and depression co-occurrence (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.21-1.45, P < 0.001) among patients with low SES, yet was associated only with anxiety (OR 1.15 95% CI 1.04-1.27, P < 0.001) but not depression or comorbid anxiety-depression among patients with high SES. Survival analyses indicated that between the ages of 40 and 60, the cumulative probability of psoriasis patients with low SES to suffer from anxiety, depression and their co-occurrence inclined more sharply with age as compared to psoriasis patients with high SES. Conclusions As psoriasis patients with low SES are prone to suffer from more severe courses of anxiety and depression, the choice of treatment of psoriasis should address the SES as well as the underlying psychiatric disease.

ID QUALITY INDEX; ASSOCIATION; DIAGNOSIS; HYPOXIA
AB Study Objectives: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with suicidal ideation (SI) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). There are no studies of OSA diagnosed by sleep study and SI in patients with PTSD.
   Methods: Forty consenting civilians with PTSD (38 female, mean +/- standard deviation age: 44.60 +/- 12.73) underwent a Level 3 home sleep apnea test (WatchPAT200; Itamar Medical, Israel). OSA severity was measured with the respiratory disturbance index (RDI) (number of apneas, hypopneas and respiratory effort related arousals per hour). SI was measured with Items 9, 35, 39, and 50 of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Other patient-rated measures included the Beck Depression Inventory, second edition (BDI-II), PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index PTSD Addendum modified to include only Items 1c, 1e, 1f, and 1g that address nightmares.
   Results: The RDI (r = .757, P < .001) and oxygen desaturation index (r = .633, P < .001) were directly correlated to SI. Multiple regression analysis using SI as the dependent variable and patient-rated measures as independent variables revealed only RDI (beta = .480, t = 4.167, P < .001) and BDI- II (beta = .469, t = 3.375, P = .002) as predictors of SI, with adjusted R-2 = 0.718. In patients with RDI < 30 events/h (n = 37) correlation of SI with RDI (r = .511, P = .001) but not ODI (r = .312, P = .060) remained significant. Multiple regression analysis (when RDI < 30 events/h) revealed only BDI- II (beta = .603, t = 3.492, P = .002), and not RDI (beta = .247, t = 1.723, P = .096) as a significant predictor of SI.
   Conclusions: OSA severity in PTSD was directly related to SI. Depression was a significant mediator in the relationship between RDI and SI, with OSA-related intermittent hypoxemia possibly contributing to this relationship only in severe OSA.

ID CASE-MANAGEMENT; REHOSPITALIZATION; INVOLUNTARY; RECIDIVISM; COMMITMENT;
   DISORDERS; RISK
AB Aim To study social, demographic, clinical, and forensic profiles of frequently re-hospitalized (revolving-door) psychiatric patients.
   Methods The study included all patients (n = 183) who were admitted to our hospital 3 or more times during a 2-year period from 1999 through 2000. We compared these patients to 2 control groups of patients who were admitted to our hospital in the same period. For comparison of forensic data, we compared them with all non revolving-cloor patients (n = 1056) registered in the computerized hospital database and for comparison of medical and clinical data we compared them with a random sample of non revolving-door patients (n =98). The sample was sufficiently large to yield high statistical power (above 98%).We collected data on the legal status of the hospitalizations (voluntary or involuntary) and social, demographic, clinical, and forensic information from the forensic and medical records of revolving-door and non revolving-door patients.
   Results In the period 1999-2000, 183 revolving-door patients accounted for 771 (37.8%, 4.2 admissions per patient) and 1056 non revolving-door patients accounted for 1264 (62.5%,1.2 admissions per patient) of the 2035 admissions to our hospital. Involuntary hospitalizations accounted for 23.9% of revolving-door and 76.0% of non revolving-door admissions. Revolving-door patients had significantly shorter mean interval between hospitalizations, showed less violence, and were usually discharged contrary to medical advice. We found no differences in sex, marital status, age, ethnicity, diagnoses, illegal drug and alcohol use, or previous suicide-attempts between the groups.
   Conclusions Revolving-door patients are not necessarily hospitalized for longer time periods and do not have more involuntarily admissions. The main difference between revolving-cloor and non revolving-door patients is greater self-management of the hospitalization process by shortening the time between voluntary re-admission and discharge against medical advice.

AB Objective To compare the drowning mortality rates and proportion of deaths of each intent among all drowning deaths in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in 2012-2014.
   Design A population-based cross-sectional study.
   Setting 32 OECD countries.
   Participants Individuals in OECD countries who died from drowning.
   Main outcome measures Drowning mortality rates (deaths per 100000 population) and proportion (%) of deaths of each intent (ie, unintentional intent, intentional self-harm, assault, undetermined intent and all intents combined) among all drowning deaths.
   Results Countries with the highest drowning mortality rates (deaths per 100000 population) were Estonia (3.53), Japan (3.49) and Greece (2.40) for unintentional intent; Ireland (0.96), Belgium (0.96) and Korea (0.89) for intentional self-harm; Austria (0.57), Korea (0.56) and Hungary (0.44) for undetermined intent and Japan (4.35), Estonia (3.70) and Korea (2.73) for all intents combined. Korea ranked 12th and 3rd for unintentional intent and all intents combined, respectively. By contrast, Belgium ranked 2nd and 15th for intentional self-harm and all intents combined, respectively. The proportion of deaths of each intent among all drowning deaths in each country varied greatly: from 26.2% in Belgium to 96.8% in Chile for unintentional intent; 0.7% in Mexico to 57.4% in Belgium for intentional self-harm; 0.0% in nine countries to 4.9% in Mexico for assault and 0.0% in Israel and Turkey to 38.3% in Austria for undetermined intent.
   Conclusions A large variation in the practice of classifying undetermined intent in drowning deaths across countries was noted and this variation hinders valid international comparisons of intent-specific (unintentional and intentional self-harm) drowning mortality rates.

AB Purpose: This innovative pilot study was designed to provide research-based evidence on the variables to consider informing a child of his/her cancer diagnosis, so as to minimize the negative psychosocial effects of the cancer experience on survivors. The hypotheses of the study were that "good information" about cancer, will allow the child a better understanding way to cope with treatment and improve sociopsychological outcomes at adulthood.
   Methods: Ninety-one adult childhood cancer (CC) survivors got the questionnaires while waiting to their routine checkup at a grate CC medical center in center Israel.
   Results: To our surprise and not according to the hypothesis, there was a difference between children diagnosed up to 12 years of age and those diagnosed during adolescence. (Participants were divided into two groups according to their age at diagnosis: from birth to 12 years old and from age 12-18). In the group diagnosed at a younger age, those who had received "good information" were found to have better quality of life, lower mental pain, and higher mental pain tolerance than did those in the same group (diagnosed at a younger age) who received "not good information." By contrast, in the group diagnosed during adolescence, those who had received "not good information" scored higher on these measures than did their counterparts who had received "good information."
   Conclusion: Given that information conveyed to children diagnosed with cancer can have a significant impact on survivors' quality of life, further research is needed to determine the precise information to be divulged to children at the time of diagnosis. In the meantime, extreme caution, sensitivity, and careful judgment are required.

AB Introduction: Mildly injured and "worried well" patients can have profound effects on the management of a mass-casualty incident. The objective of this study is to describe the characteristics and lessons learned from an event that occurred on 28 August 2005 near the central bus station in Beer-Sheva, Israel. The unique profile of injuries allows for the examination of the medical and operational aspects of the management of mild casualties.
   Methods: Data were collected during and after the event, using patient records and formal debriefings. They were processed focusing on the characteristics of patient complaints, medical response, and the dynamics of admission.
   Results: A total of 64 patients presented to the local emergency department, including two critical casualties. The remaining 62 patients were mildly injured or suffered from stress. Patient presentation to the emergency department was bi-phasic; during the first two hours following the attack (i.e., early phase), the rate of arrival was high (one patient every three minutes), and anxiety was the most frequent chief complaint. During the second phase, the rate of arrival was lower (one patient every 27 minutes), and the typical chief complaint was somatic. Additionally, tinnitus and complaints related to minor trauma also were recorded frequently.
   Psychiatric consultation was obtained for 58 (91%) of the patients. Social services were involved in the care of 47 of the patients (73%). Otolaryngology and surgery consultations were obtained for 45% and 44%, respectively. The need for some medical specialties (e.g., surgery and orthopedics) mainly was during the first phase, whereas others, mainly psychiatry and otolaryngology, were needed during both phases. Only 13 patients (20%) needed a consultation from internal medicine.
   Conclusions: Following a terrorist attack, a large number of mildly injured victims and those experiencing stress are to be expected, without a direct relation to the effectiveness of the attack. Mildly injured patients tend to appear in two phases. In the first phase, the rate of admission is expected to be higher. Due to the high incidence of anxiety and other stress-related phenomena, many mildly injured patients will require psychiatric evaluation. In the case of a bombing attack, many of the victims must be evaluated by an otolaryngologist.

AB Background: Mental health problems and risk behaviours among young people are of great public health concern. Consequently, within the VII Framework Programme, the European Commission funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted in eleven European countries, with Sweden as the coordinating centre, and was designed to identify an effective way to promote mental health and reduce suicidality and risk taking behaviours among adolescents.
   Objective: To describe the methodological and field procedures in the SEYLE RCT among adolescents, as well as to present the main characteristics of the recruited sample.
   Methods: Analyses were conducted to determine: 1) representativeness of study sites compared to respective national data; 2) response rate of schools and pupils, drop-out rates from baseline to 3 and 12 month follow-up, 3) comparability of samples among the four Intervention Arms; 4) properties of the standard scales employed: Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-II), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (Z-SAS), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), World Health Organization Well-Being Scale (WHO-5).
   Results: Participants at baseline comprised 12,395 adolescents (M/F: 5,529/6,799; mean age=14.9 +/- 0.9) from Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain. At the 3 and 12 months follow up, participation rates were 87.3% and 79.4%, respectively. Demographic characteristics of participating sites were found to be reasonably representative of their respective national population. Overall response rate of schools was 67.8%. All scales utilised in the study had good to very good internal reliability, as measured by Cronbach's alpha (BDI-II: 0.864; Z-SAS: 0.805; SDQ: 0.740; WHO-5: 0.799).
   Conclusions: SEYLE achieved its objective of recruiting a large representative sample of adolescents within participating European countries. Analysis of SEYLE data will shed light on the effectiveness of important interventions aimed at improving adolescent mental health and well-being, reducing risk-taking and self-destructive behaviour and preventing suicidality.

TI The Dual Process of Adolescent Immigration and Relocation From Country
   to Country and from Childhood to Adolescence-Its Reflection in
   Psychodynamic Psychotherapy
SO PSYCHOANALYTIC STUDY OF THE CHILD, VOL 63
SE Psychoanalytic Study of the Child
LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
ID SUICIDE ATTEMPTS; ATTACHMENT
AB This chapter presents psychological issues and processes in adolescent patients who have also migrated or relocated from one country to another Theoretical perspectives related to attachment processes illumine both migration and adolescence as changes for which secure bases are most needed, lost, and sometimes rediscovered. The psychodynamic processes underlying the difficulties encountered by such adolescents, and their meaning, are presented. Relationships with parents, which normally go through separation-individuation and renegotiation of the oedipal crisis, both of which are central to adolescence, are disrupted by migration. Migration poses new challenges and choices while identity formation is evolving during adolescence. These include adopting a new identity, embracing and letting go of the old, and accepting and integrating the new. The dual relationship with identity finds expression, for example, in language. Fluctuations in understanding and not understanding the new and the old language represent the ambivalence toward the new and the old. The developmental roller-coaster of adolescence, which involves more intense use of defense mechanisms, is heightened during immigration. Processes of idealization (of parents, therapist, old country, new culture) rapidly fade with the devaluation of the same targets. Mechanisms of splitting between good and bad, as well as massive repression of issues that are too hard to deal with at this crossroad, are profuse. Hopeful fantasies of rebirth are concurrent with despair, depression, and, in some cases, suicidal thoughts and attempts.
   Excerpts from a case in psychodynamic psychotherapy are presented, focusing on the evolving new balances: integrating the old and the new by maintaining attachments to the one while forming attachments to the other; relinquishing and mourning the lost paradise of childhood, as well as the old country, friends, culture, smells, and tastes; accepting disappointments when the shining new terrain of the new country is not the fantasized promised land; negotiating processes of splitting that have been employed in the false hope of quieting the internal turmoil of the transitions (the good vs. the bad country, parents, therapist, and developmental tasks); finding new ways of coping with the deep despair of losing all the above, and the urge to give it all up; and, finally, forming an integrated identity, built on both the old and the new. The processes are elucidated by examples from the psychotherapy of an adolescent Ethiopian-born immigrant to Israel.

TI Lessons From Analyzing the Medical Costs of Civilian Terror Victims:

AB Across the globe, the threat from terrorist attacks is rising, which requires a careful assessment of long-term medical support. We found 3 major sources of costs: hospital expenditures, mental health services dedicated to acute stress reactions, and ambulatory follow-up. During the first year, most of the costs were related to hospitalization and support for stress relief. During the second year, ambulatory and rehabilitation costs continued to grow. Public health specialists should consider these major components of costs and their evolution over time to properly advise the medical and social authorities on allocating resources for the medical and nonmedical support of civilian casualties resulting from war or terror.
   ContextAcross the globe, the threat from terrorist attacks is rising, which requires a careful assessment of long-term medical support. Based on an 18-month follow-up of the Israeli civilian population following the 2014 war in Gaza, we describe and analyze the medical costs associated with rocket attacks and review the demography of the victims who filed claims for disability compensation. We then propose practical lessons to help health care authorities prepare for future confrontations.
   MethodUsing the National Insurance Institute of Israel's (NII) database, we conducted descriptive and comparative analyses using statistical tests (Fisher's Exact Test, chi-square test, and students' t-tests). The costs were updated until March 30, 2016, and are presented in US dollars. We included only civilian expenses in our analysis.
   FindingsWe identified 5,189 victims, 3,236 of whom presented with acute stress reactions during the conflict. Eighteen months after the conflict, the victims' total medical costs reached $4.4 million. The NII reimbursed $2,541,053 for associated medical costs and $1,921,792 for associated mental health costs. A total of 709 victims filed claims with the NII for further support, including rehabilitation, medical devices, and disability pensions.
   ConclusionWe found 3 major sources of costs: hospital expenditures, mental health services dedicated to acute stress reactions, and ambulatory follow-up. During the first year, most of the costs were related to hospitalization and support for stress relief. During the second year, ambulatory and rehabilitation costs continued to grow. Public health specialists should consider these major components of costs and their evolution over time to properly advise the medical and social authorities on allocating resources for the medical and nonmedical support of civilian casualties resulting from war or terror.

TI Do Burns Increase the Severity of Terror Injuries?
SO JOURNAL OF BURN CARE & RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID EXPERIENCE
AB The use of explosives and suicide bombings has become more frequent since October 2000. This change in the nature of terror attacks has marked a new era in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We previously reported that the incidence of thermal injuries has since risen. However, the rise in the incidence of bums among victims of terror was proportionate to the rise in the incidence of burns among all trauma victims. This paper presents data from the Israeli National Trauma Registry during the years 1997-2003, to compare the severity of injuries and outcome (mortality rates) in terror victims with and without burn injuries. We also compare the severity of injuries and outcome (mortality rates) for patients with terror-attack related burns to non terror-attack related burns during the same period. Data was obtained from the Israeli National Trauma Registry for all patients admitted to 8 to 10 hospitals in Israel between 1997 and 2003. We analyzed and compared demographic and clinical characteristics of 219 terror-related burn patients (terror/burn), 2228 terror patients with no associated burns (Terror/no-burn) and 6546 non terror related burn patients (burn/no-terror). Severity of injuries was measured using the injury severity score, and burn severity by total body surface percentage indices. Admission rates to Intensive Care Units (ICU) and total length of hospitalization were also used to measure severity of injuries. In-hospital mortality rates were used to indicate outcome. Of burn/terror patients, 87.2% suffered other accompanying injuries, compared with 10.4% of burn/no-terror patients. Of burn/terror patients, 49.8% were admitted to ICU compared with only 11.9% of burn/no-terror patients and 23.8% of no-burn/terror patients. Mean length of hospital stay was 18.5 days for the terror/burn group compared with 11.1 days for the burn/no-terror group and 9.5 days for the terror/no-burn group. Burn/terror patients had a significantly higher injury severity score compared with the other groups. In-hospital mortality rate for the burn/no-terror group was 3.4%. The burn/terror group had a mortality rate of 6.4% which was similar to the no-burn/terror group (6.6%). Terror-attack injuries with accompanying burns have a more complex presentation, are of higher severity, and are associated with increased length of hospital stay and a higher ICU admissions rate, compared with terror-attack injuries without burns and non terror-attack related bums. However, mortality rates in terror-attack injuries are not affected by burns. (J Burn Care Res 2008;29:887-892)

AB Background No established treatment algorithm exists for patients with schizophrenia. Whether switching antipsychotics or early use of clozapine improves outcome in (first-episode) schizophrenia is unknown.
   Methods This three-phase study was done in 27 centres, consisting of general hospitals and psychiatric specialty clinics, in 14 European countries and Israel. Patients aged 18-40 years who met criteria of the DSM-IV for schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective disorder were treated for 4 weeks with up to 800 mg/day amisulpride orally in an open-label design (phase 1). Patients who did not meet symptomatic remission criteria at 4 weeks were randomly assigned to continue amisulpride or switch to olanzapine (<= 20 mg/day) during a 6-week double-blind phase, with patients and staff masked to treatment allocation (phase 2). Randomisation was done online by a randomisation website; the application implemented stratification by site and sex, and applied the minimisation method for randomisation. Patients who were not in remission at 10 weeks were given clozapine (<= 900 mg/day) for an additional 12 weeks in an open-label design (phase 3). The primary outcome was the number of patients who achieved symptomatic remission at the final visits of phases 1, 2, and 3, measured by intention-to-treat analysis. Data were analysed with a generalised linear mixed model, with a logistic link and binomial error distribution. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01248195, and closed to accrual.
   Findings Between May 26, 2011, and May 15, 2016, we recruited 481 participants who signed informed consent. Of the 446 patients in the intention-to-treat sample, 371 (83%) completed open-label amisulpride treatment, and 250 (56%) achieved remission after phase 1.93 patients who were not in remission continued to the 6-week double-blind switching trial, with 72 (77%) patients completing the trial (39 on olanzapine and 33 on amisulpride); 15 (45%) patients on amisulpride versus 17 (44%) on olanzapine achieved remission (p=0.87). Of the 40 patients who were not in remission after 10 weeks of treatment, 28 (70%) started on clozapine; 18 (64%) patients completed the 12-week treatment, and five (28%) achieved remission. The number of serious adverse events did not differ between the treatment arms in phase 2: one patient on olanzapine was admitted to hospital because of an epileptic seizure, and one patient on amisulpride was admitted to hospital twice because of exacerbations of psychotic symptoms. Over the course of the trial, two serious suicide attempts were reported.
   Interpretation For most patients in the early stages of schizophrenia, symptomatic remission can be achieved using a simple treatment algorithm comprising the sequential administration of amisulpride and clozapine. Since switching to olanzapine did not improve outcome, clozapine should be used after patients fail a single antipsychotic trial-not until two antipsychotics have been tried, as is the current recommendation.
