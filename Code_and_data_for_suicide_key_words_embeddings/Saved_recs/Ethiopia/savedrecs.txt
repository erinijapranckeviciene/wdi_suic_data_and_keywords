AB Background: Suicide is an emergency psychiatric problem that needs an urgent intervention. Ethiopia, as a nation, has been experiencing high burden of suicide. Cultural taboo, stigma, and criticism associated with suicidal behaviors affect the communities' attitude and practice toward suicide and its help-seeking behaviors. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis will provide the pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, and completed suicide in Ethiopia.
   Methods: This review protocol is designed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P 2015 Guidelines). Studies reporting the prevalence of suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, and completed suicide will be included from the databases of PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Web of Sciences. The reference lists of retrieved articles, Google Scholar, and national health database reporting suicide will be also searched. No time and language restrictions will be imposed on the search strategy. The methodological quality of included studies will be assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool. The heterogeneity between studies will be measured by the index of heterogeneity (I-2 statistics) test. Funnel plots and Egger's test will be used to determine publication bias. Moreover, subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be carried out. The pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, and completed suicide will be calculated by metaprop command using random effects model with the Dersimonian and Laird method.
   Discussion: This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the available epidemiological evidences about suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, and completed suicide. The final results of this review will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at conferences. The review of the results will help to raise awareness about the burden of suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, and completed suicide in Ethiopia.

AB Background: People with severe mental disorders (SMD) are at higher risk of suicide. However, research into suicide attempts and completed suicide in people with SMD in low-and middle-income countries is mostly limited to patients attending psychiatric facilities where selection bias is likely to be high.
   Methods: A population-based cohort of 919 people with SMD from rural Ethiopia (who received standardized clinician diagnoses of schizophrenia (n = 358) major depressive disorder (n = 216) and bipolar I disorder (n = 345)) were followed up annually for an average of 10 years. The Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation chart was administered by psychiatrists and used to evaluate systematically suicidal behavior and risk factors, which may be amenable to intervention.
   Results: Over the follow-up period, the cumulative risk of suicide attempt was 26.3% for major depression, 23.8% for bipolar I disorder and 13.1% for schizophrenia, (p < 0.001). The overall incidence of completed suicide was 200.2/100,000 person-years (CI = 120.6, 312.5). Hanging was the most frequent method used (71.5%) for both attempters and completers. Most people who completed suicide were successful on the first attempt (84.2%), but the case-fatality rate for suicide attempt was 9.7%. In the adjusted logistic regression model, being currently married (Adjusted OR) =2.17, 95% CI = 1.21, 3.91), and having a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder (Adjusted OR = 2.59, 95% CI = 1.57, 4.26) or major depression (Adjusted OR = 2.71, 95% CI = 1.60, 4.58) were associated significantly with increased risk of suicide attempts.
   Conclusion: In this sample of people with SMD from a rural setting, the rate of suicide was high. Initiatives to integrate mental health service into primary care need to focus on limiting access to suicide methods in people with SMD in addition to expanding access to mental health care.

ID PREVENTING SUICIDE
AB Background: Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Global, estimation of suicide and suicidal behavior is leading cause of death and burden of diseases which is also the third leading cause of death in prison. It is a common mental health problem, and the magnitude is high especially in countries where mental health service is poor. Suicide ideation is the leading cause to commit suicide. However, there is lack of study regarding suicide in prison in African countries including Ethiopia. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of suicidal ideation and associated factors among prisoners in Addis-Ababa correctional center Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 2015. Methods: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April to June 2015. Systematic random sampling technique was used to get a total of 423 samples of prisoners. After obtaining ethical clearance from the University of Gondar and Amanuel Mental Specialized Hospital and verbal consent from the respondents, data were collected. The collected data were coded, entered, and cleaned by Epi Info version 7 and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. The strength of association was presented by odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI). The independent variables that fulfill P < 0.2 in the bivariate logistic regression analysis were entered to multivariable logistic regression analysis by enter method. Variables with P < 0.05 in multivariable logistic regression analysis were considered as have statistically significant association with dependent variables. Result: A total of 423 prisoners participated with 100% response rate. The magnitude of suicidal ideation in the last 1 month was 35 (8.04%); 95% CI (5.6-11.1). Being male (AOR = 2.962, 95% CI [1.307, 6.712]), perceived stigma (AOR = 2.666, 95% CI [1.161, 6.122]), and family history of suicide (AOR = 2.291, 95% CI [1.736, 7.129]) was associated with suicide ideation. Conclusions and Recommendations: The magnitude of suicide ideation in prisoners was higher than the general population. Hence, special attention pertaining to suicide prevention; should be given for prisoners.

AB Background: People with severe mental disorders are associated with increased risk of suicide and suicide attempts compared to the general population. In low and middle-income countries, research concerning suicide attempts and completed suicide among people living with severe mental disorder is limited. The objective of this study was to assess suicide and attempts in people with severe mental disorder at Amanuel Mental Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
   Methods: Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted in August-September 2016. Patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder were selected using systematic random-sampling technique. The composite international diagnostic interview was used to assess suicide that was administered by psychiatry professionals. Substance use disorder was assessed through face-to-face interviews using structured clinical interview of DSM-IV.
   Results: A total of 542 (272 schizophrenia +270 bipolar disorder) patients were included in the study. One hundred nineteen (43.75%) of schizophrenic participants and 128 (47.1%) of bipolar participants have suicidal ideation. Fifty-six (20.7%) of schizophrenic participants and 58 (21.3%) of bipolar participants have suicidal attempt. Among the schizophrenic and bipolar patients who had suicidal ideation, 31.8 and 32.60% had co-morbid substance use disorder, respectively.
   Conclusion: In this study, which was performed in Ethiopia, suicidal ideation and attempt were shown to be common problems in people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Co-morbid substance use disorder was a more frequent phenomenon among patients with suicidal ideation and attempt. Attention should be given to screen and assess suicidal ideation and attempt in persons with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

AB Objective: Young age, availability of weapons, and stressful life events, increase the risk of suicide. The aim of the present study was to assess additional risk factors for suicide in the Israeli army.
   Methods: We conducted a case-control study, to assess risk factors for suicide. The cases comprised soldiers who died by suicide during their military service (n = 462; 0.039% of all soldiers in the cohort). The control group consisted of soldiers who did not commit suicide but were in active service during the investigated period (n = 1,170,895; 99.96%). Predictor variables, including socio-demographic and psychiatric diagnoses, were considered.
   Results: Using a Generalized Linear Model with a Binary Logistic dependent variable to predict suicide, while controlling the effect of intervening variables, we found the following variables enhanced the risk for committing suicide: male (RR = 6.703; P < 0.001), country of origin: Ethiopia (RR = 4.555; P = 0.014), low socioeconomic status (RR = 1.448; P = 0.016) and low adjustment difficulties (RR = 2.324; P < 0.001). In addition, we found that in males only, Cluster B Personality Disorder (RR = 2.548; P = 0.027), low (RR = 1.657; P = 0.002), to average motivation to serve in a combat unit (RR = 1.322; P = 0.046) increased the risk for suicide.
   Conclusions: IDF Soldiers bearing a psychiatric diagnosis or severe adjustment difficulties remained tightly monitored through their military service, and were found to be at a lower risk for suicide. However, those enlisted with mild (low) difficulties, were found to be at greater risk for suicide, as well as soldiers whose country of origin is Ethiopia. Suicide prevention program should focus on monitoring soldiers with these risk factors, together with soldiers' guidance regarding help seeking and de stigmatizing suicide.

AB Attempted suicide is known to be an important risk factor of committed suicide. Past studies of the relationship of attempted suicide with mental disorders have shown that it is most closely related to depression. The objective of the present study was to clarify characteristics of depression and measures to prevent committed suicide by comparing depression with other mental disorders. The patients with depression were significantly more often aged, males, married, and used methods other than poisoning by solids or liquids compared with patients with other mental disorders. Particularly, the major risk factors of attempted suicide (i.e. a younger age and the female gender), did not apply to our depressed patients. These results suggest that approaches such as intensive psychiatric treatment may lead to the prevention of committed suicide in older male patients with depression who have attempted suicide.

AB Background: Suicidal ideation and attempts are more frequent in people with epilepsy than in general population and suicide attempt increases the chance of later completed suicide. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of suicidal ideation and attempt among people with epilepsy in Amanuel Mental Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
   Methods: Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from May to June 2014 at Amanuel Mental Specialized Hospital among people with epilepsy. The pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire was used for interviewing the study participants. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess predictors of suicidal ideation and attempt.
   Results: The study indicated that the prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempt among people with epilepsy were 29.8 and 14.1%, respectively. Poor social support, drug treatment for mental illness, had co-morbid depression, no seizure free within 1 year and family history committed suicide were significantly associated with suicidal ideation and attempt.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempt in people with epilepsy found to be higher when compared to general population. Therefore, screening all epilepsy patients should be done for early diagnosis and treatment.

AB Background: Suicide is a major public health problem worldwide. It contributes for more than one million deaths each year. Since previous suicidal attempt was considered as the best predictor of future suicide, identifying factors behind suicidal attempt are helpful to design suicide prevention strategies. The aim of this study was to assess socio-demographic characteristics, clinical profile and prevalence of existing mental illness among patients presenting with suicidal attempt to emergency services of general hospitals in South Ethiopia.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study on patients presenting with complications of suicidal attempt to emergency departments of two general hospitals in Hawassa city from November, 2014 to August, 2015. Data was collected using semi-structured questionnaire which contained socio-demographic and clinical variables. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview version 5 (MINI PLUs) was used to assess the prevalence of existing mental illness among study participants. Data was entered and analyzed using IBM SPSS statistics 21 software package.
   Results: A total of 96 individuals were assessed, of whom 56 (58.3%) were females. The mean age of study participants was 21.5 (8.0) years. The majority, 75 (78.1%), of the study participants were aged below 25 years. Ingesting pesticide poisons and corrosive agent were used by the majority to attempt suicide. Mental illness was found in only three (3.1%) of the study participants. Impulsivity (the time between decision to attempt suicide and the actual attempt of less than 5 min) was reported by 30 (31.2%) of the study participants, of whom 18 (60%) were males. Males were found three times more likely to attempt suicide impulsively than women (COR = 3.0, 95% CI 1.2-7.3). Quarreling with family members, facing financial crisis, and having unplanned and unwanted pregnancy were reported by the majority of study participants as immediate reasons to attempt suicide.
   Conclusions: The presence of stressful life events and impulsivity behind suicidal behavior of the younger generation implies that designing suicide prevention strategies for this group is crucial. Moreover, further research is needed to systematically examine the relationship between the presence of mental illness and suicidal attempt with a larger sample size and more robust methodology.

AB Purpose: Little information exists on the mental health implications of child marriage in Africa. This study examined the association between child marriage and suicidal ideation and suicide attempt among girls aged 10-17 years.
   Methods: Data were drawn from a 2007 cross-sectional survey conducted in the Amhara region, Ethiopia. Multilevel logistic regression was used to analyze risk factors for suicidality.
   Results: Approximately 5.2% of girls reported ever being married, 5.4% were promised in marriage, and 9.3% reported receiving marriage requests. Girls who were ever married (odds ratio [OR] = 1.81; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03-3.18), were promised in marriage (OR = 2.35; 95% CI = 1.38-4.01) or had received marriage requests (OR = 2.29; 95% CI = 1.46-3.59) were significantly more likely than girls who were never in the marriage process to have had suicidal thoughts in the past 3 months. Residence in communities with high involvement in stopping child marriage was protective of suicidal ideation. The odds of suicide attempt were twice as high among girls with marriage requests as among those with none.
   Conclusions: Child marriage was associated with increased odds of suicidality. Findings call for stronger community engagement in child marriage prevention and mental health support for child brides. (C) 2013 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Suicide is a common problem worldwide and the magnitude is high especially in countries where mental illnesses are prevalent and psychiatric services are poor.
   Objective: To determine the prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts among patients who attended the Psychiatry clinic of Gondar University Hospital.
   Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted from March-December 2006 involving a total of 474 patients. Data was collected using a pre tested structured questionnaire containing basic socio-demographic variables, psychiatric diagnosis, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, the methods of suicide attempt and ways of survival from the attempted suicide. It was administered by psychiatry nurses working in the clinic. The data was analyzed anonymously using SPSS software.
   Results: The commonest mental illness was Major Depressive Disorder (51.3%) followed by Psychosis (38%). Ninety one (19.2%) patients attempted suicide at least once after the onset of the current mental illness and 307(64.8%) have suicidal ideation. The common method of suicidal attempt was hanging (45.1%) and 69.2% were at home. An association was found between suicidal ideation and attempt (OR=33.7; CI=8.2-138.8, p-value < 0.01).
   Conclusion: Suicidal ideation was common in psychiatric patients. It was also associated with suicidal attempt.

AB Judaism considers the duty of preserving life as a paramount injunction. Specific injunctions against suicide appear in the Bible, Talmud, and thereafter. Nevertheless, Jewish tradition emphasizes that one should let himself be killed rather than violate cardinal rules of Jewish law. Mitigating circumstances are found for the six deaths by suicide mentioned in the Bible, for example to account for one's sins, or avoid shameful death. Heroic suicide is praised throughout the Jewish history, from the suicide of Samson and the collective suicide in Masada, to the collective readiness of Jews in Medieval times and during the Holocaust to kill themselves rather than succumb to their enemies. Suicide rates for Jews are lower than those of Protestants and Catholics. Similarly, suicide rates in Israel are lower in comparison to Europe and North America, although being higher than those in most Moslem Asian and North African countries. This low rate of suicide is found in Jewish Israelis of all ages, including in adolescents. Elevated suicidal risk may be found in specific sub-populations, including male Israeli soldiers, immigrants from the former USSR and Ethiopia, in particular adolescent immigrants from the former USSR, elderly Holocaust survivors, and young Israel-Arab women. The meaning of these findings is discussed according to different socio-cultural perspectives.

AB There are very few population-based studies on the mental health consequences of intimate partner violence (IPV) from Ethiopia. This study was conducted among 510 'ever partnered' women in AgaroTown in February 2007. Mental distress and depression were measured using self-reporting questionnaires and Kessler's Scales. All types of IPV (physical, sexual and emotional abuses) were significantly associated with mental distress and depression. Women who suffered from physical, sexual and emotional abuses were more likely to have mental distress. We recommend using information education communications to educate the community and thereby preventing IPV and the mental health consequences.

AB Background: Injury related to self-harm is one of the leading causes of global disease burden. As a formative work for a programme to implement comprehensive mental healthcare in a rural district in Ethiopia, we determined the 12-month prevalence of non-fatal suicidal behaviour as well as factors associated with this behaviour to understand the potential burden of the behaviour in the district.
   Method: Population-based (n = 1485) and facility-based (n = 1014) cross-sectional surveys of adults, using standardised, interview-based measures for suicidality (items on suicide from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview), depressive symptoms (the Patient Health Questionnaire) and alcohol use disorders (Alcohol Use Disorder Investigation Test; AUDIT).
   Results: The overall 12-month prevalence of non-fatal suicidal behaviour, consisting of suicidal ideation, plan and attempt, was 7.9 % (95 % Confidence Interval (CI) = 6.8 % to 8.9 %). The prevalence was significantly higher in the facility sample (10.3 %) compared with the community sample (6.3 %). The 12-month prevalence of suicide attempt was 4.4 % (95 % CI = 3.6 % to 5.3 %), non-significantly higher among the facility sample (5.4 %) compared with the community sample (3.8 %). Over half of those with suicidal ideation (56.4 %) transitioned from suicidal ideation to suicide attempt. Younger age, harmful use of alcohol and higher depression scores were associated significantly with increased non-fatal suicidal behaviours. The only factor associated with transition from suicidal ideation to suicide attempt was high depression score. Only 10.5 % of the sample with suicidal ideation had received any treatment for their suicidal behaviour: 10.8 % of the community sample and 10.2 % of the facility sample. Although help seeking increased with progression from ideation to attempt, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups.
   Conclusion: Non-fatal suicidal behaviour is an important public health problem in this rural district. A more in-depth understanding of the context of the occurrence of the behaviour, improving access to care and targeting depression and alcohol use disorder are important next steps. The role of other psychosocial factors should also be explored to assist the provision of holistic care.

AB Background. Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide but information about it is sparse in Sub-Saharan Africa. Suicide-related behaviours can provide an insight into the extent of this compelling consequence of mental illness.
   Method. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with a representative sample of persons aged 18 years and over (n = 6752) in 21 of Nigeria's 36 states (representing about 57 % of the national population). Suicide-related outcomes, mental disorders, as well as history of childhood adversities were assessed using the World Health Organization (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).
   Results. Lifetime prevalence estimates of suicide ideation, plan and attempts were 3.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-6.5], 1-0% (95% CI 0.4-7.5) and 0.7% (95% CI 0.5-1.0) respectively. Almost two of every three ideators who made a plan went on to make an attempt. The highest risks for transition from ideation to plan and from plan to attempt were in the first year of having ideation or plan respectively. Mental disorders, especially mood disorders, were significant correlates of suicide-related outcomes. Childhood adversities of long separation from biological parents, being raised in a household with much conflict, being physically abused, or being brought up by a woman who had suffered from depression, anxiety disorder, or who had attempted suicide were risk factors for lifetime suicide attempt.
   Conclusions. History of childhood adversities and of lifetime mental disorders identify persons at high-risk for suicide-related outcomes. Preventive measures are best delivered within the first year of suicide ideation being expressed.

AB In Ethiopia, like many developing countries, autopsy is rare unless conducted in the medico-legal arena, making vital statistics that include pathological diagnoses sparse. To determine the most common factors contributing to death among individuals who died from natural or injury-related events in Ethiopia 200 consecutive autopsies were conducted in 2006 at the Forensic Medico-legal Pathology Department, Menelik II Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The results describe significant pathological observations, putative cause of death, age distribution, and gender ratios. Eighty-one percent of the cases were male, and the mean age was 38.9 (+/-15.5 years). Fifty-two percent of the individuals died from natural causes, including infections, and 48% died from injury-related events. In the natural deaths group, as determined by gross examination at autopsy pulmonary complications were the most commonly reported cause of death, with suspected tuberculosis accounting for 12%. Tuberculosis (21, 8%) and liver disease (14, 5%) were the most common histopathological findings in the natural and injury-related causes groups, respectively. In the injury-related group, automobile accident was the most common cause of accidental death (80%), and homicide by beating was the most common cause of death in the intentional injury group (31%). These data provide valuable unbiased analyses of causes of death among individuals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Aim To assess the prevalence and associated factors of suicidal behaviour (suicidal ideation, plan or suicide attempt) in postpartum mothers.
   Method An institutional cross-sectional study was employed from March to April 2017.
   Setting Two primary health centres and one referral hospital in northwestern Ethiopia.
   Participants A total of 1065 mothers aged >= 18 years during routine postnatal care were included and 988 of them completed the study. Those who were unable to communicate due to illness were not included.
   Outcome measure Mothers who visit for routine postnatal care were assessed for suicidal behaviour using a suicidal screening tool. Logistic analysis was employed with adjusted OR (AOR) and 95% CI, and with p value less than 0.05 as the level of significance.
   Results The prevalence of suicidal behaviour (suicidal ideation, plan or suicide attempt) was found at 14.0% (138/988) (95%CI 12.00 to 16.00) in postpartum mothers. Poor wealth of the mother (AOR=2.80, 95%CI 1.18 to 6.84), unplanned pregnancy of the current child (AOR=2.28, 95%CI 1.48 to 3.54), history of rape (AOR=2.26, 95%CI 1.42 to 3.61) and sickness of the new child (AOR=1.68, 95%CI 1.12 to 2.52) were significantly associated with suicidal behaviours.
   Conclusion Suicidal behaviour was found pretty high among postpartum mothers and was associated with poor wealth, unplanned pregnancy, history of rape and sickness of the new infant. It is recommended to screen mothers for possible suicidal behaviour during routine postnatal care.

AB Background: Suicide is a serious public health problem, responsible for 1.48% of all deaths worldwide, with suicidal ideation an important precursor. University and college students are among highly affected groups. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of suicidal ideation and to identify factors associated with suicidal ideation among university students in Ethiopia.
   Methods: A random selection of 836 students was surveyed. Binary and multivariable logistic regression models were fitted, adjusting for potential confounders. Associations were measured using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Analyses were carried out using the SPSS version 20 software.
   Results: The prevalence of suicidal ideation was 19.9% (95% CI 17.1-22.4%). The odds of suicidal ideation was higher among students who had mental distress (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.0, 95% CI 1.38-2.91), a family history of mental illness (AOR = 3.05, 95%, 1.89-4.92) and for those who had low social support (AOR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.35-2.82). Financial distress (AOR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.09-2.33), Khat chewing (AOR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.05-3), and alcohol use (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.05-2.42) were also significantly associated with suicidal ideation. We found no evidence of associations between suicidal ideation and gender, age, relationship status, or year of study.
   Conclusions: One in five students reported suicidal ideation. There was strong evidence of associations between suicidal ideation and mental distress, family history of mental illness, low social support, financial distress, and substance use. It is, therefore, important to develop suicide prevention strategies targeting these risk factors for university students in Ethiopia.

AB Background: Evidence on the utility of the minor depressive disorder diagnostic construct in rural communities and developing countries is scarce.
   Aim: To assess the utility and validity of definitive minor depressive disorder in Ethiopia by determining its impact and sociodemographic correlates.
   Methods: Assessment of 68,378 adults, aged 15-49 years, living in a largely rural district in Ethiopia using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview.
   Results: The lifetime prevalence of minor depressive disorder was 2.2% (95% CI=2.1%, 2.3%). Age, marital status, education and unemployment independently predicted minor depressive disorder. Over 80% of cases used health services, 55.1% experienced persistent thoughts of death and 14.6% attempted suicide.
   Limitation: Findings are based on lifetime estimates.
   Conclusions: Minor depressive disorder is an important public health problem in rural Ethiopia, as shown by the associated high health service use and risk behaviour. Sociodemographic correlates suggest aetiological continuity with major depression. Thus our findings extend the clinical and public health utility of this diagnostic construct to rural community and developing country settings. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Article
AB Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a major contributing factor to the burden of disease among children and adolescents. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of CSA and its outcomes among female high school students in Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted among Jirren high school female students in April 2005. A total of 323 female students from grade 9 were selected by systematic random sampling and they completed a self-administered questionnaire on experiences of sexual abuse. Data were cleaned and analysed by SPSS/PC statistical package. The results revealed that the prevalence of CSA was 68.7%. Among the different forms of sexual abuses, verbal harassment was the most common (51.4%) followed by sexual intercourse, 18.0% and unwelcome kissing, 17.1%. The commonly indicated abusers in this study were unknown persons (36%) followed by schoolmates (31.5%). Among victims of sexual abuse, 7.2% had an unwanted pregnancy and 5.9% had sexually transmitted diseases. The rate of other psychological effects of CSA, such as suicide ideation, suicide attempt, and sexual dysfunction, was high. The overwhelming majority (86.4%) considered sexual abuse to be a major social problem. The study revealed that the prevalence of CSA is high. Reproductive health education should be provided to students. Parents, police, and the public in general should be made aware of the problem before it endangers the lives of children and adolescents.

AB Background: Antenatal depression is more prevalent in low and middle income countries as compared to high income countries. It has now been documented as a global public health problem owing to its severity, chronic nature and recurrence as well as its negative influence on the general health of women and development of children. However, in Ethiopia, there are few studies with highly variable and inconsistent findings. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of antenatal depression and its determinants among pregnant women in Ethiopia.
   Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we exhaustively searched several databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct and Cochrane Library. To estimate the pooled prevalence, studies reporting the prevalence of antenatal depression and its determinants were included. Data were extracted using a standardized data extraction format prepared in Microsoft Excel and transferred to STATA 14 statistical software for analysis. To assess heterogeneity, the Cochrane Q test statistics and I-2 test were used. Since the included studies exhibit considerable heterogeneity, a random effect meta- analysis model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of antenatal depression. Finally, the association between determinant factors and antenatal depression were assessed.
   Results: The overall pooled prevalence of antenatal depression, in Ethiopia, was 24.2% (95% CI: 19.8, 28.6). The subgroup analysis of this study indicated that the highest prevalence was reported from Addis Ababa region with a prevalence of 26.9% (21.9-32.1) whereas the lowest prevalence was reported from Amhara region, 17.25 (95% CI: 6.34, 28.17). Presence of previous history of abortion (OR: 3.0, 95% CI: 2.1, 4.4), presence of marital conflict (OR: 7.2; 95% CI: 2.7, 19.0), lack of social support from husband (OR: 3.2: 95% CI: 1.2, 8.9), and previous history of pregnancy complication (OR: 3.2: 95% CI: 1.8, 5.8) were found to be determinants of antenatal depression.
   Conclusion: The pooled prevalence of antenatal depression, in Ethiopia, was relatively high. Presence of previous history of abortion, presence of marital conflict, lack of social support from husband, presence of previous history of pregnancy complications were the main determinants of antenatal depression in Ethiopia.

AB BackgroundGlobally, 350 million people are affected by depression and 800,000 people die due to suicide every year due to depression. People living with HIV/AIDS face different challenges, including HIV-related perceived stigma, lack of social support and also depression. This study aimed to assess prevalence and factors associated with depressive symptom among people living with HIV/AIDS attending Hawassa University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Hawassa, Ethiopia.MethodsHospital-based cross-sectional study was implemented in 2016. A total of 401 HIV-positive patients who had regular visit at Hawassa University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Hawassa, Ethiopia were included in the study. Systematic random sampling technique was used to recruit study participants. Patient Health Questionnaire item nine (PHQ-9) was used to assess depressive symptoms. In addition to this, Oslo social support scale and HIV perceived stigma scale were used to assess social support and HIV-related perceived stigma, respectively.ResultsA total of 401 study participants were included in the study, giving a response rate of 96.2%. The mean age of the respondents was 38years (SD10.23). This study revealed that 48.6% of HIV-positive patients had depression. Patients who had poor social support [AOR=2.53, (95% CI 1.70, 9.13)], HIV-related perceived stigma [AOR=2.83, (95% CI 1.78, 4.48)] and CD4 cell count<200 [AOR=3.89, (95% CI 1.02, 14.83)] were more likely to have depression as compared to individuals who had good social support, no perceived HIV stigma and CD4 cell count>200, respectively.ConclusionHaving poor social support, HIV-related perceived stigma and low CD4 cell count (<200) had statistically significant association with depressive symptom. Training of health workers in ART clinics and availing manuals on assessing mental health issues is useful to screen and treat depression among HIV patients.

AB Suicidal behaviours are one of the most important contributors to the global burden of disease among women, but little is known about prevalence and modifiable risk factors in low and middle income countries. We use data from the WHO multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence against women to examine the prevalence of suicidal thoughts and attempts, and relationships between suicide attempts and mental health status, child sexual abuse, partner violence and other variables. Population representative cross-sectional household surveys were conducted from 2000-2003 in 13 provincial (more rural) and city (urban) sites in Brazil, Ethiopia, japan, Namibia, Peru, Samoa, Serbia, Thailand and Tanzania. 20967 women aged 15-49 years participated. Prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts, lifetime suicidal thoughts, and suicidal thoughts in the past four weeks were calculated, and multivariate logistic regression models were fit to examine factors associated with suicide attempts in each site. Prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts ranged from 0.8% (Tanzania) to 12.0% (Peru city): lifetime thoughts of suicide from 7.2% (Tanzania province) to 29.0% (Peru province), and thoughts in the past four weeks from 1.9% (Serbia) to 13.6% (Peru province). 25-50% of women with suicidal thoughts in the past four weeks had also visited a health worker in that time. The most consistent risk factors for suicide attempts after adjusting for probable common mental health disorders were: intimate partner violence, non-partner physical violence, ever being divorced, separated or widowed, childhood sexual abuse and having a mother who had experienced intimate partner violence. Mental health policies and services must recognise the consistent relationship between violence and suicidality in women in low and middle income countries. Training health sector workers to recognize and respond to the consequences of violence may substantially reduce the health burden associated with suicidal behaviour. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: As part of a situational analysis for a research programme on the integration of mental health care into primary care (Programme for Improving Mental Health Care-PRIME), we conducted a baseline study aimed at determining the broad indicators of the population level of psychosocial distress in a predominantly rural community in Ethiopia.
   Methods: The study was a population-based cross-sectional survey of 1497 adults selected through a multi-stage random sampling process. Population level psychosocial distress was evaluated by estimating the magnitude of common mental disorder symptoms (CMD; depressive, anxiety and somatic symptoms reaching the level of probable clinical significance), harmful use of alcohol, suicidality and psychosocial stressors experienced by the population.
   Results: The one-month prevalence of CMD at the mild, moderate and severe threshold levels was 13.8%, 9.0% and 5.1% respectively. The respective one-month prevalence of any suicidal ideation, persistent suicidal ideation and suicide attempt was 13.5%, 3.8% and 1.8%. Hazardous use of alcohol was identified in 22.4%, significantly higher among men (33.4%) compared to women (11.3%). Stressful life events were widespread, with 41.4% reporting at least one threatening life event in the preceding six months. A similar proportion reported poor social support (40.8%). Stressful life events, increasing age, marital loss and hazardous use of alcohol were associated with CMD while stressful life events, marital loss and lower educational status, and CMD were associated with suicidality. CMD was the strongest factor associated with suicidality [e.g., OR (95% CI) for severe CMD = 60.91 (28.01, 132.48)] and the strength of association increased with increase in the severity of the CMD.
   Conclusion: Indicators of psychosocial distress are prevalent in this rural community. Contrary to former assumptions in the literature, social support systems seem relatively weak and stressful life events common. Interventions geared towards modifying general risk factors and broader strategies to promote mental wellbeing are required.

AB Background: Despite the potential impact on treatment adherence and recovery, there is a dearth of data on the extent and correlates of internalized stigma in patients with schizophrenia in low income countries. We conducted a study to determine the extent, domains and correlates of internalized stigma amongst outpatients with schizophrenia in Ethiopia.
   Methods: The study was a cross-sectional facility-based survey conducted at a specialist psychiatric hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Consecutive consenting individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were recruited and assessed using an Amharic version of the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale.
   Results: Data were collected from 212 individuals, who were mostly single (71.2%), unemployed (70.3%) and male (65.1%). Nearly all participants (97.4%) expressed agreement to at least one stigma item contained in the ISMI; 46.7% had a moderate to high mean stigma score. Rural residence (OR = 5.67; 95% CI = 2.30, 13.00; p < 0.001), single marital status (OR = 3.39; 95% CI = 1.40, 8.22; p = 0.019) and having prominent psychotic symptoms (OR = 2.33; 95% CI = 1.17, 4.61; p = 0.016) were associated independently with a higher stigma score. Almost half of those who discontinued their treatment reported that they had done so because of perceived stigma. Those who had attempted suicide (45.3%) were more likely to have a high stigma score (OR = 2.29; 95% CI = 1.27, 4.11; p = 0.006). Over 60% of the variation in the experience of stigma was explained by four factors: social withdrawal (16.7%), perceived discrimination (14.1%), alienation (13.9%) and stereotype endorsement (12.7%).
   Conclusion: Internalized stigma is a major problem among persons with schizophrenia in this outpatient setting in Ethiopia. Internalized stigma has the potential to substantially affect adherence to medication and is likely to affect the recovery process.

AB Background: Schizophrenia is associated with a two to three fold excess mortality. Both natural and unnatural causes were reported. However, there is dearth of evidence from low and middle income (LAMIC) countries, particularly in Africa. To our knowledge this is the first community based report from Africa.
   Methods: We followed a cohort of 307 (82.1% males) patients with schizophrenia for five years in Butajira, rural Ethiopia. Mortality was recorded using broad rating schedule as well as verbal autopsy. Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) was calculated using the mortality in the demographic and surveillance site as a reference.
   Result: Thirty eight (12.4%) patients, 34 men (11.1%) and 4 women (1.3%), died during the five-year follow up period. The mean age (SD) of the deceased for both sexes was 35 (7.35). The difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.69). It was 35.3 (7.4) for men and 32.3 (6.8) for women. The most common cause of death was infection, 18/38 (47.4%) followed by severe malnutrition, 5/38 (13.2%) and suicide 4/38 (10.5%). The overall SMR was 5.98 (95% CI = 4.09 to7.87). Rural residents had lower mortality with adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.30 (95% CI = 0.12-0.69) but insidious onset and antipsychotic treatment for less than 50% of the follow up period were associated with higher mortality, adjusted HR 2.37 (95% CI = 1.04-5. 41) and 2.66(1.054-6.72) respectively.
   Conclusion: The alarmingly high mortality observed in this patient population is of major concern. Most patients died from potentially treatable conditions. Improving medical and psychiatric care as well as provision of basic needs is recommended.

AB Background There are reports on favourable course and outcome of schizophrenia in lowincome countries. The aim of the present study was to examine onset and clinical course of the illness in a community-based sample in rural Ethiopia based on crosssectional information. Method A two-stage survey was carried out in Butajira-Ethiopia, a predominantly rural district. Altogether 68,378 individuals aged 15-49 years were CIDI-interviewed, of whom 2,159 were identified as cases according to the CIDI interview with regard to psychotic or affective disorders. Key informants identified another group of 719 individuals as being probable cases and a total of 2,285 individuals were SCAN-interviewed. The present paper reports on cases with schizophrenia. Results There were 321 cases of schizophrenia giving an estimated lifetime prevalence of 4.7/1,000). Of the cases,83.2% (N = 267) were males. Mean age of first onset of psychotic symptoms for males was 23.8 (sd 8.6) compared to 21.0 (sd 7.8) for females (P = 0.037; 95 %CI 0.16-5.47). Over 80% had negative symptoms and over 67% reported continuous course of the illness. Less than 10% had a history of previous treatment with neuroleptic medication. About 7% were vagrants, 9% had a history of assaultive behaviour,and 3.8% had attempted suicide. The male to female ratio was nearly 5:1. Conclusion This large community-based study differs from most previous studies in terms of higher male to female ratio, earlier age of onset in females and the predominance of negative symptoms.

AB Background: Diabetes is a highly prevalent non-communicable disease which is prone to more psychiatric complications like suicide; however, research into this area is limited. Assessing suicidal plan and attempt as well as its determinants are therefore important.
   Method: Institution based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 21 to June 21 at the diabetic outpatient clinic by recruiting 421 participants using systematic sampling. Suicide manual of the composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI) was used to assess suicidal plan and attempt. Chart review was used to obtain data regarding the co-morbidity of medical illness and complications of diabetes mellitus. Binary logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with suicidal attempt. Odds ratio with 95% CI was employed and variables with a p-value of<0.05 in multivariable logistic regression were declared significant.
   Results: From 423 participants 421 participated in the study with 99.5% response rate. The mean age (SD) of the respondents was 38.0((+/- 13.9) years. The lifetime prevalence of Suicidal plan; an attempt was found to be 10.7 and 7.6% respectively. Being female (AOR=2.14, 95%CI:1.10,5.65), poor social support (AOR=3.21,95%CI:1.26,8.98), comorbid depression (AOR=6.40,95%CI:2.56,15.46) and poor glycemic control (AOR=4.38,95%CI:1.66,9.59) were factors associated with lifetime suicidal attempt.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of suicidal attempt among Diabetes patients is high (7.6%). The suicidal attempt had a statistically significant association with female gender, comorbidity with depression, poor social support and poor glycemic control. Therefore the result of this study helps to do early screening, treatment, and referral of patients with suicidal attempt.

AB Background
   Suicide which is considered a psychiatric emergency, is a serious cause of mortality worldwide. Youth living with HIV/AIDS (YLWHA) have higher rates of suicidal behavior than the general public. This study aimed to assess the magnitude and associated factors of suicide ideation and attempt among the Human Immune deficiency Virus (HIV) positive youth attending anti-retroviral therapy (ART) follow up at St. Paul's hospital Millennium Medical College and St. Peter's specialized hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
   Methods
   In this cross-sectional study, 413 HIV positive youth were recruited for interviews, using the systematic random sampling technique. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was used to assess suicide. PHQ-9, the Oslo social support and HIV perceived stigma scale instruments were used to assess the factors. We computed bivariate and multivariable binary logistic regressions to assess factors associated with suicidal ideation and attempt. Statistical significance was declared at P-value < 0.05.
   Result
   The magnitude of suicidal ideation and attempts were found to be 27.1% and 16.9%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, female sex (adjusted odd ratio(AOR) = 3.1, 95% CI, 1.6-6.0), family death (AOR = 2.1, 95%CI 1.15-3.85), WHO clinical stage III of HIV (AOR = 3.1 95% CI 1.3-7.35), WHO clinical stage IV of HIV (AOR = 4.76, 95%CI, 1.37.35), co-morbid depression (AOR = 7.14, 95%CI, 3.9-12.9), and perceived HIV stigma (AOR = 4.2, 95%CI, 2.27-8.2) were significantly associated with suicidal ideation, whereas female sex (AOR = 4.12, 95%CI, 1.82-9.78), opportunistic infections (AOR = 3.1, 95%CI, 1.6-6.04), WHO clinical stage III of HIV (AOR = 3.1 95%CI 1.24-7.81), co-morbid depression (AOR = 5.6 95% CI, 2.8-11.1), and poor social support (AOR = 3.4, 95%CI, 1.2-9.4) were statistically significant with suicidal attempt. The result suggests that the magnitude of suicidal ideation and attempts among HIV positive youth were high. We recommend that clinicians consider youth with comorbid depression, perceived HIV stigma and poor social support.

AB Introduction: The World Health Organization (WHO) clearly states the importance of psychological well-being in the definition of health as "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity". However, in the community, the lives of people with bipolar disorders are often harsh and abusive. Till now, the rate and related information concerning verbal or physical abuse among patients with bipolar disorder at psychiatric outpatient clinics have not been well addressed in Ethiopian settings.
   Methods: Data were collected by interviewing 411 systematically selected participants at outpatient department of Amanuel Mental Specialized Hospital. For analysis, logistic regression and adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
   Results: The prevalence of abuse (verbal/physical) was 37.7%. Having two or more episodes [AOR 1.70, 95% CI (1.06, 2.74)], a history of aggression [AOR 3.06, 95% CI (1.63, 5.75)] and comorbid illness [AOR 2.21, 95% CI (1.25, 3.90)] were significantly associated.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of reported abuse is high among patients with bipolar disorder, and it is important to remember the rights of patients during treatment.

AB Background: The impact of mental disorders among homeless people is likely to be substantial in low income countries because of underdeveloped social welfare and health systems. As a first step towards advocacy and provision of care, we conducted a study to determine the burden of psychotic disorders and associated unmet needs, as well as the prevalence of mental distress, suicidality, and alcohol use disorder among homeless people in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among street homeless adults. Trained community nurses screened for potential psychosis and administered standardized measures of mental distress, alcohol use disorder and suicidality. Psychiatric nurses then carried out confirmatory diagnostic interviews of psychosis and administered a locally adapted version of the Camberwell Assessment of Needs Short Appraisal Schedule.
   Results: We assessed 217 street homeless adults, about 90% of whom had experienced some form of mental or alcohol use disorder: 41.0% had psychosis, 60.0% had hazardous or dependent alcohol use, and 14.8% reported attempting suicide in the previous month. Homeless people with psychosis had extensive unmet needs with 80% to 100% reporting unmet needs across 26 domains. Nearly 30% had physical disability ( visual and sensory impairment and impaired mobility). Only 10.0% of those with psychosis had ever received treatment for their illness. Most had lived on the streets for over 2 years, and alcohol use disorder was positively associated with chronicity of homelessness.
   Conclusion: Psychoses and other mental and behavioural disorders affect most people who are street homeless in Addis Ababa. Any programme to improve the condition of homeless people should include treatment for mental and alcohol use disorders. The findings have significant implications for advocacy and intervention programmes, particularly in similar low income settings.

AB Background Bipolar disorder impacts negatively on the patient, the family, as well as the society. It taxes the health care services due to a combination of the illness with associated medical and psychiatric comorbidities. In Africa, unfortunately, knowledge of the epidemiology and burden of bipolar disorder is based mainly on studies from the USA and Europe. In this systematic review of literature from Africa, we highlight the epidemiology and burden of bipolar disorder.
   Methods A systematic review of publications from Africa relating to the epidemiology and burden of bipolar disorder was conducted.
   Result Data from community surveys conducted in Nigeria and Ethiopia indicated a lifetime prevalence estimate of 0.1 % to 1.83 for bipolar disorder. Missed diagnosis rate of bipolar disorder was up to 36.2 %. In one study, 8.1 % of the males and 5.4 % of the females reported a previous suicide attempt. A study showed that up to 60 % of patients with bipolar disorder had at least one comorbidity. There were no reports on all-cause mortality and cost of illness.
   Conclusion Bipolar disorder is a major mental health problem in Africa. Scientific findings on bipolar disorder from Africa are consistent with the existing literature from other parts of the world. There still exists a dearth of high quality studies addressing the epidemiological, clinical, social, and economic burden of the disorder.

SO SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT PREVENTION AND POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE Problematic khat use; Risk factor; Harmful alcohol drinking

AB Background: Substance use disorders along with neuropsychiatric disorders contributed about 14% of the global burden of disease. Harmful alcohol use, is a known contributor for many harms (accidents, suicide, violence, and complication of other psychiatric and medical disorders). In the Western countries, alcohol and nicotine are gateway drugs to cannabis use, and cannabis use is a risk factor for other illicit drugs such as cocaine and heroin. Khat use is another psychoactive substance which is common in East African and Arabian Peninsula. But there is a knowledge gap regarding the position of khat use or problematic khat use in sequential progression of different psychoactive substances. Therefore, we aimed to understand and investigate the relationship of problematic khat use and other psychoactive substances in Ethiopia.
   Methods: Exploratory mixed methods study was employed. Quantitative cross sectional survey was done among 102 khat users, and 4 focus group discussions and 11 in-depth interviews were conducted to understand the pathways between khat use and other psychoactive substances use in 2014. Non random sampling (purposive and snowballing) was employed for both quantitative and qualitative studies. Khat users from khat cafeterias, shops, and from other open markets of khat in Addis Ababa were invited to participate.
   Result: Currently significant majorities of khat users (86.3%) used at least one other psychoactive substance after they started khat use. The prevalence of harmful drinking was 53.9% among khat users. Problematic khat use was a significant predictor of harmful drinking (p < 0.05). About one from ten respondents engaged to risky sexual behavior pushed by the effect of khat after chewing.
   Conclusion: The proportion of psychoactive substances use especially harmful drinking among khat users was observed higher compared to other cross sectional surveys conducted among general population. In Ethiopia, intervention and policy on harmful alcohol use could consider problematic khat use as one possible risky factor. A rigorous methodology which could test gateway hypothesis of problematic psychoactive substances use could be warranted.

AB The impact of meaning in life, or lack thereof, on suicidal tendencies among populations at greater risk-youth born to immigrants from developing countries, in this case Ethiopia-in comparison to native-born Israeli youth was examined among 277 adolescents-162 of Israeli origin and 115 of Ethiopian origin-aged 15-18. (1) Overall significant negative correlation between meaning in life and suicidal tendencies was found; (2) no difference was found in meaning in life between immigrant and native-born youth; (3) higher suicidal tendency, anxiety and depression were found among immigrants, with boys displaying more anxiety than girls. No difference in depression was detected between Ethiopian boys and girls. Meaning in life is crucial to minimizing suicidal tendencies among youth, native-born and immigrant alike. Establishment of prevention, intervention and therapy plans in the age range crucial for suicide. Such programs should be based upon finding meaning in life.

AB This article reviews the prevalence of bipolar disorder, as well as the studies quantifying the burden of illness and cost of illness of this condition. It also discusses barriers to treatment. Multiple epi demiologic studies suggest a lifetime prevalence of bipolar I disorder of nearly 1%, making it a common illness. Bipolar illness is not only common, but for those affected, it is a significant source of distress, disability, loss of life through suicide, and burden on relatives and other caregivers. In 1990, the World Health Organization identified bipolar disorder as the sixth leading cause of disability-adjusted life years in the world among people aged 15 to 44 years. Costs to society appear to be roughly 70% of those for schizophrenia. Despite the burden imposed by bipolar illness and the availability of several effective treatments for the illness, many bipolar patients in the United States continue to face significant barriers to care.

AB Background
   Non-adherence to antipsychotic medication has a negative impact on the course of illness resulting in increased risk of relapse, rehospitalization and suicide, and increased costs to healthcare systems. The objective of this study was to investigate factors associated with medication adherence among patients with schizophrenia at Ayder Referral Hospital and Mekelle Hospital in Mekelle, Tigray region, Northern Ethiopia.
   Methods
   The study was a cross-sectional survey in which sociodemographic characteristics, drug attitudes, insight and side effects were measured and explored in terms of their relationship with medication adherence. A structured questionnaire as a data collection tool was used. Data were analyzed with the help of SPSS Version 20.0.
   Results
   A total of 393 patients participated, 26.5% were non-adherent to their antipsychotic medication. The factors significantly associated with better adherence were positive treatment attitudes (AOR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.26, 1.55), fewer side effects (AOR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.94, 0.99), awareness of illness (AOR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.85) and the ability to relabel symptoms (AOR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.19, 2.07). However, khat chewers (AOR = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.68), being illiterate (AOR = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.47) and older age group (AOR = 0.03, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.16) were associated with less medication adherence.
   Conclusions
   A high prevalence of medication non-adherence was found among patients with schizophrenia. Intervention strategies focused on educating the patients to better understand the illness, medications and their potential side effects might be useful in improving adherence to antipsychotic medication treatment.

AB Studies have indicated that social stigma related to podoconiosis (endemic non-filarial elephantiasis) has a major impact on the psychosocial wellbeing of patients. However, little effort has been made so far to quantify the level of both felt and enacted stigma in a range of domains of life. We used a recently developed podoconiosis stigma assessment scale to measure levels of stigma as recalled over the previous 12 months. One hundred and fifty patients with podoconiosis rated the levels of stigma they perceived and experienced in 'interpersonal interactions', 'major life areas' and 'community, social and civic life'. High levels of stigma were observed on both felt and enacted stigma scales. The overall average stigma score was 40.7 (range 0 to 96). Enacted stigma was scored higher than felt stigma (mean score 21.2 vs. 19.5, respectively). The mean enacted stigma score was higher in 'major life areas', and 'community, social and civic life' than 'interpersonal interactions', while felt stigma was experienced most at the interpersonal level. Over half of patients reported that they had considered suicide in response to discrimination and prejudice, particularly in interpersonal interactions. Forced divorce, dissolution of marriage plan, insults and exclusion at social events were some of the most commonly mentioned forms of enacted stigma reported by affected individuals. Scores for overall level of stigma and enacted stigma increased significantly with stage of podoconiosis while the association observed in relation to felt stigma was only marginally significant (p = 0.085). Appropriate stigma reduction strategies must be identified and implemented in communities highly endemic for podoconiosis.

AB The objective of this study was to examine the extent to which poor sleep quality is associated with suicidal ideation among Ethiopian adults.
   A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1054 adults attending outpatient clinical facilities in Ethiopia. Standardized questionnaires were utilized to collect data on demographics, sleep quality, lifestyle, and depression status. Depression and suicidal ideation were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), while the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire was utilized to assess sleep quality. Multivariate logistic regression models were fit to estimate adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI).
   The prevalence of suicidal ideation was 24.3 % while poor sleep quality (PSQI global score of > 5 vs. ae<currency>5) was endorsed by 60.2 % of participants. After adjustment for confounders including depression, poor sleep quality was associated with more than 3-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation (AOR = 3.59; 95 % CI 2.34-5.51). When assessed as a continuous variable, each 1-unit increase in the global PSQI score resulted in a 20 % increased odds for suicidal ideation, even after adjusting for depression (AOR = 1.20; 95 % CI 1.14-1.27). Participants with both poor sleep quality and depression had much higher odds (AOR = 23.22, 95 % CI 14.10-38.28) of suicidal ideation as compared with those who had good sleep quality and no depression although inferences from this analysis are limited due to the wide 95 % CI.
   Suicidal ideation and poor sleep quality are highly prevalent. Individuals with poor sleep quality have higher odds of suicidal ideation. If confirmed, mental health services need to address sleep disturbances seriously to prevent suicidal episodes.

AB Background: Mental health is the greatest challenges for the current and future generations. Worldwide, out of the 66 million people suffering from depression; majority (85%) were from low and middle income countries. The prevalence was more common among the prisons population than the community. However, a worldwide consideration given to the problems is very low, particularly for prisoners.
   Methods: To assess level of depression and associated factors among prisoners in prisons of Northwest Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia, Institutional based cross sectional study was employed on 727 prisoners selected by multistage random sampling from three prisons of northwest Amhara. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess an individuals' depression level. The reliability of the tool was checked by Cronbach's Alpha (yielding value of 0.841). Multivariable logistic regression was done to identify factors associated with depression after Hosmer and lemeshow goodness of fit test was used for model fitness.
   Results: Of the total prisoners participated (649), 284 (43.8%; 95% CI: 39.90, 47.67%) had symptoms of depression. Detainees' satisfaction level about life before imprisonment, belief about their life after imprisonment, plan to commit suicide, social support and types of prisons were significantly associated with depression.
   Conclusions: Depression level among detainees was found to be high. Thus, providing training to scale up satisfaction of prisoners, on how to cope up with environment just before imprisonment and release, and treating prisoners will improve the problem.

AB Background
   Evidence on mortality in severe mental illness (SMI) comes primarily from clinical samples in high-income countries.
   Aims
   To describe mortality in people with SMI among a population cohort from a low-income country.
   Method
   We followed-up 919 adults (from 68 378 screened) with SMI over 10 years. Standardised mortality ratios (SMR) and years of life lost (YLL) as a result of premature mortality were calculated.
   Results
   In total 121 patients (13.2%) died. The overall SMR was twice that of the general population; higher for men and people With schizophrenia. Patients died about three decades prematurely, mainly from infectious causes (49.6%). Suicide, accidents and homicide were also common causes of death.
   Conclusions
   Mortality is an important adverse outcome of SMI irrespective of setting. Addressing common natural and unnatural causes of mortality are urgent priorities. Premature death and mortality related to self-harm should be considered in the estimation of the global burden of disease for SMI.

AB Aims Suicidal behaviour is an under-reported and hidden cause of death in most low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) due to lack of national systematic reporting for cause-specific mortality, high levels of stigma and religious or cultural sanctions. The lack of information on non-fatal suicidal behaviour (ideation, plans and attempts) in LMIC is a major barrier to design and implementation of prevention strategies. This study aims to determine the prevalence of non-fatal suicidal behaviour within community- and health facility-based populations in LMIC.
   Methods Twelve-month prevalence of suicidal ideation, plans and attempts were established through community samples (n = 6689) and primary care attendees (n = 6470) from districts in Ethiopia, Uganda, South Africa, India and Nepal using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview suicidality module. Participants were also screened for depression and alcohol use disorder.
   Results We found that one out of ten persons (10.3%) presenting at primary care facilities reported suicidal ideation within the past year, and 1 out of 45 (2.2%) reported attempting suicide in the same period. The range of suicidal ideation was 3.5-11.1% in community samples and 5.0-14.8% in health facility samples. A higher proportion of facility attendees reported suicidal ideation than community residents (10.3 and 8.1%, respectively). Adults in the South African facilities were most likely to endorse suicidal ideation (14.8%), planning (9.5%) and attempts (7.4%). Risk profiles associated with suicidal behaviour (i.e. being female, younger age, current mental disorders and lower educational and economic status) were highly consistent across countries.
   Conclusion The high prevalence of suicidal ideation in primary care points towards important opportunities to implement suicide risk reduction initiatives. Evidence-supported strategies including screening and treatment of depression in primary care can be implemented through the World Health Organization's mental health Global Action Programme suicide prevention and depression treatment guidelines. Suicidal ideation and behaviours in the community sample will require detection strategies to identify at risks persons not presenting to health facilities.

AB Background: In Ethiopia, though all kinds of mortality due to external causes are an important component of overall mortality often not counted or documented on an individual basis.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the patterns of mortality from external causes using verbal autopsy (VA) method at the Ethiopian HDSS Network sites.
   Methods: All deaths at Ethiopian HDSS sites were routinely registered and followed up with VA interviews. The VA forms comprised deaths up to 28 days, between four weeks and 14 years and 15 years and above. The cause of a death was ascertained based on an interview with next of families or other caregivers using a standardized questionnaire that draws information on signs, symptoms, medical history and circumstances preceding death after 45 days mourning period. Two physician assigned probable causes of death as underlying, immediate and contributing factors independently using information in VA forms based on the WHO ICD-10 and VA code system. Disagreed cases sent to third physician for independent review and diagnosis. The final cause of death considered when two of the three physicians assigned underlying cause of death; otherwise, labeled as undetermined.
   Results: In the period from 2009 to 2013, a total of 9719 deaths were registered. Of the total deaths, 623 (6.4%) were from external causes. Of these, accidental drowning and submersion, 136 (21.8%), accidental fall, 113 (18.1%) and transport-related accidents, 112 (18.0%) were the topmost three leading external causes of deaths. About 436 (70.0%) of deaths were from the age group above 15 years old. Drowning and submersion and transport-related accidents were high in age group between 5 and 14 years old.
   Conclusion: In this study, external causes of death are significant public health problems and require attention as one of prior health agenda.

AB Background: We sought to evaluate the prevalence and correlates of major depressive disorder (MDD) and suicidal behavior among urban dwelling Ethiopian adults.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 1097 outpatient adults ( >= 18 years of age) in a major hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics were collected via structured interviews. MDD and suicidal behavior were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) among all study participants. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
   Results: Prevalence estimates for lifetime and 12-month MDD were 18.0% and 6.7%, respectively. The prevalence of suicidal behavior during the previous year (i.e., suicidal ideation, plan or attempt) was 15.2% with approximately 4% having reported attempts. Overall, women were more likely to report suicidal behavior (17.8%) than men (11.3%). MDD odds were 1.53-fold higher among women as compared with men (aOR=1.53, 95% CI 1.05-2.23). Lifetime MDD was significantly associated with age, sex, marital status, and self-reported physical health. Participants reporting poor mental health had approximately 3-fold increased odds of MDD (OR=2.93; 95%Cl: 1.05-2.23); those between 35 and 44 years old (aOR=1.92; 95%Cl: 1.06-3.49) and those older than 55 years (aOR=2.54; 95%Cl: 1.16-5.57) had higher odds of MDD. Similarly suicidal behavior was significantly associated with sex, marital status, and self reported physical and mental health. Limitations: This cross-sectional study utilized self-reported data from outpatients. Causality cannot be inferred, and results may not be fully generalizable.
   Conclusions: Overall results show that MDD and suicidal behavior are highly prevalent among urban dwelling Ethiopian adults. Women and middle-age adults constitute a high-risk group and may therefore benefit from targeted interventions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mental health and food insecurity are major public health issues among adolescents in Ecuador. Our objective was to determine the relationship between hunger, symptoms of depression, and suicidal ideation among school-going Ecuadorian adolescents.
   We conducted crude and multivariable logistic regression models using data from the 2007 Global School-based Student Health Survey from Quito, Guayaquil, and Zamora, Ecuador (N = 5524). Hunger was defined as having gone hungry in the past 30 days due to lack of food in the home. Outcomes of interest were symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation with or without planning in the past year.
   Overall, 41.2 % (2200/5467) of students reported experiencing hunger. In multivariable logistic regression models, hunger had an increasing exposure-response relationship with symptoms of depression [sometimes hungry odds ratio (OR) 1.80, P = 0.0001; most of the time or always hungry OR 2.01, P < 0.0001] and suicidal ideation with planning (sometimes hungry OR 1.55, P = 0.04; most of the time or always hungry OR 2.63, P = 0.001).
   Hunger was associated with increased odds of symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation with planning. Strategies to improve mental health among adolescents in Ecuador should consider the potential contribution of hunger and food insecurity.

AB Background: Bipolar disorders have been extensively studied in the high-income countries but community-based studies from low-income countries are very rare. The main objectives of the current study are to estimate the lifetime prevalence of bipolar I disorder in the general population of the Butajira district in Ethiopia and to characterize the onset and course of the disorder in a predominantly treatment naive population.
   Method: Cases were identified by a door-to-door screening of the district's entire adult population aged 15 to 49 years (N=83,387), where 68,378 were successfully screened. CIDI and key informant method were used in the first stage of screening followed by confirmatory SCAN interviews.
   Results: Three hundred fifteen cases were identified and complete information could be collected for 295 individuals. Of these, 55.3% were males, 83.1% were from a rural area, and 70.2% were illiterate. Lifetime prevalence of bipolar I disorder was estimated to be 0.6% for males and 0.3% for females. The mean age of cases was 29.5 years, with no significant sex difference. The mean age of first recognition of illness was 22.0 years; for men 22.3 years and for women 21.2 years. The mean age at onset of manic phase of the illness was found to be 22.0 years (22.5 for men and 21.4 for women). The mean age at onset of depressive phase was 23.4 years (24.1 for men and 22.5 for women). There was no significant sex difference in the age of onset of manic or depressive phases. In 22.7% of the cases bipolar I illness started with a depressive episode and in 77.3% of the cases it started with a manic episode. Two or more episodes of the illness were reported by 64.1%. Over half of the study subjects (55.9%) had never sought any help from modern healthcare sector, and only 13.2% had ever been admitted to psychiatric hospital. During the survey 7.1% of the cases were undergoing treatment. A previous suicide attempt was reported by 8.1% of the males and 5.4% of the females.
   Conclusion: The overall lifetime prevalence and age of onset are within the range of findings from other studies in Western countries. In contrast to most previous studies, prevalence of the disorder among females was half of that among males. Our finding that prevalence of this disorder among males and females appeared to be different from many other studies warrants further research. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Leprosy is a neglected tropical disease still prevalent in the world today. In addition to dealing with the physical complications associated with the condition, people affected by leprosy often also face poor mental health. This study sets out to explore the psychological impact of leprosy by looking at experiences of mental health, and perceptions of the disease and disability, in a community in Bangladesh.
   Methods: Mixed methods including PHQ-9 and GAD-7 questionnaires and semi-structured interviews (SSI) were used. 30 adult participants were recruited through systematic sampling, with a purposive approach taken to select a sub-group of 6 for a focus group discussion (FGD), prioritising those who recorded severe markers of anxiety, depression and disability level during the SSI/questionnaire.
   Results: 53% of participants experienced moderate to severe depression and 44% mild depression. 37% experienced severe anxiety and 37% moderate anxiety. Underlying issues for poor mental health included high levels of disability, being a woman, low educational levels, and economic dependence. Participants identified ways to recover from mental distress such as engaging with non-affected people, increased public awareness, strengthened education and restoring their ability to financially sustain themselves.
   Conclusion: These findings add to the growing body of literature that evidences the high mental distress associated with leprosy. Despite anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation being common challenges people with leprosy experience, leprosy treatment rarely includes provision for mental health care.

AB Objectives A study to investigate deliberate self-harm (DSH) in an African context was undertaken in Uganda. Methods A case-control study in which 100 cases of DSH and 300 controls matched on age and sex were recruited from three general hospitals in Kampala and subjected to a structured interview using a modified version of the European Parasuicide Study Interview Schedule I. Results Among the cases, 63% were males, with a male to female ratio of 1.7:1 and a peak age range of 20-24 years. Higher educational attainment, higher socio-economic class and poor housing were significantly associated with DSH. District of current residence, district of birth, religion, ethnicity, marital status, number of children, current living arrangement, area of usual residence, employment status of respondent and partner were not significantly associated with DSH. Pesticides and medications, mainly antimalarials and diazepam, were the main methods of DSH used. The most commonly reported psychiatric disorders were adjustment disorder, acute stress reactions and depression. Conclusion DSH in Uganda appears to predominantly afflict the young. Disturbed interpersonal relationships, poverty and loneliness were important factors in the immediate precipitation of this behaviour. The fact that pesticide poisoning is still the predominantly used method in DSH in this area calls for a review of the legislation that controls the sale and availability of these agricultural chemicals.

   HELP; SUICIDAL IDEATION; ADDIS-ABABA; DEPRESSION; PREVALENCE; ANXIETY
AB Background
   Globally, the mental health help-seeking behavior of university students is reported to be poor; less than one-third of university students with common mental disorders (CMDs) report having sought help from formal sources. Failure to seek treatment is associated with prolonged disability and poor mental health outcomes, including suicide. In Ethiopia, little is known about the help-seeking behavior of university students for CMDs.
   Objective
   This study aimed to assess the prevalence and determinants of help seeking, and sources of help sought by Jimma University undergraduate students with CMDs.
   Method
   Seven hundred and sixty students were selected to participate in this cross-sectional study using multi-stage sampling. Sources of help were identified using the Actual Help-Seeking Questionnaire. CMDs were assessed using the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. Binary logistic regression analysis was used for both univariate and multivariable analysis.
   Results
   Of the sampled students, 58.4% were found to have current CMDs. Of those with current CMDs, 78.4% had sought help for their problems. The majority (83.8%) of participants who sought help did so from informal sources. Compared to students who had 'very good' overall levels of satisfaction with life, those who had 'good', 'fair', and 'poor or very poor' overall level of satisfaction with life were less likely to seek help (p-value = 0.021, 0.014, and 0.011, respectively). Lastly, having no previous history of help-seeking was significantly associated with seeking help for CMDs (p-value<0.001).
   Conclusion
   More than half of Jimma University students were found to have a high risk of CMDs and the majority of those with CMDs sought help from informal sources. Future studies are needed to explore the barriers of seeking help from formal resources, and the effects of not receiving help from formal sources for CMDs symptoms.

AB At this time, alcohol use is increasing in African countries. The prevalence of alcohol use disorders (AUDs) remains unknown in patients with psychiatric disorders. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of AUDs among individuals with bipolar disorder in the outpatient department at Amanuel Mental Specialized Hospital. An institution-based cross sectional study was conducted among 412 bipolar patients attending the outpatient department at Amanuel Mental Specialized Hospital from May - July 2015. Participants were selected using a systematic random sampling technique. Semi-structured questionnaires were used to collect socio-demographic and clinical data. Alcohol use disorder was measured using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-10). Binary logistic regression analysis was performed. The prevalence of alcohol use disorder was found to be 24.5%. Those affected were predominantly female (58.5%). Being18-29 years of age (AOR=3.86, 95%CI: 1.34, 11.29), being 30-44 years of age (AOR=4.99, 95%CI: 1.85, 13.46), being unable to read and write (AOR=5.58, 95%CI: 2.026, 13.650), having a secondary education (AOR=3.198, 95%CI: 1.149, 8.906), being a farmer (AOR=4.54, 95%CI: 1.67, 12.32), being employed by the government (AOR=3.53, 95%CI: 1.36, 4.15), being a day labourer (AOR=3.5, 95%CI: 1.14, 10.77), use of other substances during past 12 months (AOR=2.06, 95%CI: 1.06, 3.99), having a family history of alcohol use (AOR=2.18, 95%CI: 1.29, 3.68), having discontinued medication (AOR=2.78, 95%CI: 1.52, 5.07), having suicidal thoughts (AOR=4.56, 95%CI: 2.43, 8.54), and having attempted suicide (AOR=5.67, 95%CI: 3.27, 9.81) were statistically significant to alcohol use disorder using multivariate logistic analysis. The prevalence of co-morbid alcohol use disorder was high. This finding suggests that screening for risky alcohol use should be integrated into routine hospital outpatient care. Further, preventive measures against alcohol use disorder should be established.

AB Background: Depression and anxiety disorders are common among people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus than the non-infected individuals. The co-existence of these disorders are associated with barriers to treatment and worsening medical outcomes, including treatment resistance, increased risk for suicide, greater chance for recurrence and utilization of medical resources and/or increase morbidity and mortality. Therefore, assessing depression and anxiety among HIV patients has a pivotal role for further interventions.
   Methods: Institution based cross-sectional study was conducted at ALERT hospital May, 2015. Data were collected using a pretested, structured and standardized questionnaire. Systematic sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify associated factors. Odds ratio with 95 % CI was computed to assess the strength of associations.
   Results: The prevalence of co-morbid depression and anxiety among HIV patients was 24.5 % and prevalence of depression and anxiety among HIV patients was 41.2 % (172) and 32.4 % (135) respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that individual who had perceived HIV stigma (AOR = 3.60, 95 % CI (2.23, 5.80), poor social support (AOR = 2.02, 95 % CI (1.25, 3.27), HIV stage III (AOR = 2.80, 95 % CI (1.50, 5.21) and poor medication adherence (AOR = 1.61, 95 % CI (1.02, 2.55) were significantly associated with depression. Being female (AOR = 3.13, 95 % CI (1.80, 5.44), being divorced (AOR = 2.51, 95 % CI (1.26, 5.00), having co morbid TB (AOR = 2.74, 95 % CI (1.37, 5.47) and perceived HIV stigma (AOR = 4.00, 95 % CI (2.40, 6.69) were also significantly associated with anxiety.
   Conclusion: Prevalence of depression and anxiety was high. Having perceived HIV stigma, HIV Stage III, poor social support and poor medication adherence were associated with depression. Whereas being female, being divorced and having co morbid TB and perceived HIV stigma were associated with anxiety. Ministry of health should give training on how to screen anxiety and depression among HIV patients and should develop guidelines to screen and treat depression and anxiety among HIV patients.

AB IMPORTANCE The literature focuses on mortality among children younger than 5 years. Comparable information on nonfatal health outcomes among these children and the fatal and nonfatal burden of diseases and injuries among older children and adolescents is scarce.
   OBJECTIVE To determine levels and trends in the fatal and nonfatal burden of diseases and injuries among younger children (aged < 5 years), older children (aged 5-9 years), and adolescents (aged 10-19 years) between 1990 and 2013 in 188 countries from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 study.
   EVIDENCE REVIEW Data from vital registration, verbal autopsy studies, maternal and child death surveillance, and other sources covering 14 244 site-years (ie, years of cause of death data by geography) from 1980 through 2013 were used to estimate cause-specific mortality. Data from 35 620 epidemiological sources were used to estimate the prevalence of the diseases and sequelae in the GBD 2013 study. Cause-specific mortality for most causes was estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble Model strategy. For some infectious diseases (eg, HIV infection/AIDS, measles, hepatitis B) where the disease process is complex or the cause of death data were insufficient or unavailable, we used natural history models. For most nonfatal health outcomes, DisMod-MR 2.0, a Bayesian metaregression tool, was used to meta-analyze the epidemiological data to generate prevalence estimates.
   FINDINGS Of the 7.7 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 7.4-8.1) million deaths among children and adolescents globally in 2013, 6.28 million occurred among younger children, 0.48 million among older children, and 0.97 million among adolescents. In 2013, the leading causes of death were lower respiratory tract infections among younger children (905 059 deaths; 95% UI, 810304-998 125), diarrheal diseases among older children (38 325 deaths; 95% UI, 30 365-47 678), and road injuries among adolescents (115 186 deaths; 95% UI, 105 185-124 870). Iron deficiency anemia was the leading cause of years lived with disability among children and adolescents, affecting 619 (95% UI, 618-621) million in 2013. Large between-country variations exist in mortality from leading causes among children and adolescents. Countries with rapid declines in all-cause mortality between 1990 and 2013 also experienced large declines in most leading causes of death, whereas countries with the slowest declines had stagnant or increasing trends in the leading causes of death. In 2013, Nigeria had a 12% global share of deaths from lower respiratory tract infections and a 38% global share of deaths from malaria. India had 33% of the world's deaths from neonatal encephalopathy. Half of the world's diarrheal deaths among children and adolescents occurred in just 5 countries: India, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Ethiopia.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Understanding the levels and trends of the leading causes of death and disability among children and adolescents is critical to guide investment and inform policies. Monitoring these trends over time is also key to understanding where interventions are having an impact. Proven interventions exist to prevent or treat the leading causes of unnecessary death and disability among children and adolescents. The findings presented here show that these are underused and give guidance to policy makers in countries where more attention is needed.
