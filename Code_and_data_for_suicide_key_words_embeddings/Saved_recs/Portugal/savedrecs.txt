TI Lithium in Public Drinking Water and Suicide Mortality in Portugal:
   Initial Approach
SO ACTA MEDICA PORTUGUESA

ID EXPOSURE; RISK
AB Introduction: Lithium can be found naturally in drinking water. There is some evidence that natural levels of lithium in drinking water may have a protective effect on suicide mortality. The aim of this study is to evaluate if higher natural concentrations of lithium in public drinking water are associated with lower local rates of suicide in Portugal.
   Material and Methods: Suicide standardized mortality ratios at 54 Portuguese municipalities within the 6-year period from 2011 to 2016 was correlated with lithium concentrations in public drinking water and socioeconomic factors using Pearson's correlation coefficients (r) with one-tailed tests. Multivariate regression models were adjusted for well-known socioeconomic factors known to influence suicide mortality in Portugal (population density, average income per capita, unemployment rates and proportion of Roman Catholics).
   Results: The average lithium level, as evidenced by raw values for 54 municipalities, was 10.88 pg/L (standard deviation = 27.18). There was no statistically significant correlation between lithium levels and suicide standardized mortality ratio (r = 0.001, p-value = 0.996). There was a statistically significant higher suicide standardized mortality ratio for males (p-value = 0.000). When analyzed separately for both sexes, no statistically significant correlation between suicide standardized mortality ratio and lithium levels was found (male r= 0.024, p-value = 0.862; female r= 0.000, p-value = 0.999). No association between suicide standardized mortality ratio and socioeconomic factors was found: population density (r = -0.144, p-value = 0.300), average income per capita (r= -0.112, p-value = 0.418), unemployment rates (r= -0.001, p-value = 0.994), and proportion of Roman Catholics (r =- 0.150, p-value = 0.278).
   Discussion: Unlike most international studies regarding natural lithium levels and suicide risk, no inverse relation was found in Portugal. Factors such as the country's low suicide rate, confunding suicide risk variables, and unaccounted lithium intake might have influenced these findings.
   Conclusions: No association between lithium in public drinking water and suicide rates was found in Portugal.

AB Introduction: Suicide is considered a public health priority. It is a complex phenomenon resulting from the interaction of several factors, which do not depend solely on individual conditions. This study analyzes the spatio-temporal evolution of suicide mortality between 1980 and 2015, identifying areas of high risk, and their variation, in the 278 municipalities of Continental Portugal.& para;& para;Material and Methods: Based on the number of self-inflicted injuries and deaths from suicide and the resident population, the spatio-temporal evolution of the suicide mortality rate was assessed via: i) a Poisson joinpoint regression model, and ii) spatio-temporal clustering methods.& para;& para;Results: The suicide mortality rate evolution showed statistically significant increases over three periods (1980 - 1984; 1999 - 2002 and 2006 - 2015) and two statistically significant periods of decrease (1984 - 1995 and 1995 - 1999). The spatio-temporal analysis identified five clusters of high suicide risk (relative risk >1) and four clusters of low suicide risk (relative risk < 1).& para;& para;Discussion: The periods when suicide mortality increases seem to overlap with times of economic and financial instability. The geographical pattern of suicide risk has changed: presently, the suicide rates from the municipalities in the Center and North are showing more similarity with those seen in the South, thus increasing the ruralization of the phenomenon of suicide.& para;& para;Conclusion: Between 1980 and 2015 the spacio-temporal pattern of mortality from suicide has been changing and is a phenomenon that is currently experiencing a growing trend (since 2006) and is of higher risk in rural areas.

AB As one of the more specific and distinctive problems of human beings, suicide has been investigated with increasing attention all over the world. Several risk factors have been described as well as limitations arising from their study. The World Health Organization estimates that this scourge affects one million people annually, which corresponds to one death every 40 s worldwide. According to recent studies, Portugal, despite the good rates (10 suicide deaths per 100,000 inhabitants), had shown an increasing trend among younger people.
   This work aims to characterize the evolution of the suicidal profile autopsied at the Forensic Pathology Department of the Centre Branch of the National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences of Portugal, analyzing several variables: age, gender, marital status, employment status, suicidal methodology, toxicological analysis and some conditions/behaviors regarding personal history (alcoholism, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, physical illness, psychiatric disorder). All the autopsies from the 1 January, 2003 to 31 December, 2009 were analyzed.
   The suicide profile achieved corresponded to a man (77%), aged between 65 and 74 years old (20.4%), married (54.5%), employed, who committed suicide by hanging, in September, May or February. Clinical records include an organic health problem or psychiatric one, in addition to risk behaviors such as alcoholism, suicidal thoughts or suicide attempts.
   The number of suicides autopsied at the Centre Branch has increased, resembling the profile to the result of many other authors. However, new medical and social developments place hanging as the favorite suicide method in our study. Many barriers remain to overthrow but several prevention programs begin to be designed and implemented. Future evaluations and interventions at the social and medical level, including the death certification process, will be fundamental to a better realistic understanding of this phenomenon.

AB This study compares the existing statistical association between suicide mortality and the characteristics of places of residence (municipalities), before and during the current economic crisis, in Portugal. We found that (1) the traditional culture-based North/South pattern of suicidal behaviour has faded away, while the socioeconomic urban/rural divide has become more pronounced; (2) suicide is associated with higher levels of rurality and material deprivation; and (3) recent shifts in suicidal trends may result from the current period of crisis. Strategies targeting rural areas combined with public policies that address area deprivation may have important implications for tackling suicide. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB 'Undetermined' (UnD) and accidental deaths (AccD) are explored as possible sources of 'under-reported-suicides' (URS) in 20 Western countries.
   WHO mortality rates per million of AccD, UnD and suicides analysed. UnD:suicides ratios of < 1:5 calculated as likely URS versus ratios > 1:10 unlikely URS and all correlated by sex and age.
   Male URS likely in 7 countries and in 11 for females. URS in AccD likely in 5 countries for both sexes only UnD and suicide rates the elderly (75+) significantly correlated.
   Strong indication of URS in the UK, Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany with likely URS in AccD in Greece, Portugal, Switzerland and USA. These findings have important implications, indicating that, with the exception of France and Japan, official reported suicide rates contain a degree of under-reporting, and especially for women yet it is essential to have accurate suicide data to ensure adequate service provision.

AB The present study assessed the impact of suicide and distress on suicidal ideation in a sample of 93 Portuguese family members bereaved by suicide. A control community sample of 102 adults also participated. After controlling for educational level, those bereaved by the suicide of a family member were found to have higher levels of suicidal ideation. Forty-two percent of family members had Suicide Ideation Questionnaire scores at or above the cutoff point. General distress, depression, anxiety, and hostility related to suicidal ideation, whereas time since suicide also interacted with general distress and depression in predicting suicidal ideation.

AB The study aims to determine the prevalence of self-harm (SH) and related psychosocial factors in a large sample of Portuguese adolescents. A total of 1,713 pupils, aged 12 to 20 years, completed an anonymous questionnaire in a school setting. In all, 7.3% reported at least 1 episode of SH: rates were 3 times higher for females than males. Almost half reported repeated SH, most commonly self-cutting. Anxiety, depression, and substance abuse were linked to SH, and particularly repeated SH. Anxiety, trouble with the police, and exposure to SH or suicide of others, were independently associated with SH in both genders. These findings indicate that SH is a public health concern in Portugal as in other European countries.

AB Suicide in children is a rare finding and is probably motivated by acts of impulsiveness. This study aims to contribute to the characterization of child suicide in a forensic perspective in the Portuguese population. Data of forensic autopsies from 2004 to 2012 related to suicide victims under 18years were reviewed. A total of 17 cases, with a male predominance (64.7%) and a mean age of 15.24 +/- 1.348 for both genders, were registered. The leading suicide method was hanging (35.3%), and a suicide note was found in 41.2%. Psychological autopsy proved to be useful in promoting a better understanding of these incidents and their antecedents. This study also offers useful information, namely the implied risk factors, for future programs of suicide research and prevention.

AB Background: There is a lack of international research on suicide by drug overdose as a preventable suicide method. Sex-and age-specific rates of suicide by drug self-poisoning (ICD-10, X60-64) and the distribution of drug types used in 16 European countries were studied, and compared with other self-poisoning methods (X65-69) and intentional self-injury (X70-84).
   Methods: Data for 2000-04/05 were collected from national statistical offices. Age-adjusted suicide rates, and age and sex distributions, were calculated.
   Results: No pronounced sex differences in drug self-poisoning rates were found, either in the aggregate data (males 1.6 and females 1.5 per 100,000) or within individual countries. Among the 16 countries, the range (from some 0.3 in Portugal to 5.0 in Finland) was wide. 'Other and unspecified drugs' (X64) were recorded most frequently, with a range of 0.2-1.9, and accounted for more than 70% of deaths by drug overdose in France, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain. Psychotropic drugs (X61) ranked second. The X63 category ('other drugs acting on the autonomic nervous system') was least frequently used. Finland showed low X64 and high X61 figures, Scotland had high levels of X62 ('narcotics and hallucinogens, not elsewhere classified') for both sexes, while England exceeded other countries in category X60. Risk was highest among the middle-aged everywhere except in Switzerland, where the elderly were most at risk.
   Conclusions: Suicide by drug overdose is preventable. Intentional self-poisoning with drugs kills as many males as females. The considerable differences in patterns of self-poisoning found in the various European countries are relevant to national efforts to improve diagnostics of suicide and appropriate specific prevention. The fact that vast majority of drug-overdose suicides came under the category X64 refers to the need of more detailed ICD coding system for overdose suicides is needed to permit better design of suicide-prevention strategies at national level.

AB Trends in adolescent suicide rates (15-19 years) from 1979 to 1996 were compared with suicide trends in individuals of 20 years and over in 30 countries and with trends in rates of deaths due to undetermined causes in adolescents in 17 countries of the WHO European Region. In 21 of the 30 studied countries, male adolescent suicide rates increased during the study period (highest increases in Belarus, Kazakstan and Ireland) accompanied by far less increases or decreases in suicide rates of males of 20 years and over. Part of the observed increases in Sweden, Ireland and Greece can be attributed to improved suicide statistics, while increases in Finland, Belgium, Bulgaria and the United Kingdom can be even higher due to the rising classification of deaths as "undetermined". In Portugal, decreasing suicide trends seem to be misinterpreted by ignoring the vast increases in rates of undetermined deaths. Female adolescent suicide rates rose less markedly than in males in 18 countries, with the exception of strong increases in Norway, Ireland. Increases in female adolescent suicide rates were marginally affected by changes in classification practices and were accompanied primarily by declining suicide rates in females of 20 years and over.

AB Introduction: Some studies alerted for the burden of suicidal attempters at emergency rooms. In this study we characterized the suicidal patients admitted to a Portuguese emergency room.
   Material and Methods: For three years, all patients assessed by the first author after suicidal behaviour were included. Suicidal intentionality was evaluated with the Pierce Suicide Intent Scale. Clinical records were searched for follow-up status and satisfaction level was assessed through telephone call.
   Results: From 120 included patients 70.8% were female, with mean age of 42.35 years. Pierce Suicide Intent Scale suicidal intentionality was low in 30.1%, medium in 59.3%, and high in 10.6% of the sample. The most important predictors of Pierce Suicide Intent Scale intentionality were male gender (p < 0.001), family history of suicide (p < 0.01), divorced or widowed marital status (p < 0.013), and severe mental illness (p < 0.015). In 41.6% of the patients the follow-up status was unknown. Regarding satisfaction, only 19.5% gave a valid answer: 2.7% 'mildly satisfied', 4.4% 'moderately satisfied', and 12.5% 'very satisfied'.
   Discussion: The Pierce Suicide Intent Scale is useful on suicidal behavior assessment at emergency rooms. Highly intentional suicidal behaviour is related to male sex, social problems and personal and familial psychiatric history.
   Conclusion: The quality of administrative records on this psychiatric emergency room setting are still unacceptable. The most important variables correlated with higher suicidal intentionality are the same described in other countries. Of the reachable patients, one fifth was satisfied with provided follow-up. We still need studies for better understanding of suicidal behaviour observed on this Portuguese emergency room.

AB This study presents the characteristics of child and adolescent suicides which occurred in Kairouan, Tunisia. Data were collected from autopsy records of the Forensic Department of the University Hospital Ibn El Jazzar of Kairouan. General characteristics of suicides among children and adolescents (under the age of 18) between 2009 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 49 cases, with a female predominance (61.2%) and a mean age of 15.4 +/- 2.1, were registered. Most of the victims were from rural areas (93.1%). In most cases, suicide occurred in the victim's home or the surrounding area (73.4%). The identified precipitating factors were family problems in 55.1%, and school issues in 12.2%. The most common suicide method was hanging (69.38%) for both genders, followed by self-immolation for males and poisoning for females, the majority using pesticides. This study offers useful information to understand the risk factors in Tunisian child and adolescent suicides and provides a basis for the development of urgently needed preventive strategies.

AB Background: Suicide accounts for over 58,000 deaths in Europe per annum, where suicide attempts are estimated to be 20 times higher. Males have been found to have a disproportionately lower rate of suicide attempts and an excessively higher rate of suicides compared to females. The gender difference in suicide intent is postulated to contribute towards this gender imbalance. The aim of this study is to explore gender differences in suicide intent in a cross-national study of suicide attempts. The secondary aims are to investigate the gender differences in suicide attempt across age and country.
   Methods: Data on suicide attempts (acquired from the EU-funded OSPI-Europe project) was obtained from eight regions in Germany, Hungary, Ireland and Portugal. Suicide intent data was categorized into 'Non-habitual Deliberate Self-Harm' (DSH), 'Parasuicidal Pause' (SP), 'Parasuicidal Gesture' (SG), and 'Serious Suicide Attempt' (SSA), applying the Feuerlein scale. Gender differences in intent were explored for significance by using X-2-tests, odds ratios, and regression analyses.
   Results: Suicide intent data from 5212 participants was included in the analysis. A significant association between suicide intent and gender was found, where 'Serious Suicide Attempts' (SSA) were rated significantly more frequently in males than females (p < .001). There was a statistically significant gender difference in intent and age groups (p < .001) and between countries (p < .001). Furthermore, within the most utilised method, intentional drug overdose, 'Serious Suicide Attempt' (SSA) was rated significantly more often for males than females (p < .005).
   Conclusions: Considering the differences in suicidal intent between males and females highlighted by the current study, gender targeted prevention and intervention strategies would be recommended.

AB A number of health outcomes were affected by previous financial crises, e. g. suicides, homicides and transport accident mortality. Aim of this study was to analyse the effects of the current financial crisis on selected health outcomes at population level in Europe. Methods: A mixed approach of ecologic and time trend design was applied, including correlation analysis. For eight countries, data on the economic situation (unemployment rate and economic growth) and health indicators (overall mortality, suicide and transport accident mortality) was drawn from EUROSTAT database for 2000-10. Spearman's rank correlation was applied to analyse the influence of social protection on the association between exposure and outcome variables. Results: The financial crisis had no visible effect on overall mortality in any of the eight countries until 2010. Transport accident mortality decreased in all eight countries, in the range of 18% in Portugal to 52% in Slovenia. In contrast, suicide mortality increased in Germany (+5.3%), Portugal (+5.2%), Czech Republic (+7.6%), Slovakia (+22.7%) and Poland (+19.3%). The effect of unemployment on suicide is higher in countries with lower social spending (Spearman's r = -0.83). Discussion: Clear cause-effect relations could not be established owing to the ecological study design and issues concerning data availability. However, there are clear changes in suicide and transport accident mortality after onset of the crisis, and findings are consistent with previous work. As part of this work, a comprehensive framework was developed, which can be applied to analyse health effects of financial crises in more detail.

AB Deliberate self-harm (DSH) among adolescents is a high-risk condition for suicide. The aim of the present study is to describe the characteristic clinical features of adolescents with DSH according to our local context (Lisbon, Portugal), using easily available information from clinical settings. A case control study was constructed from a sample of 100 adolescents (aged 12 to 21 years). The sample was divided into two groups: adolescents with and without DSH. Case files were examined and data was completed by clinical interviews. Demographic, psychosocial, and psychopathological data were assessed and compared. Ninety-eight subjects completed the protocol. The DSH group was associated with the following: suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior as consultation motive, emergency room referral, previous follow-up attempts, suicidal ideation, psychosocial difficulties, or lack of therapeutic goals. There was a nonsignificant trend towards diagnosis of depression in the DSH group. These results reflect our clinical practice with adolescents and add data about teenagers who self-harm to the literature. Prevention and early recognition of DSH (and frequently associated depression) in adolescents are essential and could be life-saving measures. An integrated approach, which takes into account psychosocial difficulties, family dysfunction, and negative expectations, seems to be of great importance.

AB While linkages between some macroeconomic phenomena and suicides in some countries have been explored, only two studies, hitherto, have established a causal relationship between fiscal austerity and suicide, albeit in a single country. The aim of this study is to provide the first systematic multiple -country evidence of a causal relationship of fiscal austerity on time-, gender-, and age-specific suicide mortality across five Eurozone peripheral countries, namely Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain over the period 1968-2012, while controlling for various socioeconomic differences. The impact of fiscal adjustments is found to be gender-, age- and time-specific. Specifically, fiscal austerity has short-, medium- and long-run suicide increasing effects on the male population in the 65-89 age group. A 1% reduction in government spending is associated with a 138%, 2.42% and 3.32% increase in the short, medium- and long-run, respectively, of male suicides rates in the 65-89 age group in the Eurozone periphery. These results are highly robust to alternative measures of fiscal austerity. Improved labour market institutions help mitigate the negative effects of fiscal austerity on suicide mortality.

AB Background: There are an estimated one million completed suicides per year worldwide. As a response to increasing concern about suicide within Europe, the EUROSAVE (European Review of Suicide and Violence Epidemiology) study was undertaken to examine recent trends in the epidemiology of suicide and self-inflicted injury mortality in the European Union (EU). Methods: Suicide and self-inflicted injury mortality data for the 15 EU countries for the years,1984-1998 were obtained from the World Health Organisation (WHO), the European Statistical Office of the European Commission (EUROSTAT) and national statistical agencies. Data were also obtained for a second group of deaths classified as 'undetermined' or 'other violence'. Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated and examined for trends over time. Results: Finland had the highest suicide rate, while Greece had the lowest for the latest available year (1997). Age-standardized suicide rates tended to be lowest in the Mediterranean countries. Significant downward linear time trends in suicide,mortality were observed in most countries, although rates varied markedly between countries. Both Ireland and Spain displayed significant upward linear trends in suicide mortality. Portugal had the highest rate of undetermined deaths-both in 1984 and 1998 while Greece had the lowest in both 1984 and 1997. Five countries (including Ireland and Spain) showed significant downward trends in deaths due to undetermined causes whereas Belgium and Germany showed borderline significant upward linear trends in deaths due to undetermined causes. Conclusions: Although suicide rates in most countries seem to be decreasing, the validity of the data is uncertain. Misclassification may contribute to the geographical and temporal variation in suicide rates in some EU countries but it does not explain the phenomenon. More detailed research comparing suicide-recording procedures and practices across the EU is required. In the absence of adequate EU wide data on suicide epidemiology, effective prevention of this distressing phenomenon is likely to remain elusive.

AB Background: No recent cross-country examinations for youth suicide trends and methods for Europe were found.
   Aim: The aim of the study is to specify differences in suicide rates, trends and methods used among 15-24 years olds by gender across 15 European countries.
   Method: Data for 14,738 suicide cases in the age group 15-24 in 2000-2004/5 were obtained and analysed.
   Results: Suicide rates ranged 5.5-35.1 for males and 1.3-8.5 for females. Statistically significant decline since 2000 was observed in Germany, Scotland, Spain, and England for males and in Ireland for females. Hanging was most frequently used for both genders, followed by jumping and use of a moving object for males and jumping and poisoning by drugs for females. Male Suicides had a higher risk than females of using firearms and hanging and lower risk of poisoning by drugs and jumping. There were large differences between single Countries.
   Limitations: The limitations of the study are the small numbers of specific suicide methods in some countries as well as the recategorisation of ICD-9 codes into ICD-10 in England, Ireland and Portugal. Further, the use of suicides (X60-X84) without events of undetermined deaths (Y10-Y34) continues to be problematic considering the possibility of "hidden suicides".
   Conclusions: The present Study shows that suicide rates among young males are decreasing since 2000 in several European countries. Analysis of suicide methods confirms that there is a very high proportion of hanging in youths, which is extremely difficult to restrict. However, besides hanging there are also high rates of preventable suicide methods and reducing the availability of means should be one of the goals of suicide prevention.

AB Background: Police officers, as first responders to difficult situations with ready access to firearms, are frequently considered to be at increased suicide risk. Aims: We aimed to calculate the suicide rate for male officers of the Portuguese National Police (PSP) and compare it with the Portuguese general population. Method: Retrospective review of the PSP male officers suicides between 2005 and 2014 and comparison with the suicide rate for the general Portuguese population, adjusted for sex and age. Results: A total of 39 suicides were identified, with 34 using a firearm - mostly the service one (30 cases).The average truncated (20-59 years) suicide rate for male officers was 20.6 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI =14.2-27.1). Over the same period, the rate for the general Portuguese population was 13.9 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI = 13.5-14.3). The standardized rate ratio was 1.5 (95% CI = 0.9-2.4). Limitations: Despite the 10-year period of observation, this is a small sample and there are issues with missing data, such as lack of information for retired or dismissed police officers. Denominators were converted to estimates of person-years observations and we should be mindful of the limitations in the validity of the reported rates. Conclusion: Portuguese male police officers mostly die by suicide using service firearms.The suicide rates among them were not statistically different from those of the sex- and age-adjusted general population. However, given that police officers are healthy workers, we would expect lower rates - thus, similar rates could suggest an increased risk in the study sample.

AB Objectives A multidimensional psychological pain model of suicide has been developed that includes three dimensions: affective, cognitive, and avoidance. In the present research, we evaluated the relationships between the three dimensions of psychological pain and suicidal ideation. Method Two community samples from Portugal and the U.S. participated in the research. Results Hierarchical multiple regression analysis demonstrated that when controlling for the effects of depressive symptoms and psychache, the avoidance dimension, but not the cognitive or affective dimension of psychological pain, explained significant, and unique variance in suicidal ideation in each sample. Conclusion Even when individuals perceive psychological pain, there may not be an elevated risk of suicide, provided that they do not consider suicide as a form of coping to decrease that pain.

AB Background: Research concerning the association between use of antidepressants and incidence of suicide has yielded inconsistent results and is the subject of considerable controversy. The first aim is to describe trends in the use of antidepressants and rates of suicide in Europe, adjusted for gross domestic product, alcohol consumption, unemployment, and divorce. The second aim is to explore if any observed reduction in the rate of suicide in different European countries preceded the trend for increased use of antidepressants.
   Methods: Data were obtained for 29 European countries between 1980 and 2009. Pearson correlations were used to explore the direction and magnitude of associations. Generalized linear mixed models and Poisson regression distribution were used to clarify the effects of antidepressants on suicide rates, while an autoregressive adjusted model was used to test the interaction between antidepressant utilization and suicide over two time periods: 1980-1994 and 1995-2009.
   Findings: An inverse correlation was observed in all countries between recorded Standardised Death Rate (SDR) for suicide and antidepressant Defined Daily Dosage (DDD), with the exception of Portugal. Variability was marked in the association between suicide and alcohol, unemployment and divorce, with countries depicting either a positive or a negative correlation with the SDR for suicide. Every unit increase in DDD of an antidepressant per 1000 people per day, adjusted for these confounding factors, reduces the SDR by 0.088. The correlation between DDD and suicide related SDR was negative in both time periods considered, albeit more pronounced between 1980 and 1994.
   Conclusions: Suicide rates have tended to decrease more in European countries where there has been a greater increase in the use of antidepressants. These findings underline the importance of the appropriate use of antidepressants as part of routine care for people diagnosed with depression, therefore reducing the risk of suicide.

AB We investigated suicidal behavior, mental health, and satisfaction with social support in 52 female street sex workers in Porto, Portugal, using the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire, the Social Support Satisfaction Scale, and structured interviews. Almost half our interviewees (46.15%) reported high suicidal ideation and 44.2% had made at least one suicide attempt. Most had a mental health diagnosis, most commonly depression (88.2%). Social support and suicidal ideation were moderately negatively correlated. Further research is needed to improve understanding of suicidal behaviors in female sex workers and develop interventions to improve social support and reduce suicidal ideation and associated risk factors.

AB The attitudes and practise of doctors concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide have been the subject of studies performed in many countries. However, these issues have not been studied properly in Portugal.
   This study is a survey of 450 Portuguese oncologists by postal means and personal contact.
   The response rate was 33% (143). Only 13% would practise euthanasia with the present law in force forbidding such practise, and 24% would do so if it were legalised; 39% favoured its legalisation and 36% would like to have the option of euthanasia if they had a terminal disease. About assisted suicide, 15% would do it with the current law in force forbidding such action and 25% would do so if it were made legal; 32% favoured its legalisation and 24% would like to have that option if they had a terminal disease. There was one case of euthanasia and no cases of assisted suicide. The most important factor related with the acceptance of euthanasia and assisted suicide was religion, with non-practising Catholics accepting such practises more often than practising Catholics. The Portuguese oncologists have a very positive view on the potential role of palliative care in preventing many requests for euthanasia and assisted suicide.
   Portuguese oncologists are mainly against the practise of euthanasia and assisted suicide and the number of requests is also relatively low; consequently, the number of episodes of assisted death is also apparently very low.

AB Introduction: Psychiatric patients are at increased risk of death from a number of natural and unnatural causes. This study examines the mortality causes of all psychiatric inpatients of an acute psychiatric unit at a general hospital in Portugal for sixteen years (1998 to 2013).
   Material and Methods: Twenty-one inpatients died at the inpatient unit between 1998 and 2013 (average 1.3 per year). A retrospective study through case-file review was carried to collect demographic characteristics, medical and psychiatry diagnosis. Patients transferred to other wards during their admission were not included.
   Results: Circulatory system diseases were the most prevalent causes of death, occurring in 2/3 of patients and include pulmonary embolism (n = 6), acute stroke (n = 3), cardiac arrhythmia (n = 2), acute myocardial infarction (n = 1), abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture (n = 1) and heart failure (n = 1). Two patients died with pneumonia and in four cases the cause of death was undetermined. Only one case of suicide was registered.
   Discussion: Circulatory conditions were the most frequent causes of death in our inpatient unit. Albeit a relatively rare event, inpatient suicide does occur and, in addition to its complex consequences on staff, family and patients should remain a focus for continued prevention.
   Conclusion: Mortality studies are important for determining quality of health care and to create recommendations for preventive measures.

AB Objective: Train-person collisions have a significant impact in our society, due to their negative economic and psychological effects. This work aims to study fatalities resulting from train-person collisions in Portugal.
   Methods: A retrospective study was conducted based on the analysis of autopsy reports related to train-person fatalities performed in the North Branch of the National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences.
   Results: Suicide was responsible for most of the cases, and males were more often involved in train-person collisions than females. Victims, between 40 and 59years old, were found to be involved in a high percentage (39%) of the cases, and people older than 65 accounted for a significant percentage (40%) of the accidents. No seasonality was observed in suicide cases, but a decrease in accident numbers was registered in summer. Regarding weekday and time of day, afternoon and non-rush hour were the times when most suicides were observed, whereas accidents did not showed a specific weekday or time of day, except for rush hour, during which they were more frequent. Alcohol-positive blood analysis accounting for 25% of the cases.
   Conclusions: Differences from other European studies were found, which may be related to the different cultures of the countries/regions, as well as to the differences in the railway systems. More extensive studies must be performed in order to develop strategies to prevent train-person collisions.

AB Objective: To characterize non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) behaviors, methods, and functions as well as suicide ideation in the adolescent population of a Portuguese community in Sao Miguel Island, Azores. Increasing rates of NSSI behaviors among adolescents have been observed globally, while suicidal behavior has been pointed as a major cause of death during adolescence.
   Methods: A sample of 1,763 adolescents, aged 14 to 22, was randomly drawn from public and private schools and administered a set of self-report questionnaires. Descriptive and regression analyses were used to look for specific relationships and predictors of NSSI and suicide ideation in this isolated community.
   Results: Approximately 30% of youths reported at least one NSSI behavior, a rate that is twice as high as most studies carried out in mainland Portugal and in other European countries. Biting oneself was the most frequent form of NSSI, and NSSI behaviors served predominantly automatic reinforcement purposes (i.e., regulation of disruptive emotional states). NSSI and suicide ideation encompassed different distal and proximal risk factors.
   Conclusions: Exploring and characterizing these phenomena is necessary to provide a better understanding, enhance current conceptualizations, and guide the development of more effective prevention and intervention strategies in youths.

AB Background: Community facilitators (CFs), such as teachers, nurses and social workers, are well placed as gatekeepers for depression and suicidal behavior, but not properly prepared to provide preventive and supportive services. The current study aimed: (1) to improve CFs' attitudes toward depression, knowledge on suicide, and confidence to detect suicidal behavior in four European countries and (2) to identify specific training needs across regions and CF groups.
   Methods: A standardized training program was provided to 1276 CFs in Germany, Hungary, Ireland, and Portugal. Attitudes toward depression, knowledge about suicide, and confidence in identifying suicidal persons were assessed before training, after training, and at three to six months follow-up. Additionally, several participants' characteristics were registered.
   Results: At baseline, CFs showed relatively favorable attitudes toward depression, but limited knowledge on suicide, and little confidence to identify suicidal behavior. Basic skills strongly differed across CF groups and countries. For example, in Germany, carers for the elderly, nurses, teachers, and managers were most in need of training, while in Portugal pharmacists and the clergy appeared to be important target groups. Most importantly, the training program improved the competencies of CF groups across countries and these improvements were sustained after three to six months. CFs with low basic skills benefited most of the training.
   Limitations: The observed training effects could be influenced by other external factors as our results are based upon a pre-post comparison with no control group.
   Conclusions: Gatekeeper trainings in community settings are successful in improving knowledge, reshaping attitudes, and boosting the confidence of gatekeepers. The most effective strategy to achieve the preferred objectives is to target those CF groups that are most in need of training and to tailor the content of the training program to the individual needs of the target group.

AB Background: Little is known about country-specific variations in suicidal ideation (SID) by sex and how they correspond with completed suicide rate. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess variations in SID prevalence rates by sex and its correlation to completed suicide rates across European countries.
   Method: SHARE is a cross-national European survey of individuals over the age of 50 and their spouse of any age. The present study relied on wave 4 conducted in 2010-2012 including 49,008 participants aged 55 to 104 years from 16 countries. SID was evaluated using a single item from the Euro-D. Data on completed suicide rates were taken from the WHO mortality database.
   Results: Of the study population (n = 49,008, 44.3% men, mean age 68.2 +/- 9.1 years), a total of 4139 (8.5%, 95% CI 8.2-8.7) reported suicidal ideation within the last month. The women: men ratio in SID prevalence ranged from 1.30 in Estonia to 2.25 in Spain and Portugal. Regarding country-specific variation, the SID prevalence patterns of both men and women did not correspond to the completed suicide rates for males and females aged 55+ reported by the WHO (2013). Correlations were rather moderate in men (r = 0.45) and especially weak in women (r = 0.16).
   Conclusion: The study showed remarkable differences in SID prevalence by sex. The most exciting finding was that SID rates did not correspond with completed suicide rates in each country under investigation. However, the strength of these patterns substantially differs across countries. This unexpected finding need to be further evaluated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

ID HEALTH
AB Introduction/Objectives: Depression has shown as the more common mental disorder in elderly community and suicide is it worst consequence. In the Portuguese context suicide rates among the elderly take values higher than in other age groups. The present study aimed to compare elderly institutionalized and not institutionalized in terms of depression, suicidal ideation, dependency and leisure activities.
   Material and Methods: The sample was collected in Algarve, Alentejo and Lisbon, in 155 elderly, 85 institutionalized and 71 not institutionalized, with similar proportions between genders. The instruments were The Activity and Leisure Index (IAL), the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), The Barthel Index and the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSI).
   Results: The results showed that the elderly institutionalized did not presented higher depression, loneliness, suicidal thoughts or lowest level of activity and leisure, but were less independent. The participants with highest suicidal thoughts had more depression. A self-perception of worse health and more loneliness were related with more depression. A higher activity and leisure was related with less suicidal ideation.
   Conclusions: The data seem to show that the institutionalization of elderly is not related negatively with depression and suicidal ideation.

AB The 'European Alliance Against Depression' community-based intervention approach simultaneously targets depression and suicidal behaviour by a multifaceted community based intervention and has been implemented in more than 115 regions worldwide. The two main aims of the European Union funded project "Optimizing Suicide Prevention Programmes and Their Implementation in Europe" were to optimise this approach and to evaluate its implementation and impact. This paper reports on the primary outcome of the intervention (the number of completed and attempted suicides combined as 'suicidal acts') and on results concerning process evaluation analysis. Interventions were implemented in four European cities in Germany, Hungary, Portugal and Ireland, with matched control sites. The intervention comprised activities with predefined minimal intensity at four levels: training of primary care providers, a public awareness campaign, training of community facilitators, support for patients and their relatives. Changes in frequency of suicidal acts with respect to a one-year baseline in the four intervention regions were compared to those in the four control regions (chi-square tests). The decrease in suicidal acts compared to baseline in the intervention regions (-58 cases, -3.26%) did not differ significantly (chi(2) = 0.13; p = 0.72) from the decrease in the control regions (-18 cases, -1.40%). However, intervention effects differed between countries (chi(2) = 8.59; p = 0.04), with significant effects on suicidal acts in Portugal (chi(2) = 4.82; p = 0.03). The interviews and observations explored local circumstances in each site throughout the study. Hypothesised mechanisms of action for successful implementation were observed and drivers for 'added-value' were identified: local partnership working and 'in-kind' contributions; an approach which valued existing partnership strengths; and synergies operating across intervention levels. It can be assumed that significant events during the implementation phase had a certain impact on the observed outcomes. However, this impact was, of course, not proven.

AB Introduction Recent evidence suggests that incidence of Anorexia nervosa (AN) has remained stable over the last decades in Western Europe, while decreasing for Bulimia nervosa (BN). It is well-known that most individuals with an ED (Eating disorder) do not seek medical treatment. Objective The present study analyses hospitalizations related with EDs held in mainland Portuguese public hospitals between 2000 and 2014. Method A retrospective observational study was performed gathering all inpatient episodes with primary or secondary diagnosis of ED. Number of patients, gender, mean age at discharge, suicide-attempts related hospitalizations, in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and mean charges were analyzed. Results There were a total of 4,485 hospitalizations with an associated ED. AN was the most frequent ED (n = 2,806). Suicide attempt-related hospitalizations were most common among patients with BN (10.1% of BN hospitalizations) or AN (5.2% of AN hospitalizations). Discussion AN has higher in-hospital mortality than BN. We observed a higher proportion of suicide related hospitalizations in BN when compared to AN. Although pica, rumination disorder, and psychogenic vomiting represent a smaller portion of all EDs, this study was the first to describe hospitalization trends for this set of EDs for a 15-year period, to the best of our knowledge.

TI Injury mortality in the European Union 1984-1993 - An overview
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English

DE epidemiology; injury; mortality; trends
AB Background: Approximately 190,000 European Union (EU) citizens die annually as a result of an injury. In response, the European Commission identified accidents and injuries as a priority area for action in the field of public health in 1993. In 1984, the World Health Organization (WHO) Health for All targets were set in Europe to reduce unintentional injuries by 25% and reverse the rising trends in suicide by the year 2000. The aim of this study was to examine the trends in mortality due to externally caused physical injuries between 1984 and 1993 in the 15 countries which are currently members of the EU. Methods: Injury mortality data for all countries were obtained from the WHO and national government agencies. Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated for both unintentional and intentional injuries and examined over time. Results: Downward trends in age-standardized injury mortality due to unintentional injuries were identified in most countries. Marked variations were observed between countries, with low rates in the UK, The Netherlands and Sweden and high rates in Finland, Portugal and France. Age-standardized suicide rates decreased in most countries over the study period, with marked variations between countries. In general, countries in northern Europe experienced higher suicide rates than countries in southern Europe. Mortality rates due to homicide and other violent causes were low and relatively stable over the study period. Conclusions: Most countries appear to be on track to meet the WHO targets for unintentional injury mortality and suicide mortality. However, disparities between countries remain, for reasons that are unclear. While mortality data were valuable in describing the epidemiology of fatal injury in Europe, agreement on standardized practices of data collection, coding and analysis would improve the comparability of data between countries.

TI Elder homicide in the north of Portugal
SO JOURNAL OF FORENSIC AND LEGAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Elder homicide; Portugal; Medical-legal autopsy
ID MORTALITY; SUICIDE; NEGLECT
AB Introduction: The increasing average life expectancy leads to population aging, and growing numbers in the elder population, a population that suffers from great vulnerability. Therefore, a rise in elder homicide is expected. This phenomenon has not been thoroughly described in Portugal. This study aims to analyse and characterize elder homicide, in order to achieve a better understanding of this form of violence.
   Material and Methods: We conducted a retrospective study, reviewing autopsy reports along with data regarding circumstances of death of suspected homicides occurring between 1992 and 2007 (n = 78), whose victims were 65 years old or above, autopsied in the medical legal services of the north of Portugal.
   Results: During this period, an overall of 615 suspected homicides occurred, 13% being perpetrated against elders. The age range of the victims was 65-96 years, with an average of 74 years; 58% of them were males and 45% were married. In 61% of the documented cases, the perpetrator was known to the victim, and a family member in 36%. A considerable number of deaths occurred at the victim's residence and in a rural scenario, the motive being robbery in 51% of the documented cases. The supposed perpetrator ran away from the scene in 64% of the cases. The most frequent mechanisms of death were blunt force trauma (31%), followed by stabbing (22%) and gunshot wounds (21%). Fatal wounds were observed mainly in the head (55%) and thorax (35%).
   Conclusions: In the north of Portugal, elder homicide seems to be uncommon. This study suggests an association between elder homicide and robbery, in which elders, due to their vulnerability, are a preferential target. Contrary to other reports worldwide, there were no cases of death in nursing homes, possibly due to underreport or misidentification. In a large number of the cases, it wasn't possible to collect all the necessary data, due to lack of information regarding circumstances of the events.

AB Evidence from a range of sources demonstrates that end-of-life (EoL) care practices and preferences vary across countries; culture is consistently one of the main explanations given for this. In order to understand how cultural factors are used. to explain similarities and differences in EoL care between Spain, Italy and Portugal, database and hand searches were performed and cross-cutting core themes identified. Similarities included higher proportions of people who wished to die at home than actually died at home, a persistent trend for partial disclosure in Italy and Spain, low use of advance directives, and low incidence of all medical EoL decisions (with the exception of terminal sedation) compared to northern European countries. The role of religion and the importance of family ties were the two main cultural factors used to explain the similarities. Further research is needed in order to interpret the important differences that were also found. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI What Are Reasons for the Large Gender Differences in the Lethality of
   Suicidal Acts? An Epidemiological Analysis in Four European Countries
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CASE-FATALITY RATES; DEATHS; MULTICENTER; ALLIANCE; BEHAVIOR; STATES
AB Background
   In Europe, men have lower rates of attempted suicide compared to women and at the same time a higher rate of completed suicides, indicating major gender differences in lethality of suicidal behaviour. The aim of this study was to analyse the extent to which these gender differences in lethality can be explained by factors such as choice of more lethal methods or lethality differences within the same suicide method or age. In addition, we explored gender differences in the intentionality of suicide attempts.
   Methods and Findings
   Methods. Design: Epidemiological study using a combination of self-report and official data. Setting: Mental health care services in four European countries: Germany, Hungary, Ireland, and Portugal. Data basis: Completed suicides derived from official statistics for each country (767 acts, 74.4% male) and assessed suicide attempts excluding habitual intentional self-harm (8,175 acts, 43.2% male).
   Main Outcome Measures and Data Analysis. We collected data on suicidal acts in eight regions of four European countries participating in the EU-funded "OSPI-Europe"-project (www.ospi-europe.com). We calculated method-specific lethality using the number of completed suicides per method * 100 /(number of completed suicides per method + number of attempted suicides per method). We tested gender differences in the distribution of suicidal acts for significance by using the chi(2)-test for two-by-two tables. We assessed the effect sizes with phi coefficients (phi). We identified predictors of lethality with a binary logistic regression analysis. Poisson regression analysis examined the contribution of choice of methods and method-specific lethality to gender differences in the lethality of suicidal acts.
   Findings Main Results
   Suicidal acts (fatal and non-fatal) were 3.4 times more lethal in men than in women (lethality 13.91% (regarding 4106 suicidal acts) versus 4.05% (regarding 4836 suicidal acts)), the difference being significant for the methods hanging, jumping, moving objects, sharp objects and poisoning by substances other than drugs. Median age at time of suicidal behaviour (35-44 years) did not differ between males and females. The overall gender difference in lethality of suicidal behaviour was explained by males choosing more lethal suicide methods (odds ratio (OR) = 2.03; 95% CI = 1.65 to 2.50; p < 0.000001) and additionally, but to a lesser degree, by a higher lethality of suicidal acts for males even within the same method (OR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.32 to 2.02; p = 0.000005). Results of a regression analysis revealed neither age nor country differences were significant predictors for gender differences in the lethality of suicidal acts. The proportion of serious suicide attempts among all non-fatal suicidal acts with known intentionality (NFSAi) was significantly higher in men (57.1%; 1,207 of 2,115 NFSAi) than in women (48.6%; 1,508 of 3,100 NFSAi) (chi(2) = 35.74; p < 0.000001).
   Main limitations of the study
   Due to restrictive data security regulations to ensure anonymity in Ireland, specific ages could not be provided because of the relatively low absolute numbers of suicide in the Irish intervention and control region. Therefore, analyses of the interaction between gender and age could only be conducted for three of the four countries. Attempted suicides were assessed for patients presenting to emergency departments or treated in hospitals. An unknown rate of attempted suicides remained undetected. This may have caused an overestimation of the lethality of certain methods. Moreover, the detection of attempted suicides and the registration of completed suicides might have differed across the four countries. Some suicides might be hidden and misclassified as undetermined deaths.
   Conclusions
   Men more often used highly lethal methods in suicidal behaviour, but there was also a higher method-specific lethality which together explained the large gender differences in the lethality of suicidal acts. Gender differences in the lethality of suicidal acts were fairly consistent across all four European countries examined. Males and females did not differ in age at time of suicidal behaviour. Suicide attempts by males were rated as being more serious independent of the method used, with the exceptions of attempted hanging, suggesting gender differences in intentionality associated with suicidal behaviour. These findings contribute to understanding of the spectrum of reasons for gender differences in the lethality of suicidal behaviour and should inform the development of gender specific strategies for suicide prevention.

AB The views of French, Portuguese, and Spanish people on end-of-life decisions were compared. Two hundred seventy-seven adults from Barcelona, Oporto, and Toulouse judged the acceptability of life-ending procedures in 42 scenarios composed of all combinations of 3 factors: the patient's age (30 or 80 years), the patient's life expectancy (days, weeks, or months), and the type of procedure (suicide, suicide assisted by the physician, euthanasia by the physician at the request of a suffering patient, euthanasia of a comatose patient at the family's request, euthanasia of a comatose patient as stipulated in the patient's advance directives, euthanasia of a comatose patient without advance directions and without a request from the family, or euthanasia of a suffering patient without a request from the patient). In all 3 countries, the type of procedure had the major effect. The 4 procedures implemented by the patient or at the patient's request were, on average, considered acceptable. The 2 procedures not implemented at the patient's request were considered unacceptable. Euthanasia of a comatose patient at the request of the family was judged mildly acceptable. The attitudes of the people in Toulouse, Oporto, and Barcelona concerning the acceptability of ending a patient's life have now largely converged, although Spanish participants were statistically significantly more accepting than French and Portuguese participants.

TI Optimizing Suicide Prevention Programs and Their Implementation in

AB Background: Suicide and non-fatal suicidal behaviour are significant public health issues in Europe requiring effective preventive interventions. However, the evidence for effective preventive strategies is scarce. The protocol of a European research project to develop an optimized evidence based program for suicide prevention is presented.
   Method: The groundwork for this research has been established by a regional community based intervention for suicide prevention that focuses on improving awareness and care for depression performed within the European Alliance Against Depression (EAAD). The EAAD intervention consists of (1) training sessions and practice support for primary care physicians, (2) public relations activities and mass media campaigns, (3) training sessions for community facilitators who serve as gatekeepers for depressed and suicidal persons in the community and treatment and (4) outreach and support for high risk and self-help groups (e.g. helplines). The intervention has been shown to be effective in reducing suicidal behaviour in an earlier study, the Nuremberg Alliance Against Depression. In the context of the current research project described in this paper (OSPI-Europe) the EAAD model is enhanced by other evidence based interventions and implemented simultaneously and in standardised way in four regions in Ireland, Portugal, Hungary and Germany.
   The enhanced intervention will be evaluated using a prospective controlled design with the primary outcomes being composite suicidal acts (fatal and non-fatal), and with intermediate outcomes being the effect of training programs, changes in public attitudes, guideline-consistent media reporting. In addition an analysis of the economic costs and consequences will be undertaken, while a process evaluation will monitor implementation of the interventions within the different regions with varying organisational and healthcare contexts.
   Discussion: This multi-centre research seeks to overcome major challenges of field research in suicide prevention. It pools data from four European regions, considerably increasing the study sample, which will be close to one million. In addition, the study will gather important information concerning the potential to transfer this multilevel program to other health care systems.

AB The scope of this study is to conduct an assessment of the media coverage and dissemination of health issues in Portugal in order to problematize the aspects of coverage and invisibility of health topics and establish the themes neglected in media coverage. To achieve this, the coverage on health issues in the Portuguese daily newspaper Publico was compared with the epidemiological context regarding health priorities and the perceptions of key players on media dissemination and the themes that are relevant to the Portuguese population. The results showed that the recurrent health-associated themes do not deal with diseases per se, but with the politics and economics of health and medication. The themes neglected in media coverage identified in the Portuguese context include: communicable diseases, such as hepatitis and tuberculosis; issues related to mental health and suicide; and ailments and social consequences associated with the economic crisis that has beset Portugal recently. From the standpoint of the people interviewed, other neglected diseases include hemochromatosis and other rare diseases. In tandem with this, the study highlights the well covered media themes that revolve around the lives and activities of celebrities, which are exhaustively aired in the communication media in the country.

AB This study's aims are: (i) identifying spatial patterns for the risk of hospitalization due to mental illness and for the potential risk resulting from contextual factors with influence on mental health; and (ii) analyzing the spatial association between risk of hospitalization due to mental illness and potential risk resulting from contextual factors in the metropolitan areas of Lisbon and Porto, Portugal. A cross-sectional ecological study was conducted by applying statistical methods for assessing spatial dependency and heterogeneity. Results reveal a spatial association between risk of hospitalization due to mental illness and potential risk resulting from contextual factors with a statistical relevance of moderate intensity. 20% of the population under study lives in areas with a simultaneously high potential risk resulting from contextual factors and risk of hospitalization due to mental illness. Porto Metropolitan Area show the highest percentage of population living in parishes with a significantly high risk of hospitalization due to mental health, which puts forward the need for interventions on territory-adjusted contextual factors influencing mental health.

AB Introduction: The number of burns in Portugal remains considerably large and therefore constitutes a major public health problem. There is a shortage of studies describing the epidemiological and clinical impact of seasonality on burn centre admissions, particularly in high income countries.
   Methods: This retrospective analysis included all patients (>18 years old) with acute burns admitted to a specialized Burn Center in Lisbon (Hospital Sao Jose) between 20 of September 2010 and 19 of September 2017 (7 years). Clinical data was obtained from electronic medical records. The patients were categorized into four groups, according to each season.
   Results: Six hundred and sixteen (616) patients were included in this analysis, the majority being male (55.2%). There were no significant differences between the number of patients admitted in each season nor in gender distribution. Older patients were admitted during winter. Hospitalisation time was higher for patients admitted in the winter and surface area injured was higher for those admitted during summer. Fire burns were the most common aetiology in all seasons. Work related burns and suicide attempts were more frequent in the summer. Most patients had more than one anatomical area affected (73.9%) and winter was specifically associated with more frequent isolated lower limb burns. Winter and fire burns were associated with deeper injuries. More patients underwent surgery during winter (80.7%) than in the remaining seasons (average 65%) but the average number of surgeries per season did not change significantly. The overall mortality rate was 6.8% and the need for mechanical ventilation was 28.9%. Concerning both variables we did not find major differences across seasons. Mortality was associated with older patients, deeper and more extensive burns and need for mechanical ventilation.
   Conclusion: Winter seems to be associated with older patients and with the most severe burns (deeper and more often needing surgery). This study was designed to fill the gap in seasonal burn profile in Portugal and it helps in establishing preventive strategies and better resource allocation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

DT Article
ID ATTACHMENT STYLES
AB Introduction: While attending to higher education, multiple changes occur in the lives of young students. These changes make higher education students particularly more exposed and vulnerable to mental health problems, and therefore more likely to present suicidal behaviors.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess suicidal ideation in higher education students, and its relationship with some psychosocial variables.
   Methods: Exploratory, quantitative and descriptive study, applied on a sample of 1074 students of a higher education institution in Portugal.
   Results: Some significant associations with suicidal ideation were found with self-concept factors (self-acceptance, self-effectiveness and impulsivity); stress, anxiety and clinical depression; linkage anxiety and social support activities dimensions; intimacy and total social support.
   Conclusion: In our sample we found 84 students with potential suicidal risk, and through the result analysis, the biopsychosocial profile of the student at risk for suicidal ideation exhibits the following traits: female, age 18/19, low self-concept, insecure linkage patterns and little involvement in social activities and intimacy relationships. All facts considered, higher education institutions should provide programs that promote mental health and suicide prevention in academic environments. The results of this study also have implications for policy makers, clinical practice, suicide prevention and higher education institutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID SUICIDE
AB Background This paper reports the findings of an analytical comparison of several macro indicators collected routinely from institutional sources in Europe. Methods We carried out a review of macro indicators capable of providing a synthetic description of mental health status and the availability of psychiatric care in European countries. These were collected routinely from sources such as WHO, OECD, EUROSTAT, and IMS. The evaluation of temporal trends in each nation permits subsequent comparisons between countries. Results In all European countries, a decreased trend of suicides was observed in the period 1980 - 2000, with the exception of Ireland and ( partially) of Spain. In Ireland, the increased trend was particularly strong, with a high risk in young and adult males. Portugal and Greece had respectively the highest and the lowest rates of undetermined causes of death. Most countries that were high consumers of alcohol in the initial period of observation had a rate above the national mean until 1980, after which consumption decreased. Most nations that were low consumers in 1960 had rates below the mean until 1980, when the rates progressively increased. However, a general decrease of alcohol-related deaths was apparent in all countries. Mortality associated with mental disorder increased, most clearly during the mid 1980s. The number of psychiatrists per 100,000 inhabitants ranged from 3.6 in Spain to 17.5 in Finland; of child psychiatrists, from 0.9 in Germany to 5.1 in Portugal. Psychiatric beds ranged from 0.4 per 1,000 inhabitants in Italy and Spain to 1.3 in Ireland. Nine countries showed a trend towards a reduction in psychiatric beds, whilst in a further five countries no change was observed. Rates of long-stay patients varied from 9.5 in the UK to 84 in Belgium, with a generally decreasing trend. The use of outpatient facilities differed markedly between countries, although there was a general increase over time. Official data were scarce in relation to the sale of psychotropic drugs. IMS data indicated increasing consumption in all European countries for antidepressant and antipsychotic medication. Conclusions The official data resources available for European countries seem to indicate some discrepancies, probably relating to methods of recording. Better co-ordination in the collection of data about mental health status in the European Union and an improvement of the quality in available services is needed.

AB Background: Public attitudes toward depression and help-seeking behaviour are important factors influencing depressed people to obtain professional help and adequate treatment. OSPI-Europe is a multi-level suicide prevention programme including a public awareness campaign. It was implemented in four regions of four European countries (Germany, Hungary, Ireland and Portugal). This paper reports the results of the evaluation of the campaign, including its visibility and effects of the campaign on stigma associated with depression and help seeking behaviour.
   Methods: A representative general population survey (N = 4004) including measures on personal stigma, perceived stigma, openness to help, perceived value of help, and socio-demographic variables was conducted in the four intervention and four control regions in a cross-sectional pre-post design.
   Results: The public awareness campaign was considerably more visible in Germany and Portugal compared to Ireland and Hungary. Visibility was further affected by age and years of schooling. Personal stigma, perceived stigma and openness toward professional help varied significantly across the four countries. Respondents in the intervention regions showed significantly less personal depression stigma than respondents in the control regions after the campaign. Respondents of the intervention region who were aware of the campaign reported more openness toward seeking professional help than respondents who were unaware of it.
   Conclusion: The OSPI-Europe awareness campaign was visible and produced some positive results. At the same time, it proved to be difficult to show strong, measurable and unambiguous effects, which is in line with previous studies. Public awareness campaigns as conducted within OSPI-Europe can contribute to improved attitudes and knowledge about depression in the general public and produce synergistic effects, in particular when the dissemination of awareness campaign materials is simultaneously reinforced by other intervention levels of a multi-level intervention programme.
   Limitations: The survey was cross-sectional and based on self-report, so no causal inferences could be drawn.

TI Financial crisis, austerity, and health in Europe

AB The financial crisis in Europe has posed major threats and opportunities to health. We trace the origins of the economic crisis in Europe and the responses of governments, examine the effect on health systems, and review the effects of previous economic downturns on health to predict the likely consequences for the present. We then compare our predictions with available evidence for the effects of the crisis on health. Whereas immediate rises in suicides and falls in road traffic deaths were anticipated, other consequences, such as HIV outbreaks, were not, and are better understood as products of state retrenchment. Greece, Spain, and Portugal adopted strict fiscal austerity; their economies continue to recede and strain on their health-care systems is growing. Suicides and outbreaks of infectious diseases are becoming more common in these countries, and budget cuts have restricted access to health care. By contrast, Iceland rejected austerity through a popular vote, and the financial crisis seems to have had few or no discernible effects on health. Although there are many potentially confounding differences between countries, our analysis suggests that, although recessions pose risks to health, the interaction of fiscal austerity with economic shocks and weak social protection is what ultimately seems to escalate health and social crises in Europe. Policy decisions about how to respond to economic crises have pronounced and unintended effects on public health, yet public health voices have remained largely silent during the economic crisis.

TI Austerity: a failed experiment on the people of Europe
SO CLINICAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID PUBLIC-HEALTH PROFESSIONALS; FINANCIAL CRISIS
AB Many governments in Europe, either of their own volition or at the behest of the international financial institutions, have adopted stringent austerity policies in response to the financial crisis. By contrast, the USA launched a financial stimulus. The results of these experiments are now clear: the American economy is growing and those European countries adopting austerity, including the UK, Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain, are stagnating and struggling to repay rising debts. An initial recovery in the UK was halted once austerity measures hit. However, austerity has been not only an economic failure, but also a health failure, with increasing numbers of suicides and, where cuts in health budgets are being imposed, increasing numbers of people being unable to access care. Yet their stories remain largely untold. Here, we argue that there is an alternative to austerity, but that ideology is triumphing over evidence. Our paper was written to contribute to discussions among health policy leaders in Europe that will take place at the 15th European Health Forum at Gastein in October 2012, as its theme 'Crisis and Opportunity Health in an Age of Austerity'.

AB Intimate partner violence (IPV) is an important cause of women's health and socio-familial severe problems, the most extreme being the victims' homicide. This is the first nationwide Portuguese autopsy-based and judicial-proven study about female intimate partner homicide.
   At least 62 women over 15 years old were killed by current or former men-intimate partners, corresponding to an IPV-related female mortality rate of 0.44/100.000 women; intimate partner violence was the reason of homicide in 60.8% of all autopsied women.
   The typical Portuguese victim showed to be a young adult woman, employed, killed by a current husband in a long-term relationship, usually with children in common and with a history of previous IPV. The typical Portuguese perpetrator showed to be older than the victim, employed, owning a firearm and without criminal records. At the time of the fatal event 59.7% of the relationships were current. In 57.9% of the former relationships women were killed during the 1st year after its terminus. Near half of the perpetrators attempted or committed suicide afterward. Most women were killed by gunshot wounds (45.2%), especially in the thorax (48.4%), with multiple fatal injuries; 56.5% also presented non-fatal injuries.
   The detection of prior IPV and the risk evaluation seems to be fundamental to decrease these fatal outcomes, but also, the prevention of perpetrators' alcohol abuse and carrying weapons. This work emphasizes the need to deepen the research on this issue, aiming to contribute to prevent both fatal and non-fatal IPV-related cases.

AB The economic crisis has placed Portugal in a situation of budgetary constraints with repercussions on mental health, since 2009. This study analyses the association between economic crisis and the inpatient profile of major depression in the working-age population in Portuguese National Health System hospitals. This was an observational, descriptive and cross-sectional study. An individual analysis of hospitalisation and an ecological analysis at district level, were performed before 2008 and during the crisis (2013). Data on the hospitalisation episodes, working-age population and psychiatric inpatient beds were analysed. An increase in hospitalisation rates for major depression were observed, and across country, high spatial variations were perceived: districts with lower rates of urbanisation and population density had higher hospitalisation rates for major depression. Hospitalisation rates were positively influenced by the available inpatient beds. The results for 2013 were more critical (higher hospitalisation rates, less beds). Further research is needed to understand all patterns, considering other individual and contextual information.

AB The KADS-6 is a self-report assessment instrument known for its ease application in assessing depression in young people. This study aimed to contribute to the validation of the Portuguese version of this tool and analyze its psychometric characteristics in comparison with other self-report instruments for depression in adolescents, in Portugal. Two samples were collected, a non-clinical group of in school youth (n=773; 52.4% male) and a clinical sample (n=134 youth; 44% male). Comparisons also used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI). Results: The factor analysis revealed the unidimensionality of the measure. The KADS-6 demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) in both clinical (. 74) and school (. 80) samples. Its convergent validity with the BDI-II and CDI was r=.44; r=.61, respectively in the clinical sample and r=.60; r=.57 in the school sample. The KADS-6, a short and time efficient instrument, showed good psychometric characteristics in terms of internal consistency and convergent validity in comparison with the BDI-II and the CDI. Given its ease of use and scoring, the KADS-6 could be considered for use in both school and clinical settings when addressing adolescent depression.

AB INTRODUCTION. The study aims to analyse the relationship between depression, socio-demographic factors, suicide risk, and satisfaction with social support of nursing students attending a public school in the North of Portugal.
   METHODS. A quantitative, exploratory, transversal and correlational study was performed. The non-probabilistic intentional sample comprised 420 students (30 % of the overall population). Data collection was carried out online between October and December 2015. The voluntary participation complied with all ethical guidelines.
   RESULTS. The majority of participants were female (88.5 %), with an average age of 22.4 years (SD = 4 years). Out of this total, 28.6 % had already received or were receiving psychological or psychiatric support. Depressive symptoms were found in an average of 9.87 (SD = 8.79) students, a figure which is very close to clinically relevant indicators. 32.4 % showed slight depression, 7.6 % moderate depression and 2.6 % severe depression.
   DISCUSSION. These findings suggest the importance of designing targeted interventions in order to cope with such complex problem. The rates of depression are high when compared to other nursing students and very high when compared with community samples.
   CONCLUSIONS. The results emphasize the need to develop mental health promotion programmes among this population, together with risk prevention mechanisms through early detection of depressive symptoms and the implementation of structures or professional teams able to provide students with therapeutic support.

AB Lithium is a key component in green energy storage technologies and is rapidly becoming a metal of crucial importance to the European Union. The different industrial uses of lithium are discussed in this review along with a compilation of the locations of the main geological sources of lithium. An emphasis is placed on lithium's use in lithium ion batteries and their use in the electric vehicle industry. The electric vehicle market is driving new demand for lithium resources. The expected scale-up in this sector will put pressure on current lithium supplies. The European Union has a burgeoning demand for lithium and is the second largest consumer of lithium resources. Currently, only 1-2% of worldwide lithium is produced in the European Union (Portugal). There are several lithium mineralisations scattered across Europe, the majority of which are currently undergoing mining feasibility studies. The increasing cost of lithium is driving a new global mining boom and should see many of Europe's mineralisation's becoming economic. The information given in this paper is a source of contextual information that can be used to support the European Union's drive towards a low carbon economy and to develop the field of research.

AB The global increase in elderly population all over the world, especially in Portugal, justifies the importance of mental health study in this age group. The aim of this study was to characterize the elderly patients in Gerontopsychiatry Consultation of Centro Hospitalar Sao Joao in Porto, related to socio-demographic aspects, physical and global disabilities, depression, suicidal ideation and quality of life, and to explore the association between suicidal ideation, depression, and quality of life and global and functional disability. In this cross-sectional study, 155 patients were recruited consecutively, with a final sample of 75 subjects (59 women and 16 men) without cognitive deficits and a mean age of 72.8 (SD = 6.04). Concerning the depression level measured with the Geriatric Depression Scale (Barreto et al., 2008) it was found that 66.7% presented severe depression and suicidal ideation (M = 41.96, SD = 36.38), a value considered with a potential risk of suicide using the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (Ferreira & Castela, 1999). The elderly also perceived their quality of life as low, revealing global disability assessed with the EasyCare-Elderly Assessment (Sousa & Figueiredo, 2000a). A significant positive correlation was also found between depression and suicidal ideation (rs = . 71, p < .001), as well as quality of life (rs = .50, p < .001), and suicidal ideation with quality of life (rs = .40, p < .001). The data obtained in this study corroborate the results found in other studies.

AB Introduction: Anorexia nervosa is a severe, usually chronic, life-threatening disease of complex etiology characterized by food restriction, overestimation of the importance of body weight and image, intense fear of weight gain and distortion of body image. Anorexia nervosa is associated with high rates of mortality, suicide and decreased quality of life. Our aim is to present an anorexia nervosa treatment program offered in a major university hospital in Portugal, and to determine the impact of illness duration before admission on the outcome. Our hypothesis is that patients with greater disease longevity may have worse prognosis and poorer outcome.
   Material and Methods: The sample included data from case records of 169 patients seen consecutively and for the first time at Centro Hospitalar Sao Joao, between 2010 and 2015. We performed a retrospective observational study which included data collected at admission and from later follow-up years.
   Results: From the initially selected patients, 14.8% reached total remission, 16% accomplished partial remission and 14.2% ended up with exacerbation/stagnation of the disease. The dropout rate was of 55% throughout our study period. We found significant differences on outcome rates between distinct illness duration groups (p = 0.007).
   Discussion: There are several factors frequently associated with poor outcome for anorexia nervosa. The interpretation of outcome findings was limited by the high rate of dropout and lack of consistent definition criteria.
   Conclusion: Our results support the idea that illness duration has an important role on the outcome and prognostic features of these patients.

AB AimsAcute drug overdose, especially with paracetamol, may cause acute liver failure leading to registration for transplantation (ALFT). Population statistics and between-country differences for ALFT related to overdose have been poorly described. The aim of the present study was to evaluate overdose ALFT in the multi-country Study of Acute Liver Transplantation (SALT).
   MethodsAll adult overdose-related ALFT, with or without suicidal intent, in France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and the UK between 2005 and 2007 were identified from liver transplant registries and hospital records. These were compared with whole-country and per capita use of paracetamol.
   ResultsSix hundred cases of ALFT were identified in 52 of 57 eligible transplant centres, of which 114 involved overdose (72 intentional, 10 non-intentional, 32 uncertain). Overdose represented 20% of all-cause ALFT: Ireland 52%, UK 28%, France 18%, the Netherlands 8%, and Italy 1%. Overdose ALFT were mostly females (61%), mean age 33.610.9years. A total of 111 (97%) of the overdoses involved paracetamol. Event rates ranged from one ALFT for 20.7 tons of paracetamol in Ireland, to one for 1074 tons in Italy and one case in 60 million inhabitants over 3years in Italy to one case in 286000 inhabitants per year in Ireland. Per-country event rates for non-overdose ALFT exposed to paracetamol were between 2.5 and 4.0 per million treatment-years sold.
   ConclusionsParacetamol overdose was found to represent one-sixth of all-cause ALFT. There was a 50-fold difference in Europe in the rates of paracetamol overdose ALFT, and a 200-fold difference per million inhabitants.

SO JOURNAL OF FORENSIC AND LEGAL MEDICINE

DT Article
DE Carbon monoxide; Forensic practice; Retrospective study
AB This study presents the epidemiology and the postmortem forensic aspects in cases with a carboxihemoglobin (COHb) analysis, from autopsies performed at the Forensic Pathology Department of the Centre Branch of the National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences of Portugal. Between January 2000 and December 2010, 69 COHb analyses were requested in our institution. In approximately 70% of the situations, circumstantial information included a Carbon Monoxide (CO) source at the death scene. More than half of the cases presented thermal lesions, cherry-red lividity, and cherry-red blood and viscera coloration were found in, approximately, 30% of the cases. Fourteen cases were recorded as CO poisonings. The highest number of poisonings occurred in 2000, with most of the cases in winter (53.8%), in 51-60 years-old male individuals. 69.2% of the poisonings were accidental and the remainder were suicides, being fires the most frequent sources of CO (38.5%). Cherry-red lividity was present in 61.5% of the cases, and all of them presented cherry-red blood and viscera coloration. Older individuals and those with thermal lesions presented lower COHb levels, and politrauma was the most frequent cause of death among the negative cases. It is possible to conclude that the forensic aspects of CO poisonings interact in a complex way, and differential diagnosis is not straightforward. This study also emphasizes the role played by public prevention campaigns and improvement of heating appliances in reducing the number of accidental CO poisonings, and the importance of preventing urban and forest fires, the major source of CO among us.

AB Purpose Recognizing the relevance of mental pain in drug addiction, this study aimed to adapt and validate the Portuguese translation of the Orbach & Mikulincer Mental Pain Scale (OMMP) on a drug addicted population and assess its psychometric properties.
   Methods The study sample (N = 403) was collected from several outpatient treatment centres for drug addiction and in therapeutic communities located in the north of Portugal. The validation of the OMMP Scale followed the same method considered by the authors of the original scale.
   Results A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed and did not confirm the structure of eight factors provided by the authors. An exploratory factor analysis revealed a five-factor model (labeled emptiness, irreversibility, emotional flooding, helplessness and confusion) leading to a reduction from 40 to 24 items. The OMMP-24-P showed acceptable levels for internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Confirmatory factor analysis indices supported the five-factor model. OMMP-24-P factors were positively correlated with measures of stress, anxiety and depression, negatively associated with quality of life, and showed small to moderate positive correlations with drug addiction severity, with exception of the helplessness factor.
   Conclusions This study has shown the OMMP-24-P to be a valid and reliable scale for assessment and evaluation of mental pain among drug addicts. Further research should attempt to determine the contribution that mental pain can provide towards an understanding of drug addiction dynamics and other psychopathological syndromes, and thereby contribute to the development of more effective treatment programs.

AB In the last decades the paradigm of the early intervention in the first psychotic episodes (FEP) has spread all over the world and the research has shown its benefits in terms of improvement in recovery rates, psychotic relapse and suicide.
   Currently, a criticism of this intervention model is its arbitrary age criterion that raises issues of potential age and gender discrimination. There are arguments for and against the expansion of the age limits of early intervention programs (EIPs), with most of the `counter' arguments based on the premise that patients with younger FEP represent the vast majority of cases, have a greater disruption functionally, greater psychosocial needs and a worse prognosis in the long term. However, recent data challenge these conceptions and indicate that psychosis arises at any stage of life with marked impact and disruption, with the population experiencing late illnesses requiring treatment and intervention equivalent to or greater than younger patients. This debate is hampered by the relative lack of knowledge about late FEPs - the majority of EIPs are focused on youth, so the flow of research tends to follow this pattern. Thus, populations of late FEP are relatively neglected with little literature focusing on this topic.
   Based on a non - systematic review of the literature, the authors intend to present the main arguments that have been raised in favor of and against the remodeling of the EIP, according to the age criterion, analyzing and comparing the international scenario and the Portuguese reality in this scope..

AB Over the past five decades, two successive waves of political reform have brought democracy to, first, Spain, Portugal and Greece, and, more recently, Central and Eastern European countries. We assessed whether democratization was associated with improvements in population health, as indicated by life expectancy and cause-specific mortality rates.
   Data on life expectancy at birth, age-standardized total and cause-specific mortality rates, levels of democracy and potential time-variant confounding variables were collected from harmonized international databanks. In two pooled cross-sectional time-series analyses with country-fixed effects, life expectancy and cause-specific mortality were regressed on measures of current and cumulative democracy, controlling for confounders. A first analysis covered the 1960-1990 period, a second covered the 1987-2008 period.
   In the 1960-1990 period, current democracy was more strongly associated with higher life expectancy than cumulative democracy. The positive effects of current democracy on total mortality were mediated mainly by lower mortality from heart disease, pneumonia, liver cirrhosis, and suicide.
   In the 1987-2008 period, however, current democracy was associated with lower, and cumulative democracy with higher life expectancy, particularly among men. The positive effects of cumulative democracy on total mortality were mediated mainly by lower mortality from circulatory diseases, cancer of the breast, and external causes. Current democracy was associated with higher mortality from motor vehicle accidents in both periods, and also with higher mortality from cancer and all external causes in the second.
   Our results suggest that in Europe during these two periods democratization has had mixed effects. That short-term changes in levels of democracy had positive effects in the first but not in the second period is probably due to the fact that democratization in Central and Eastern Europe was part of a complete system change which caused major societal disruptions.

AB In 2017 the inauguration of the Mungsten Bridge, a most ambitious, wide-span bridge from 19th century Germany, dated back 120 years. For that reason, a designation of the bridge as a UNESCO World heritage site as part of a conglomerate together with four other European bridges, the Maria Pia Bridge and the Dom Luiz I Bridge in Porto/Portugal, the Viaduct of Garabit in France and the Ponte Michele in Northern Italy, is currently prepared. The five bridges were designed and built between 1875 and 1897, and they are all similar in terms of the technological and political ambition they were projected with. The Mungsten Bridge, at that time named "Kaiser-Wilhelm-Bridge", included numerous innovative technical features concerning the design, the material as well as the applied construction methods and until today, the bridge is attributed with various legends. One of these legends deals with an engineer, who committed suicide because of false calculations or construction details, which he had contributed to the project. As Anton v. Rieppel is believed to be the only creator and designer of the "Mungsten Bridge", there was never a reason for doubting his predominance. Recently found historical sources however, name in fact another person who was supposed to be involved in the Mungsten Bridge project and could be another protagonist. Before working for the company, responsible for the design and construction of the Mungsten Bridge, he was a known engineer in 19th century steel bridge design with a large engineering expertise among eight wide span bridges over River Rhine. He died in a natural way, shortly after completion of the bridge in 1897. These facts and the situation, that he was consistently concealed in the context of the Mungsten Bridge, point at special circumstances, which lead to the complete obliteration of his lifework in professional public.

AB Objective: To analyze the initial five years' experience of the new heart transplant program of Coimbra University Hospitals.
   Methods: Between November 2003 and December 2008, 132 patients were transplanted, with a mean age of 52.0 years (range 3-71 years), of whom 98 were male (74%). Half of the patients had dilated cardiomyopathy and 33% ischemic cardiomyopathy. The mean age of donors was 31.7 years and 102 were male (77%). Donor hearts were harvested at a distance in 62% of cases. There was a gender mismatch between donor and recipient (F:M) in 19% of cases and ABO blood type disparity (not identical but compatible) in 11%. In all cases we used the technique of total transplantation with bicaval anastomosis, modified in this center. Mean ischemia time was 88.9 +/- 32.2 minutes. All patients received induction therapy with basiliximab and methylprednisolone.
   Results: Six patients (4.5%) died within 30 days or during hospitalization, due to graft failure in four and hyperacute rejection in two. Two patients required prolonged ventilation, ten (8%) required inotropic support for more than 48 hours, and four required pacemaker implantation. Mean hospital stay was 15.6 +/- 15.2 days (median 13 days). Ninety percent of patients (116/129) were maintained on triple immunosuppressive therapy, including cyclosporine, the remainder receiving tacrolimus. In 23 patients it was necessary to change the immunosuppressive regimen due to renal and/or tumoral complications, or humoral rejection. All patients are followed regularly in the Surgical Center. Thirteen patients (10%) died late of cancer (6 patients), infection (4 patients), and pancreatitis, pulmonary hypertension and suicide (one patient each). Twenty-two patients (17%) had 25 episodes of cellular rejection (>= 2R), with clinical consequences in only one case, and five had humoral rejection (3.9%). No patients died of late rejection, but there is evidence of mild graft vascular disease in one. Actuarial survival (Kaplan-Meier) at one and five years was 90% and 82%, respectively.
   Conclusion: In this initial series of five years we obtained results equivalent to or better than those in centers with wider and longer experience, aided by self-correction arising from our own experience. This program has increased the rate of cardiac transplantation in Portugal to above the European average.
