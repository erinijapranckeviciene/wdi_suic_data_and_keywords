AB Background: Although much is known about the correlates of heroin overdose, less is known about pharmaceutical opioid (PO) overdose. This study aimed to examine correlates of opioid overdose deaths by opioid and compare correlates between opioids.
   Methods: Analysis of opioid overdose deaths in Australia between 2000-2015, extracted from the National Coronial Information System (NCIS). The NCIS is an online database of deaths reportable to the coroner, and contains coroner's findings, autopsy and toxicology reports. Deaths were categorized into mutually exclusive groups: 1) Heroin deaths; and 2) PO deaths (excluding heroin). PO deaths were examined by individual opioid.
   Results: There were 10,795 opioid overdose deaths over the study period. Relative to deaths occurring in major cities, deaths in regional/remote areas had 15.2 (95 % CI: 11.5-20.2) times the risk of being attributed to pharmaceutical fentanyl than heroin. Relative to deaths among people without a recorded history of chronic pain, deaths among people with a recorded history of chronic pain had a 1.9-10.7-fold increased risk of the death being attributed to POs than heroin. Deaths among people with a recorded history of substance use problems where the opioid was injected prior to death had 7.2 and 1.7 times the risk of being attributed to methadone and pharmaceutical fentanyl (respectively) than heroin.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest the need to: educate PO consumers about the risks of overdose at the time of prescribing; increase coverage and engagement in opioid dependence treatment (particularly in regional/remote areas); and increase uptake of take-home naloxone to reduce opioid overdose mortality.

AB Aim To measure the stress levels of Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) students at the University of Sydney using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) questionnaire. Methods DVM students in years 1 to 4 were surveyed in semester 2 of 2018. The voluntary online survey consisted of 6 demographic questions and the K10 scale, a standardised measure of stress commonly used in Australia by medical practitioners for evaluation and referral to mental health professionals. Academic year cohorts were compared to identify differences in stress levels. Cohorts were compared to published K10 scores from various populations including the Australian public, medical students, practicing veterinarians, and Junior Medical Officers (JMOs). Results The response rate was 54.4% (n = 237). DVM students experienced a higher level of psychological distress (mean 24, median 23, range 10-50) than the Australian population (mean 14.5, median 13, range 10-50), medical students (mean 18.4, median 16, range 10-50), practicing veterinarians (mean 16.7, median 15.5, range 10-30), and JMOs (mean 18.1, median 16, range 10-50). Female students (median 23) had a significantly higher level of psychological distress compared to male students (median 18) (p = 0.0005). International students (median 23) had a higher level of psychological stress than domestic students (median 22) (p = 0.0488). Different year cohorts, age range, work hours, and exercise were not associated with difference in stress levels. Conclusion Based on higher levels of stress in DVM students than that of the general population, practicing veterinarians, JMOs and medical students, there is an urgent need for evidence-based interventions to target stress in DVM students.

AB Background: Inhalant misuse is the deliberate inhalation of products containing toluene to induce intoxication. Chronic harms associated with inhalant misuse are well described; including alcohol and other drug use, mental health disorders, and suicidal behaviours. However, the nature of the acute harms from inhalants and characteristics of people who experience those harms are not well understood. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the acute harms associated with inhalant misuse attendances, and to determine whether these differ by age or gender.
   Methods: Ambulance attendance data (Victoria, Australia) from January 2012 to June 2017 were extracted from a database of coded ambulance records. 779 ambulance attendances involving inhalant misuse were identified. Attendance characteristics were categorised by age and gender. Co-morbidities of current mental health, self-harm and suicidal behaviour were assessed, plus the involvement of alcohol and other drugs.
   Results: Overall, attendances related to the acute harms of inhalant misuse have decreased over time, although that trend has reversed from January 2015. Gender differentiated the acute harms associated with inhalant misuse. Males were older and presented with concurrent alcohol and other drug use. Females were younger and presented with concurrent suicidal ideation and self-injury. Attendances for under 15-year-olds are increasing; this age group was over-represented, predominantly female, with a strong association with self-injury.
   Conclusions: Ambulance presentations related to inhalant misuse were associated with acute and serious harms. This study highlights that the acute treatment needs of those misusing inhalants are complex and may need to be tailored to gender and age groups.

AB Background: Medico-legal death investigations are a recognised data source for public health endeavours and its accessibility has increased following the development of electronic data systems. Despite time and cost savings, the strengths and limitations of this method and impact on research findings remain untested. This study examines this issue using the National Coronial Information System (NCIS).
   Methods: PubMed, ProQuest and Informit were searched to identify publications where the NCIS was used as a data source for research published during the period 2000-2014. A descriptive analysis was performed to describe the frequency and characteristics of the publications identified. A content analysis was performed to identify the nature and impact of strengths and limitations of the NCIS as reported by researchers.
   Results: Of the 106 publications included, 30 reported strengths and limitations, 37 reported limitations only, seven reported strengths only and 32 reported neither. The impact of the reported strengths of the NCIS was described in 14 publications, whilst 46 publications discussed the impacts of limitations. The NCIS was reported to be a reliable source of quality, detailed information with comprehensive coverage of deaths of interest, making it a powerful injury surveillance tool. Despite these strengths, researchers reported that open cases and missing information created the potential for selection and reporting biases and may preclude the identification and control of confounders.
   Conclusions: To ensure research results are valid and inform health policy, it is essential to consider and seek to overcome the limitations of data sources that may have an impact on results.

ID DISORDERS; NEED; FOUNDATION; DEPRESSION; SUICIDE; SCALE
AB Objective: To assess the extent to which youth-specific, mental health care centres engage young people (12-25 years of age) in treatment, and to report the degree of psychological distress, and the diagnostic type, stage of illness, and psychosocial and vocational impairment evident in these young people.
   Design and setting: Standardised clinical and self-report assessments of consecutive presentations at two youth-specific centres from October 2007 to December 2009. Both sites are operated by the Brain and Mind Research Institute in Sydney, Australia, as part of headspace: the National Youth Mental Health Foundation mental health care service.
   Results: Of 1260 young people assessed, 53% were male, and the mean (SD) age was 18.1 (3.9) years. Over 40% of the young people were self-referred, or their assessment was arranged by family or friends, or by other social agencies; 30% of young people were referred from other primary health providers. Almost 70% reported high or very high levels of psychological distress. More than 60% of subjects reported having 2 or more days "unable to function" within the past month, and clinicians rated over 50% as having at least moderate difficulty in social/occupational functioning. Importantly, 25% of subjects were receiving income support. Two-thirds of subjects were rated as being at the early stage of an illness, and almost half were diagnosed with anxiety or depressive syndromes.
   Conclusions: Targeted youth-specific mental health services, based in primary care settings, are able to engage young Australians, particularly young men, in treatment. Many of these young people report established patterns of psychosocial and vocational impairment.

AB Near-hanging is an increasing presentation to hospitals in Australasia. We reviewed the clinical management and outcome of these patients as they presented to public hospitals in Queensland. A retrospective clinical record audit was made at five public hospitals between 1991 and 2000. Of 161 patients enrolled, 82% were male, 8% were indigenous and 10% had made a previous hanging attempt. Chronic medical illnesses were documented in 11% and previous psychiatric disorders in 42%. Of the 38 patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) of 3 on arrival at hospital, 32% returned to independent living and 63% died. Fifty-two patients received CPR, of whom 46% had an independent functional outcome. Independent predictors of mortality were a GCS on hospital arrival of 3 (AOR 150, CI 95% 12.4-1818, P < 0.001), taking plain X-rays of the cervical spine (AOR 0.06, CI 95% 0.004-0.97, P=0.047) and contact with the ground (AOR 0.03, CI 95% 0.002-0.62, P=0.02). Only 66% had imaging of the cervical spine performed with other imaging performed infrequently. There were three laryngeal, two hyoid bone and three cervical spine injuries and one carotid dissection. The number of cervical spine X-rays required to find a significant cervical spine fracture was 54. Near-hanging presenting to hospital with a poor conscious state or even cardiac arrest can have a favourable clinical outcome. Radiological investigations are infrequently performed despite a low GCS precluding early accurate assessment. Given the general favourable outcome, an aggressive approach to searching for correctable injuries is recommended.

AB Background: Medicinal substances have been identified as common agents of both unintentional and intentional poisoning among older people, including those with dementia. This study aims to compare the characteristics of poisoning resulting in hospitalization in older people with and without dementia and their clinical outcomes.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study involving an examination of poisoning by intent involving individuals aged 50+ years with and without dementia using linked hospitalization and mortality records during 2003-2012. Individuals who had dementia were identified from hospital diagnoses and unintentional and intentional poisoning was identified using external cause classifications. The epidemiological profile (i.e. individual and incident characteristics) of poisoning by intent and dementia status was compared, along with clinical outcomes of hospital length of stay (LOS), 28-day readmission and 30-day mortality.
   Results: The hospitalization rate for unintentional and intentional poisoning for individuals with dementia was double and 1.5 times higher than the rates for individuals without dementia (69.5 and 31.6 per 100,000) and (56.4 and 32.5 per 1,00,000). The home was the most common location of poisoning. Unintentional poisoning was more likely to involve individuals residing in aged care facilities (OR 2.12; 95% CI 1.70-2.63) or health service facilities (OR 3.91; 95% CI 3.45-4.42). There were higher mortality rates and longer LOS for unintentional poisoning for individuals with dementia.
   Conclusions: Clinicians need to be aware of the risks of poisoning for individuals with dementia and care is required in appropriate prescription, safe administration, and potential for self-harm with commonly used medications, such as anticholinesterase medications, antihypertensive drugs, and laxatives.

AB Background/Aims: Non-fatal opioid overdose (NFOO) and major depression (MD) are highly prevalent in heroin users. Many risk factors are known for NFOO, but studies in non-clinical samples on its relationship with MD are lacking. We aimed to examine this relationship in a street-recruited sample, controlling for potential well-known confounders. Methods: A cross-sectional study in 452 heroin users street-recruited by chain referral methods in three Spanish cities. Eligibility criteria were: age <= 30 years, heroin use at least 12 days in the last year and at least once in the last 3 months. Depression was assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. A precise definition of NFOO was used. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) for the NFOO predictors were obtained by logistic regression. Results: The prevalence of NFOO and MD in the last 12 months was 9.1 and 23.2%, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, NFOO and MD were significantly associated (AOR 2.2; 95% CI 1.01-4.74). Other associated factors were imprisonment (AOR 4.1; 95% CI 1.4-12.1), drug injection (AOR 6.7; 95% CI 2.4-18.4) and regular use of tranquillisers/sleeping pills (AOR 2.9; 95% CI 1.16-7). Conclusions: Drug and mental health treatment facilities should consider the relationship between MD and NFOO when contacting and treating heroin users. Imprisonment, drug injection and use of tranquillisers/sleeping pills are also risk factors for NFOO. Copyright (C) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Background: Public policy across the world is increasingly focusing on the role of mental health promotion in whole of health strategies. There is a growing evidence-base that mental health promotion, delivered by trained facilitators, is effective in promoting self-awareness and self-care to prevent the damaging effects of ongoing stress in one's life and to promote early detection of any possible emerging mental health problems. Within Australia, however, few clinicians or school staff are confident or trained in mental health promotion. Aims: This paper reports the results of a two-day training designed for facilitators of a mental health program for secondary-school students. The goal was to develop facilitators' knowledge and understanding of best practice in youth mental health promotion and to increase their confidence in delivering the program. Design: A mixed methods evaluation assessed the impact that a solution-focused training program had on participating facilitators. Methods: A questionnaire was created and included eight quantitative items and one open ended, qualitative question. Twenty-seven nurses and guidance officers from central Queensland were recruited via convenience sampling and data were analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Results: The evaluation revealed that participants' perception of their ability to facilitate a youth mental health program significantly improved after completing the training. Qualitative data indicated that participants found the professional development experience to be valuable, provide useful and transferable skills, and believed it to be necessary for mental health promotion work. Conclusion: By providing detailed description of the program's content and processes, other mental health professionals may be inspired to further develop effective learning experiences.

AB Objective: Previous Australian research suggests there is very little difference in the prevalence of mental health disorders across rural, remote and metropolitan areas. However, mental health specialists are particularly scarce in rural and remote areas and some researchers have argued that non-metropolitan residents rely heavily on general practitioners (GPs) for mental health care. This article investigated rates of GP services for psychological problems across rural, remote and metropolitan areas.
   Method: The Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health (BEACH) program, Medicare and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme data were used in this report. Data included all psychological, depression and anxiety problems reported as managed by GPs and prescriptions for mental health medications (written and filled). Problem and medication rates are given per 100 patient encounters and per 1000 population.
   Results: Only a few regional differences were evident in the rate of psychological problems and prescriptions for mental health medications per 100 GP-patient encounters. However, rural and remote residents visited GPs less frequently than their metropolitan counterparts. Lower rates of GP encounters for psychological problems were evident for residents of most non-metropolitan areas (per 1000 population). Additionally, GPs prescribed mental health medications at half the rate for residents of remote areas than capital cities.
   Conclusions: General practitioners provide fewer mental health services per capita in non-metropolitan areas. This difference could represent completely untreated psychological problems or fewer follow-up consultations. While non-metropolitan residents have limited access to specialists, rates of GP encounters for psychological problems are also very low.

ID QUALITY-OF-LIFE; PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; TERMINALLY ILL; MODEL;
   EUTHANASIA; CANCER
AB Purpose This study examined a novel intervention, dignity therapy, designed to address psychosocial and existential distress among terminally ill patients. Dignity therapy invites patients to discuss issues that matter most or that they would most want remembered. Sessions are transcribed and edited, with a returned final version that they can bequeath to a friend or family member. The objective of this study was to establish the feasibility of dignity therapy and determine its impact on various measures of psychosocial and existential distress.
   Patients and Methods Terminally ill inpatients and those receiving home-based palliative care services in Winnipeg, Canada, and Perth, Australia, were asked to complete pre- and postintervention measures of sense of dignity, depression, suffering, and hopelessness; sense of purpose, sense of meaning, desire for death, will to live, and suicidality; and a postintervention satisfaction survey.
   Results Ninety-one percent of participants reported being satisfied with dignity therapy; 76% reported a heightened sense of dignity; 68% reported an increased sense of purpose; 67% reported a heightened sense of meaning; 47% reported an increased will to live; and 81 % reported that it had been or would be of help to their family. Postintervention measures of suffering showed significant improvement (P =.023) and reduced depressive symptoms (P =.05). Finding dignity therapy helpful to their family correlated with life feeling more meaningful (r = 0.480; P =.000) and having a sense of purpose (r = 0.562; P =.000), accompanied by a lessened sense of suffering (r = 0.327; P =.001) and increased will to live (r = 0.387; P =.000).
   Conclusion Dignity therapy shows promise as a novel therapeutic intervention for suffering and distress at the end of life.

AB Purpose We know little about how community structures influence the risk of common mental illnesses. This study presents a new way to establish links between depression and social fragmentation, thereby identifying pathways to better target mental health services and prevention programs to the right people in the right place.
   Method A principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted to develop the proposed Australian neighborhood social fragmentation index (ANSFI). General practice clinical data were used to identify cases of diagnosed depression. The association between ANSFI and depression was explored using multilevel logistic regression. Spatial hot spots (clusters) of depression prevalence and social fragmentation at the statistical area level 1 (SA1) were examined.
   Results Two components of social fragmentation emerged, reflecting fragmentation related to family structure and mobility. Individuals treated for depression in primary care were more likely to live in neighborhoods with lower socioeconomic status and with higher social fragmentation related to family structure. A 1-SD increase in social fragmentation was associated with a 16% higher depression prevalence (95% CI 11%, 20%). However, the association attenuated with adjustment for neighborhood socio-economic status. Considerable spatial variation in social fragmentation and depression patterns across communities was observed.
   Conclusions Developing a social fragmentation index for the first time in Australia at a small area level generates a new line of knowledge on the impact of community structures on health risks. Findings may extend our understanding of the mechanisms that drive geographical variation in the incidence of common mental disorders and mental health care.

AB Aim Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people are more likely to experience mental health issues or end their life by suicide than non-Aboriginal youth, but are less likely to access mental health services for support. Systemic change is required if mainstream youth mental health services are to be relevant and culturally secure for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people. Methods Building Bridges (2017-2019) is a three-year participatory action research project being conducted in partnership with the Nyoongar community and three mainstream youth mental health services in Perth, Western Australia. The project involves Nyoongar Elders and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people working directly with senior management and key staff of youth mental health services to co-design, implement and evaluate a framework for systems change. The aim of the project is to increase Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people's engagement with services and improve mental health outcomes for young people and their families. Results This paper outlines the engagement process that underpinned the first phase of the project. Our research methods are premised by an investment in establishing safe spaces for the Elders, young people and service staff to engage in open, honest dialogue. We present two key activities that illustrate this process of building trust and deepening understanding, namely: spending time "On Country" and engaging in a "storying" process. Conclusions Building Bridges demonstrates the centrality of trusting relationships for systemic change and the way in which meaningful engagement is at the core of both the process and the outcome.

AB Objective: This study was undertaken to examine the association of hydrogen cyanide and carboxyhaemoglobin in victims of fire related deaths in Australia. The secondary aim was to document demographic data about Australian fire related deaths. Methods: An observational retrospective study was undertaken of autopsy reports from the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine. Reports of fire related deaths were electronically searched using the terms burns, "smoke" or "fire" as a cause of death in the calender years 1992 to 1998. Data on the circumstances of the fire and results of toxicological screening were obtained on 178 persons. Additional whole blood cyanide levels were determined if blood samples were available in storage. Demographics of the victims were analysed, as well as the relationship between carboxyhaemoglobin and whole blood cyanide levels. Results: Most (82%) of the victims died at the scene, whilst 32 victims died after a period of hospitalisation (hours to weeks). Suicide as a result of self-immolation was the reported cause of death in 32 cases. Most of the fires were in houses (114) and cars (29). The blood ethanol level was zero in 112 cases; the remaining cases (53) had a mean level of 0.17%. Other central nervous system (CNS) depressants were recorded in 49 of the 134 cases that received a complete toxicological screen. carboxyhaemoglobin levels were measured in only 154 of 178 cases. The carboxyhaemoglobin level was zero in 43 cases. The remaining cases (I H) had a mean level of 40%; with 44 cases having a level greater than 50%, a level considered to be potentially lethal. Whole blood hydrogen cyanide levels were measured in only 138 of 178 cases. The hydrogen cyanide level was zero in 52 cases. The remaining cases (86) had a mean level of 1.65 mg/L; with 11 cases having a level greater than 3.0 mg/L (potentially fatal). Blood ethanol levels were significantly correlated with both carboxyhaemoglobin (R=0.22, P<0.01) and cyanide (R=0.36, P<0.001). In addition, a significant correlation (r=0.34) between carboxyhaemoglobin and hydrogen cyanide levels was noted. Conclusions: This study showed a correlation between elevated blood ethanol and whole blood cyanide levels (r=0.36, p<0.001) and between elevated carboxyhaemoglobin and hydrogen cyanide levels (r=0.34). Although the mean cyanide level was 1.3 mg/L (above the level some consider potentially toxic) in those cases with a carboxyhaemoglobin level of greater than 10%, there is insufficient data to permit recommendations for clinical care. Further studies are required on those victims that reach hospital alive.

AB Introduction: There is growing evidence in the literature which indicates that the prevalence of depression is similar in both non-metropolitan and metropolitan areas. However, it is generally perceived that factors associated with compromised mental health in rural residents include deprivation and lack of access to healthcare services. This study examines the relationship between depression and possible determinants of mental health among rural adolescents. The determinants identified were degree of remoteness, gender, socioeconomic status and the perception of rural community characteristics. Rural community characteristics examined were long waiting lists and lack of mental health professionals.
   Method: Respondents were 531 South Australian adolescents (55.7% female) aged 13 to 18 years, living outside the Adelaide (state capital) metropolitan area. Respondents completed a questionnaire including: demographic questions; the Kutcher Adolescent Depression Scale (KADS); and questions regarding individual perceptions of community characteristics. The data were obtained by self-report, degree of remoteness was measured using the Accessibility and Remoteness Index of Australia Plus, and socio-economic status was determined from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Socio-Economic Index of Relative Socio-Economic Advantage and Disadvantage (SEIFA).
   Results: The rate of depression obtained from this sample of rural adolescents is concerning; 18% screened positive for depression on the KADS, 41% reported low mood much of the time or more often, and 20% experienced occasional or more frequent self-harm or suicidal thoughts, plans or actions. Depression was related to gender, with more females (23%) screening positive for depression than males (11.8%). Prevalence of depression was unrelated to degree of remoteness or the socioeconomic status of the participants. This finding is not consistent with other research that identifies socioeconomic status as a psychosocial determinant of mental health. It is noteworthy that the perception of long waiting lists and a lack of mental health professionals were related to depression but that this relationship was only significant for females. This may be because those who experience symptoms of depression are more likely to be aware of service availability due to help-seeking behaviour. That this finding is significant for females is consistent with research that identifies females as being better able to identify symptoms of depression and more willing to seek help.
   Conclusion: Efforts to enhance the mental health of rural Australian adolescents should focus on improving the availability of mental health services, improving mental health literacy and promoting help-seeking behaviour for mental health difficulties. Consideration should be given to the gender differences identified when developing future mental health initiatives.

AB Background: Careful characterization of the phenotype and genotype of Huntington disease (HD) can foster better understanding of the condition.
   Methods: We conducted a cohort study in the United States, Canada, and Australia of members of families affected by HD. We collected demographic and clinical data, conducted the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale and Mini-Mental State Examination, and determined Huntingtin trinucleotide CAG repeat length. We report primarily on cross-sectional baseline data from this recently completed prospective, longitudinal, observational study.
   Results: As of December 31, 2009, 2,318 individuals enrolled; of these, 1,985 (85.6%) were classified into six analysis groups. Three groups had expanded CAG alleles (36 repeats or more): individuals with clinically diagnosed HD [n = 930], and clinically unaffected first-degree relatives who had previously pursued [n = 248] or not pursued [n = 112] predictive DNA testing. Three groups lacked expanded alleles: first-degree relatives who had previously pursued [n = 41] or not pursued [n = 224] genetic testing, and spouses and caregivers [n = 430]. Baseline mean performance differed across groups in all motor, behavioral, cognitive, and functional measures (p<0.001). Clinically unaffected individuals with expanded alleles weighed less (76.0 vs. 79.6 kg; p = 0.01) and had lower cognitive scores (28.5 vs. 29.1 on the Mini Mental State Examination; p = 0.008) than individuals without expanded alleles. The frequency of "high normal" repeat lengths (27 to 35) was 2.5% and repeat lengths associated with reduced penetrance (36 to 39) was 2.7%.
   Conclusion: Baseline analysis of COHORT study participants revealed differences that emerge prior to clinical diagnosis. Longitudinal investigation of this cohort will further characterize the natural history of HD and genetic and biological modifiers.

AB Cultural sensitivity: easy to say, difficult to do! This chapter explores the process of doing cross-cultural research in the context of working with Aboriginal people. It follows our journey in search of methods to collect meaningful data and reveals the successes and struggles encountered. We address the question: "How do we maximize cultural sensitivity as white women doing research with Aboriginal people?" We share our experience in finding ways to do culturally sensitive research. The many ways that participants tell their stories, how to achieve a degree of trust and rapport with the communities, the elders, the individuals, their families and the service providers is examined.
   Many Aboriginal people have good reason to be sceptical about research and doubt whether it is really useful to their communities. Aboriginal communities are often the focus of research but are rarely the recipients of tangible benefits of this intense interest. Given the history of research being "done to" Aboriginal people the importance of building relationships, showing respect and a willingness to learn is foremost in our minds when we embark on research. Researchers need to be cognisant of the history of exploitation within communities and the associated ongoing cultural dyslexia that characterises our society. We argue that cultural dyslexia is a result of dissonance, institutional racism and positivist research and management approaches that are preoccupied with "evidence", data quality and outcomes and too often lead to the objectification of participants.
   The need for research to be grounded in participatory methodologies such as action research and community-based ethnography is well documented. A reflexive approach is essential because it promotes community inclusion and confronts the traditional exclusivity in academic culture of research expertise. By sharing experiences and fostering a collaborative culture through research, we can learn from communities and we can undertake more meaningful research.

AB Aim To explore the recent contact with health and social services by drug misusers who died of a fatal overdose and identify opportunities for preventive intervention.
   Design Retrospective case analysis.
   Subjects Eighty-seven residents of the Greater Glasgow area who died of a drug misuse-related overdose in 1999.
   Methods Analysis of matched data from several sources: Strathclyde Police; University of Glasgow Department of Forensic Medicine and Science; the Scottish Prison Service; general practitioners' medical notes, including records of accident and emergency attendances and psychiatric assessments; and five specialist agencies for drug misusers or the homeless.
   Findings Most of those who died of an overdose were males, long-standing heroin injectors and resident in a deprived area. Heroin caused most deaths, either alone or with other drugs. Twenty-three per cent died within 2 weeks of release from prison. For the 77 whose medical records were available, 90% had seen their general practitioner (32% in the month before death), 48% had attended accident and emergency services and 22% had received a psychiatric assessment in the year before death. Over 40% of the 87 used a drug agency in the year before death and 20% had used more than one agency.
   Conclusions Previous suicidal ideation, attempted suicide and depression were common among those who died of an overdose, as was recent release from prison. Almost all had been in contact with and several were receiving specific treatment from health or specialist addiction services in their last weeks or months. The findings highlight both the numerous opportunities for intervention and the challenge of using them to prevent death.

AB Introduction Hanging is a rare but devastating cause of out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The characteristics and outcomes of hanging associated OHCA in the paediatric age group are described.
   Methods The Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry was searched for patients aged less than 18 years where the precipitant cause of OHCA was hanging. Results were cross checked with the coronial database.
   Results During the years 2000-2009, there were 680 paediatric cardiac arrests of which 53 (7.8%) were precipitated by hanging with an incidence of 4.4 per million paediatric patients (<18 years) per year. Median age was 16 (IQR 14-17) years and 58.5% were males. Five were unintentional hangings; median age 3 (IQR 2-4) years. The youngest deliberate hanging associated OHCA was aged 10 years. Most hangings occurred in a house (85%) and bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed in 30%. Asystole was the most common initial cardiac arrest rhythm seen in 50 cases (94%) while three patients had pulseless electrical activity. The emergency medical services (EMS) attempted resuscitation in 18 patients (34%), inserting an endotracheal tube in 13 patients. The majority (n-41) were not transported; seven patients were transported with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and five patients were transported with ongoing CPR. Victims who had bystander CPR were more likely to have EMS attempted resuscitation (p<0.001). Only patients who had received bystander CPR achieved ROSC (p<0.001). Three patients survived to hospital discharge; two survivors suffered severe neurological injury (Cerebral Performance Category Scale 3-4).
   Conclusion Non-intentional hanging is rare but deliberate hanging with suicidal intent represents a significant proportion of OHCAs in patients under 18 years of age. A focus on prevention is key, as outcomes are poor, with survivors likely to suffer a severe neurological insult.

AB Experiences of 15 family members and friends of missing people of a coronial investigation into the suspected death of a missing person in New South Wales (NSW), Australia were examined via in-depth interviews. This study explored participant perceptions of the impact of coronial proceedings on well-being, and views on best practice approaches to families in the Coroner's Court. Transcripts were thematically analysed, yielding six key themes in participant experiences of inquests: (1) Opportunity to be heard, (2) A chance for education, (3) If you are human with me (sensitive treatment and language), (4) Timely investigations, (5) A public and formal court environment, and (6) Coronial outcomes. Overall, families benefitted from opportunities to have input and feel heard, compassionate treatment, and appropriate education about the process and available support services. A detriment on well-being was described when these factors were precluded. Some participants perceived positive outcomes arising from public awareness of cases of missing people, formalities that conveyed respect, and timeframes that enabled further investigation or preparation for the inquest. Others reported distress and trauma in response to significant delays that led to a loss of evidence, intrusive media and unknown persons in court, and unwelcoming, formal court environments. Some participants were profoundly distressed by a finding of death and by the procedures that followed the inquest, emphasising the need for post-inquest debriefing and ongoing support. These findings deepen our understanding of coronial practices, and of measures to prevent harm, that will be instructive to other coronial jurisdictions. Further research should examine family experiences in contexts where there are variable coronial proceedings or procedures that result in legal findings of death.

AB Aim: Currently, there is limited knowledge on the impact of father-only sessions or parenting programs supporting impending fatherhood. This research explored an antenatal dads program aimed at fathers to assess the benefits of such interventions. Background: Literature regarding parenting programs and early childhood education initiatives, especially those aimed at children and families in disadvantaged circumstance, have been demonstrated to act as a buffer to poorer health and lifestyle outcomes in later life. Methods: A qualitative research approach was used to explore the experiences of 16 fathers and 6 staff of a community-based parenting program with sessions focusing on fatherhood. Findings: Four main themes were identified from the data regarding the experiences of groups engaged with the Antenatal Dads and First Year Families program. The first theme 'Knowledge and Capacity Building' stated that the information provided in the program helped fathers to be better informed and prepared for their impending fatherhood. The second theme was 'Mental Health Awareness' and identified the importance of raising awareness of depression and suicide in fathers, including where and how to get help. The third theme was 'Soft-Entry' and highlighted how the attendance at one service helped participants to learn about additional services through word of mouth and targeted promotion. The final theme was 'Feeling Connected', which helped fathers to feel more connected with the process of childbirth and development including playing and engaging with their children. Overall, the fathers found that the male-only sessions assisted them by supporting frank discussions on fatherhood. Additionally, the study helped identify the advantages of fathers meeting other fathers through attendance in the program, or even other couples in similar situations that helped fathers to feel less lonely regarding their situation.

AB This study presents differences in rate of decomposition and insect succession between exposed carcasses on the soil surface and those enclosed within a vehicle following carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. Nine 45-kg pigs were used as models for human decomposition. Six animals were sacrificed by CO gas, half of which were placed within the driver's side of separate enclosed vehicles and half were placed under scavenger-proof cages on the soil surface. A further three animals were sacrificed by captive headbolt and placed under scavenger proof cages on the soil surface. The pattern of insect succession and rate of decomposition were similar between surface carcasses within trials regardless of the mode of death. Progression through the physical stages of decomposition was 3-4 days faster in the enclosed vehicle due to higher temperatures there compared to external ambient temperatures. Patterns of insect succession also differed between the vehicle and surface treatments. Carcass attendance by representatives of the Calliphoridae was delayed within the vehicle environment by 16-18 h, while oviposition was not observed until 24-28 h following death. In contrast, attendance by Calliphoridae at surface carcasses occurred within 1 h of death, and oviposition occurred within 6-8 h of death. Typical patterns of insect succession on the carcasses were also altered. Carcass attendance by representatives of the Coleoptera occurred during the bloat stage of decomposition at surface carcasses but was delayed until the onset of wet decomposition (as defined by carcass deflation and breakage of the skin) within the vehicle environment. This study provides baseline data outlining the decomposition patterns of a carcass enclosed within a vehicle following CO poisoning in Western Australia. Understanding how variations in decomposition situations impact on the rate of decomposition and patterns of insect succession is essential to obtaining an accurate estimate of minimum post-mortem interval (PMI).

AB Aims To explore the intentions of nurses to respond to requests for legal assisted-dying. Background As more Western nations legalize assisted-dying, requests for access will increase across clinical domains. Understanding the intentions of nurses to respond to such requests is important for the construction of relevant policy and practice guidelines. Design Mixed-methods. Data Sources A total of 45 Australian nurses from aged, palliative, intensive, or cancer care settings surveyed in November 2018. Method Q-methodology studying nurses' evaluations of 49 possible responses to a request for a hastened death. Data consisted of rank-ordered statements analysed by factor analysis with varimax rotation. Findings Four distinct types of intentions to respond to requests for assisted-dying: a) refer and support; b) object to or deflect the request; c) engage and explore the request; or d) assess needs and provide information. Conclusion The findings underscore the complexity of intentionality in assisted-dying nursing practice and differences from other forms of end-of-life care, particularly regarding patient advocacy and conscientious objection. This study enables further research to explore determinants of these intentions. It can also assist the development of professional guidance by linking policy and clinical intentions. Impact Identified a basic range of nurses' intentions to respond to requests for assisted-dying, as there was no evidence at present. Developed a fourfold typology of intentions to respond with most nurses intending to engage in practices that support the requestor and sometimes the request itself. A minority would object to discussing the request. The relatively low level of advocacy within the intended responses selected also is distinctly different from other end-of-life care research findings. This research could assist nursing associations in jurisdictions transitioning to legal assisted-dying to develop guidance ways nurses can frame their responses to requests.

AB Objective: College entrance may be a strategically well-placed "point of capture" for detecting late adolescents with suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB). However, a clear epidemiological picture of STB among incoming college students is lacking. We present the first cross-national data on prevalence as well as socio-demographic and college-related correlates for STB among first-year college students.
   Method: Web-based self-report surveys were obtained from 13,984 first-year students (response rate 45.5%) across 19 colleges in 8 countries (Australia, Belgium, Germany, Mexico, Northern Ireland, South Africa, Spain, and the United States).
   Results: Lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts was 32.7%, 17.5%, and 4.3%, respectively. The 12-month prevalence was 17.2%, 8.8%, and 1.0%, respectively. About three-fourths of STB cases had onset before the age of 16 years (Q3 = 15.8), with persistence figures in the range of 41% to 53%. About one-half (53.4%) of lifetime ideators transitioned to a suicide plan; 22.1% of lifetime planners transitioned to an attempt. Attempts among lifetime ideators without plan were less frequent (3.1%). Significant correlates of lifetime STB were cross-nationally consistent and generally modest in effect size (median adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.7). Nonheterosexual orientation (aOR range 3.3-7.9) and heterosexual orientation with some same-sex attraction (aOR range 1.9-2.3) were the strongest correlates of STB, and of transitioning from ideation to plans and/or attempts (aOR range 1.6-6.1).
   Conclusion: The distribution of STB in first-year students is widespread, and relatively independent of socio-demographic risk profile. Multivariate risk algorithms based on a high number of risk factors are indicated to efficiently link high-risk status with effective preventive interventions.

AB Aim To study drug-induced mortality and characteristics of overdose deaths in the war (1991-1995), pre-war (1986-1990), and post-war period (1996-2000) in Split-Dalmatia County.
   Methods We retrospectively searched through Databases of the Department of Forensic Medicine, University Hospital Split, the national register of death records, the archives of the Split-Dalmatia County Police, and the Register of Treated Drug Addicts of the Croatian National Institute of Public Health, covering the period from 1986 to 2000, according to drug poisoning codes IX and X of the International Classification of Diseases. The indicators were statistically analyzed.
   Results There were 146 registered drug-induced deaths, with 136 (93%) deceased being men. The median age of all cases was 27 years (interquartile range 8). Most of them were single (70.6%), unemployed (44.6%), and secondary school graduates (69.2%). In the war period, there were 4.8 times more deaths than in the pre-war period (P = 0.014), and in the post-war period there were 5.2 times more deaths than in the pre-war period (P = 0.008). The most common site of death was the deceased person's home. The toxicological analyses showed that 59 (61%) deaths were heroin related, alcohol use was found in 62 cases (42.5%), and multi-substance use was found in more than a half of the cases. In 133 (91.1%) cases, deaths were classified as unintentional, whereas 13 (8.9%) were classified as suicides.
   Conclusion The war, along with other risk factors, contributed to unfavorable developments related to drug abuse in Split-Dalmatia County, including the increase in the drug-induced mortality rate.

TI The structure of psychological life satisfaction: insights from farmers

SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH

   HAPPINESS; ACCURACY; SUICIDE; DOMAINS
AB Background: Psychological life satisfaction is a robust predictor of wellbeing. Public health measures to improve wellbeing would benefit from an understanding of how overall life satisfaction varies as a function of satisfaction with multiple life domains, an area that has been little explored. We examine a sample of drought-affected Australian farmers and a general community sample of Australians to investigate how domain satisfaction combines to form psychological satisfaction. In particular, we introduce a way of statistically testing for the presence of "supra-domains" of satisfaction to propose a novel way of examining the composition of psychological life satisfaction to gain insights for health promotion and policy.
   Methods: Covariance between different perceptions of life domain satisfaction was identified by conducting correlation, regression, and exploratory factor analyses on responses to the Personal Wellbeing Index. Structural equations modelling was then used to (a) validate satisfaction supra-domain constructs emerging from different perceptions of life domain satisfaction, and (b) model relationships between supra-domains and an explicit measure of psychological life satisfaction.
   Results: Perceived satisfaction with eight different life domains loaded onto a single unitary satisfaction construct adequately in each sample. However, in both samples, different domains better loaded onto two separate but correlated constructs ('supra-domains'): "satisfaction with connectedness" and "satisfaction with efficacy". Modelling reciprocal pathways between these supra-domains and an explicit measure of psychological life satisfaction revealed that efficacy mediated the link between connectedness and psychological satisfaction.
   Conclusions: If satisfaction with connectedness underlies satisfaction with efficacy (and thus psychological satisfaction), a novel insight for health policy emerges: psychological life satisfaction, a vital part of wellbeing, can potentially be enhanced by strengthening individuals' connectedness to community. This may be particularly important and efficacious for vulnerable populations.

   UNEMPLOYMENT
AB Individuals with autism are often faced with significant barriers to entering the workforce, irrespective of their individual level of functioning or capabilities. Research suggests that even in the developed countries adults with autism experience higher rates of unemployment than almost all other disability groups. These findings are concerning if we have in mind the known positive effects of employment on the individual, the family system, and as a means of offsetting the economic costs of autism. Furthermore, unemployment can have devastating impacts on the mental and physical health of the unemployed individual. Despite the importance of improving employment outcomes for individuals with autism, there is a marked lack of research regarding employment supports or interventions for adults with autism. In this chapter we first review the existing literature with regard to what we know about employment and employment programs in individuals with autism. Next we draw attention to the high rate of co-morbid disorders in adults with autism, in particular depression and suicidal ideation, anxiety and the potential impact of sleep disorders. Consistent with the theme of this book, personal narratives are provided in the form of case studies from people affected by autism. Our first case study describes the life of a young man who participates in supported employment and who is actively engaged with his community. We then describe an innovative employment program operating in Australia that has been effective in providing meaningful employment opportunities in the information technology sector to adults with autism. The benefits of employment for the individual and the family unit are then set in the broader context of the net economic gains for society. For a successful transition into employment the economic gains and productivity improvement over the lifetime of the individual are positive and significant, far outweighing the costs of the intervention.

TI Differences in the epidemiology of out-of-hospital and in-hospital

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article

   MORTALITY; BURDEN; ALCOHOL; TRENDS
AB Background
   Trauma is a leading cause of mortality. Holistic views of trauma systems consider injury as a public health problem that requires efforts in primary, secondary and tertiary prevention. However, the performance of trauma systems is commonly judged on the in-hospital mortality rate. Such a focus misses opportunities to consider all deaths within a population, to understand differences in in-hospital and out-of-hospital trauma deaths and to inform population-level injury prevention efforts. The aim of this study was to provide an epidemiological overview of out-of-hospital and in-hospital trauma deaths in a geographically-defined area over a 10-year period.
   Methods
   We performed a population-based review of out-of-hospital and in-hospital trauma deaths over the period of 01 July 2006 to 30 June 2016 in Victoria, Australia, using data from the National Coronial Information System and the Victorian State Trauma Registry. Temporal trends in population-based incidence rates were evaluated.
   Results
   Over the study period, there were 11,246 trauma deaths, of which 71% were out-of-hospital deaths. Out-of-hospital trauma deaths commonly resulted from intentional self-harm events (50%) and transport events (35%), while in-hospital trauma deaths commonly resulted from low falls (<= 1 metre) (50%). The incidence of overall trauma deaths did not change over the study period (incidence rate ratio 0.998; 95%CI: 0.991, 1.004; P = 0.56).
   Conclusions
   Out-of-hospital deaths accounted for most trauma deaths. Given the notable differences between out-of-hospital and in-hospital trauma deaths, monitoring of all trauma deaths is necessary to inform injury prevention activities and to reduce trauma mortality. The absence of a change in the incidence of both out-of-hospital and in-hospital trauma deaths demonstrates the need for enhanced activities across all aspects of injury prevention.

AB Background: Deliberate self-harm among young people is an important focus of policy and practice internationally. Nonetheless, there is little reliable comparative international information on its extent or characteristics. We have conducted a seven-country comparative community study of deliberate self-harm among young people. Method: Over 30,000 mainly 15- and 16-year-olds completed anonymous questionnaires at school in Australia, Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands and Norway. Study criteria were developed to identify episodes of self-harm; the prevalence of self-harm acts and thoughts, methods used, repetition, reasons given, premeditation, setting for the act, associations with alcohol and drugs, hospitalisation, and whether other people knew, were examined. Results: Self-harm was more than twice as common among females as males and, in four of the seven countries, at least one in ten females had harmed herself in the previous year. Additional young people had thought of harming themselves without doing so. More males and females in all countries except Hungary cut themselves than used any other method, most acts took place at home, and alcohol and illegal drugs were not usually involved. The most common reasons given were 'to get relief from a terrible state of mind' followed by 'to die', although there were differences between those cutting themselves and those taking overdoses. About half the young people decided to harm themselves in the hour before doing so, and many did not attend hospital or tell anyone else. Just over half those who had harmed themselves during the previous year reported more than one episode over their lifetime. Conclusions: Deliberate self-harm is a widespread yet often hidden problem in adolescents, especially females, which shows both similarities and differences internationally.

AB Aims
   To determine whether childhood physical abuse (CPA) histories were associated with age of onset of psychoactive substance use and injecting, and the extent of polydrug use among injecting drug users (IDU).
   Design
   Cross-sectional.
   Setting
   Sydney, Australia.
   Participants and measurements
   A total of 300 IDU were administered a structured interview examining the prevalence and severity of CPA and drug use histories.
   Findings
   Of the participants, 40.3% had experienced severe abuse (SA), 34.0% mild-moderate abuse (MMA) and 25.7% no abuse history (NA). After controlling for other variables, a history of severe CPA was a significant independent correlate of an earlier age at first alcohol intoxication compared to both the NA (beta = -0.23, P < 0.01) and MMA (beta = 0.20, P < 0.01) groups. Severe CPA was also a significant independent correlate of an earlier age at first illicit drug use compared to both the NA (beta = -0.16, P < 0.05) and MMA (beta = -0.15, P < 0.05) groups. In contrast, CPA histories were not independently associated with the onset of injecting drug use. After controlling for potential confounders, both the MMA (beta = 0.28, P < 0.001) and SA (beta = 0.27, P < 0.001) groups were associated with more extensive life-time polydrug use, but did not differ from each other (P = 0.82). After controlling for potential confounders, both MMA (beta = 0.20, P < 0.01) and SA (beta = 0.33, P < 0.001) group membership were associated with more extensive recent polydrug use but, again, did not differ significantly from each other (P = 0.08).
   Conclusions
   Severe childhood physical abuse severity is associated with an earlier initiation into drug use. Any level of abuse is associated with more extensive life-time and recent polydrug use.

AB Objectives: Gender differences in psychotic disorder have been observed in terms of illness onset and course; however, past research has been limited by inconsistencies between studies and the lack of epidemiological representative of samples assessed. Thus, the aim of this study was to elucidate gender differences in a treated epidemiological sample of patients with first episode psychosis (FEP).
   Methods: A medical file audit was used to collect data on premorbid, entry, treatment and 18-month outcome characteristics of 661 FEP consecutive patients treated at the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre (EPPIC), Melbourne, Australia.
   Results: Prior to onset of psychosis, females were more likely to have a history of suicide attempts (p = .011) and depression (p = .001). At service entry, females were more likely to have depressive symptoms (p = .007). Conversely, males had marked substance use problems that were evident prior to admission (p<.001) and persisted through treatment (p<.001). At service entry, males also experienced more severe psychopathology (p<.001) and lower levels of functioning (GAF, p = .008: unemployment/not studying p = .004; living with family, p = .003). Treatment non-compliance (p<.001) and frequent hospitalisations (p = .047)were also common for males with FER At service discharge males had significantly lower levels of functioning (GAF, p = .008; unemployment/not studying p = .040; living with family, p = .001) compared to females with FEP.
   Conclusions: Gender differences are evident in illness course of patients with FER particularly with respect to past history of psychopathology and functioning at presentation and at service discharge. Strategies to deal with these gender differences need to be considered in early intervention programs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aim: The aim of this study was to describe temporal trends in the incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of hanging-related out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Method: A retrospective study of all hanging-related OHCA in Victoria, Australia, between 2000 and 2017 was conducted. Trends in incidence, characteristics, and outcomes were assessed using linear regression and a non-parametric test for trend, as appropriate. Predictors of survival to hospital discharge were identified using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Between 2000 and 2017, emergency medical services (EMS)-attended 3,891 cases of hanging-related OHCA, of which 876 cases (23%) received an attempted resuscitation. The overall incidence rate of EMS-attended cases was 3.8 cases per 100,000 person-years increasing from 2.3 cases per 100,000 person-years in 2000 to 4.7 cases in 2017 (p for trend <0.001). Incidence rates increased approximately two-fold in young adults (18?44?years) and three-fold in middle aged adults (45?64?years). Despite improvement in the rate of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (from 49% in 2000?2005 to 75% in 2012?2017), the survival to hospital discharge rate remained unchanged (3% overall). Among adult survivors with 12-month follow-up (n = 10), five patients responded to telephone interviews. Of those, three (60%) reported severe functional disability. Five patients responded to telephone interviews, of which 3 patients reported severe functional disability. An initial shockable rhythm (OR 23.17, 95% CI: 5.75, 93.36) or pulseless electrical activity (OR 13.14, 95% CI: 4.79, 36.03) were associated with survival. Conclusion: The incidence of hanging-related OHCA doubled over the 18?year period with no change to survival rates. New preventative strategies are needed to reduce the community burden of these events.

AB Background: Gay men are at higher risk of suffering from a variety of psychiatric disorders, yet the mental health literacy of this population has remained largely unknown.
   Methods: In 2007 and 2011, surveys were conducted among gay men in Geneva, Switzerland, recruited by probability-based time-space sampling. Based on a case vignette of a man with major depression, respondents were asked a series of questions about labelling, perceived risk, and help-seeking beliefs. Men meeting caseness for major depression were asked open questions about perceived causes and additional help-seeking/self-help.
   Results: Among the 762 respondents, 14.7% met diagnostic criteria for major depression (MDD) in the past 12 months. The vignette was labelled depression by 44.1% of the entire sample, and 61.9% of the men with MDD. Discrimination (33 2%), acceptance or rejection by others (21.4%), and loneliness (24.9%) were the most common reasons given for greater susceptibility among gay men, yet men with MDD reported problems with love/relationship (32.5%,) and work (28.9%) as the most common perceived causes of recent depression, and problems with love/relationship (21.9%), accepting one's homosexuality (21.1%), and family (20.2%) at initial outset. The highest proportions of gay men rated non-medical options such as a close friend (91.6%), relaxation exercises or meditation (84.4%), and physical activity (83.5%) as being helpful for the depression vignette.
   Limitations: No probes used for open questions, and findings generalizable only to gay men in the sampling scheme.
   Conclusions: There are many commonalities in labelling, perceived causes, and help-seeking with general populations, but also numerous specificities in mental health literacy and experience among gay men. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ADOLESCENTS; DEPRESSION; SUICIDE; ADULTS; RISK; ADJUSTMENT; ANXIETY;
   STRESS
AB Purpose: In recent decades Western psychology has conceptualized learning disabilities (LD) in terms of deficits and such related 'social emotional issues' as insecurity, low self-esteem and social isolation that can be rehabilitated through combined remedial teaching and psychological intervention. With increasing advocacy and legislation on behalf of people with disabilities in the US, UK and Australia, more resources are being made available to students with LD in institutions of higher education. Due to this increase in the quantity of services, written programmes and accommodations made to their needs, increased numbers of students with LD have been graduating successfully from institutions of higher education. This paper describes an option for treating students with LD that is based on a theoretical perspective that understands these students as an excluded population and emphasizes the importance of their empowerment.
   Method: A project involving social work students with LD at Hebrew University in Jerusalem is presented as a case study. Case-study investigation, one of the common methods of qualitative research, explores social and human problems in their natural context. A 6-year evaluation of this project was conducted based on questionnaires, focus groups, documentation of all activities related to the project, in-depth interviews and outcome measures.
   Results: The results suggest that the project developed in three stages: raising awareness, building partnerships, and lobbying for rights and services. Outcome measures indicate that the project was successful in lowering dropout rates and improving students' academic achievement. Analysis of interviews with students suggests that the project positively affected the students' perceptions by helping them reframe the social and emotional connotations of their learning disability. Students reported marked social and emotional change, including reduced stress and anxiety levels and increased self-esteem.
   Conclusions : Empowerment practices that are based on partnership, participation, advocacy and social change provide an alternative to rehabilitation via individual therapy.

AB Aims This retrospective, population-based study investigated the patterns and risks of mortality from breast cancer, other cancers and non-cancer causes according to the age at diagnosis of breast cancer. Methods Mortality was assessed in all Australian women (n=179653) aged 3079 years who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 1982 and 2004 and who survived a minimum of 1year. The mean follow up was 6.3years (range 023years). Results Before December 2005, 52934 women had died (34459 of breast cancer, 5019 of other cancers and 13456 of non-cancer causes). There was an inverse age-related relative risk of mortality (calculated as the standardized mortality ratio [SMR]) from breast cancer (linear trend across age P<0.01). For breast cancer survivors the age-adjusted SMR was 0.99 for other cancers and 0.81(P<0.01) for non-cancer causes in comparison with the general population. The SMR for other cancers and non-cancer causes was highest in the 3039-year-old age group (2.13, P<0.01 and 2.15, P<0.01, respectively), and progressively decreased with increasing age, with the 7079-year-old age group having significantly reduced SMR (0.95, P<0.05, and 0.78, P<0.01, respectively, compared with the age-matched general population). Conclusion There was an inverse age-related relative risk of death from breast cancer, other cancers and non-cancer causes. These findings suggest that younger Australian women require long-term health surveillance and that older women with limited comorbidities require optimal treatment of their breast cancer.

AB Context: People living in rural and remote areas have been found to suffer higher rates of mental illness and psychological distress than their urban counterparts. However, rural and remote Australians also suffer from a lack of specialist mental health services. Mental health consumers are concerned about the lack of access to specialist mental health care and report poor service quality and stigmatizing staff attitudes when presenting with mental health emergencies at acute care facilities. Standards for the Mental Health Workforce released in 2002 promote respect for the individual, their family and carers; best practice in the assessment, early detection and management of acute illness; promotion of mental health and safety; and the prevention of relapse. These standards are for generalists providing care to mentally ill patients; their family and carers in the acute care setting; as well as specialist mental health professionals. Up-skilling generalists in rural and remote areas to respectfully and effectively manage mental health emergency care is a priority.
   Issues: A short course, 'Managing Mental Health Emergencies' was developed by the Australian Rural Nurses and Midwives in 2002. Almost 750 participants had completed the course at the time of the evaluation. The objectives of the course were to: develop an increased knowledge of mental health presentations and gain confidence in managing and assessing mental health clients; gain an understanding of the referral processes in the local environment; gain an insight into the impact of mental health emergencies on individuals, their family and carers; and identify strategies to minimise the impact of managing mental health emergencies on the healthcare team. The model of training matched what is known to be best practice in rural and remote health practitioner development in emergency care, being local, interdisciplinary, and engaging local expert service providers while being overseen by a national steering committee. The evaluation consisted of a pre-(n=456) and post-course (n=163) survey, and follow-up interviews with participants between 3 and 6 months post-course (n=44).
   Lessons learned: The pre-and post-survey identified that, as a result of the course, participants had improved confidence in seeking information about suicide ideation, were significantly more able to differentiate between substance intoxication and psychosis (X(2) [ df=1, n=619] =140.9, p<.000); and between dementia and delirium (X(2) [df=3, n=619] =126.5, p<.000). The follow-up interview notes were analysed using thematic analysis. Three themes were used: changing attitudes; changing clinical practice; and communication. Participants had reflected on their attitudes following the course and recognized how these had been stigmatizing. Many participants reported putting their new skills into practice and reported better recognition of non-verbal cues and better information seeking from family members, past history and police. The Managing Mental Health Emergencies course is a valuable addition to the emergency courses available to rural and remote healthcare providers.

AB Background Medication is commonly used to treat youth depression, but whether medication should be added to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as first-line treatment is unclear. We aimed to examine whether combined treatment with CBT and fluoxetine was more effective than CBT and placebo in youth with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder.
   Methods The Youth Depression Alleviation-Combined Treatment (YoDA-C) trial was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre clinical trial. Participants were aged 15-25 years with moderate-to-severe MDD and had sought care at one of four clinical centres in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive CBT for 12 weeks, plus either fluoxetine or placebo. Participants began on one 20 mg capsule of fluoxetine or one placebo pill per day. All participants received CBT, delivered by therapists in weekly 50-minute sessions and attended interviews at baseline, and at weeks 4, 8, and 12, during which they completed assessments with research assistants. Participants saw a psychiatrist or psychiatry trainee to complete medical assessments at the same timepoints. The primary outcome was change in the interviewer-rated Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score at 12 weeks. The trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12612001281886).
   Findings 153 participants (mean age 19.6 years [SD 2.7]) were enrolled from Feb 20, 2013, to Dec 13, 2016. 77 (50%) patients were allocated to CBT and placebo and 76 (50%) to CBT and fluoxetine. Participants had severe depression at baseline (mean MADRS score 33.6 [SD 5.1] in the CBT and placebo group and 32.2 [5.6] in the CBT and fluoxetine group), with high proportions of participants with anxiety disorder comorbidity (47 [61%] in the CBT and placebo group and 49 [64%] in the CBT and fluoxetine group) and past-month suicidal ideation (55 [71%] in the CBT and placebo group and 59 [78%] in the CBT and fluoxetine group). 59 (77%) participants in the CBT and placebo group and 64 (84%) in the CBT and fluoxetine group completed follow-up at week 12. After 12 weeks of treatment both groups showed a reduction in MADRS scores (-13.7, 95% CI -16.0 to -11.4, in the CBT and placebo group and -15.1, -17.4 to -12.9, in the CBT and fluoxetine group). There was no significant between-group difference in MADRS scores (-1.4, -4.7 to 1.8; p=0.39). There were five suicide attempts in the CBT and placebo group and one suicide attempt in the UST and fluoxetine group (odds ratio 0.2, 0.0-1.8; p=0.21), and no significant between-group differences for other suicidal behaviours.
   Interpretation We did not find evidence that the addition of fluoxetine (rather than placebo) to CBT further reduced depressive symptoms in young people with moderate-to-severe MDD. Exploratory analyses showed that the addition of medication might be helpful for patients with comorbid anxiety symptoms and for older youth. Copyright (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   VALIDITY; SUICIDE; REFORM
AB Objective: To analyse, and explain to Australasian psychiatrists, recent proposed changes to the terms of coercive treatment for mental illness in Tasmania and Victoria and to place the proposals in the context of a broader human rights framework that is likely to impact the future shape of mental health legislation more generally.
   Methods: The Australian law reform proposals are reviewed against the requirements of numerous human rights instruments, including the recently ratified United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Ethical and legal arguments are made to support the proposed changes and to introduce others, taking into account academic commentary on mental health law and recent empirical work on the ability to usefully categorise patients by their likelihood of harm to self and others.
   Results: The Victorian and Tasmanian draft mental health bills propose a new basis for compulsory psychiatric treatment in Australasia. If they become law, coercive psychiatric treatment could only be applied to patients who lack decision-making capacity. The Tasmanian draft bill also sets a new benchmark for timely independent review of compulsory treatment. However both jurisdictions propose to retain an 'additional harm' test which must be satisfied before patients may be treated without consent. This differs from non-psychiatric cases, where if patients are unable to consent to medical treatment for themselves, they will be entitled to receive coercive treatment if it is in their best interests.
   Conclusions: The proposed changes under the Tasmanian and Victorian draft mental health bills will ensure that, in line with local and international human rights obligations, only patients who lack decision-making capacity may be coercively treated for mental illness. However the continuing 'additional harm' criteria may breach human rights obligations by imposing a discriminatory threshold for care on patients who are unable to consent to treatment for themselves. This could be avoided by replacing the 'additional harm' test with a 'best interests' test.

AB Objective: The 2010 Survey of High Impact Psychosis (SHIP) is Australia's second national psychosis survey. This paper provides an overview of its findings, including comparisons with the first psychosis survey and general population data.
   Methods: The survey covered 1.5 million people aged 18-64 years, approximately 10% of Australians in this age group. A two-phase design was used. In phase 1, screening for psychosis took place in public mental health services and non-government organizations supporting people with mental illness. In phase 2, 1825 of those screen-positive for psychosis were randomly selected and interviewed. Data collected included symptomatology, substance use, functioning, service utilization, medication use, education, employment, housing, and physical health including fasting blood samples.
   Results: The estimated 1-month treated prevalence of psychotic disorders in public treatment services was 3.1 people per 1000 population; the 12-month treated prevalence was 4.5 people per 1000. The majority (63.0%) of participants met ICD-10 criteria for schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder. One-half (49.5%) reported attempting suicide in their lifetime and two-thirds (63.2%) were rated as impaired in their ability to socialize. Over half (54.8%) had metabolic syndrome. The proportion currently smoking was 66.1%. Educational achievement was low. Only 21.5% were currently employed. Key changes in the 12 years since the first survey included: a marked drop in psychiatric inpatient admissions; a large increase in the proportion attending community mental health clinics; increased use of rehabilitation services and non-government organizations supporting people with mental illness; a major shift from typical to atypical antipsychotics; and large increases in the proportions with lifetime alcohol or drug abuse/dependence.
   Conclusion: People with psychotic illness face multiple challenges. An integrated approach to service provision is needed to ensure that their living requirements and needs for social participation are met, in addition to their very considerable mental and physical health needs.

AB Background Knowledge about the natural history of self-harm is scarce, especially during the transition from adolescence to young adulthood, a period characterised by a sharp rise in self-inflicted deaths. From a repeated measures cohort of a representative sample, we describe the course of self-harm from middle adolescence to young adulthood.
   Methods A stratified, random sample of 1943 adolescents was recruited from 44 schools across the state of Victoria, Australia, between August, 1992, and January, 2008. We obtained data pertaining to self-harm from questionnaires and telephone interviews at seven waves of follow-up, commencing at mean age 15.9 years (SD 0.49) and ending at mean age 29.0 years (SD 0.59). Summary adolescent measures (waves three to six) were obtained for cannabis use, cigarette smoking, high-risk alcohol use, depression and anxiety, antisocial behaviour and parental separation or divorce.
   Findings 1802 participants responded in the adolescent phase, with 149 (8%) reporting self-harm, More girls (95/947 [10%]) than boys (54/855 [6%]) reported self-harm (risk ratio 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.2). We recorded a substantial reduction in the frequency of self-harm during late adolescence. 122 of 1652 (7%) participants who reported self-harm during adolescence reported no further self-harm in young adulthood, with a stronger continuity in girls (13/888) than boys (1/764). During adolescence, incident self-harm was independently associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety (HR 3.7, 95% CI 2.4-5.9), antisocial behaviour (1.9, 1.1-3.4), high-risk alcohol use (2.1, 1.2-3.7), cannabis use (2.4, 1.4-4.4), and cigarette smoking (1.8, 1.0-3.1). Adolescent symptoms of depression and anxiety were clearly associated with incident self-harm in young adulthood (5.9, 2.2-16).
   Interpretation Most self-harming behaviour in adolescents resolves spontaneously. The early detection and treatment of common mental disorders during adolescence might constitute an important and hitherto unrecognised component of suicide prevention in young adults.

AB Objectives: There have been relatively few detailed reports on the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of bipolar disorder in large outpatient clinical samples. This paper reports on findings from the Black Dog Institute Bipolar Disorders Clinic (BDI-BDC) and compares this dataset with the predominantly outpatient Stanley Foundation Bipolar Disorders Network (SFBN) and Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) samples.
   Methods: A total of 217 patients with DSM-IV bipolar disorder were assessed in detail in the BDI-BDC using a series of standardized and non-standardized structured interviews. Ninety per cent had bipolar I disorder, and 10% bipolar II disorder. This sample was compared with the SFBN and STEP-BD datasets.
   Results: The sociodemographic characteristics of the three samples were remarkably similar. Female gender and younger age were overrepresented compared to the general population. Functional impairment, indicated by marital status and labour force participation, was clearly more common among the study subjects than in the general population. In all three samples, prior educational attainment was higher than the general population. With respect to clinical features, approximately half of each sample was euthymic and approximately one-third was in a DSM-IV episode of depression at study entry. One-half reported depression as their first episode of mood disturbance. Similar proportions identified positive family histories of bipolar disorder (40%) and unipolar depression (55%). Other clinical characteristics demonstrated more variation between the samples. The STEP-BD population reported an earlier age of onset. The SFBN subjects reported higher numbers of overall episodes, but psychotic features and suicide attempts were less common than in the BDI-BDC sample.
   Conclusions: This report highlights the marked commonalities of the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients with bipolar disorder recruited predominantly in the outpatient setting in three different continents, that is, Australia, North America and Europe. It also demonstrates some critical distinctions between such samples, emphasizing the need to be aware of these differences when interpreting findings, such as treatment outcome, from different bipolar disorder datasets.

AB Though medical consequences of war attract attention, the health consequences of the prisoner-of-war (POW) experience are poorly researched and appreciated. The imprisonment of Allied military personnel by the Japanese during the World War II provides an especially dramatic POW scenario in terms of deprivation, malnutrition and exposure to tropical diseases. Though predominantly British, these POWs also included troops from Australia, Holland and North America. Imprisonment took place in various locations in Southeast Asia and the Far East for a 3.5-year period between 1942 and 1945. Nutritional deficiency syndromes, dysentery, malaria, tropical ulcers and cholera were major health problems; and supplies of drugs and medical equipment were scarce. There have been limited mortality studies on ex-Far East prisoners (FEPOWs) since repatriation, but these suggest an early (up to 10 years post-release) excess mortality due to tuberculosis, suicides and cirrhosis (probably related to hepatitis B exposure during imprisonment). In terms of morbidity, the commonest has been a psychiatric syndrome which would now be recognized as post-traumatic stress disorderpresent in at least one-third of FEPOWs and frequently presenting decades later. Peptic ulceration, osteoarthritis and hearing impairment also appear to occur more frequently. In addition, certain tropical diseases have persisted in these survivorsnotably infections with the nematode worm Strongyloides stercoralis. Studies 30 years or more after release have shown overall infection rates of 15. Chronic strongyloidiasis of this type frequently causes a linear urticarial larva currens rash, but can potentially lead to fatal hyperinfection if immunity is suppressed. Finally, about 5 of FEPOW survivors have chronic nutritional neuropathic syndromesusually optic atrophy or sensory peripheral neuropathy (often painful). The World War II FEPOW experience was a unique, though often tragic, accidental experiment into the longer term effects of under nutrition and untreated exotic disease. Investigation of the survivors has provided unique insights into the medical outcome of deprivation in tropical environments.

ID MENTAL-HEALTH
AB Background: People living in rural and remote Australia experience increased mental health problems compared with metropolitan Australians. Moreover, Indigenous Australians are twice as likely as non Indigenous Australians to report high or very high levels of mental health problems. It is imperative, therefore, that effective and sustainable social and emotional wellbeing services (Indigenous Australians prefer the term "social and emotional wellbeing" to "mental health") are developed for Indigenous Australians living in remote communities. In response to significant and serious events such as suicides and relationship violence in a remote Indigenous community, a social and emotional wellbeing service (SEWBS) was developed. After the service had been running for over three years, an independent evaluation was initiated by the local health board. The aim of the evaluation was to explore the impact of SEWBS, including issues of effectiveness and sustainability, from the experiences of people involved in the development and delivery of the service.
   Methods: Purposive sampling was used to recruit 21 people with different involvement in the service such as service providers, service participants, and referrers. These people were interviewed and their interviews were transcribed. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was used to analyse the interview transcripts to identify superordinate themes and subthemes in the data.
   Results: Two superordinate themes and nine subthemes were developed from the interview transcripts. The first superordinate theme was called "The Big Picture" and it had the sub themes: getting started; organizational factors; funding; the future, and; operational problems. The second superordinate theme was called "On the Ground" and it had the subthemes: personal struggles; program activities; measuring outcomes, and; results.
   Conclusions: While the evaluation indicated that the service had been experienced as an effective local response to serious problems, recommendations and directions for future research and development emerged that were more broadly applicable. Issues such as appropriate staffing, localising decision making, identifying priorities and how they will be evaluated, and developing flexibility in terms of job descriptions and qualifications are highlighted.

   PREVALENCE; DISORDERS; ANXIETY; INTERVENTIONS; METAANALYSIS; ASSOCIATION
AB Background
   Evidence regarding the extent of mental health problems and the associated characteristics within an employee population is necessary to inform appropriate and tailored workplace mental health programs. Mental health within male dominated industries (such as mining) has received recent public attention, chiefly through observations regarding suicide in such populations in Australia and internationally. Currently there is limited empirical evidence regarding the mental health needs in the mining industry as an exemplar of a male dominated workforce, and the relative contribution to such problems of individual, socio-economic and workplace factors. This study aimed to investigate the mental health and associated characteristics among employees in the Australian coal mining industry with a specific focus on identifying modifiable work characteristics.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional study was conducted among employees (n = 1457) across eight coal mines stratified by key mine characteristics (state, mine type and employee commute arrangements). Participants completed measures of psychological distress (K10+) and key variables across four categories (socio-demographic characteristics, health history, current health behaviours, work attitudes and characteristics).
   Results
   Psychological distress levels within this sample were significantly higher in comparison with a community sample of employed Australians. The following factors contributed significantly to levels of psychological distress using hierarchical linear regression analysis: lower social networks; a past history of depression, anxiety or drug/alcohol problems; high recent alcohol use; work role (managers) and a set of work characteristics (level of satisfaction with work, financial factors and job insecurity; perception of lower workplace support for people with mental health problems.
   Conclusion
   This is the first study to examine the characteristics associated with mental health problems in the Australian coal mining industry. The findings indicate the salience of mental health needs in this population, and the associated interplay of personal, social and work characteristics. The work characteristics associated with psychological distress are modifiable and can guide an industry response, as well as help inform the understanding of the role of workplace factors in mental health problems in a male dominated workforce more generally.

ID HOSPITAL DISCHARGE DATA
AB This study aimed to develop an estimate of the incidence of all medically-treated injury by level of severity and to broadly describe the epidemiology of injury in the Australian State of Victoria in a given year. Victoria has developed a relatively comprehensive injury surveillance system. Data is currently collected by various agencies on injury deaths, hospitalisations and emergency department attendances. The method used to establish the incidence of both unintentional and intentional injury is described. Incidence figures were directly derived, or estimated from, the available Victorian health sector and Coronial data bases for three level of severity (deaths, hospitalisations and medical treatment only) and for causes of injury, age and gender groups, location of the injury event and activity at the time of injury. In 1993/1994, injuries resulted in at least 1487 deaths, 67 402 persons hospitalised and an estimated 397 160 medically-treated, non-hospitalised injured persons in Victoria. In total, over 466 000 people were injured or 10.5 persons per year for every 100 residents. Males sustain 62% of all injuries yet represent 49.5% of the population. Almost three-quarters of injury fatalities and over 60% of non-fatal injuries occur among males. Young people aged 15-24 years account for 22% of all injuries yet represent only about 16% of the Victorian population. Children (0-14 years) also suffer relatively high injury rates, although mainly less severe, while the elderly are at risk of more severe injuries. The leading cause of injury death in Victoria is suicide, followed by motor vehicle accidents, whereas falls are the leading cause of all non-fatal injury. Most injuries occur in the home (36%), areas of sport and recreation (12.5%) and transport (11.7%). They are mainly associated with leisure activities (33.1%), work (11%) and transportation (10.8%). This study demonstrates a method for the development of comprehensive injury incidence estimates. The results indicate that injuries have a significant impact on the Victorian community, health care system and economy in general. Reliable incidence data are necessary for descriptive epidemiology and provide the basis for quality of life and economic cost studies. Together this information has potential application for evidence-based strategic planning and evaluation in injury research and prevention. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background Occurrence, severity, and geographic extent of droughts are anticipated to increase under climate change, but the health consequences of drought conditions are unknown. We estimate risks of cardiovascular-related and respiratory-related hospital admission and mortality associated with drought conditions for the elderly population in western USA.
   Methods For this retrospective study, we analysed the 2000 to 2013 data from the US Drought Monitor for 618 counties in the western USA to identify full drought periods, non-drought periods, and worsening drought periods stratified by low severity and high severity. We used Medicare claims made between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2013, to calculate daily rates of cardiovascular admissions, respiratory admissions, and deaths among adults aged 65 years or older. Using a two-stage hierarchical model, we estimated the percentage change in health risks when comparing drought with non-drought period days, controlling for daily weather and seasonal trends.
   Findings On average, 2.1 million days were classified as non-drought periods and 0.6 million days were classified as drought periods. Compared with non-drought periods, respiratory admissions significantly decreased by -1.99% (95% posterior interval -3.56 to -0.38) during the full drought period, but not during worsening drought conditions. Mortality risk significantly increased by 1.55% (0.17 to 2.95) during the high-severity worsening drought period, but not the full drought or low-severity worsening drought periods. Cardiovascular admissions did not differ significantly during either full drought or worsening drought periods. In counties where drought occurred less frequently, we found risks for cardiovascular disease and mortality to increase during worsening drought conditions.
   Interpretation Drought conditions increased risk of mortality during high-severity worsening drought, but decreased the risk of respiratory admissions during full drought periods among adults aged 65 years and older. Counties that previously had fewer drought events show larger risk for mortality and cardiovascular disease. This research describes an understudied environmental association with global health significance. Copyright (C) The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Clozapine is an antipsychotic medication associated with a lower suicide rate compared with other antipsychotic agents. Clozapine is used specifically in patients for whom previous therapy was inadequate or not tolerated, and is the only antipsychotic agent associated with the development of myocarditis.
   Objective: To retrospectively review all adverse drug reaction reports voluntarily submitted to the Australian Adverse Drug Reactions Unit mentioning suspected myocarditis in clozapine-treated patients.
   Patients and methods: We accessed all electronic database entries and case reports citing suspected myocarditis associated with clozapine therapy from January 1993 through to December 2003, inclusive.
   Results: 116 case reports of suspected myocarditis amongst clozapine-treated patients were identified during the specified time frame (incidence between 0.7% and 1.2% of treated patients). Median patient age for these cases was 30 years (SD 11.1 years) compared with 37 years from the Clopine (R) registry. The condition developed within a median 16 days (mean 19.8 days; SD 17.3 days) of commencing clozapine for the bulk of patients developing myocarditis within 6 months (n = 93, 80.2%). For all cases with known treatment commencement and cessation dates (n = 106), the condition developed within a median 17 days (mean 171.7 days, SD 530.9 days). Over nine-tenths of cases were prescribed clozapine within the dose range of 100 mg/day to 450 mg/day. Sixty patients (51.8%) recovered from their episode when reported or during follow-up reports, whereas 17 patients (14.7%) had not yet recovered: 27 patients (23.3%) had unknown outcome when reported and the remaining 12 patients (10.3%) died.
   Conclusion: Clozapine is uncommonly but importantly related to myocarditis, often fatal or near fatal and sometimes in relatively young patients with early onset after treatment initiation. The most striking feature about this condition is the wide diversity of nonspecific symptoms that occur in afflicted patients. Additional pharmacovigilance, improved reporting systems and further investigation of mechanisms of drug-induced myocarditis and related cardiovascular conditions (such as heart failure) are clearly warranted. A case-control study would be suitable for investigation of baseline predictors.

TI A POSITIVE APPROACH TO WORKPLACE BULLYING: LESSONS FROM THE VICTORIAN

AB Over the past decades the devastating issue of workplace bullying and its "cancerous'' impact on workplace emotions has seen "today's costliest secret'' become exposed (Einarsen, Hoel, Zapf & Cooper, 2003, p. 32; Glendinning, 2001, p. 296; Needham, 2003, p. 12). Bullying at work has become so prevalent within today's workplace that 1 of the 4 of us are estimated to suffer the crippling abuse of the workplace bully, costing Australian organizations between $17 billion and $36 billion each year (Clarke, J. (2005). Working with monsters: How to identify and protect yourself from the workplace psychopath. Sydney: Random House Australia; Rayner, C. (2000). Building a business case for tackling bullying in the workplace: Beyond a cost-benefit analysis. In: Sheehan, M., Ramsey, C., & Patrick, J. (Eds), Transcending boundaries. Proceedings of the 2000 Conference, September, Brisbane). The impending doom faced by the target of the bully demeans the individual to such an extent that bullying has been associated with suicide, post-traumatic stress disorder, and even increased risk of coronary heart disease and has been demonstrated to sever "at home'' relationships, with grave implications on work-life balance (Archer, 1999; Geffner, Braverman, Galasso & Marsh, 2004; Lewis, 2006). Yet despite the significant lose-lose outcomes of workplace bullying for both the individual and the well-documented consequences of decreased productivity for the organization, there seems to be little progress toward meaningfully addressing the issues that actually create, promote, and sustain workplace bullying (Bolton, 2007; Dutton & Ragins, 2007; Heames & Harvey, 2006; Peyton, 2003). Rather than narrowly concentrating on bullying and its drivers which limits workplace bullying to an occupational health and safety issue, this chapter demonstrates the practical implementation across five Victorian public sector organizations of a tool developed using the principles of positive psychology. This approach places bullying in the wider context of positive workplace emotions, allowing for consideration of the broader organizational characteristics and the subtle negative behaviors which are suggested to underlie the deep seated and pervasive nature of workplace bullying. The preliminary findings suggests that the tool was seen as valuable in creating a bully-free culture and resonates practically by offering insights into some of the issues organizations should consider to ensure such initiatives provide a genuine source of competitive advantage.

AB Objective The aim of this study was to determine the effect of a broad range of common mental disorders and their comorbidity on health-related quality of life and functional disability. Methods In all, 2734 Australians aged >= 18 years, recruited from the general community via Facebook during August-December 2014, completed an online survey assessing demographic characteristics, nine mental disorders, suicidal ideation and attempt. Outcome measures were health-related quality of life (assessed using the Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL)-4D measure and functional disability (days out of role). Results Overall, 53.1% of the sample met criteria for at least one mental disorder. Participants with each of the 11 mental health problems had significantly lower mean AQoL-4D scores and significantly greater functional disability compared with not having the disorder (P < 0.001). A monotonic decrease in quality of life and an increase in functional disability were observed with an increased total number of comorbid disorders (P < 0.001). Accounting for disorder prevalence, annual economic burden for each mental disorder was estimated to be in the range of A$870 million-A$17 billion. Conclusions Mental disorders negatively affect health-related quality of life and functional disability, exacerbated by increased comorbidity. The economic burden to participants and employers estimated in this study is of concern, and highlights the importance of evidence-based treatment and prevention approaches. What is known about the topic? Mental disorders are associated with poorer health-related quality of life, increased functional disability and increased economic costs. What does this paper add? This paper furthers our understanding of the associations of nine mental disorders, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts with quality of life in an Australian setting, highlighting the considerable economic implications of these associations. Further, it reveals that comorbidity of mental disorders exacerbates reductions in quality of life and increased functional disability. What are the implications for practitioners? The economic burden associated with lost productivity and quality of life for individuals with mental disorders is considerable. Therefore, prioritising funding to prevention and treatment using evidence-based approaches will have significant effect in terms of economic productivity and personal well-being for individuals.

AB Background: Currently, we lack a clear picture of the evolution of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adolescents. The period of disturbance preceding MDD can be conceptualised as the prodrome. The aim of the study was to explore the prodrome of first-episode MDD retrospectively in a group of help-seeking adolescents using qualitative methodologies. Sampling and Methods: Consecutively referred adolescents (15-18 years of age) with first-episode MDD were recruited for this study from Orygen Youth Health, Melbourne, Vic., Australia. After using quantitative methodologies to confirm the index episode of MDD and measure the extent of recovery, the prodrome was investigated in depth using qualitative techniques. Results: Twenty-nine adolescents (20 females and 9 males) and 7 informants (6 mothers and 1 grandmother) participated. All 29 participants had a prodrome of varying lengths (between 6 days and 4 years). The most noticeable symptoms initially were perplexity and confusion and, thereafter, sadness and irritability. A common pattern was a reduction in their ability to fulfil their role accompanied by guilt, self-blame and reduced self-esteem. Around half of the participants had increased thoughts of suicide and increased anxiety. There were gender differences in the patterns of symptoms noticed, with males more commonly noticing a change in how they related to the world and females more commonly noticing a change in the way that they related to others. All informants noticed a prodrome of varying lengths; in 2 cases longer, in 2 cases shorter and in 3 cases around the same time period as that noticed by the participant. The changes most commonly noticed by informants were sadness, upset, irritability and reduced self-esteem. The symptoms 'were fewer in number and sometimes varied from those noticed by the adolescents themselves. Conclusions: Whilst we recognise that this study is vulnerable to autobiographical bias, we took all reasonable measures to minimise this. Symptoms not included in the diagnostic criteria for depression were the earliest changes noticed by the adolescents themselves and are, therefore, potentially important in informing prevention strategies, as is the finding that there are gender differences in the patterns of changes noticed. In addition, parents may provide an additional avenue to help seeking. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel

   DURATION; RECOGNITION; DISORDERS; LITERACY; INTERVENTION; ILLNESS
AB Background: Early detection and treatment of mental disorders in adolescents and young adults can lead to better health outcomes. Mental health literacy is a key to early recognition and help seeking. Whilst a number of population health initiatives have attempted to improve mental health literacy, none to date have specifically targeted young people nor have they applied the rigorous standards of population health models now accepted as best practice in other health areas. This paper describes the outcomes from the application of a health promotion model to the development, implementation and evaluation of a community awareness campaign designed to improve mental health literacy and early help seeking amongst young people.
   Method: The Compass Strategy was implemented in the western metropolitan Melbourne and Barwon regions of Victoria, Australia. The Precede-Proceed Model guided the population assessment, campaign strategy development and evaluation. The campaign included the use of multimedia, a website, and an information telephone service. Multiple levels of evaluation were conducted. This included a cross-sectional telephone survey of mental health literacy undertaken before and after 14 months of the campaign using a quasi-experimental design. Randomly selected independent samples of 600 young people aged 12 - 25 years from the experimental region and another 600 from a comparison region were interviewed at each time point. A series of binary logistic regression analyses were used to measure the association between a range of campaign outcome variables and the predictor variables of region and time.
   Results: The program was judged to have an impact on the following variables, as indicated by significant region-by-time interaction effects ( p < 0.05): awareness of mental health campaigns, self-identified depression, help for depression sought in the previous year, correct estimate of prevalence of mental health problems, increased awareness of suicide risk, and a reduction in perceived barriers to help seeking. These effects may be underestimated because media distribution error resulted in a small amount of print material "leaking" into the comparison region.
   Conclusion: We believe this is the first study to apply the rigorous standards of a health promotion model including the use of a control region to a mental health population intervention. The program achieved many of its aims despite the relatively short duration and moderate intensity of the campaign.

ID OVERDOSE
AB Context. Paliperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that was approved in the U. S. in 2006, and is also available in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and Asia. Information regarding paliperidone overdoses is limited to case reports. Serious toxicity has yet to be reported. Objective. To evaluate the toxicity of paliperidone exposures using a national poison center database. Methods. A retrospective, observational case series of single-substance paliperidone cases reported to the National Poison Data System from 2007 to 2012 was conducted. Cases were evaluated for demographics, reason for exposure, clinical effects, treatments, disposition, and coded medical outcomes. For cases with major effects the text fields in poison center charts were evaluated to verify accuracy of coded outcome. The relationship between dose and severity of medical outcome was analyzed for acute exposure cases. Results. There were 801 paliperidone cases that met inclusion criteria that included 592 persons of 13 years or greater, 67 children of 6-12 years, 140 children of less than 6 years, and 2 unknown ages. Most common reasons for exposure included: suicide attempt (39.6%), unintentional general (21.1%), therapeutic error (15.7%), and adverse drug reaction (11.9%). The most commonly observed clinical effects were drowsiness/lethargy (28.7%), tachycardia (23.3%), and dystonia (14.2%). Most patients were managed in the emergency department (40.3%) or were admitted to a health care facility (HCF) (42.7%). In 564 cases treated in a HCF, treatments included activated charcoal (25.7%), antihistamines (21.1%), and benzodiazepines (9.4%). Medical outcomes were no effect (35.0%), minor (30.8%), moderate (33.7%), and major effect (0.5%). There were no deaths. Of 491 acute exposures, dose was coded for 74.3% of exposures. There was a significant difference in the reported median dose between those with no effect (6 mg) and either minor effect (12 mg; p = 0.047) or moderate effect cases (12 mg; p = 0.020) in 91 children less than 6 years. Conclusions. The majority of patients experienced no or minor toxicity and were not admitted for medical care. Although a higher dose was associated with a more serious outcome in children less than 6 years, the data do not provide clear-cut triage guidelines.

AB The impact of traumatic workplace death on bereaved families, including their mental health and well-being, has rarely been systematically examined. This study aimed to document the rates and key correlates of probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and prolonged grief disorder (PGD) in family members following a workplace injury fatality. The hidden nature of the target population necessitated outreach recruitment techniques, including the use of social media, newspaper articles, radio interviews, and contact with major family support organizations. Data were collected using a cross-sectional design and international online survey. The PCL-C (PTSD), the PHQ-8 (MDD), and PG-13 (PGD) were used to measure mental health disorders. All are well-established self-report measures with strong psychometric qualities. Participants were from Australia (62%), Canada (17%), the USA (16%), and the UK (5%). The majority were females (89.9%), reflecting the gender distribution of traumatic workplace deaths (over 90% of fatalities are male). Most were partners/spouses (38.5%) or parents (35%) and over half (64%) were next of kin to the deceased worker. Most deaths occurred in the industries that regularly account for more than 70 percent of all industrial deaths-construction, manufacturing, transport, and agriculture forestry and fishing. At a mean of 6.40 years (SD = 5.78) post-death, 61 percent of participants had probable PTSD, 44 percent had probable MDD, and 43 percent had probable PGD. Logistic regressions indicated that a longer time since the death reduced the risk of having each disorder. Being next of kin and having a self-reported mental health history increased the risk of having MDD. Of the related information and support variables, having satisfactory support from family, support from a person to help navigate the post-death formalities, and satisfactory information about the death were associated with a decreased risk of probable PTSD, MDD, and PGD, respectively. The findings highlight the potential magnitude of the problem and the need for satisfactory information and support for bereaved families.

AB BackgroundThere are currently no approved pharmacotherapies for managing methamphetamine dependence. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been found to reduce the craving for methamphetamine and other drugs, but its effect on methamphetamine use and other clinically related endpoints are uncertain. The N-ICE trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of NAC as a take-home pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine dependence.Methods/designThis is a two-arm parallel double-blind placebo-controlled three-site randomised trial (ratio 1:1) using permuted block randomisation, with variable block sizes. It is stratified by site, sex and whether the methamphetamine is injected or not. Participants (N=180; 60 per site) need to be dependent on methamphetamine, interested in reducing their methamphetamine use and not currently receiving treatment for substance use disorders. The trial is being conducted in outpatient settings in Melbourne, Geelong and Wollongong, Australia. Participants will receive either 2400mg oral NAC or a matched placebo, delivered as a take-home medication for 12weeks. Two 600mg capsules are self-administered in the morning and two more in the evening. Adherence is being monitored using eCAP medication bottle lids, which record the date and time of each occasion the bottle is opened. The primary outcome is methamphetamine use during the 12-week trial medication period, measured as (a) days of use, assessed using the timeline followback, and (b) methamphetamine-positive saliva tests, taken weekly. Secondary measures include weekly assessment of methamphetamine craving, severity of methamphetamine dependence, methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms and psychiatric symptoms (depression, suicidality, psychotic symptoms and hostility). Adverse events are monitored at each weekly assessment. Tolerability is assessed using the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication.DiscussionThe N-ICE trial is the first clinical trial to assess whether NAC can reduce methamphetamine use. This trial will improve our understanding of the potential utility of NAC in managing methamphetamine dependence and clinically related outcomes. If found to be effective, take-home NAC could be a potentially scalable and affordable pharmacotherapy option for treating methamphetamine dependence.Trial registrationAustralian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12618000366257.

TI Does Interpersonal Psychotherapy improve clinical care for adolescents
   with depression attending a rural child and adolescent mental health
   service? Study protocol for a cluster randomised feasibility trial
SO BMC PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID DISORDERS; EFFICACY; SUICIDE; THERAPY
AB Background: Depression amongst adolescents is a costly societal problem. Little research documents the effectiveness of public mental health services in mapping this problem. Further, it is not clear whether usual care in such services can be improved via clinician training in a relevant evidence based intervention. One such intervention, found to be effective and easily learned amongst novice clinicians, is Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT). The study described in the current paper has two main objectives. First, it aims to investigate the impact on clinical care of implementing Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Adolescents for the treatment of adolescent depression within a rural mental health service compared with Treatment as Usual (TAU). The second objective is to record the process and challenges (i.e. feasibility, acceptability, sustainability) associated with implementing and evaluating an evidence-based intervention within a community service. This paper outlines the study rationale and design for this community based research trial.
   Methods/design: The study involves a cluster randomisation trial to be conducted within a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service in rural Australia. All clinicians in the service will be invited to participate. Participating clinicians will be randomised via block design at each of four sites to (a) training and delivery of IPT, or (b) TAU. The primary measure of impact on care will be a clinically significant change in depressive symptomatology, with secondary outcomes involving treatment satisfaction and changes in other symptomatology. Participating adolescents with significant depressive symptomatology, aged 12 to 18 years, will complete assessment measures at Weeks 0, 12 and 24 of treatment. They will also complete a depression inventory once a month during that period. This study aims to recruit 60 adolescent participants and their parent/guardian/s. A power analysis is not indicated as an intra-class correlation coefficient will be calculated and used to inform sample size calculations for subsequent large-scale trials. Qualitative data regarding process implementation will be collected quarterly from focus groups with participating clinicians over 18 months, plus phone interviews with participating adolescents and parent/guardians at 12 weeks and 24 weeks of treatment. The focus group qualitative data will be analysed using a Fourth Generation Evaluation methodology that includes a constant comparative cyclic analysis method.
   Discussion: This study protocol will be informative for researchers and clinicians interested in considering, designing and/or conducting cluster randomised trials within community practice such as mental health services.

AB Background: Concerns have been raised of a potential connection between excessive online activity outside the academic realm and increased levels of psychological distress in young people. Young Minds Matter: the second Australian Child and Adolescent Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing provides estimates of the prevalence of online activity and allows an exploration of associations between this activity, a range of mental disorders, socio-demographic characteristics and risk taking behaviour.
   Methods: Based on a randomized nationally representative sample, a household survey of mental health and wellbeing (Young Minds Matter) was conducted in 2013-14. Interviews were conducted with 6,310 parents and carers of 4-17 year-olds (55 % response rate), together with self-report questionnaires completed by 2,967 11-17 year-olds in these households (89 % response rate). The survey identified a range of mental disorders and emotional problems using a variety of diagnostic tools, with the self-report including questions about use of the Internet and electronic games. Five behaviours were measured related to this activity, with 'problem behaviour' being defined as exhibiting at least four out of five behaviours.
   Results: Levels of Internet use (98.9 %, CI 98.5-99.3 %) and electronic gaming (85.3 %, CI 83.9-86.6 %) were high, and 3.9 % (CI 3.2-4.6 %) of young people reported problem behaviour. The proportion of girls with very high levels of psychological distress and problem behaviour (41.8 %, CI 28.8-54.9 %) was twice that for boys (19.4 %, CI 7.7-31.1 %). Those engaging with a range of risk factors reported higher prevalence of problem behaviour than others. Youth who suffered from emotional problems or high levels of psychological distress spent the most time online or playing games. Multivariate analysis showed associations with problem behaviour and having attempted suicide, experiencing high to very high levels of psychological distress, using alcohol, and living in a poorly functioning family. It was not possible to determine the direction of the associations.
   Conclusion: There are links between problem behaviours associated with Internet use and electronic gaming, and mental disorders and risk-taking behaviour in young people. Further studies are required to determine whether these are precursors or sequelae.

AB Objectives: To collate data from multiple obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) treatment centers across seven countries and five continents, and to report findings in relation to OCD comorbidity, age of onset of OCD and comorbid disorders, and suicidality, in a large clinical and ethnically diverse sample, with the aim of investigating cultural variation and the utility of the psychiatric diagnostic classification of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.
   Methods: Researchers in the field of OCD were invited to contribute summary statistics on current and lifetime psychiatric comorbidity, age of onset of OCD and comorbid disorders and suicidality in their patients with OCD.
   Results: Data from 3711 adult patients with primary OCD came from Brazil (n = 955), India (n = 802), Italy (n = 750), South Africa (n = 565), Japan (n = 322), Australia (n = 219), and Spain (n = 98). The most common current comorbid disorders were major depressive disorder (28.4%; n = 1055), obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (24.5%, n = 478), generalized anxiety disorder (19.3%, n = 716), specific phobia (19.2%, n = 714) and social phobia (18.5%, n = 686). Major depression was also the most commonly co-occurring lifetime diagnosis, with a rate of 50.5% (n = 1874). OCD generally had an age of onset in late adolescence (mean = 17.9 years, SD = 1.9). Social phobia, specific phobia and body dysmorphic disorder also had an early age of onset. Co-occurring major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and psychotic disorders tended to have a later age of onset than OCD. Suicidal ideation within the last month was reported by 6.4% (n = 200) of patients with OCD and 9.0% (n = 314) reported a lifetime history of suicide attempt.
   Conclusions: In this large cross-continental study, comorbidity in OCD was common. The high rates of comorbid major depression and anxiety disorders emphasize the need for clinicians to assess and monitor for these disorders. Earlier ages of onset of OCD, specific phobia and social phobia may indicate some relatedness between these disorders, but this requires further study. Although there do not appear to be significant cultural variations in rates or patterns of comorbidity and suicidality, further research using similar recruitment strategies and controlling for demographic and clinical variables may help to determine whether any sociocultural factors protect against suicidal ideation or psychiatric comorbidity in patients with OCD.

AB Background: Late-life depression is associated with high rates of morbidity, premature mortality, disability, functional decline, caregiver burden and increased health care costs. While clinical and public health approaches are focused on prevention or early intervention strategies, the ideal method of intervention remains unclear. No study has set out to evaluate the role of neurobiological agents in preventing depressive symptoms in older populations at risk of depression.
   Methods/Design: Subjects with previously reported sub-threshold depressive symptoms, aged 60 to 74 years, will be screened to participate in a single-centre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial with three parallel groups involving omega-3 fatty acid supplementation or sertraline hydrochloride, compared with matching placebo. Subjects will be excluded if they have current depression or suicide ideation; are taking antidepressants or any supplement containing omega-3 fatty acid; or have a prior history of stroke or other serious cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease, neurological disease, significant psychiatric disease (other than depression) or neurodegenerative disease. The trial will consist of a 12 month treatment phase with follow-up at three months and 12 months to assess outcome events. At three months, subjects will undergo structural neuroimaging to assess whether treatment effects on depressive symptoms correlate with brain changes. Additionally, proton spectroscopy techniques will be used to capture brain-imaging markers of the biological effects of the interventions. The trial will be conducted in urban New South Wales, Australia, and will recruit a community-based sample of 450 adults. Using intention-to-treat methods, the primary endpoint is an absence of clinically relevant depression scores at 12 months between the omega-3 fatty acid and sertraline interventions and the placebo condition.
   Discussion: The current health, social and economic costs of late-life depression make prevention imperative from a public health perspective. This innovative trial aims to address the long-neglected area of prevention of depression in older adults. The interventions are targeted to the pathophysiology of disease, and regardless of the effect size of treatment, the outcomes will offer major scientific advances regarding the neurobiological action of these agents. The main results are expected to be available in 2017.

AB Background No systematic attempts have been made to estimate the global and regional prevalence of amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine, and opioid dependence, and quantify their burden. We aimed to assess the prevalence and burden of drug dependence, as measured in years of life lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disabilityadjusted life years (DALYs).
   Methods We conducted systematic reviews of the epidemiology of drug dependence, and analysed results with Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010) Bayesian meta-regression technique (DisModMR) to estimate population-level prevalence of dependence and use. GBD 2010 calculated new disability weights by use of representative community surveys and an internet-based survey. We combined estimates of dependence with disability weights to calculate prevalent YLDs, YLLs, and DALYs, and estimated YLDs, YLLs, and DALYs attributable to drug use as a risk factor for other health outcomes.
   Findings Illicit drug dependence directly accounted for 20.0 million DALYs (95% UI 15.3-25.4 million) in 2010, accounting for 0.8% (0.6-1.0) of global all-cause DALYs. Worldwide, more people were dependent on opioids and amphetamines than other drugs. Opioid dependence was the largest contributor to the direct burden of DALYs (9.2 million, 95% UI 7.1-11.4). The proportion of all-cause DALYs attributed to drug dependence was 20 times higher in some regions than others, with an increased proportion of burden in countries with the highest incomes. Injecting drug use as a risk factor for HIV accounted for 2.1 million DALYs (95% UI 1.1-3.6 million) and as a risk factor for hepatitis C accounted for 502 000 DALYs (286 000-891 000). Suicide as a risk of amphetamine dependence accounted for 854 000 DALYs (291 000-1 791 000), as a risk of opioid dependence for 671 000 DALYs (329 000-1 730 000), and as a risk of cocaine dependence for 324 000 DALYs (109 000-682 000). Countries with the highest rate of burden (> 650 DALYs per 100 000 population) included the USA, UK, Russia, and Australia.
   Interpretation Illicit drug use is an important contributor to the global burden of disease. Effi cient strategies to reduce disease burden of opioid dependence and injecting drug use, such as delivery of opioid substitution treatment and needle and syringe programmes, are needed to reduce this burden at a population scale.

AB Background: The vast majority of the world's refugees and people seeking asylum live in a state of sustained displacement. Little is known, however, about the mental health impact of prolonged insecurity.Objective: This study aimed to investigate the association between insecure visa status and mental health, suicidality, disability and social engagement in a sample of refugees and asylum-seekers living in AustraliaMethod: Participants were 1,085 refugees with secure (i.e. permanent residency or Australian citizenship, n = 826, 76.1%) and insecure (i.e. asylum-seeker claim, bridging visa, temporary visa, n = 259, 23.9%) visa status who had arrived in Australia since January 2011, and were from Arabic, Farsi, Tamil or English-speaking backgrounds. Participants completed an online survey assessing pre- and post-migration experiences, mental health, disability and social engagement.Results: Results indicated that, after controlling for background factors, refugees with insecure visas had significantly greater PTSD symptoms, depression symptoms, thoughts of being better off dead and suicidal intent compared to those with secure visas. There were no group differences in disability. Refugees with insecure visas received support from significantly more groups in the Australian community than those with secure visas. Further, refugees with insecure visa status who had low group membership showed greater depression symptoms and suicidal intent than those with secure visa status who had low group membership.Conclusion: Findings highlight the negative mental health consequences of living in a state of protracted uncertainty for refugees and people seeking asylum, and the key role of social engagement in influencing mental health amongst insecure visa holders. Results also underscore the importance of designing and implementing policies and services that facilitate improved mental health for those with visa insecurity. Antecedentes: la mayoria de los refugiados del mundo y las personas que solicitan asilo viven en un estado de desplazamiento sostenido. Sin embargo, se conoce muy poco sobre el impacto en la salud mental de la inseguridad prolongada.Objetivo: este estudio investiga la asociacion entre el estatus inseguro de la visa y la salud mental, la suicidalidad, la discapacidad y la participacion social en una gran muestra de refugiados y solicitantes de asilo que viven en Australia.Metodologia: Los participantes fueron 1.085 refugiados. Un grupo tenia un estatus seguro de la visa (como por ejemplo residencia permanente o ciudadania australiana n=826, 76.1%) y otro grupo tenia un estatus inseguro de su visa (como por ejemplo solicitantes de asilo, visa puente(1), visas temporales, n = 259, 23,9%). Los sujetos llegaron a Australia desde Enero de 2011, y eran de origen arabe, farsi, tamil o angloparlante. Los participantes completaron un cuestionario online que evaluaba las experiencias pre y post migracion, salud mental, discapacidad y participacion social.Resultados: Los resultados indican que despues de controlar factores contextuales importantes, los refugiados con visas inseguras tuvieron sintomas de TEPT significativamente mayores (beta =0.15, 95%; intervalo de confianza (IC) = 0,05-0,26), sintomas depresivos (beta =0.22, 95% CI=0.069-0.34), pensamientos de estar mejor muerto (OR=1.9, 95% CI=1.26-2.89) e intentos suicidas (OR=2.41, 95% CI=1.03-5.62), comparados con aquellos que contaban con visas seguras. No existen diferencias entre grupos para la discapacidad.
   Los refugiados con visas inseguras recibieron el apoyo de muchos mas grupos que aquellos que tenian visas seguras (Chi - cuadrado de Wald= 33.01, p <.001). Ademas, los refugiados con estatus de visa inseguro con baja pertenencia al grupo mostraron mayores sintomas de depresion (B=0.17, t=3.85, p <.001) e intentos suicidas que aquellos que tenian un estatus de visa seguro y una baja pertenencia a un grupo (B=-1.25, OR=0.29, p =0.006).Conclusion: Los resultados destacan las consecuencias negativas para la salud mental de vivir en un estado de incertidumbre prolongada para los refugiados y las personas que solicitan asilo, y el papel clave de la participacion social para influir en la salud mental entre los titulares de visas inseguras. Los resultados tambien subrayan la importancia de disenar e implementar politicas y servicios que faciliten una mejor salud mental para las personas con visas inseguras. ???????????????????????????????,???????????????????????????????????????????????????????, ??, ???????????????????1,085??2011?1???????, ???, ??????????????????????,?826???(76.1%)???????(???????????????),259???(23.9%)????(?????????, ????, ????)????????????????, ????, ????????????????????,?????????????,??????????,??????PTSD??(beta= 0.15,95%????(CI)= 0.05-0.26), ????(beta= 0.22,95%CI = 0.069 -0.34), ?????????(OR = 1.9,95%CI = 1.26-2.89)?????(OR = 2.41,95%CI = 1.03-5.62)??????????????????????????????????????????(Wald??(1)= 33.01,p <.001)???,?????, ?????????????????(B = -1.25,t = 3.85,t = 3.85,p <.001)???????????, ???????????(OR = 0.29,p = 0.006)????????????????????????????????????????,????????????????????????????????, ??????????????????????????

AB A psychiatric assistance dog (PAD) is a service dog that is trained to assist its handler (owner) who has been diagnosed with a mental health condition such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder. Literature searches reveal that little is known about the population of people who own PADs, the types of dogs used or the functions they provide. One third (n = 199) of PAD owners in Australia registered with the charity "mindDog" participated in an online survey designed to better understand the person and dog team. Participants learned about PADs through the internet (37%), health care practitioners (32%), or family/friends (30%). The dogs in the sample were of varying age, gender and breed. The most common reasons for people to choose a dog to be a PAD were temperament (60%) and size/weight (48%). Just under half (48%) of the dogs had been acquired by the owner specifically to be trained as a PAD, and the rest were existing pets. All the dogs were trained by the owner or a combination of the owner and a qualified trainer; none were trained exclusively by assistance/service dog provider organizations. The median age of the participants at the time of data collection was 47 years, ranging from 10 to 75 years. Most (77%) identified as female. Depression (84%), anxiety (social 61%; generalized 60%), PTSD (62%), and panic attacks (57%) were the most reported mental health diagnoses. Tasks the dogs performed for their owners included: reduction of anxiety through tactile stimulation (94%); nudging/pawing to bring back to the present (71%); interrupting undesirable behavior (51%); constant body contact (50%); deep pressure stimulation (45%) and blocking contact from other people (42%). PAD usage decreased (46%), increased (30%) or did not change (24%) participants' use of psychiatric or other health care services. Decrease in service use was mainly due to reduced suicide attempts, and less requirement for hospitalization and medication; increased use was mainly due to enhanced ability to attend appointments. Results of this study show that PAD owners have differing mental health diagnoses, and their dogs perform different tasks to support them in daily life. Every participant described the relationship with his/her PAD as positive, suggesting that a successful working partnership does not require the dog to have been bred or raised specifically for the role. A better understanding of this population and the person-dog relationship will inform the appropriate choice, training and use of PADs for people living with mental health problems.

AB Background: Identifying mental health disorders in migrant and refugee women during pregnancy provides an opportunity for interventions that may benefit women and their families. Evidence suggests that perinatal mental health disorders impact mother-infant attachment at critical times, which can affect child development. Postnatal depression resulting in suicide is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality postpartum. Routine screening of perinatal mental health is recommended to improve the identification of depression and anxiety and to facilitate early management. However, screening is poorly implemented into routine practice. This study is the first to investigate routine screening for perinatal mental health in a maternity setting designed for refugee women. This study will determine whether symptoms of depression and anxiety are more likely to be detected by the screening program compared with routine care and will evaluate the screening program's feasibility and acceptability to women and health care providers (HCPs).
   Objective: The objectives of this study are (1) to assess if refugee women are more likely to screen risk-positive for depression and anxiety than nonrefugee women, using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS); (2) to assess if screening in pregnancy using the EPDS enables better detection of symptoms of depression and anxiety in refugee women than current routine care; (3) to determine if a screening program for perinatal mental health in a maternity setting designed for refugee women is acceptable to women; and (4) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the perinatal mental health screening program from the perspective of HCPs (including the barriers and enablers to implementation).
   Methods: This study uses an internationally recommended screening measure, the EPDS, and a locally developed psychosocial questionnaire, both administered in early pregnancy and again in the third trimester. These measures have been translated into the most common languages used by the women attending the clinic and are administered via an electronic platform (iCOPE). This platform automatically calculates the EPDS score and generates reports for the HCP and woman. A total of 119 refugee women and 155 nonrefugee women have been recruited to evaluate the screening program's ability to detect depression and anxiety symptoms and will be compared with 34 refugee women receiving routine care. A subsample of women will participate in a qualitative assessment of the screening program's acceptability and feasibility. Health service staff have been recruited to evaluate the integration of screening into maternity care.
   Results: The recruitment is complete, and data collection and analysis are underway.
   Conclusions: It is anticipated that screening will increase the identification and management of depression and anxiety symptoms in pregnancy. New information will be generated on how to implement such a program in feasible and acceptable ways that will improve health outcomes for refugee women.

AB The impact academic difficulties can have on social, emotional and behavioural outcomes is well documented, including links with low self-esteem, difficulty making and maintaining friendships, learned helplessness, reduced confidence in ability to learn and be successful, low achievement motivation, attention problems, maladaptive behaviours and increased risk of suicide.
   In Australia, the need to provide high quality, and equitable, education to all young Australians is highlighted in The Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians [1]. Policies, such as the implementation of a nationwide curriculum, strive for delivery of high quality and equitable education with regards to the curriculum taught but it does not address how equity in regards to educational outcomes for socially disadvantaged groups is attained.
   It is argued that attempts to remedy academic difficulties often target learning outcomes at the individual level (e.g., school based reading recovery programmes) reflecting the perspective that difficulties sit within the individual. This approach to intervention fails to take into consideration the ecological influences on the learning process and social context in which learning occurs. The benefits of moving from an individual perspective to a systems level perspective (e.g., ecological model), and therefore a systemic model of intervention, is reflected in the community psychology and Positive Youth Development literature. These approaches emphasise that development occurs as part of an interaction between the individual and their environment (i.e., school) and that when there is a 'goodness of fit' between the individual and the environment, optimal development occurs.
   What is missing in the literature is an understanding of the personal learning experience of students and how individual characteristics (i.e., personal experiences and competencies) and social contexts interact with structures and processes within the school and impact on learning outcomes. Further, it is argued that greater consideration should be given to how educational activities and policies which influence the social/cultural context (e.g., National Assessment Programmes for Literacy and Numeracy) are developed and implemented within schools, and how school settings themselves influence the development of not only academic achievement but social and emotional development.
   Further research is needed to clarify how equitable outcomes can be enacted within school settings characterised by diversity and to define 'how' the curriculum should be taught in ways that facilitate inclusivity and engagement in addition to 'what' should be taught. It is argued that understanding the 'how' identifies an issue missing in the academic achievement literature.
   Drawing on empowerment theory, this paper discusses the development of an overarching theory that can guide decision making and inform policy development that facilitates equitable academic outcomes for all students by promoting the development and enactment of empowering academic settings that are able to accommodate diverse needs and the mapping of targeted engagement, and subsequent intervention, in ways that promote sustainable learning outcomes.

AB Background: Each year, many young Australians aged between 16 and 25 years experience a mental health disorder, yet only a small proportion access services and even fewer receive timely and evidence-based treatments. Today, with ever-increasing access to the Internet and use of technology, the potential to provide all young people with access (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) to the support they require to improve their mental health and well-being is promising.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to use participatory design (PD) as research methodologies with end users (young people aged between 16 and 25 years and youth health professionals) and our research team to develop the Mental Health eClinic (a Web-based mental health clinic) to improve timely access to, and better quality, mental health care for young people across Australia.
   Methods: A research and development (R&D) cycle for the codesign and build of the Mental Health eClinic included several iterative PD phases: PD workshops; translation of knowledge and ideas generated during workshops to produce mockups of webpages either as hand-drawn sketches or as wireframes (simple layout of a webpage before visual design and content is added); rapid prototyping; and one-on-one consultations with end users to assess the usability of the alpha build of the Mental Health eClinic.
   Results: Four PD workshops were held with 28 end users (young people n=18, youth health professionals n=10) and our research team (n=8). Each PD workshop was followed by a knowledge translation session. At the conclusion of this cycle, the alpha prototype was built, and one round of one-on-one end user consultation sessions was conducted (n=6; all new participants, young people n=4, youth health professionals n=2). The R&D cycle revealed the importance of five key components for the Mental Health eClinic: a home page with a visible triage system for those requiring urgent help; a comprehensive online physical and mental health assessment; a detailed dashboard of results; a booking and videoconferencing system to enable video visits; and the generation of a personalized well-being plan that includes links to evidence-based, and health professional-recommended, apps and etools.
   Conclusions: The Mental Health eClinic provides health promotion, triage protocols, screening, assessment, a video visit system, the development of personalized well-being plans, and self-directed mental health support for young people. It presents a technologically advanced and clinically efficient system that can be adapted to suit a variety of settings in which there is an opportunity to connect with young people. This will enable all young people, and especially those currently not able or willing to connect with face-to-face services, to receive best practice clinical services by breaking down traditional barriers to care and making health care more personalized, accessible, affordable, and available.

AB Introduction: The establishment of the rural clinical schools funded through the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing (now Department of Health) Rural Clinical Training and Support program over a decade ago has been a significant policy initiative in Australian rural health. This article explores the impacts of this policy initiative and presents the wide range of educational innovations contextualised to each rural community they serve.
   Methods: This article reviews the achievements of the Australian rural clinical and regional medical schools (RCS/RMS) through semi-structured interviews with the program directors or other key informants. The questions and responses were analysed according to the funding parameters to ascertain the numbers of students, types of student placements and range of activities undertaken by each university program.
   Results: Sixteen university medical schools have established 18 rural programs, creating an extensive national network of RCS and RMS in every state and territory. The findings reveal extensive positive impacts on rural and regional communities, curriculum innovation in medical education programs and community engagement activities. Teaching facilities, information technology, video-conferencing and student accommodation have brought new infrastructure to small rural towns. Rural clinicians are thriving on new opportunities for education and research. Clinicians continue to deliver clinical services and some have taken on formal academic positions, reducing professional isolation, improving the quality of care and their job satisfaction. This strategy has created many new clinical academics in rural areas, which has retained and expanded the clinical workforce. A total of 1224 students are provided with high-quality learning experiences for long-term clinical placements. These placements consist of a year or more in primary care, community and hospital settings across hundreds of rural and remote areas. Many programs offer longitudinal integrated clerkships; others offer block rotations in general practice and specialist clinics. Nine universities established programs prior to 2004, and these well-established programs are finding graduates who are returning to rural practice. Universities are required to have 25% of the students from a rural background. University admission policies have changed to encourage more applications from rural students. This aspect of the policy implements the extensive research evidence that rural-origin students are more likely to become rural practitioners. Additional capacity for research in RCS has influenced the rural health agenda in fields including epidemiology, population health, Aboriginal health, aged care, mental health and suicide prevention, farming families and climate change. There are strong research partnerships with rural workforce agencies, research centres for early career researchers and PhD students.
   Conclusions: The RCS policy initiative has vastly increased opportunities for medical students to have long-term clinical placements in rural health services. Over a decade since the policy has been implemented, graduates are being attracted to rural practice because they have positive learning experiences, good infrastructure and support within rural areas. The study shows the RCS initiative sets the stage for a sustainable future Australian rural medical workforce now requiring the development of a seamless rural clinical training pipeline linking undergraduate and postgraduate medical education.

AB Background Previous trials have shown that pridopidine might reduce motor impairment in patients with Huntington's disease. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether higher doses of pridopidine than previously tested reduce motor symptoms in a dose-dependent manner while maintaining acceptable safety and tolerability.
   Methods PRIDE-HD was a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2, dose-ranging study in adults (aged >= 21 years) with Huntington's disease at outpatient clinics in 53 sites across 12 countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA). Eligible patients had clinical onset after age 18 years, 36 or more cytosine-adenine-guanine repeats in the huntingtin gene, motor symptoms (Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score [UHDRS-TMS] >= 25 points), and reduced independence (UHDRS independence score <= 90%). Patients were randomly assigned (1: 1: 1: 1: 1) with centralised interactive-response technology to receive one of four doses of pridopidine (45, 67.5, 90, or 112.5 mg) or placebo orally twice a day for 52 weeks. Randomisation was stratified within centres by neuroleptic drug use. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in the UHDRS-TMS from baseline to 26 weeks, which was assessed in all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment (full analysis set). Participants and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2013-001888-23) and ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT02006472).
   Findings Between Feb 13, 2014, and July 5, 2016, 408 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive placebo (n=82) or pridopidine 45 mg (n=81), 67.5 mg (n=82), 90 mg (n=81), or 112.5 mg (n=82) twice daily for 26 weeks. The full analysis set included 397 patients (81 in the placebo group, 75 in the 45 mg group, 79 in the 67.5 mg group, 81 in the 90 mg group, and 81 in the 112.5 mg group). Pridopidine did not significantly change the UHDRS-TMS at 26 weeks compared with placebo at any dose. The most frequent adverse events across all groups were diarrhoea, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, falls, headache, insomnia, and anxiety. The most common treatment-related adverse events were insomnia, diarrhoea, nausea, and dizziness. Serious adverse events occurred in the pridopidine groups only and were most frequently falls (n=5), suicide attempt (n= 4), suicidal ideation (n=3), head injury (n=3), and aspiration pneumonia (n=3). No new safety or tolerability concerns emerged in this study. One death in the pridopidine 112.5 mg group due to aspiration pneumonia was considered to be possibly related to the study drug.
   Interpretation Pridopidine did not improve the UHDRS-TMS at week 26 compared with placebo and, thus, the results of secondary or tertiary analyses in previous trials were not replicated. A potentially strong placebo effect needs to be ruled out in future studies.

TI Peer Support for the Hardly Reached: A Systematic Review
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Review
ID SUICIDE-PREVENTION; MORTALITY; INUIT; YOUTH; COMMUNITY; CANADA;
   INTERVENTION; NEWFOUNDLAND; ASSOCIATION; AUSTRALIA
AB Background. Health disparities are aggravated when prevention and care initiatives fail to reach those they are intended to help. Groups can be classified as hardly reached according to a variety of circumstances that fall into 3 domains: individual (e.g., psychological factors), demographic (e.g., socioeconomic status), and cultural-environmental (e.g., social network). Several reports have indicated that peer support is an effective means of reaching hardly reached individuals. However, no review has explored peer support effectiveness in relation to the circumstances associated with being hardly reached or across diverse health problems.
   Objectives. To conduct a systematic review assessing the reach and effectiveness of peer support among hardly reached individuals, as well as peer support strategies used.
   Search methods. Three systematic searches conducted in PubMed identified studies that evaluated peer support programs among hardly reached individuals. In aggregate, the searches covered articles published from 2000 to 2015.
   Selection criteria. Eligible interventions provided ongoing support for complex health behaviors, including prioritization of hardly reached populations, assistance in applying behavior change plans, and social-emotional support directed toward disease management or quality of life. Studies were excluded if they addressed temporally isolated behaviors, were limited to protocol group classes, included peer support as the dependent variable, did not include statistical tests of significance, or incorporated comparison conditions that provided appreciable social support.
   Data collection and analysis. We abstracted data regarding the primary health topic, categorizations of hardly reached groups, program reach, outcomes, and strategies employed. We conducted a 2-sample t test to determine whether reported strategies were related to reach.
   Results. Forty-seven studies met our inclusion criteria, and these studies represented each of the 3 domains of circumstances assessed (individual, demographic, and cultural-environmental). Interventions addressed 8 health areas, most commonly maternal and child health (25.5%), diabetes (17.0%), and other chronic diseases (14.9%). Thirty-six studies (76.6%) assessed program reach, which ranged from 24% to 79% of the study population. Forty-four studies (94%) reported significant changes favoring peer support. Eleven strategies emerged for engaging and retaining hardly reached individuals. Among them, programs that reported a strategy of trust and respect had higher participant retention (82.8%) than did programs not reporting such a strategy (48.1%; P = .003). In 5 of the 6 studies examining moderators of the effects of peer support, peer support benefits were greater among individuals characterized by disadvantage (e.g., low health literacy).
   Conclusions. Peer support is a broad and robust strategy for reaching groups that health services too often fail to engage. The wide range of audiences and health concerns among which peer support is successful suggests that a basis for its success may be its flexible response to different contexts, including the intended audience, health problems, and setting.
   Public health implications. The general benefits of peer support and findings suggesting that it may be more effective among those at heightened disadvantage indicate that peer support should be considered in programs intended to reach and benefit those too often hardly reached. Because engendering trust and respect was significantly associated with participant retention, programs should emphasize this strategy.

AB Background Little is known about the long-term psychosocial outcomes associated with self-harm during adolescence. We aimed to determine whether adolescents who self-harm are at increased risk of adverse psychosocial outcomes in the fourth decade of life, using data from the Victorian Adolescent Health Cohort Study.
   Methods We recruited a stratified, random sample of 1943 adolescents from 44 schools across the state of Victoria, Australia. The study started on Aug 20, 1992, and finished on March 4, 2014. We obtained data relating to self-harm from questionnaires and telephone interviews at eight waves of follow-up, commencing at mean age 15.9 years (SD 0.5; waves 3-6 during adolescence, 6 months apart) and ending at mean age 35.1 years (SD 0 . 6; wave 10). The outcome measures at age 35 years were social disadvantage (divorced or separated, not in a relationship, not earning money, receipt of government welfare, and experiencing financial hardship), common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety, and substance use. We assessed the associations between self-harm during adolescence and the outcome measures at 35 years (wave 10) using logistic regression models, with progressive adjustment: (1) adjustment for sex and age; (2) further adjustment for background social factors; (3) additional adjustment for common mental disorder in adolescence; and (4) final additional adjustment for adolescent antisocial behaviour and substance use measures.
   Findings From the total cohort of 1943 participants, 1802 participants were assessed for self-harm during adolescence (between waves 3 and 6). Of these, 1671 were included in the analysis sample. 135 (8%) reported having self-harmed at least once during adolescence. At 35 years (wave 10), mental health problems, daily tobacco smoking, illicit drug use, and dependence were all more common in participants who had reported self-harm during the adolescent phase of the study (n=135) than in those who had not (n=1536): for social disadvantage odds ratios [ORs] ranged from 1.34 (95% CI 1.25-1.43) for unemployment to 1.88 (1.78-1.98) for financial hardship; for mental health they ranged from 1.61 (1.51-1.72) for depression to 1.92 (1.79-2.04) for anxiety; for illicit drug use they ranged from 1.36 (1.25-1.49) for any amphetamine use to 3.39 (3.12-3.67) for weekly cannabis use; for dependence syndrome they were 1.72 (1.57-1.87) for nicotine dependence, 2.67 (2.38-2.99) for cannabis dependence, and 1.74 (1.62-1.86) for any dependence; and the OR for daily smoking was 2.00 (1.89-2.12). Adjustment for socio-demographic factors made little difference to these associations but a further adjustment for adolescent common mental disorders substantially attenuated most associations, with the exception of daily tobacco smoking (adjusted OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.08-2 .81), any illicit drug use (1.72, 1.07-2.79) and weekly cannabis use (3.18, 1.58-6.42). Further adjustment for adolescent risky substance use and antisocial behaviour attenuated the remaining associations, with the exception of weekly cannabis use at age 35 years, which remained independently associated with self-harm during adolescence (2.27, 1.09-4.69).
   Interpretation Adolescents who self-harm are more likely to experience a wide range of psychosocial problems later in life. With the notable exception of heavy cannabis use, these problems appear to be largely accounted for by concurrent adolescent mental health disorders and substance use. Complex interventions addressing the domains of mental state, behaviour, and substance use are likely to be most successful in helping this susceptible group adjust to adult life.

AB Depression is common in adolescents, with cumulative rates indicating that up to 20% of young people will suffer at least one clinically depressive episode by the age of 18 years. 1 Adolescent depression causes significant impairment, impacts on developmental trajectories, interferes with educational attainment and increases the risk of attempted and completed suicide as well as major depressive disorder in adulthood, 2-5 yet it often remains unrecognised and untreated. 6,7 Depression in adolescence is an important public health issue and there has been growing interest in the development of preventative and early interventions. Systematic reviews of programmes designed to reduce symptoms of depression in adolescents have noted considerable variability in results but remain supportive of prevention and early intervention approaches delivered in schools. 8,9 However, significant methodological shortfalls, limited follow-up and absence of attention control or placebo comparisons have been noted as important omissions in previous studies10 and the cost-effectiveness of school-based depression prevention programmes has not yet been established.
   Several evaluations have been carried out of depression prevention programmes based on cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) principles, including the Penn Resiliency Programme, (11,12) Coping with Stress, 13 Problem Solving for Life, (14) FRIENDS, 15 Resourceful Adolescent Programme (RAP) (16) and other CBT programmes. 17 Although a number of studies have demonstrated short-term reduction in symptoms of depression, there is often an absence of long-term follow-up and where this is present effects typically diminish after 6 months. (1,10,18-20)Given the limited evidence of long-term gains for depression preventative interventions, it is possible that additional booster sessions could be useful in maintaining short-term benefits. Furthermore, active interventions need to be compared with appropriate controls, including placebo conditions, to account for non-specific treatment effects and spontaneous recovery.(1,8,9,18)
   Cognitive-behavioural therapy-based depression prevention programmes have been delivered as indicated (selective or targeted) interventions to adolescents with elevated symptoms of depression21,22 or as universal interventions to whole populations. (16,23) A meta-analytic review of school-based depression prevention programmes revealed that indicated programmes typically have larger effects than universal approaches. 9 However, indicated preventative interventions do not provide any input to low-risk children that would prevent symptoms developing and they encounter significant recruitment problems that severely limit their reach and potential impact. (11,21,24) Universal prevention programmes provide an alternative pragmatic approach, increasing reach (recruitment rates of 67-88% reported), reducing possible negative effects of stigma and labelling and resulting in lower rates of dropout. 13,14,16,25 Thus, although universal approaches might have a marginally smaller effect on symptoms of depression for individuals, they can potentially reduce far more disorders in the population as a whole. 26 The question of who delivers school-based interventions also needs to be considered, as depression prevention programmes that are led by trained facilitators typically have larger effects than those led by teachers.
   Of the evaluated universal depression prevention programmes, the RAP appears particularly promising. Three studies have demonstrated a reduction in symptoms of depression relative to a control group post intervention, and all have demonstrated good reach (> 70% of the eligible population) and low attrition (< 10%), 16,24,25 although sustained effects at long-term follow-up (12 months) were not assessed in two of these studies. 24,25 The largest of these studies was a multisite randomised controlled effectiveness trial in Australia of RAP involving 2664 students from 12 schools. 24 Of the ` at-risk' students, 49.1% in the RAP condition moved into the healthy category post intervention compared with 35.3% in the control group. This difference was maintained at 12-month follow-up and qualitative feedback indicated a high level of skills usage in the RAP group. 24
   The current project aimed to undertake a pragmatic trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a universally delivered classroom-based CBT depression prevention programme implemented under everyday conditions in the UK school context. To maximise the potential for effectiveness, an efficacious programme was selected (RAP), booster sessions were offered, and the programme was delivered by trained professionals external to the school. To overcome the methodological limitations of previous studies, classroom-based CBT was compared with usual Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) curriculum and attention control PSHE groups, and a long-term follow-up (12 months) was included.

AB A personal reflection on 'identity' and forcible removal
   The National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families was an important and earnest attempt to provide the Australian community with the facts as they relate to the extent and nature of this country's assimilation policies. And even though the impact of the Inquiry's findings has led all state and territory parliaments to express such practices as abhorrent, determining that they will not happen in their respective jurisdictions, there is still a prevailing attitude in the broader community that what was done, was done 'with the best intentions' and 'in the best interests of the child'. I would like to suggest an alternative perspective that may better explain the actions of early twentieth century politicians, pastoralists and developers.
   Since 1788, the concept of terra nullius, or empty land, has been used by Australian courts to exclude the suggestion of Aboriginal prior ownership or occupancy of this land. As early as the 1890s, governments, churches and pastoralists were thinking about what to do with the growing so called 'half-caste' population. In their views, traditional Aboriginal people were to be left to die out naturally, hence, the protection era of the early 1900s where governments did what they could 'to smooth the dying pillow' of the traditional Aborigine. If traditional Aborigines died out, then the questions of land ownership, land use and just compensation no longer posed significant problems. However, the so-called 'half-caste' population was altogether a different proposition. As long as they continued to live with their Aboriginal families, then they would have legitimate claims to the families' traditional land.
   I would offer that the separation of Aboriginal children, first from their family, then from their land, was a further attempt to limit the number of Aboriginal people who would legally be defined as traditional owners. Given that Aboriginal cultures are predicated on affiliation with land, and that land is determined by family kinship arrangements, if family is removed, then affiliation to land becomes almost impossible to substantiate. This is the current situation for many Aboriginal people who were forcibly removed under assimilation policies. Even though the 1992 Mabo High Court judgement has now put to rest the legal fiction of terra nullius, Australian common law maintains that Aboriginal claims to land must demonstrate either a traditional or historical connection to the area. The same applies to land claimed under state-based land rights legislation or Native Title legislation.
   The story of forced removal within my family began in 1946 when my mother was removed. It is in my memory, my brothers' and sisters' memories and that of my niece and nephews who were also removed. They are not historic, distant or remote memories. We cannot consign them to the past like some people would prefer us do. They are lived and re-lived every day of our lives. Nor are they isolated incidents or the aberrations of a few. My family's story is a familiar and common one within the broader Indigenous community. However, like so many aspects of Aboriginal Australia, our stories have been hidden or excluded from public view for so long.
   My natural mother was the eldest of six brothers and sisters. Like so many other Aboriginal kids, her birth was never registered. All that is known is that she was born at Alice Springs on or about 28 December 1933. Her mother was Ruby Foster and her father was Elias Jack Williams. Jack was a Western Arrernte man who lived on his country at Hermannsburg, a former Lutheran Church Mission approximately 130 kilometres west of Alice Springs. Hermannsburg Mission was established in 1877 in the traditional land of the Western Arrernte. Over time, Luritja and Pintubi people were brought into the Mission as the civilising mission spread further and further into the Central Desert area. Hermannsburg was handed back to its traditional owners and custodians by the Church in 1982 and is now called by its Arrernte name: Ntaria.
   My grandfather, Jack, as he was called, was the son of Johannes Ntjalka and Maria Kngarra. While Jack claimed my mother as his daughter, he was not her biological father; that was a white man whose name is not mentioned by the old people at Hermannsburg. This was the way things were.
   While her brothers and sisters grew up together at Hermannsburg, my mother was raised in Alice Springs by a Northern Territory policeman. He was a white man named Bob Hamilton and although he was not my mother's father, he 'grew her up' from when she was a toddler. I would have liked to have met him but he died in 1963, long before I even knew his name. Despite being an officer himself, Bob could not stop the police or the Native Welfare Board from taking my mother.
   My mother was thirteen when she was removed from her Western Arrernte family, and transported 2000 kilometres away to Mulgoa Mission, Warragamba, New South Wales to be trained as a domestic servant. The year was 1946, one year after the Second World War ended. During the Second World War, thousands of so-called 'half-caste' Aboriginal kids from the Northern Territory were taken from their families and placed in institutions in South Australia and New South Wales. Ostensibly, the Northern Territory Administration's removal and relocation of Aboriginal children was to protect them from the threats of war. The Administration claimed that Aboriginal children removed during the war would be returned to their families after hostilities had ceased. Of course, this official explanation does not explain why Aboriginal children were removed 20 years before the war and 30 years after it had finished. Nor does it explain why only 'half-caste' kids were considered in need of protection. So, like so many Aboriginal children before and after her, my mother was simply taken from her family one day and driven to a place called 'The Bungalow' at the old Telegraph Station at Alice Springs to await transportation to some unknown destination. Her removal was in the name of 'assimilation', and she would be educated and trained for a lifetime of domestic service.
   However else it may be described, The Bungalow was a temporary staging area for the re-distribution of Aboriginal kids to all points north and south of Alice Springs. It had been built in 1933 and was one of several facilities used by the Commonwealth Government in its 'assimilation' program. Aboriginal children from the Northern Territory placed in other institutions - such as Garden Point on Croker Island, or Khalin Compound and the Retta Dixon Home in Darwin - had a good chance of remaining somewhere within the Territory. This was the case with Mum's brothers and sisters who were taken away, one by one, and placed in various institutions in the Northern Territory. When they were old enough and no longer under the control of the Native Affairs Department, they all managed to return to Hermannsburg to live. But it was not the case with those kids taken to The Bungalow and then sent interstate.
   After two years in the Church Mission Society home at Mulgoa, my mother was deemed sufficiently educated and trained to start employment as a domestic servant, despite being functionally illiterate. At the age of 15 she was placed into the custody and employ of the Matron at Normanhurst Private Hospital, Ashfield. Although my mother spent two years working at the Hospital, she apparently caused a great deal of anguish for Matron, who described my mother as 'a real problem, insolent, and difficult to handle'. This gave me great pleasure to read.
   My mother was 17 years old when I was born at 'Hillcrest', a Salvation Army hospital at Merewether, near Newcastle. She named me Douglas Raymond Williams. When I was seven months old, the Aborigines Protection Board and the NSW Child Welfare Department placed me up for adoption. I was adopted into a non-Aboriginal family whose surname is Mozley. I was then renamed John William Mozley. This is the name that appears on my Birth Extract. The name Mary Williams does not appear. To all intents and purposes, according to the Birth Extract, I was born to the two non-Aboriginal people who adopted me. This was one of the more invidious and pernicious products of the assimilation policies: I and countless thousands of Aboriginal people who were removed will never be entitled to possess a Birth Certificate that acknowledges our natural birth parents.
   After searching for twenty-odd years (Link-Up hadn't been established at this time), I finally located my mother. She was alive and living in Tennant Creek. When we met for the first time she told me that she never stopped believing I was alive, and that we would meet one day. Even after finding my mother, my brothers and sisters, and becoming a registered traditional owner of our country in Ntaria (formerly Hermannsburg), the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages in both New South Wales and the Northern Territory will not allow me to obtain a Birth Certificate with my mother's or my details showing us at law to be mother and son. Three years after being re-united with my mother, I had my name changed by Deed Poll to John Williams-Mozley, to reflect the family names of both my natural family and my adoptive family. Three years after that, my mother died of diabetes-induced kidney failure. She was 51 years old.
   From records obtained from the NSW Archives, I learned that it took nine years for my mother to return to Alice Springs. She was taken away as a young girl and returned to her country a 21 year old woman. In all that time, she had not been allowed contact with her family, had been prepared for life as a domestic servant, and was 'encouraged to give up'(1) her first-born son, according to a letter I found in the NSW Archives. At the time of meeting my mother, I also learned that I was the eldest of her children and that I had three sisters and four brothers.
   My brother Kenny, who is three years younger than me, was taken away at birth from Alice Springs and placed on Croker Island. He was permitted to return to our family when he was about 11 years old. My sister Elna was taken away aged three months. She too was placed on Croker Island and was permitted to return to our family when ten years old. Kenny and Elna have told me that when they were on Croker Island, they didn't know that they were brother and sister. Elna's three children, one girl and two boys, were also taken from her as toddlers and placed with adoptive families. The middle child, a boy, suicided when 17 years old proclaiming at his death that he didn't know who he was.
   My brother Paul was taken away at birth and adopted by a Greek family in South Australia. He grew up believing he was Greek. Through Link-Up, we were re-united with Paul several years ago. He was 33 years old at the time and continued to find it extremely difficult to come to terms with his true identity and his place in our family. Paul died aged 53 of heart failure. Through Link-Up, we also located a brother who was one year older than Paul and living in Western Australia. His name was Peter, and soon after Link-Up confirmed his identity through DNA tests, Elna, Kenny, Paul, Robert and my youngest sister, Louisa, travelled from the Northern Territory to Peter's hospital bed in Perth to meet him. He died two weeks after that visit, aged 54, having been diagnosed with cancer several months before Link-Up found him. I had grown up knowing I was Aboriginal and even though my adoptive parents had no knowledge of Aboriginal cultures, or Western Arrernte culture in particular, they had told me at the earliest opportunity that my mother was an Aboriginal woman from Alice Springs named Mary Williams. The only other fact they were told by the New South Wales Child Welfare Department and the Aborigines Protection Board was that my grandfather was a policeman in the Northern Territory. As far back as I can remember, I had always wanted to be a policeman 'just like my grandfather'. In 1967, the same year the Australian population voted overwhelmingly in favour in a referendum for Aboriginal people to be counted in the National Census as Australian citizens, I was accepted as the first Aboriginal Police Cadet in the New South Wales Police Cadet Corps. To my knowledge, I was the only Aboriginal person ever accepted in the Cadet Corps throughout its 40-year history.
   Owing to the fact that I was taken from my natural family at such a young age, and thereafter denied access to my language, my culture, my land, my place in my family, I have no claims to my Aboriginal heritage. Conversely, although I was raised in what could only be termed a 'typical' white Australian family, white society will not accept me as white. I am neither black nor white. My identity resides somewhere in the hyphen in the middle of my name. In every respect, that is nowhere.
   Three generations of my family, beginning with my mother and continuing with my sister's children, were removed over the last 40 years and either placed in institutions or adopted in the name of 'assimilation'. We were not allowed to grow up with each other or within our families. Consequently, we do not know each other. We can, in all honesty, be described as 'dysfunctional'. We have no past, and in many respects, we have no future.
