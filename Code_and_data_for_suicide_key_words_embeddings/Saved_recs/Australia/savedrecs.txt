AB Aim. To compare suicide rates in Australia, Slovenia, and Croatia with suicide rates in Croatian immigrant groups in Australia and Slovenia in a 10-year period.
   Method. We analyzed records for completed suicides of the residents of Australia in a decade between 1988 and 1997 and Croatia and Slovenia in a decade between 1985 and 1994. The Croatian Catholic Centers in Australia had 31 completed suicides reported in their Parish Registries in the decade between 1985 and 1994, In Slovenia, 141 completed suicides of Croats were reported in the same decade by the Institute of Public Health of Republic of Slovenia.
   Results. The suicide rate and method of suicide in the Croatian immigrant group in Slovenia (26.01/100,000/year; 60% of hanging) converged towards those of the host country (31.43/100,000/year; 76% of hanging), perhaps as a function of the years since migration from Croatia (22.53/100,000/year, 42% of hanging). Somewhat higher male-female ratio in this immigration group (3.55) could be explained by their lower social status. Surprisingly low suicide rate was calculated for the immigration group in Australia (3.10/100,000/year).
   Conclusion. Croat immigrants to Australia have the lowest suicide rate, but the highest male-female suicide ratio, which could be a consequence of underreporting of suicides by Croatian Catholic Centers in Australia. Different suicide data sources can be a source of significant bias in cross-cultural comparison of suicide behavior.

DE agricultural establishment; farm resident; farm suicide; suicide rate;
   rural suicide
AB Despite much having been written, both nationally and internationally, about rural suicides, no one in Australia knows either the number of residents on farms or the suicide rate for this group of people. This paper seeks to determine the number of residents on farms in South Australia, along with the suicide rate.
   A retrospective audit review of the files of suicides completed between the 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2001 was undertaken in the South Australian Coroner's Office. There were 1033 cases examined for sociodemographic details and 380 files were explored in detail.
   Estimating both the number of agricultural establishments in South Australia and the resident population on farms for 2001, and determining the number of suicides on farms between 1997 and 2001, the farm suicide rate was found to be 33.8 for men, 6.7 for women and 21.6 per 100 000 for persons, much higher than the rural suicide rate for South Australia in 2001 (23.8 for men, 5.6 for women and 14.5 per 100 000 for persons) according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
   This study provides an estimate of the number of farm residents in South Australia in 2001, the number and rate of suicides on farms in South Australia in 2001, and shows that this rate is significantly higher than the overall rate of suicide in South Australia in 2001.

ID METEOROLOGICAL FACTORS; ASSOCIATION; BEHAVIOR
AB The suicide rate in New South Wales is shown to be related to annual precipitation, supporting a widespread and long-held assumption that drought in Australia increases the likelihood of suicide. The relationship, although statistically significant, is not especially strong and is confounded by strong, long-term variations in the suicide rate not related to precipitation variations. A decrease in precipitation of about 300 mm would lead to an increase in the suicide rate of approximately 8% of the long-term mean suicide rate.

AB Previous studies have found that rates of suicide have a distinct annual rhythm with a peak in spring. Two recent European studies, however, have found that the amplitude of this rhythm has decreased over time. The purpose of this study was to examine whether such effects are found in Australia. Australian Bureau of Statistics data on all suicides in Australia 1970-1999 were analysed by spectral analysis. We found that suicide, violent suicide and suicide by males are seasonal and that the seasonal amplitude has increased over time. Males who use violent methods determine the seasonal effect. These results support previous findings that suicide and particularly violent suicide have a characteristic seasonal rhythm. However, the progressive increase in the amplitude of this rhythm over time in Australia is in direct contrast to other European findings. We suggest that this may be related to differences in patterns of anti-depressant use and also the effect of migration on the number of seasonally vulnerable individuals in Australia.

AB Disproportionate rates of suicide in rural Australia in comparison to metropolitan areas pose a significant public health challenge. The dynamic interrelationship between mental and physical health, social determinants, and suicide in rural Australia is widely acknowledged. Advancement of this knowledge, however, remains hampered by a lack of adequate theory and methods to understand how these factors interact, and the translation of this knowledge into constructive strategies and solutions. This paper presents a protocol for generating a comprehensive dataset of suicide deaths and factors related to suicide in rural Australia, and for building a program of research to improve suicide prevention policy and practice to better address the social determinants of suicide in non-indigenous populations. The two-phased study will use a mixed-methods design informed by intersectionality theory. Phase One will extract, code, and analyse quantitative and qualitative data on suicide in regional and remote Australia from the National Coronial Information System (NCIS). Phase Two will analyse suicide prevention at three interrelated domains: policy, practice, and research, to examine alignment with evidence generated in Phase One. Findings from Phase One and Two will then be integrated to identify key points in suicide prevention policy and practice where action can be initiated.

Within the unifying framework of logistic regression we investigate how suicide rates vary with marital status and age and how these patterns vary over time and between the two cultures. The main significant differences between the two cultures are that rates are higher in Australia, rates for males are much higher than for females in Australia but only slightly higher in Hong Kong, in Hong Kong the oldest age group has the highest suicide rate unlike in Australia and the protective effects of marriage are larger in Australia.

ID PREVENTION; ADOLESCENTS
AB Objective: Current practice in Australia is to avoid discussing suicide or suicidal ideation directly with students in school suicide prevention programs. This paper examines why there is a strong argument to question this approach in the context of a continuing unacceptable rate of youth suicide in this country.
   Methods: A review of the literature that informs the debate was conducted. Using an action research methodology, a more direct intervention approach was taken based on the use of the 'Toughin' it out' pamphlet.
   Results: A misrepresentation or the evidence surrounding school-based suicide intervention programs in Australia has made educators and guidance officers wary or being more direct with suicide prevention programs. The experience of several practitioners in northern Australia suggests that it is highly beneficial to engage students in discussions about suicide and how to deal with suicidal thoughts. Their impression is that this has led to a lessening of suicide attempts in high-risk situations and there has been no evidence of any adverse outcome.
   Conclusion: The ongoing tragedy of Indigenous adolescent suicide in Australia demands that all possible interventions should be considered. Taking a more direct approach to school suicide prevention and life-promoting programs using the brief intervention tool, the 'Toughin' it out' pamphlet, appeared to be associated with a positive impact on suicide in high-risk secondary schools in northern Australia. The positive experience in northern Australia would support a similar approach being considered in school programs nationally.

AB A number of studies have investigated the presence of suicide clusters, but few have sought to identify risk and protective factors of a suicide occurring within a cluster. We aimed to identify sociodemographic and contextual characteristics of suicide clusters from national and regional analyses of suicide clusters. We searched the National Coroners Information System for all suicides in Australia from 2004 to 2008. Scan statistics were initially used to identify those deaths occurring within a spatial-temporal suicide cluster during the period. We then used logistic regression and generalized estimation equations to estimate the odds of each suicide occurring within a cluster differed by sex, age, marital status, employment status, Indigenous status, method of suicide and location. We identified 258 suicides out of 10,176 suicides during the period that we classified as being within a suicide cluster. When the deceased was Indigenous, living outside a capital city, or living in the northern part of Australia (in particular, Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia) then there was an increased likelihood of their death occurring within a suicide cluster. These findings suggest that suicide clustering might be linked with geographical and Indigenous factors, which supported sociological explanations of suicide clustering. This finding is significant for justifying resource allocation for tackling suicide clustering in particular areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study analysed suicide rates among first-generation immigrants in Australia from 1974 to 2006, and compared their suicide risks against the Australian-born population. It also examined the associations between the suicide rates of immigrants from 23 selected countries of birth during 2001-2006, and in their home countries.
   Age-standardised suicide rates (15+ years) and rate ratios, with a 95 % confidence interval, during 1974-2006 were calculated for country of birth (COB) groups. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was calculated between COB-specific immigrant suicide rates during 2001-2006 in Australia and in their homelands.
   Suicide rates showed a decreasing time-trend among all COB groups for both genders in Australia. The lowest suicide rates were found during 2004-2006, compared to other year groups. Throughout the study period, males born in Eastern, Northern and Western Europe and New Zealand had the highest suicide rates in Australia. For females, the highest rates were among those born in Western Europe and the UK (including Ireland). Male and female migrants born in North Africa and the Middle East, Southern and Central Asia and South East Asia showed the lowest suicide rates. There was a significant correlation between male immigrant suicide rates by COB and the rates of their home countries.
   The patterns of suicide rates in immigrants were influenced by the social and cultural norms of their COB. The overall decrease in suicide risk among immigrants was particularly evident in males.

Adolescents within the welfare system, indigenous, rural and refugee youth, along with same sex attracted young people often need very careful monitoring and support. Young men continue to take their lives more frequently than young women. Prevention programmes in Australia aim to develop resilience in young people, families and communities that can serve as protection against self harm and suicide. The improvement of mental health literacy, a fostering of adolescent self-efficacy and better access to early intervention strategies are currently privileged in national and state policies related to young people in Australia. More work is needed, however, to achieve a well integrated mental health framework capable of effectively addressing adolescent suicide prevention into the twenty-first century.

TI Suicide notes from Australia and the United States
SO PERCEPTUAL AND MOTOR SKILLS

DT Article
AB The rates and patterns of suicide in the United States and Australia are similar. There are, however, few empirical studies comparing these two countries; indeed, there is a paucity of cross-cultural study in suicidology in general. Suicide notes from both countries were compared, based on Leenaars' multidimensional model of suicide. No major differences were noted as is in keeping with similar studies of suicide notes around the world. It was concluded that the model may be applicable to suicides in both countries; further study is warranted.

AB Background: Many epidemiological studies indicate suicide rates are higher for males than females and for urban than rural, Here we re-examine gender, urban and rural differentials in suicide in Australia and Beijing (China). More specifically, to test the two hypotheses (i) that the male to female ratio is larger than one; (ii) that the urban suicide rate is higher than the rural in both places. Methods: Suicide data with information of gender, rural and urban regions for Australia and Beijing (China) for the period of 1991-1996 were used. Ratios between the gender-specific urban and rural suicides rates with the associated confidence intervals were constructed to examine gender, urban and rural differentials in Australia and Beijing. Results: The rural suicide rate in Beijing for both genders was higher than for their urban counterparts. Further, the elderly had the highest suicide rate followed by women aged 20-29. Also, the male to female ratio in China was less than one. In Australia, the rural male suicide rate was higher than the urban whereas the urban female suicide rate was higher than the rural. The male to female ratio was 4 to 1. The differences in rural to urban and male to female ratios between Australia and Beijing are statistically significant. Conclusions: In contrast to the west, male suicide rates are not higher than female rates in China. Urban rates are not necessarily higher than rural rates - not even in a western setting. Cultural factors and regional differences in socio-economic situation are significant in explaining the low gender ratio and the relatively higher suicide rates in rural China. Limitations: The suicide rate in the Beijing region might not exactly reflect the same for the whole of China. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SEXUAL ORIENTATION
AB IntroductionSexual orientation is seldom recorded at death in Australia, and to date there have been no studies on the relationship between those that have died by suicide and sexuality or minority gender identity in Australia. The aim of the present study is to determine whether or not lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT), and intersex individuals who die by suicide constitute a unique subpopulation of those who die by suicide, when compared with non-lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex suicide deaths.
   MethodsThe Queensland Suicide Register holds records of all suicides in Queensland since 1990. All cases from 2000 to 2009 (inclusive; a total of 5,966 cases) were checked for potential indicators of individuals' sexual orientation and gender identification. A total of 35 lesbian (n=10), gay (n=22), bisexual (n=2), and transgender (n=1) suicide cases were identified. Three comparison cases of non-LGBT suicides for each LGBT suicide were then located, matched by age and gender. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.
   ResultsIt was significantly more likely that depression was mentioned in the cases of LGBT suicides than in non-LGBT cases. While 12.4% of the comparison group had been diagnosed with psychotic disorders, there were no such diagnoses among LGBT individuals. LGBT individuals experienced relationship problems more often, with relationship conflict also being more frequent than in non-LGBT cases.
   DiscussionDespite its limitations, this study - the first of its kind in Australia - seems to indicate that LGBT people would require targeted approaches in mental and general health services.

ID PREFECTURE; INCREASES
AB Design and Materials and Methods: Japan has a high suicide rate, ranking tenth in the world. The suicide rate in Australia is relatively low in comparison with other countries. In Japan as well as other countries, most important events occurred after 1990. Therefore, in the present study, we researched the annual suicide, unemployment, GDP growth, and divorce rates and compared each of these between Japan, which has a high suicide rate, and Australia, which had a low suicide rate during 1990-2000. Additionally, we assessed the correlation of the suicide rates with the unemployment, GDP growth, and divorce rates in both Japan and Australia.
   Results and Conclusion: During the study period in Japan, the annual suicide rates correlated significantly with the annual unemployment rates: r(11) = 0.92, F-(1,F- 9) = 53.12, and p < 0.001 (y = 3.48x + 7.93), while they did not correlate with the annual GDP growth rates: r(11) = 0.52 and p = 0.10 (y = -1.00x + 20.82). Moreover, the annual suicide rates correlated significantly with the annual divorce rates: r(11) = 0.91, F-(1,F- 9)= 43.59, and p < 0.001 (y = 12.68x - 1.87). In Australia, the annual suicide rates did not correlate with the annual unemployment (r(11) = 0.28 and p = 0.40 (y = -0.16x + 14.28)), GDP growth (r(11) = 0.02 and p = 0.96 (y = 0.01x + 12.93)), and divorce rates (r(11) = 0.19 and p = 0.58 (y = 1.49x + 8.93)). Therefore, each country's administration, medical staff, police, and citizens should pay close attention to the increase in suicide rates when the unemployment and divorce rates show an increasing trend, particularly in countries that already have a high suicide rate, such as Japan.

AB Australia has one of the highest rates of youth suicide in the western world, especially among rural men. This paper discusses the social construction of this issue in Australia and explores the issue through interviews with 30 young people and 12 key informants from a rural town in NSW. Findings suggest that young people struggle to deal with conflict in social relationships, that community discourses shape young people's understandings and that suicide is talked about in reference to depression. Implications for youth suicide prevention in Australian rural communities are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Media reporting of suicide has attracted public health attention because of its potential to trigger "copycat" acts. Aims: To determine the factors associated with an individual suicide featuring in the media. Method: We identified from the National Coroners Information System (NCIS) all suicides that occurred in Australia over a 1-year period and established those that were reported in the Australian media using data from our earlier Media Monitoring Project. Available variables were used to examine factors associated with a suicide being reported in the media. Results: Of the 2,161 suicides, 29 were reported in the media. Suicides by younger individuals were particularly likely to be reported, as were suicides by gunshot and other violent methods, suicides in commercial areas (e. g., office buildings and hotels) and medical/residential facilities and other institutions (e. g., detention centers), and suicides that occurred in the context of multiple fatality events (e. g., homicide-suicides and suicide pacts). Conclusions: Striking the right balance in terms of media reporting of suicide is crucial. The current study suggests that the reported suicides tend to be those that may either heighten the risk of lethal imitative behaviors or serve to distort public perceptions about suicide.

AB The patterns of association between age and suicide rate vary by country, subpopulation and gender, and over time. To shed light on factors associated with these differences, we analysed suicide data from four populations, two 'Western' (Australia, the United States [US]) and two Asian (Japan and Hong Kong). We computed suicide rates in five-year age-groups (between 10 and 14 years and 85+ years) for men and women separately, and present graphical representations of the age patterns during selected five-year periods. Rates and age patterns differed markedly, as did gender patterns except in Hong Kong. In 1964-8, male suicide rates in Australia and US were represented by upward-sloping graphs, whereas in Japan the pattern was bimodal. By 1979-83, male patterns in Australia and US were bimodal, but Japan's was trimodal, including a middle-age peak reached in 1994-98. In contrast, female age patterns in the Western countries were shallowly convex or uniform, while in Hong Kong and Japan the upward-sloping graphs became, over time, less steep; by 2009-13, the pattern in Japan was uniform (flat). In recent decades, suicide rates of older men in Australia, US and Japan, and older women in Japan and Hong Kong, have fallen considerably. Suicide rates of men aged 45-64 in Australia and US also fell, though by 2009-13 the US rate had risen again. The suicide rate of Australian men in their twenties halved between 1994-98 and 2009-13, while rates for younger men and women in Japan have risen since 1994-98. In Hong Kong, suicide rates of young men have increased. Age patterns of suicide likely reflect period and cohort effects shaped by socioeconomic stressors, availability of health and welfare services, access to lethal methods of suicide, and other factors. Greater understanding of their impact on age patterns of suicide can result in potential preventive solutions.

AB Background: In Australia, farming populations have been identified as having higher rates of suicide, in comparison to metropolitan, rural and regional communities. The reasons for this are unclear although stigma is considered a risk factor. This study was designed to understand the role of suicide stigma and suicide literacy and the relationship between these.
   Methods: A mixed-methods online intervention was developed. This paper reports on baseline quantitative data (suicide stigma, suicide literacy and suicide effect) collected from male and female rural Australian participants (N = 536) with an experience of suicide.
   Results: When compared with previous Australian community samples, our sample demonstrated higher levels of stigma and higher levels of suicide literacy. Males were more likely to have considered suicide than females. Females were more likely than males to report a devastating and ongoing effect of suicide bereavement, but less likely than a previous Australian community sample.
   Conclusion: Results of this study reiterate the need for improved understanding of the risk factors and experience of suicide within the context of life and work in rural Australian farming communities and how 'best practice' can be adapted to improve stigma reduction and suicide prevention efforts.

AB Objectives: This audit examined the demographics of Indigenous Australians dying by suicide in the Kimberley region of Western Australia during the period 2005-2014.
   Methods: This is a de-identified retrospective audit of reported suicide deaths provided to Kimberley Mental Health and Drug Service during the period 2005-2014. Variables such as age, sex, method of suicide, previous engagement with mental health services, locality and ethnicity were assessed.
   Results: Indigenous suicide rates in the Kimberley region have dramatically increased in the last decade. There is also an overall trend upwards in Indigenous youth suicide and Indigenous female suicides.
   Conclusions: These findings highlight the need for culturally informed, and youth focussed, suicide prevention interventions within the Kimberley region.

AB Background: During the late nineteenth century, a considerable number of young Punjabi men sought their fortunes in the Australian colonies, working as hawkers and farm labor. While in Australia they experienced marginalization and high levels of racial vilification by the Anglo-Celtic settler community.
   Aims: To assess the frequency and nature of suicides of Punjabi workers in nineteenth century Australia. Materials and
   Methods: The paper draws on archival sources and contemporary newspaper reports.
   Results: A wide range of methods of suicides were observed, with drowning the preferred method.
   Conclusions: This article is the first to collate the data on the suicides and suicide attempts by young Punjabi men working in an immigration country. It can be shown that the suicide rate among Punjabi was almost six times higher than that of the host community.

ID AUSTRALIA; ENGLAND; TRENDS
AB Australia has a significantly higher suicide rate than England. Rather than accepting that this statistical fact' is a direct reflection of some positivist truth, this article begins with the premise that how suicide is counted depends upon what counts as suicide. This study involves semi-structured interviews with coroners both in Australia and England, as well as observations at inquests. Important differences between the two coronial systems include: first, quite different logics of operation; second, the burden of proof for reaching a finding of suicide is significantly higher in England; and, third, the presence of family members at English inquests results in far greater pressure being brought to bear upon coroners. These combined factors result in a reduced likelihood of English coroners reaching a finding of suicide. The conclusions are twofold. First, this research supports existing criticisms of comparative suicide statistics. Second, this research adds theoretical weight to criticisms of positivist analyses of social phenomena.

ID SOCIOLOGICAL LITERATURE; PSYCHOLOGICAL AUTOPSY; RISK-FACTOR; LATER LIFE;

AB ObjectiveThe relationship between older adult suicide rates and population-level variables has been examined in a few studies. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to analyse the extent to which population-level factors are associated with suicide by older persons in Australia, from an ecological perspective.
   MethodsSuicide rates for older adults aged 65years and over were calculated for 68 observation units at Statistical Areas Level 4 in Australia for 2002-2011. The 2011 Census of Population and Housing was used for population-level variables. Analysis on standardised suicide mortality ratios and Poisson regression were performed to examine geographical and gender differences.
   ResultsBetween 2002 and 2011, a total of 3133 suicides of persons aged 65years and above (men: n=2418, 77.1%) was identified with an average annual rate of 10.1 per 100000 persons. Suicide rates in older adults vary widely between different geographical regions in Australia. The multivariate estimates of contextual factors showed that the risk of suicide was positively associated with the sex ratio (incidence risk ratio (IRR)=1.053, 95%CI=1.016-1.092), the proportion of those in tenant household (IRR=1.120, 95%CI=1.081-1.160) and Australian residents born in North-West Europe (IRR=1.058, 95%CI=1.022-1.095). Significant gender variations were found.
   ConclusionsSpecific factors increasing risk of suicide for older adults on SA4 level in Australia were living in areas with a higher proportion of male population, a higher proportion of tenant household dwellers and a higher proportion of immigrants from North-West Europe. The different influences of population-level factor on suicide between older men and women indicate the need for targeted suicide prevention activities. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

   ENGLAND; DEPRESSION; MORTALITY; HEALTH
AB Background: Understanding the spatial distribution of suicide can inform the planning, implementation and evaluation of suicide prevention activity. This study explored spatial clusters of suicide in Australia, and investigated likely socio-demographic determinants of these clusters.
   Methods: National suicide and population data at a statistical local area (SLA) level were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the period of 1999 to 2003. Standardised mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated at the SLA level, and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques were applied to investigate the geographical distribution of suicides and detect clusters of high risk in Australia.
   Results: Male suicide incidence was relatively high in the northeast of Australia, and parts of the east coast, central and southeast inland, compared with the national average. Among the total male population and males aged 15 to 34, Mornington Shire had the whole or a part of primary high risk cluster for suicide, followed by the Bathurst-Melville area, one of the secondary clusters in the north coastal area of the Northern Territory. Other secondary clusters changed with the selection of cluster radius and age group. For males aged 35 to 54 years, only one cluster in the east of the country was identified. There was only one significant female suicide cluster near Melbourne while other SLAs had very few female suicide cases and were not identified as clusters. Male suicide clusters had a higher proportion of Indigenous population and lower median socio-economic index for area (SEIFA) than the national average, but their shapes changed with selection of maximum cluster radii setting.
   Conclusion: This study found high suicide risk clusters at the SLA level in Australia, which appeared to be associated with lower median socio-economic status and higher proportion of Indigenous population. Future suicide prevention programs should focus on these high risk areas.

AB This study aimed to investigate the factors associated with the choice of trains over other means of suicide. We performed a case-control study using data on all suicides in Victoria, Australia between 2009 and 2012. Cases were those who died by rail suicide and controls were those who died by suicide by any other means. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the association between the choice of trains and a range of individual level and neighbourhood-level factors. Individuals who were never married had double odds of using trains compared to individuals who were married. Those from areas with a higher proportion of people who travel to work by train also had greater odds of dying by railway suicide compared to those from areas with a relatively lower proportion of people who travel to work by train. Prevention efforts should consider limiting access to the railways and other evidence-based suicide prevention activities.

AB Gunshot deaths in children less than 17 years of age from Adelaide, SA, Australia (1969-2005) and from San Diego County, CA, United States (1988-2005) were compared. Forty-two pediatric gunshot fatalities occurred in South Australia (1.1 cases/year; M:F = 30:12). There were 6 accidents (14%), 14 suicides (33%), and 22 homicides (52%). In San Diego there were 185 cases (c.10 cases/year; M:F = 148:37). There were 6 accidents (3%), 42 suicides (23%), 130 homicides (70%), and 7 undetermined cases (4%). The incidence of homicide was significantly higher in San Diego County compared to Adelaide (p < 0.001), with a higher proportion of murder-suicides occurring in Adelaide. There were markedly more accidents and suicides involving males in Adelaide and a far higher number of male homicide victims in San Diego County compared to females. Rifles of 0.22-caliber were preferred weapons in South Australia, compared to handguns in San Diego County.

AB Studies of suicide epidemiology in regions of Australia have been conducted, but the spatial pattern in the whole country has not been fully investigated. This study aimed at visualizing the sex-specific suicide pattern over the country from 2004 to 2008, and studying the metropolitan-rural-remote differentials of suicide across all states/territories. We applied a Poisson hierarchical model to yield smoothed sex specific, age standardized mortality ratios of suicide in all postal areas, and compiled the age-standardized suicide rates across different levels of remoteness and different jurisdictions. We identified the area variation of suicide risk across states/territories, and metropolitan-rural-remote differential with rates higher in rural and remote areas for males. Spatial clusters of some high risk postal areas were also identified. Socio-economic deprivation, compositional factors, high risks for Indigenous people and low access to mental health service are the underlying explanations of the elevation of suicide risk in some areas. These findings suggest that it is important to take geographical variations in suicide risk into account in national policy making. Particular suicide prevention interventions might be targeted at males living in remote areas, and some localized areas in metropolitan zones. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID TRENDS
AB We reconsider conventional suicide measurement. First, a headcount of suicide is examined relative to some other causes of death (circulatory diseases, cancer, and motor vehicle accidents). We then construct a time-series data set of an alternative measure of suicide, the potential years of life lost (PYLL) for males and females. Suicide PYLLs average 4.57% of all male PYLLs and 2.44% of female PYLLs for 1907-2005. The comparable "count'' percentages are 1.85 and 0.65, respectively. These differences are widening through time. In 2005, suicide represented 3.25% of all male deaths and 0.90% of female deaths using the count measure and, using PYLLs, 11.0% and 4.96%, respectively. The two measures produce quite different indications of suicide.

AB This study aimed to explore determinants of increased suicide deaths among African youth in South Australia. The paper reports on the intersectionality between intergenerational conflicts and fatal suicides in the target population. The study employed a qualitative inquiry approach, studying 31 young people in the African community in Adelaide. Intergenerational conflicts were identified as pervasive, with negative implications for the affected individuals, their families, and the entire African community. These led to turmoil in the community, youth isolation, reduced social interactions, stress and fatal suicides. Intergenerational conflicts and the increased number of suicide deaths were identified as a significant, emerging public health issue within the African community in South Australia. A need to re-orient resources to develop and implement programs to address mental health problems and provide high quality, informed and culturally responsive services that support the community were identified as a priority.

   TRENDS
AB There is concern in Australia that droughts substantially increase the incidence of suicide in rural populations, particularly among male farmers and their families. We investigated this possibility for the state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia between 1970 and 2007, analyzing data on suicides with a previously established climatic drought index. Using a generalized additive model that controlled for season, region, and long-term suicide trends, we found an increased relative risk of suicide of 15% (95% confidence interval, 8%-22%) for rural males aged 30-49 y when the drought index rose from the first quartile to the third quartile. In contrast, the risk of suicide for rural females aged >30 y declined with increased values of the drought index. We also observed an increased risk of suicide in spring and early summer. In addition there was a smaller association during unusually warm months at any time of year. The spring suicide increase is well documented in nontropical locations, although its cause is unknown. The possible increased risk of suicide during drought in rural Australia warrants public health focus and concern, as does the annual, predictable increase seen each spring and early summer. Suicide is a complex phenomenon with many interacting social, environmental, and biological causal factors. The relationship between drought and suicide is best understood using a holistic framework. Climate change projections suggest increased frequency and severity of droughts in NSW, accompanied and exacerbated by rising temperatures. Elucidating the relationships between drought and mental health will help facilitate adaptation to climate change.

AB ObjectiveThis research aimed to assess the frequency and impact of client suicides on psychologists in Australia.
   MethodParticipants were 178 psychologists who completed an online self-report questionnaire concerning the frequency of occurrence and impact of client suicide.
   ResultFifty six (31.5%) participants reported one or more client suicides. Psychologists with more years of experience reported more client suicides. Participants who had experienced a client suicide reported a range of emotional, cognitive and behavioural reactions as well as professional impacts. Ratings of responsibility, preventability and predictability of a client suicide were associated with emotional and/or professional impacts. Beneficial coping responses included talking to supervisors and colleagues, recognising the psychologist is not responsible and having increased acceptance of a client suicide.
   ConclusionsThe findings have important implications for training, workplace practices and research.

AB In comparing Indigenous to non-Indigenous suicide in Australia, this study focussed on the frequency of the association between some psychiatric conditions, such as depression and alcohol abuse, and some aspect of suicidality, in particular communication of suicide intent. Logistic regression was implemented to analyze cases of Indigenous (n = 471) versus non-Indigenous suicides (n = 6,655), using the Queensland Suicide Register as a data source. Compared to non-Indigenous suicides, Indigenous cases had lower odds of being diagnosed with unipolar depression, seeking treatment for psychiatric conditions or leaving a suicide note. Indigenous suicides had greater odds of verbally communicating suicide intent and having a history of alcohol and substance use. The magnitude of these differences is remarkable, underscoring the need for culturally sensitive suicide prevention efforts.

AB Objective: To examine the frequency of suicides on holidays and special days of the year, specifically in Queensland, Australia.
   Methods: We analysed data from the Queensland Suicide Register between 1990 and 2009. The days examined were: Easter, Christmas, New Year, Valentine's Day and Anzac Day. We compared suicide cases on these days with the average counts for periods before and after the days.
   Results: There was a statistically significant increase in suicides on Christmas Eve and on New Year's Day. Our results are discussed in light of trends reported in the literature.
   Conclusion: The beginning and end of the festive season are times when special attention is warranted for those with a heightened risk of suicide.

AB Retrospective review of hanging suicides in individuals aged <= 17 years was undertaken at Forensic Science South Australia, Australia, over two 5-year periods: 1995-1999 and 2005-2009. Seven cases of hanging suicides were identified from 1995 to 1999, with a further 14 cases from 2005 to 2009, an increase of 100% (p < 0.001). Hanging accounted for 33.3% of all suicides in this age group (721) from 1995 to 1999, compared with 93.3% of the total number of suicides (1415) in the second 5-year period. In contrast, Australian national data from 1998 and 2008 showed a 30% decrease in hanging suicides in the young, from one case/100,000 population in 1998 to 0.7 in 2008. Cluster suicides occur in the young and are often initiated by direct communication. As it is possible that Internet-based social sites may facilitate this phenomenon, investigations should include an evaluation of the victim's Internet access given the potential risk of similar actions by peers.

TI Suicide, assisted suicide and euthanasia: International perspectives
SO IRISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE assisted suicide; euthanasia; international; suicide
AB Suicide, assisted suicide and euthanasia are elusive and controversial issues worldwide. To discuss such issues from only one perspective may be limiting. Therefore, this paper was written by authors from various regions, each of whom has been asked to reflect on the issues. The countries/cultures are: Australia, China, Cuba, Ireland, India, Japan, Russia, South Africa, The Netherlands, North America (Turtle Island) and United States. Historically and today, suicide is viewed differently. Assisted suicide and euthanasia are equally seen from multifarious perspectives. Highlighting development in the Netherlands, Australia's Northern Territory and Japan (ie. the famous Yamanouchi Case), the review shows growing re-examination of the right to die. There appear, however, to be no uniform legal and ethical positions. Further debate and discussion globally is needed to avoid myopic perspectives.

AB Objective: This paper summarises a report to the NHMRC the objectives of which were to review research into the epidemiology of youth suicide in Australia and identify gaps in research.
   Method: Literature searches were conducted. A limited amount of new data analysis was included to shed light on reliability issues of official Australian suicide data.
   Results: The review examined suicide data systems, including issues to do with coroners, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and alternative systems. The epidemiological areas reviewed included: all ages, youth, age and gender, geographical, socioeconomic, marital, indigenous, migrants, suicides in custody and gay and lesbian suicides.
   Conclusion: While much is known about the epidemiology of youth suicide, much remains to be clarified. Study of indigenous issues is perhaps the most neglected area; study of family issues may be potentially be the most productive.

TI Suicides in Australia following media reports of the death of Robin
   Williams
SO AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE Media; suicide; Robin Williams
ID GUIDELINES
AB Objective: This study assessed the extent to which local reporting of Robin Williams' suicide (on 11 August 2014) was associated with suicide in Australia. It followed several studies in the United States which showed that there were significant increases in suicide following media reports of Williams' death and that those media reports were less than optimal in terms of adherence to best-practice guidelines. In a previous study, we demonstrated that Australian media reports of Williams' suicide were largely adherent with our Mindframe guidelines on responsible reporting of suicide, so we speculated that there would be no increase in suicide following the reporting of Williams' suicide in Australia. Method: We extracted data on Australian suicides from the National Coroners Information System for the period 2001 to 2016. We conducted interrupted time series regression analyses to determine whether there were changes in suicides in the 5-month period immediately following Williams' suicide. Results: Our hypothesis that there would be no increase in suicides in Australia following Williams' highly publicised suicide was not supported. There was an 11% increase in suicides in the 5-month period following Williams' death, largely accounted for by men aged 30-64 and by people who died by hanging (the method Williams used). Conclusion: It may be that Australians were exposed to reports that contravened safe reporting recommendations, particularly via overseas media or social media, and/or that some Australian reports may have had unhelpful overarching narratives, despite largely adhering to the Mindframe guidelines. The Mindframe guidelines constitute international best practice but consideration should be given to whether certain recommendations within them should be further reinforced and whether more nuanced information about how stories should be framed could be provided. Future revision and augmentation of the Mindframe guidelines should, as always, involve media professionals.

TI In Support of a Decisional Paradigm for Assisted Dying
SO CRIMINAL LAW JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID SUICIDE
AB In May 2018, a centenarian travelled from Australia to Switzerland to end his life. He was not suffering from a terminal or incurable illness. The deceased travelled to Switzerland because that country permits self-determination of death, unconditional on it being consequential to palliative treatment for a terminal illness. Australia, like the United Kingdom and most developed nations, does not permit euthanasia and assisted suicide is criminal. This article examines the discretionary issues around criminal culpability for the journey of the deceased from Australia to Switzerland for the known purpose of suicide. We argue the allocation of prosecutorial discretion in cases of assisted suicide is contrary to public interest. We consider the decisional framework that informed the centenarian's decision. We explain why a decisional paradigm, rather than medical, moral or other structures, should inform law and policy regarding assisted dying and give developed nations, such as Australia, cause for reform.

ID HOMICIDE
AB This paper reports the findings of a study of murder-suicide in Australia. The study is based on the analysis of 188 events in four states of Australia spread over a period of 20 years from 1973 to 1992. This paper focuses on two types of murder-suicide-those events in which a male offender kills his female partner and those events in which a parent kills his or her child or children. The motivations of men and women who commit murder and then kill themselves are qualitatively different. The findings are discussed from a feminist perspective and it is argued that there is a need to combine psychological and sociological frameworks for a better understanding of murder followed by suicide.

AB Various temporal patterns of suicide events, according to time of day, day of week, month and season, have been identified. However, whether different dimensions of time interact has not been investigated. Using suicide data from Queensland, Australia, this study aims to verify if there is an interaction effect between seasonal and day-of-the-week distribution. Computerized suicide data from the Queensland Suicide Register for those aged 15+ years were analyzed according to date of death, age, sex and geographic location for the period 1996-2007. To examine seasonal differences in day-of-the-week pattern of suicide, Poisson regressions were used. A total of 6,555 suicides were recorded over the whole study period. Regardless of the season, male residents of Brisbane had a significantly marked day-of-the-week pattern of suicide, with higher rates between Mondays and Thursdays. When seasonal differences were considered, male residents in Brisbane showed a Monday peak in summer and a wave-shape pattern with a peak on Thursday and a nadir on Saturdays in winter. Whilst males have distinctive peaks in terms of days of the week for summer and winter, females do not show similar patterns.

AB Given the important role teachers play as gatekeepers in school suicide prevention, this study explored teachers' perspectives on what should be done to improve current suicide prevention efforts. The study, in Queensland, Australia, was part of a large-scale survey examining teachers' knowledge, attitudes and experience of suicidality. One hundred and fifteen teachers responded to an online survey question regarding their views on the requirements for school suicide prevention. Qualitative analysis identified five themes from teachers' responses: awareness and stigma reduction, support services for students, education and training, bullying and the role of social media. The results of this study provide some profound insights into teachers' perspectives on suicide and highlight the critical need for improved suicide prevention efforts in schools.

AB Seasonal variations in suicide were examined in a Caucasian population living relatively close to the equator. A spring/early summer peak, but no secondary autumn peak, was found for males. An autumn trough was found for females. No significant seasonal variation was found for rurality, distance from the equator, employment status, or methods of suicide. Post-mortem blood alcohol levels were higher in spring and summer, possibly reflecting socialization patterns. The modest associations are consistent with suggestion that climatic influences may produce greater variation in suicide rates where the climatic variation itself is greater. Copyright (C) 2000 S.

AB There has been no research on whether particularly vulnerable people such as the unemployed are prone to being in a suicide cluster (defined as an unusually high number of suicides occurring in a defined geographical area and/or over a relatively brief period of time). We investigated the presence of unemployed suicide clusters in Australia over the period 2001-2013 using a Poisson discrete scan statistic approach. Spatial, temporal and spatial/temporal clusters comprised 13.4, 4.4 and 1.7% of all unemployed suicides respectively. These results suggest the importance of targeting preventative efforts in where large numbers of unemployed persons who have died by suicide resided before death.

AB BackgroundWhether veterinarians have an elevated suicide rate compared with the general population is controversial.
   MethodsReported cases of suicide among veterinarians and veterinary nurses in Australia over the period 2001 to 2012 were investigated in a retrospective case-series study.
   ResultsThe standardised mortality ratio of veterinarians (n=18) was 1.92 (95% CI 1.14-3.03) and that of veterinary nurses (n=7) to the general population was 1.24 (95% CI 0.80-1.85). Overdosing on drugs (pentobarbitone) was the main method of suicide in these occupations.
   ConclusionThe reasons for veterinary suicides are likely to be multifactorial, including work- and life-related stressors, and individual characteristics. This research highlights the need for targeted suicide prevention and intervention for veterinarians.

AB Despite significant investment in mental health and suicide intervention strategies in Australia, the extent of change in suicide rates over the last decade is unclear. This paper analyses sex and age trajectories in suicide rates over the last decade in Australia. Age Standardized Suicide Rates from 2004 to 2013 were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and reflect rates of suicide per 100,000 within age and sex cohorts. Age-related suicide rates were consistent over the last decade. For both males and females, there were increases in mid-life suicide rates before declining around 55-65 years of age. However, rates of suicide in men increased in late-life with rates for those aged 70-79 comparable with those in mid-life. Rates amongst men aged 85+ were consistently the highest rates over the decade. Positively, there was decline in suicide rates among younger men aged 20-34 years. However, more consistently, for both sexes across most age cohorts, there were either increases or no change in suicide rate. Apart from declines in younger-adult males, analysis of age-standardized suicide rates indicate no improvement in suicide rates. High suicide rates amongst middle-aged and older males remain a significant public health issue that needs to be addressed. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

DT Article
ID TRENDS
AB Objective: To examine the changes in rates of methods of suicide in Australian states and territories between 1988 and 2007.
   Design and setting: Meta-analysis of suicide mortality rates and suicide methods (hanging, shooting, gassing, poisoning, jumping from a height, drowning, use of a sharp implement) for males and females in Australian states and territories in the decades 1988-1997 and 1998-2007.
   Main outcome measures: Changes in use of suicide methods from 1988 to 2007; changes in the overall suicide rates and in rates for each method of suicide in Australian states and territories between 1988-1997 and 1998-2007.
   Results: There was a decline in rates of shooting, gassing, poisoning and drowning in males and a decline in shooting, gassing, jumping from a heiight and drowning among females, but an increase in hanging by both males and females in the decade 1998-2007 when the compared to 1988-1997. There was significant variation in the rates of and trends in methods of suicide between the states and territories of Australia between 1988-1997 and 1998-2007.
   Conclusions: The decline in rates of suicide in most parts of Australia coincides with a reduction in the availability of lethal methods. Consideration should be given to further measures to limit the availability of lethal methods of suicide. MJA 2010; 192: 432-437

AB Previous research has shown for the most part positive correlations between intelligence and suicide prevalence on the national level. However, this study found proxies for regional intelligence in Australia (international average domain scores from the PISA 2000 study) to be significantly negatively correlated with the total, male, and female suicide rates of the different administrative divisions of Australia, and this finding was independent of regional wealth. A research synthesis of the current results and those from similar studies of other countries (positive correlations for Austria, Belarus, The British Isles, Denmark, and The Netherlands; inconclusive findings for France, Germany, and the USA) was conducted. This synthesis of research findings showed that positive ecological correlations of intelligence with suicide rate were more likely observed for nations with higher suicide rates and poorer general living conditions, whereas there was no relation with national IQ.

AB Background Observed reductions in firearm suicides in Australia have been linked to the 1997 national firearms agreement (NFA) introduced following the 1996 Port Arthur massacre. The NFA placed strong access restrictions on firearms. Aims To assess the impact of legislative restrictions on the incidence of firearm suicide in Queensland and explore alternative or contributory factors behind observed declines. Method The Queensland suicide register (QSR) provided detailed information on all male suicides in Queensland (1990-2004), with additional data for Australia (1968-2004) accessed from other official sources. Trends in suicide rates pre/post NFA, and in method selection, were assessed using negative binomial regressions. Changing method selection patterns were examined using a cohort analysis of 5 years of age classes for Australian males. Results The observed reduction in firearms suicides was initiated prior to the 1997 introduction of the NFA in Queensland and Australia, with a clear decline observed in Australian figures from 1988. No significant difference was found in the rate pre/post the introduction of the NFA in Queensland; however, a significant difference was found for Australian data, the quality of which is noticeably less satisfactory. A marked age-difference in method choice was observed through a cohort analysis demonstrating both time and age influences. Within sequential birth cohorts, rates of firearms suicides decreased in younger males but increased in hanging suicides; this trend was far less marked in older males. Conclusions The implemented restrictions may not be responsible for the observed reductions in firearms suicide. Data suggest that a change in social and cultural attitudes could have contributed to the shift in method preference.

TI Are young female suicides increasing? A comparison of sex-specific rates

AB Background: Australian mortality statistics suggest that young female suicides have increased since 2004 in comparison to young males, a pattern documented across other Western high-income countries. This may indicate a need for more targeted and multifaceted youth suicide prevention efforts. However, sex-based time trends are yet to be tested empirically within a comprehensive Australian sample. The aim of this study was to examine changes over time in sex-based rates and characteristics of all suicides among young people in Australia (2004-2014).
   Methods: National Coronial Information System and Australian Bureau of Statistics data provided annual suicide counts and rates for 10-24-year-olds in Australia (2004-2014), stratified by sex, age group, Indigenous status and methods. Negative binomial regressions estimated time trends in population-stratified rates, and multinomial logistic regressions estimated time trends by major suicide methods (i.e., hanging, drug poisoning).
   Results: Between 2004 and 2014, 3709 young Australians aged 10-24 years died by suicide. Whilst, overall, youth suicide rates did not increase significantly in Australia between 2004 and 2014, there was a significant increase in suicide rates for females (incident rate ratio [IRR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 1.06), but not males. Rates were consistently higher among Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander youth, males, and in older (20-24-years) as compared to younger (15-19 years) age groups. Overall, the odds of using hanging as a method of suicide increased over time among both males and females, whilst the odds of using drug-poisoning did not change over this period.
   Conclusions: We showed that suicide rates among young females, but not young males, increased over the study period. Patterns were observed in the use of major suicide methods with hanging the most frequently used method among both sexes and more likely among younger and Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander groups. Findings highlight the need to broaden current conceptualizations of youth suicide to one increasingly involving young females, and strengthen the case for a multifaceted prevention approach that capitalize on young females' greater help-seeking propensity.

AB Pesticides in Australia are tightly regulated but it is unknown how this may affect the distribution of misuse and self-harm across Australia, both spatially and within subgroups in the population. We performed an observational study to examine spatial differences in suicide/deliberate poisonings with pesticides in Australia. We examined Coronial inquest cases of self-harm by pesticide ingestion for the years 2001-2013 (n = 209). Coronial cases were older, more likely to be male, have lower SES status and live in outer regional areas as opposed to cities when compared to the general population. Case densities (cases/100,000 population) were lower in large capital cities and higher in agricultural areas: despite this half the cases occurred in major cities. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

TI Australia's 1996 gun law reforms: faster falls in firearm deaths,

SO INJURY PREVENTION
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: After a 1996 firearm massacre in Tasmania in which 35 people died, Australian governments united to remove semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns and rifles from civilian possession, as a key component of gun law reforms.
   Objective: To determine whether Australia's 1996 major gun law reforms were associated with changes in rates of mass firearm homicides, total firearm deaths, firearm homicides and firearm suicides, and whether there were any apparent method substitution effects for total homicides and suicides.
   Design: Observational study using official statistics. Negative binomial regression analysis of changes in firearm death rates and comparison of trends in pre-post gun law reform firearm-related mass killings.
   Setting: Australia, 1979-2003.
   Main outcome measures: Changes in trends of total firearm death rates, mass fatal shooting incidents, rates of firearm homicide, suicide and unintentional firearm deaths, and of total homicides and suicides per 100 000 population.
   Results: In the 18 years before the gun law reforms, there were 13 mass shootings in Australia, and none in the 10.5 years afterwards. Declines in firearm-related deaths before the law reforms accelerated after the reforms for total firearm deaths (p=0.04), firearm suicides (p=0.007) and firearm homicides (p=0.15), but not for the smallest category of unintentional firearm deaths, which increased. No evidence of substitution effect for suicides or homicides was observed. The rates per 100 000 of total firearm deaths, firearm homicides and firearm suicides all at least doubled their existing rates of decline after the revised gun laws.
   Conclusions: Australia's 1996 gun law reforms were followed by more than a decade free of fatal mass shootings, and accelerated declines in firearm deaths, particularly suicides. Total homicide rates followed the same pattern. Removing large numbers of rapid-firing firearms from civilians may be an effective way of reducing mass shootings, firearm homicides and firearm suicides.

AB A retrospective review of suicides occurring among Aboriginal people in the community in South Australia over a 5-year period was undertaken from January 2005 to December 2009. Twenty-eight cases were identified, consisting of 21 males (age range 16-44 years, mean 29.9 years) and 7 females (age range 23-45 years, mean 32.0 years). Deaths in all cases were caused by hanging (100%). Toxicological evaluation of blood revealed alcohol (39.3% of cases), cannabinoids (39.3%), benzodiazepines (10.7%), opiates (7.1%), antidepressants (7.1%), amphetamines (3.6%) and volatiles (3.6%). This study has demonstrated that the method of suicide overwhelmingly preferred by indigenous victims in South Australia is hanging. The precise reasons for this preference are uncertain, however, an indigenous person in South Australia presenting as a suicide where a method other than hanging has been used would be exceedingly uncommon, raising the possibility of alternative manners of death.

AB Objective: To examine birth cohort effects in New South Wales (NSW) suicide data (1865-1998).
   Method: Aggregate suicide data were examined after controlling for age and period using descriptive statistics and Poisson regression modelling. Three approaches were applied to address the non-identification of age, period and cohort in age-period-cohort (APC) models of suicide.
   Results: Apparent cohort effects in male and female suicide using a minimum constraints APC model of age, period and cohort were no longer present in female suicide when a surrogate period APC model was used, and were absent in both male and female suicide when identifiable cohort effects were isolated using a 'drift' adjusted approach to APC modelling.
   Conclusion: Increases in youth suicide rates in NSW occurring since the 1960s cannot be attributed to cohort effects, such as family influences on development. The causes of youth suicide are thus effects operating contemporaneously.

AB Rural versus urban rates of suicide in current patients of a large area mental health service in Australia were compared. Suicide deaths were identified from compulsory root cause analyses of deaths, 2003-2007. Age-standardized rates of suicide were calculated for rural versus urban mental health service and compared using variance of age-standardized rates with 95% confidence intervals. There were 44 suicides and the majority (62%) were rural. Only urban patients used jumping from heights as a method of suicide (4/17; p = 0.02). Rural patients had 2.7 times higher rates of suicide, similar to findings for rural versus urban community suicides and may reflect the underlying community rates, differences in mental health service delivery, or socioeconomic disadvantage.

LA English
DT Review
DE ageing; Australia; men; mental health; suicide
ID NEW-SOUTH-WALES; MENTAL-HEALTH; MORTALITY; RATES; URBAN; DIFFERENTIALS;
   QUEENSLAND; DROUGHT; REMOTE
AB Introduction: Suicide remains an important public health issue in Australia, responsible for around 2500 deaths each year. Although suicide only accounts for around 1.7% of total mortality in Australia per year, 75% of suicide deaths are in males. This article reviews the factors contributing to suicide in older rural males in Australia and then categorises the papers into themes for ease of explanation. Living with experiences of drought, dramatic weather change, lower employment opportunities, out-migration, changing family dynamics, ageism in the community, economic change and competitive labour markets, all add to the diverse experience for an older person who is ageing in a rural setting.
   Methods: A literature search was conducted in March 2015, using the terms 'elderly' and 'older males' and then combined with 'rural', 'suicide' and 'Australia', to investigate the amount of research that has been conducted on the factors relating to suicide in older rural Australian males.
   Results: Reviewed articles consisted of research using either quantitative or qualitative approaches, which investigated suicide in older Australians published between 1950 and 2014. With strict adherence to the selection criteria, articles (21 in total) were removed because they were a literature review; a narrative review; they focused predominantly on youth or suicide risk, suicidal ideation or suicide attempts; or they discussed reasons for living. This article discusses the researcher's recommendations for further research into employment transitions for older Australian males, and the need to review policy change for further intervention in the future.
   Conclusions: This article highlights factors that may cause older rural Australians to be placed at a higher risk of suicide than their urban-dwelling counterparts. With the impact of the changing economy, unpredictable climatic conditions and dynamic changes in rural Australian families, there is a need to highlight research that has been conducted in this area. Future research should focus on identification of misclassification of suicide deaths, investigation of the possible effect that retirement pathways may have on older Australian males, suicide prevention strategies, mental wellbeing and the risk of suicidal behaviour. This will ascertain any compounding or protective factors that could influence this current trend.

AB Background: As young Australian males are at a high risk of suicide, the identification of risk factors other than psychopathology is vital for the development of comprehensive suicide prevention measures.
   Aims: The study investigated whether there were differences in risk factors and pathways to suicide in young adult males from Queensland, Australia, with and without a diagnosable psychiatric disorder.
   Methods: A case-control, psychological autopsy method was applied using a control group of young males who had died suddenly from causes other than suicide.
   Results: Suicide cases without a psychiatric diagnosis more frequently displayed behaviours indicative of their suicidality (such as previous attempts, disposing of possessions and making statements of hopelessness) than controls without a diagnosis. Suicides without a diagnosis also displayed more 'difficult' personality traits, such as higher levels of neuroticism and aggression. They also experienced poorer quality of life and were significantly more likely than their controls to have experienced a recent separation from a spouse or partner.
   Conclusion: The results of this study confirmed the existence of several distinct characteristics of young males who die by suicide in the absence of any diagnosable psychiatric disorder.

AB ObjectivesSuicide among nursing home residents is a growing public health concern, currently lacking in empirical research. This study aims to describe the frequency and nature of suicide among nursing home residents in Australia.
   MethodsThis research comprised a national population-based retrospective analysis of suicide deaths among nursing home residents in Australia reported to the Coroner between July 2000 and December 2013. Cases were identified using the National Coronial Information System, and data collected from paper-based coroners' records on individual, incident, and organizational factors, as well as details of the medico-legal death investigation. Data analysis comprised univariate and bivariate descriptive statistical techniques; ecological analysis of incidence rates using population denominators; and comparison of age and sex of suicide cases to deaths from other causes using logistic regression.
   ResultsThe study identified 141 suicides among nursing home residents, occurring at a rate of 0.02 deaths per 100000 resident bed days. The ratio of deaths from suicide to deaths from any other cause was higher in males than females (OR=3.56, 95%CI=2.48-5.12, P=<0.001). Over half of the residents who died from suicide had a diagnosis of depression (n=93, 66.0%) and had resided in the nursing home for less than 12months (n=71, 50.3%). Common major life stressors identified in suicide cases included the following: health deterioration (n=112, 79.4%); isolation and loneliness (n=60, 42.6%); and maladjustment to nursing home life (n=42, 29.8%).
   ConclusionsThis research provides a foundational understanding of suicide among nursing home residents in Australia and contributes important new information to the international knowledge base.

TI Assessing the Impact of Suicide Exclusion Periods on Life Insurance
SO CRISIS-THE JOURNAL OF CRISIS INTERVENTION AND SUICIDE PREVENTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Australia; age-standardized mortality rate; life insurance;
   suicide-exclusion period; suicide rate
AB Background: We study the impact of suicide-exclusion periods, common in life insurance policies in Australia, on suicide and accidental death rates for life-insured individuals. If a life-insured individual dies by suicide during the period of suicide exclusion, commonly 13 months, the sum insured is not paid. Aims: We examine whether a suicide-exclusion period affects the timing of suicides. We also analyze whether accidental deaths are more prevalent during the suicide-exclusion period as life-insured individuals disguise their death by suicide. We assess the relationship between the insured sum and suicidal death rates. Methods: Crude and age-standardized rates of suicide, accidental death, and overall death, split by duration since the insured first bought their insurance policy, were computed. Results: There were significantly fewer suicides and no significant spike in the number of accidental deaths in the exclusion period for Australian life insurance data. More suicides, however, were detected for the first 2 years after the exclusion period. Higher insured sums are associated with higher rates of suicide. Conclusions: Adverse selection in Australian life insurance is exacerbated by including a suicide-exclusion period. Extension of the suicide-exclusion period to 3 years may prevent some "insurance-induced" suicides - a rationale for this conclusion is given.

AB A search was undertaken at Forensic Science South Australia (FSSA) for all cases of suicide registered in South Australia, Australia, over a 10-year period from January 2003 to December 2012. More recent data was not accessioned as not all contemporary cases may have been completed or formally registered. The data were compared to corresponding numbers on two national registers: the National Coronial Information System (NCIS) and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). A total of 2105 cases of suicide were registered at FSSA, with a death rate of 13.3/100,000 population. NCIS data were available from 2003 to 2010, with 1542 suicides recorded (12.3/100,000 population). ABS data were available from 2003 to 2011, with 1366 deaths coded as suicides (12.4/100,000 population). Significant differences were found between local data on suicides and related data accrued nationally from the same population, with only 67.8% of local drug overdoses recorded on the NCIS. Although this represents an Australian-based study the conclusions have global applications. Thus, given the likely accuracy of local data, reliance on smaller, community-specific datasets in any country/jurisdiction may be of far greater use in analyzing and monitoring such complex cases.

ID ECONOMIC COST; BEHAVIOR; IMPACT; DEATH
AB Suicide is the leading cause of death among Australians between 15 and 24 years of age. This study seeks to estimate the economic cost of youth suicide (15-24 years old) for Australia using 2014 as a reference year. The main outcome measure is monetized burden of youth suicide. Costs, in 2014 AU$, are measured and valued as direct costs, such as coronial inquiry, police, ambulance, and funeral expenses; indirect costs, such as lost economic productivity; and intangible costs, such as bereavement. In 2014, 307 young Australians lost their lives to suicide (82 females and 225 males). The average age at time of death was 20.4 years, representing an average loss of 62 years of life and close to 46 years of productive capacity. The average cost per youth suicide is valued at $2,884,426, including $9721 in direct costs, $2,788,245 as the value of lost productivity, and $86,460 as the cost of bereavement. The total economic loss of youth suicide in Australia is estimated at $22 billion a year (equivalent to US$ 17 billion), ranging from $20 to $25 billion. These findings can assist decision-makers understand the magnitude of adverse outcomes associated with youth suicide and the potential benefits to be achieved by investing in effective suicide prevention strategies.

ID NORTHERN-TERRITORY; WALES; MORTALITY; VIOLENCE; ENGLAND
AB Background: There has been a lack of investigation into the spatial distribution and clustering of suicide in Australia, where the population density is lower than many countries and varies dramatically among urban, rural and remote areas. This study aims to examine the spatial distribution of suicide at a Local Governmental Area (LGA) level and identify the LGAs with a high relative risk of suicide in Queensland, Australia, using geographical information system (GIS) techniques.
   Methods: Data on suicide and demographic variables in each LGA between 1999 and 2003 were acquired from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. An age standardised mortality (ASM) rate for suicide was calculated at the LGA level. GIS techniques were used to examine the geographical difference of suicide across different areas.
   Results: Far north and north-eastern Queensland (i.e., Cook and Mornington Shires) had the highest suicide incidence in both genders, while the south-western areas (i.e., Barcoo and Bauhinia Shires) had the lowest incidence in both genders. In different age groups (<= 24 years, 25 to 44 years, 45 to 64 years, and >= 65 years), ASM rates of suicide varied with gender at the LGA level. Mornington and six other LGAs with low socioeconomic status in the upper Southeast had significant spatial clusters of high suicide risk.
   Conclusions: There was a notable difference in ASM rates of suicide at the LGA level in Queensland. Some LGAs had significant spatial clusters of high suicide risk. The determinants of the geographical difference of suicide should be addressed in future research.

   PREVENTION; WALES; UK
AB Background: Globally, suicide accounts for 5.2% of deaths among persons aged 15 to 44 years and its incidence is rising. In Australia, suicide rates peaked in 1997 and have been declining since. A substantial part of that decline stems from a plunge in suicides by one particular method: asphyxiation by motor vehicle exhaust gas (MVEG). Although MVEG remains the second most common method of suicide in Australia, its incidence decreased by nearly 70% in the decade to 2006. The extent to which this phenomenon has been driven by national laws in 1986 and 1999 that lowered permissible levels of carbon monoxide (CO) emissions is unknown. The objective of this ecological study was to test the relationship by investigating whether areas of Australia with fewer noxious vehicles per capita experienced lower rates of MVEG suicide.
   Methods and Findings: We merged data on MVEG suicides in Australia (2001-06) with data on the number and age of vehicles in the national fleet, as well as socio-demographic data from the national census. Poisson regression was used to analyse the relationship between the incidence of suicide within two levels of geographical area-postcodes and statistical subdivisions (SSDs)-and the population density of pre-1986 and pre-1999 passenger vehicles in those areas. (There was a mean population of 8,302 persons per postcode in the study dataset and 87,413 persons per SSD.) The annual incidence of MVEG suicides nationwide decreased by 57% (from 2.6 per 100,000 in 2001 to 1.1 in 2006) during the study period; the population density of pre-1986 and pre-1999 vehicles decreased by 55% (from 14.2 per 100 persons in 2001 to 6.4 in 2006) and 26% (from 44.5 per 100 persons in 2001 to 32.9 in 2006), respectively. Area-level regression analysis showed that the suicide rates were significantly and positively correlated with the presence of older vehicles. A percentage point decrease in the population density of pre-1986 vehicles was associated with a 6% decrease (rate ratio [RR] = 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.08) in the incidence of MVEG suicide within postcode areas; a percentage point decrease in the population density of pre-1999 vehicles was associated with a 3% decrease (RR = 1.03; 95% CI 1.02-1.04) in the incidence of MVEG suicide.
   Conclusions: Areas of Australia with fewer vehicles predating stringent CO emission laws experience lower rates of MVEG suicide. Although those emission laws were introduced primarily for environmental reasons, countries that lack them may miss the benefits of a serendipitous suicide prevention strategy.

TI Suicide and attempted suicide among older adults in Western Australia
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID MENTAL-HEALTH-SERVICES; AGE; HOPELESSNESS; CARE
AB Background. Suicide rates are high in later life. Risk factors include male sex and depressive illness. This study investigated the relationship between suicidal behaviour and contact with mental health services among the elderly in Western Australia. Methods.
   Record linkage was used to obtain records of hospital admissions and mental health service contacts for all suicide attempts and deaths in the period 1980-95. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated for the elderly, general population and people with mental health service contacts. Cox regression was used to evaluated potential risk factors for elderly people who were in contact with mental health services.
   Results. People over 60 years of age accounted for 15 % of suicides and 4.6 % of attempted suicides. Suicide rates were 3.3 times higher in males and 4.4 times higher in females when compared to the general population of elderly people. For attempted suicide, the rate was 5.8 times higher in males and 6.6 times higher in females with prior contact with mental health services. Highest risk of suicide was found in patients with diagnoses of affective psychoses (RR = 3.7), adjustment reaction (RR = 3.2) or depressive disorder (RR = 2.8). The diagnosis of cancer was associated with decreased risk of suicide (RR = 3.6) and attempted suicide (RR = 1.9).
   Conclusions. Suicide rates are high among the elderly in Western Australia. Suicide is significantly associated with the diagnosis of mood disorder. Suicide attempts are less common, and are associated most strongly with mood and personality disorders. The decreased risk of self-harm behaviour among patients with cancer warrants further investigation.

AB Background: Restricting access to lethal means is a well-established strategy for suicide prevention. However, the hypothesis of subsequent method substitution remains difficult to verify. In the case of jumping from high places ('hotspots'), most studies have been unable to control for a potential shift in suicide locations. This investigation aims to evaluate the short-and long-term effect of safety barriers on Brisbane's Gateway Bridge and to examine whether there was substitution of suicide location.
   Methods: Data on suicide by jumping - between 1990 and 2012, in Brisbane, Australia were obtained from the Queensland Suicide Register. The effects of barrier installation at the Gateway Bridge were assessed through a natural experiment setting. Descriptive and Poisson regression analyses were used.
   Results: Of the 277 suicides by jumping in Brisbane that were identified, almost half (n = 126) occurred from the Gateway or Story Bridges. After the installation of barriers on the Gateway Bridge, in 1993, the number of suicides from this site dropped 53.0% in the period 1994-1997 (p = 0.041) and a further reduction was found in subsequent years. Analyses confirmed that there was no evidence of displacement to a neighbouring suicide hotspot (Story Bridge) or other locations.
   Conclusions: The safety barriers were effective in preventing suicide from the Gateway Bridge, and no evidence of substitution of location was found.

TI Media awards for responsible reporting of suicide: Experiences from
   Australia, Belgium and Denmark
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Media awards to encourage responsible reporting of suicide have been introduced in several countries, including Australia, Belgium and Denmark.
   Aims: This study aimed to examine the experiences of Australian, Belgian and Danish award recipients in preparing stories on suicide, and consider the impacts of the awards for these recipients and for media professionals more broadly.
   Method: We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with the majority (14 out of 15) of past recipients of the awards in the three countries of interest.
   Results: Media awards appear to show promise as a method of reinforcing national and international media guidelines on reporting suicide. The recipients of awards were proud to have had their achievements recognized in this way, and had developed a heightened awareness of the issues inherent in reporting suicide. Although relatively few had prepared subsequent stories on suicide, a number had been given opportunities to provide advice to other media professionals about how best to approach this sensitive topic. Recipients viewed the awards as an important means by which good quality reporting can be rewarded, and a springboard for raising community awareness about suicide.
   Conclusion: The experience from Australia, Belgium and Denmark suggests that media awards which recognize responsible reporting of suicide are extremely worthwhile.

AB Background: There has been increasing attention over the last decade on the issue of indigenous youth suicide. A number of studies have documented the high prevalence of suicide behavior and mortality in Australia and internationally. However, no studies have focused on documenting the correlates of suicide behavior for indigenous youth in Australia. Aims: To examine the prevalence of suicide ideation and attempt and the associated factors for a community(1) cohort of Koori(2) (Aboriginal) youth. Method: Data were obtained from the Victorian Aboriginal Health Service (VAHS) Young People's Project (YPP), a community initiated cross-sectional data set. In 1997/1998, self-reported data were collected for 172 Koori youth aged 12-26 years living in Melbourne, Australia. The data were analyzed to assess the prevalence of current suicide ideation and lifetime suicide attempt. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to identify closely associated social, emotional, behavioral, and cultural variables at baseline and Cox regression modeling was then used to identify associations between PCA components and suicide ideation and attempt. Results: Ideation and attempt were reported at 23.3% and 24.4%, respectively. PCA yielded five components: (1) emotional distress, (2) social distress A, (3) social distress B, (4) cultural connection, (5) behavioral. All were positively and independently associated with suicide ideation and attempt, while cultural connection showed a negative association. Conclusions: Suicide ideation and attempt were common in this cross-section of indigenous youth with an unfavorable profile for the emotional, social, cultural, and behavioral factors.

AB The population attributable risk (PAR) of mental disorders compared to indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) for attempted suicide was estimated for Australia. For mental disorders, the highest PAR% for attempted suicide was for anxiety disorders (males 28%; females 36%). For SES, the highest PAR% for attempted suicide in males was for occupation (males 31%; females 16%) and education level (males 19%; females 8%), following adjustment for age and mental disorders. The study results suggest that one third of suicide attempts in both males and females are attributable to anxiety disorders, the same proportion attributable to low educational or occupational status.

DE hanging; Indigenous health; remote health; suicide
AB Objective: The aim of the present study was to characterize suicide in the Northern Territory (NT) for the 6 year period 1 January 2001-31 December 2006.
   Method: Suicide death rates by area (Australia, NT), sex, and Indigenous status for the period of 2001-2006 were obtained from the National Coroners Information System through the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine. Population figures were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
   Results: For this period the suicide rate of NT (21.6 per 100 000) was double the national rate (11), and the rate for NT Indigenous people (36.7) was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than that of NT non-Indigenous people (14.7). There was a decline in the suicide rate for Australia of -8.6%; for NT, -6.3%; for NT non-Indigenous, -3.3%; and for NT Indigenous, -9.0%. The sex difference was significant (p < 0.001) for both Australia and the NT with male subjects having a higher suicide rate than female subjects. With respect to age group, some evidence suggested an earlier peak for NT Indigenous compared to NT non-Indigenous people. Hanging was more common in NT than in the rest of the country and accounted for 87% of Indigenous suicide.
   Conclusion: Suicide is more common in NT than in Australia generally, and more common in NT Indigenous than NT non-Indigenous people. There is evidence of a decline in suicide rates across the board.

AB Introduction: Given the impact of suicide on individuals, families and communities, particularly for rural, remote and Indigenous populations, the current study was undertaken to enhance understanding on this topic. Coroners' reports were identified as a rich data source, amenable to thematic summary to reveal key factors associated with suicide.
   Methods: Thematic analysis was undertaken of 411 coroners' reports of completed suicides across a 10 year period, occurring in the Northern Territory, Australia. Data were extracted numerically and qualitatively, categorised and tallied.
   Results: Key factors associated with suicide in order of frequency of identification by coroners were (i) alcohol and other drug abuse, (ii) conflict and relationship breakdown and (iii) mental illness and mental health concerns. Considerable differences were noted between Indigenous and non-Indigenous cases. In addition to numerical summaries, examples of coroners' comments are provided that underscore the relevance of these factors.
   Conclusion: An array of factors was associated with suicide and considerable variation was found between Indigenous and non-Indigenous cases. The relative importance of social and contextual factors is confirmed for people at risk of suicide in rural, remote and Indigenous populations. These findings suggest relative priorities for suicide prevention and postvention.

AB Gun control is the prototypical example of controlling the environment for the means of suicide, an effective public health approach to suicide prevention. Canada's Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1977 (Bill C-51) provides an excellent opportunity to illustrate the effects of legislative gun-control laws and the impact on suicide. The research in Canada supports the significant effect of C-51 in reducing suicides and firearm suicides, even if one controls for socioeconomic factors, although not equally for all ages. The young, a high-risk group, show the most significant decrease, without significant substitution of other methods (displacement). Studies on gun-control laws from New Zealand, the United States, and Australia support the Canadian findings. It is concluded that, although not equally applicable in all countries, gun control may well have significant applications in reducing suicide worldwide.

AB Forty-eight deaths occurring in prisons in South Australia were identified between January 1996 and December 2010, including 25 cases of suicide (mean age=37years; median age=34years; age range=24-70years). Most suicides were due to hanging (23/25; 92.0%) with victims using bedding, belts, or shoelaces attached to cell shelves, air vents, doors, or other accessible projections. There were no suicides attributed to drug overdose or sharp force injury. Over a third of all suicides (39.1%) occurred during the first month of confinement, with 26.1% of cases occurring within the first week. There was one suicide reported after 2years of imprisonment. Given that suicide in state prisons currently occurs at a rate approximately eight times that of the general South Australian community, it appears that the subset of incarcerated individuals represents a group in need of effective preventive strategies to enable more appropriate provisions of existing prisoner resources.

AB The impaired health of a person who has committed suicide is often suggested among the proximate causes of suicidal behaviour. The introduction in 1997 of multiple-cause-of-death coding by the Australian Bureau of Statistics provided an opportunity to examine health impairments recorded on the death certificates of suicides. Data for the quinquennium 1997-2001 revealed a high prevalence of mental and behavioural disorders, in particular among women and among young and adolescent suicides. Comparison of multiple causes of death attributed to those who died in accidents with those recorded as suicides revealed that of the chronic and terminal illnesses, HIV and cancer were probably the conditions likely to trigger suicidal action.

AB Purpose To investigate small-area variation in risks associated with suicide deaths across four regional communities in New South Wales, Australia, and to determine whether these areas have unique demographic and socioeconomic risk profiles that could inform targeted means restriction suicide prevention efforts.
   Methods Archival data on suicide mortality for all deaths in New South Wales, Australia, over the period 2006-2015 were geospatially attributed to four high-risk priority regions. Deaths in the four regions were compared to each other, and to NSW, on demographic factors, indicators of economic deprivation, and suicide means.
   Results Priority means restriction targets were identified for all sites. In Murrumbidgee, suicide deaths were significantly more likely to involve firearms and older males (p<0.001). The Central Coast had a greater proportion of overdose deaths (p<0.001), which were associated with being female and unemployed. Suicide deaths in Newcastle were associated with being younger (p=0.001) and involving 'jumping from a height' (p<0.001), while economic deprivation was a major risk for suicide death in Illawarra Shoalhaven (p<0.001).
   Conclusions Local regions were significantly differentiated from each other, and from the State, in terms of priority populations and means of suicide, demonstrating the need for locally based, targeted interventions. There were, however, also some risk constancies across all sites (males, hanging, economic deprivation), suggesting that prevention initiatives should, optimally, be delivered within multilevel models that target risk commonalities and provide tailored initiatives that address risk specific to a region.

AB Retrospective review of cases of suicide involving helium inhalation was undertaken at Forensic Science South Australia over a 25-year period from 1985 to 2009. No cases of helium-related suicides were identified in the first 15 years of the study, with one case between 2000 and 2004 and eight cases between 2005 and 2009. Australian data were also reviewed from 2001 to 2009 that showed 30 cases between January 2001 and June 2005, compared to 79 cases between July 2005 and December 2009, an increase of 163%. A review of Swedish data between 2001 and 2009 showed no cases between January 2001 and June 2005, compared to seven cases between July 2005 and December 2009. Thus, all three areas showed recent and striking increases in cases of suicide involving helium inhalation. Given the availability of helium and the recent promotion of this method of suicide, it is quite possible that this may represent a newly emerging trend in suicide deaths.

AB Background Farmers in Australia, in general, have poorer health outcomes, including higher rates of suicide.
   Aims To investigate risk and protective factors and attitudes towards suicide and help-seeking among farmers living and working in New South Wales and Queensland in Australia.
   Methods A qualitative study in which three farming sites were selected in each state to represent an area with a suicide rate equal to, below and above the state average. Focus groups were conducted with men and women separately.
   Results Focus groups involved 30 men and 33 women. Inductive thematic analysis showed three broad themes characterized responses: environment and society; community and relationships; and individual factors. There was considerable overlap and dynamic interaction between themes. A combination of individual factors, as well as social and environmental stressors, was described as most likely to increase risk of suicide death and reduce help-seeking. The vast majority of known farmer suicides described involved men and many of the issues discussed pertained specifically to male farmers. Participants found suicide as an act complex, intertwined with many factors, and hard to fathom. A common belief was that an individual must feel a complete lack of hope and perceive their situation vastly differently from others to contemplate suicide.
   Conclusions Future suicide prevention efforts for farmers should take a biopsycho-ecological approach. Physical, psychological and cultural isolation could be addressed with education and training programmes and public campaigns. These could also improve people's ability to recognize possible suicidality.

AB Purpose To study the incidence of suicide by homeless persons over a 20-year period, and identify demographic and clinical characteristics that distinguish these cases from those in non-homeless persons.
   Methods A comparative analysis of homeless and non-homeless persons who died by suicide between 1990 and 2009 in Queensland, Australia. Ninety-two persons (82 males and 10 females) were identified from the Queensland Suicide Register as being homeless at the time of death. Suicide rates were calculated for the second decade only due to the lack of population numbers of homeless persons in the first decade.
   Results Homeless persons had almost twice higher suicide rate than non-homeless counterparts. They were more often male, of young age, single/never married, non-Indigenous, unemployed, had at least one physical illness or other stressful life event prior to death, had drug and alcohol abuse problems, and also were more likely to have evidence for an untreated mental illness. Regression analysis showed that being unemployed, having a history of legal problems and not being diagnosed with mental illness were strongly associated with suicide among homeless persons.
   Conclusions This study is the first in Australia, and the second study internationally, to examine the characteristics of homeless people who died by suicide. Although based on a relatively small sample, the present work nonetheless carries practical implications for the development of targeted suicide prevention strategies in this peculiar population of individuals.

TI Application of Scan Statistics to Detect Suicide Clusters in Australia
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID REMOTE
AB Background: Suicide clustering occurs when multiple suicide incidents take place in a small area or/and within a short period of time. In spite of the multi-national research attention and particular efforts in preparing guidelines for tackling suicide clusters, the broader picture of epidemiology of suicide clustering remains unclear. This study aimed to develop techniques in using scan statistics to detect clusters, with the detection of suicide clusters in Australia as example.
   Methods and Findings: Scan statistics was applied to detect clusters among suicides occurring between 2004 and 2008. Manipulation of parameter settings and change of area for scan statistics were performed to remedy shortcomings in existing methods. In total, 243 suicides out of 10,176 (2.4%) were identified as belonging to 15 suicide clusters. These clusters were mainly located in the Northern Territory, the northern part of Western Australia, and the northern part of Queensland. Among the 15 clusters, 4 (26.7%) were detected by both national and state cluster detections, 8 (53.3%) were only detected by the state cluster detection, and 3 (20%) were only detected by the national cluster detection.
   Conclusions: These findings illustrate that the majority of spatial-temporal clusters of suicide were located in the inland northern areas, with socio-economic deprivation and higher proportions of indigenous people. Discrepancies between national and state/territory cluster detection by scan statistics were due to the contrast of the underlying suicide rates across states/territories. Performing both small-area and large-area analyses, and applying multiple parameter settings may yield the maximum benefits for exploring clusters.

AB Objectives: This paper aims to describe the epidemiology of suicide among males employed in driving occupations (road and rail) compared to other male occupations in Australia.
   Methods: Suicide cases among road and rail drivers were extracted from a national dataset of occupationally coded suicide cases for the period 2001 to 2010. Suicide rates per 100 000 were calculated and standardised using the Australian standard population (2001). Incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using Mantell Haenszel rates and compared to all employed suicide cases.
   Results: The majority of suicides in this occupational category occurred in truck drivers, followed by road and rail drivers. 98% of these suicides were among males; hence only males were included in further analyses. The age-standardised rate of male suicide among Road and Rail drivers over the period 2001 to 2010 was 22.6 per 100000(95% CI 19.2 to 25.9). The IRR of suicide in this occupational group compared to other male occupations was 1.42 (95% CI 1.26 to1.60).
   Conclusions: Suicide among Road and Rail drivers is higher than in the other male occupations. Suicide prevention initiatives addressing these risk factors, while also providing access to treatment for those at risk, are clearly needed.

AB This study aims to simultaneously examine individual- and community-level factors associated with railway suicide.
   We performed a case-control study in Victoria, Australia between 2001 and 2012. Data on cases of railway suicide were obtained from the National Coronial Information System (a database of coronial investigations). Controls were living individuals randomly selected from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia study, matching to cases on age groups, sex and year of exposures. A conditional logistic regression model was used to assess the individual-level and community-level influences on individual odds of railway suicide, controlling for socioeconomic status.
   Individual-level diagnosed mental illness increased railway suicide odds by six times [95 % confidence interval (CI) 4.5, 9.2]. Community-level factors such as living in an area with a presence of railway tracks [odds ratio (OR) 1.8, 95 % CI 1.2, 2.8], within a city (OR 3.2, 95 % CI 1.9, 5.4), and with a higher overall suicide rate (OR 1.02, 95 % CI 1.01, 1.04) were independently associated with greater individual odds of railway suicide compared to living in an area without a presence of railway tracks, outside a city, and with a relatively lower overall suicide rate.
   The effects of mental illness and high incidence of overall suicides are prominent, but not specific on railway suicide. The effects of presence of railway tracks and city residence suggest the importance of accessibility to the railways for individual risk of railway suicide. Prevention efforts should focus on vulnerable people live in areas with easy access to the railways.

AB Background: Suicide rates among those employed in male-dominated professions such as construction are elevated compared to other occupational groups. Thus far, past research has been mainly quantitative and has been unable to identify the complex range of risk and protective factors that surround these suicides.
   Methods: We used a national coronial database to qualitatively study work and non-work related influences on male suicide occurring in construction workers in Australia. We randomly selected 34 cases according to specific sampling framework. Thematic analysis was used to develop a coding structure on the basis of pre-existing theories in job stress research.
   Results: The following themes were established on the basis of mutual consensus: mental health issues prior to death, transient working experiences (i.e., the inability to obtain steady employment), workplace injury and chronic illness, work colleagues as a source of social support, financial and legal problems, relationship breakdown and child custody issues, and substance abuse.
   Conclusion: Work and non-work factors were often interrelated pressures prior to death. Suicide prevention for construction workers needs to take a systematic approach, addressing work-level factors as well as helping those at-risk of suicide

ID NEW-SOUTH-WALES; 1ST-GENERATION; ADOLESCENTS; IMMIGRANTS; PARENTS
AB Purpose Generally, due to limited availability of official statistics on the topic, little is known about suicide mortality in second-generation migrants. A recent study from Sweden showed that these people could be at a high suicide risk. In a generalised phenomenon, this aspect would represent an important issue in suicide prevention. This paper aims to report the profile of second-generation migrants who died by suicide and the suicide risk differentials of second-generation migrants with other Australians.
   Methods Official suicide data from 2001 to 2008 were linked with State/Territory registries to collect information about the birthplace of the deceased's parents to differentiate migration status (first, second or third-plus generation). The profile and suicide risk of second-generation migrants were compared with other generations by logistic and Poisson regression.
   Results Suicide in second-generation migrants accounted for 811 cases (14.6 %). These tended to be represented by younger subjects, more often never married, as compared to the other cases. Second-generation males aged 25-39 years tended to have a higher suicide risk than first-generation migrants, but the risk was lower when compared with the third-plus generation. Second-generation migrants aged 60+ tended to have a lower suicide risk than first-generation migrants.
   Conclusion In Australia, second-generation migrants are not at a higher suicide risk as compared to first-generation migrants or locals (third-plus-generation). In males aged 25-39, a lower suicide risk was found in second-generations as compared to Australian-born third generation, which may be explained by their more advantageous socioeconomic status and the flexibility and resources rendered by having grown up in a bicultural environment. The higher suicide rates found amongst older first-generation migrants require further examination.

TI Research Priorities in Suicide Prevention in Australia A Comparison of
   Current Research Efforts and Stakeholder-Identified Priorities

LA English
DT Article
DE suicide; prevention; research; priorities; Australia
ID MENTAL-HEALTH
AB This project sought to inform priority setting in Australian suicide prevention research, by empirically examining existing priorities and by seeking stakeholders' views on where future priorities might lie. Existing priorities were examined via reviews of Australian literature published and grants funded during the life of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy (1999-2006). Stakeholders' views of future priorities were elicited via a questionnaire administered to 11 groups comprising 231 individuals with an interest in suicide prevention. The study identified 263 journal articles and 36 grants. The journal articles most commonly reported on studies of descriptive epidemiology, while the grants tended to fund intervention studies. Both gave roughly equal weight to completed and attempted suicide, and gave little emphasis to studies of suicide methods. Young people were the most frequently-researched target group, with people with mental health problems and people who had attempted suicide or deliberately self-harmed also receiving attention. Stakeholders indicated that emphasis should be given to intervention studies, and that completed suicide and attempted suicide are both important. In terms of suicide method, they felt the focus should be on poisoning by drugs and hanging. They had mixed views about the target groups that should be afforded priority, although young people and people with mental health problems were frequently ranked highly. This paper presents a picture of the current focus with regard to suicide prevention research, identifying some areas where there are clear gaps and others where relatively greater efforts have been made. By combining this information with stakeholders' views of where future priorities should lie, the paper provides some guidance as to the shape a future suicide prevention research agenda for Australia should take. A strategic approach to suicide prevention research will help fill internationally-identified gaps in knowledge about what works and what doesn't work in suicide prevention.

TI Accuracy of official suicide mortality data in Queensland
SO AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY

DT Article
DE data quality; data reporting; evaluation research; suicide
ID AUSTRALIA; NEED
AB Objective: The purpose is to answer the following research question: are the time-series data published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for Queensland statistically the same as those of the Queensland Suicide Register?
   Method: This question was answered by first modelling statistically, for males and females, the time series suicide data from these two sources for the period of data availability, 1994 to 2007 (14 observations). Fitted values were then derived from the 'best fit' equations, after rigorous diagnostic testing. The outliers in these data sets were addressed with pulse dummy variables. Finally, by applying the Wald test to determine whether or not the fitted values are the same, we determined whether, for males and females, these two data sets are the same or different.
   Results: The study showed that the Queensland suicide rate, based on Queensland Suicide Register data, was greater than that based on Australian Bureau of Statistics data. Further statistical testing showed that the differences between the two data sets are statistically significant for 24 of the 28 pair-wise comparisons.
   Conclusions: The quality of Australia's official suicide data is affected by various practices in data collection. This study provides a unique test of the accuracy of published suicide data by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The Queensland Suicide Register's definition of suicide applies a more suicidological, or medical/health, conception of suicide, and applies different practices of coding suicide cases, timing of data collection processes, etc. The study shows that '`difference ' between the two data sets predominates, and is statistically significant; thus the extent of the under-reporting of suicide is not trivial. Given that official suicide data are used for many purposes, including policy evaluation of suicide prevention programmes, it is suggested that the system used in Queensland should be adopted by the rest of Australia too.

AB Objective: Grief reactions change over time. However, only a limited number of studies, and none in Australia, have analysed changes in individual grief reactions longitudinally. The aim is to examine changes in grief reactions, mental health and suicidality of close family members bereaved by suicide, 6, 12 and 24 months after their loss compared with those bereaved by other forms of sudden death, adjusting for confounding factors. Method: Participants were 142 adult family members bereaved by suicide and 63 by other sudden death, followed up at 6, 12 and 24 months in Queensland, Australia. The Grief Experience Questionnaire, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation were used as main outcomes. Mixed-effects linear and logistic regressions were utilized for statistical analyses. Results: There were significant differences in rejection, stigmatization, shame and responsibility between the suicide and sudden death bereaved over the 2-year period, after adjusting for potential confounding factors. Rejection, stigmatization, search for explanation, somatic reactions and symptoms of depression and anxiety (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale) declined significantly over time in both groups. Rejection and somatic reactions showed group-by-time interaction effects, with a decrease in the suicide bereaved and no change in the sudden death bereaved. Loss of social support and suicidal ideation did not show a group or time effect. Conclusion: Although our findings confirm that there are several common dimensions to experiencing a sudden death of a family member, several differences were found between the suicide and non-suicide sudden death bereaved including significantly higher levels of rejection, stigmatization, shame and responsibility remaining in the suicide compared to sudden death bereaved 2 years after their loss. These findings should be considered in clinical practice and when designing postvention services in Australia.

AB Background: There is evidence of heightened vulnerability to nonfatal suicidal behaviors among LGBT populations yet a paucity of studies into fatal behaviors. Aim: The specific aim of this article was to identify factors related to suicide in LGBT individuals in Australia. Method: The psychological autopsy (PA) method with a matched case-control study design was used. PA interviews were conducted with 27 next-of-kin of an LGBT person that had died by suicide. Three living LGBT controls per suicide case, matched by age and gender, were also interviewed. Results: The key factors relating to suicide in LGBT people were a lack of acceptance by family and self (reflected in higher internalized homophobia and shame), negative feelings about own sexuality/gender, and dissatisfaction with appearance. LGBT people who died by suicide also tended to go through coming out milestones 2 years earlier than controls. There was a higher prevalence of aggressive behaviors and a more predominant history of physical and sexual abuse. Additionally, there was greater incidence of depression and anxiety and alcohol and substance use disorders. Conclusion: Specific predictive factors for suicide in LGBT populations in Australia were identified, including significantly poorer mental health outcomes and more violence across an array of measures.

ID RISK-FACTORS; TRENDS; AGE; AVAILABILITY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MORTALITY;
   AUTOPSY; ACCESS; CHINA; WEST
AB Background: The gender ratio (male/female) of suicide rates greatly differs by country and by age group. These differences are accompanied by differences in the use of violent methods of suicide.
   Methods: The gender ratio of suicide rates and the methods used were calculated from the most recently available official electronic mortality data published by the four countries (two Eastern (Korea and Japan) and two Western (Australia and the United states) countries) and from the World Health Organization [WHO] mortality database. Suicide gender ratios based on 95% Confidence intervals (CIs) were used to compare the countries between age groups.
   Results: The gender ratio of suicide rates was higher in the United States (3.9) and Australia (3.3), where gender differences in suicide methods were more prominent, than in Korea (1.8) and Japan (2.7). In the United States and Australia, the gender ratios greatly increased in the elderly (age 70 years and over), with a higher use of firearms by men. The gender ratio of suicide rates was lowest (1.0) in the young (age 20-29) in Korea, where hanging was a more common method in women than in men.
   Limitations: The study does not consider the various other factors that may have influenced gender differences of suicide rate.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that differences in suicide methods play a role in determining the differences in the gender ratio of suicide rates between countries. Because suicide methods varied with gender, age, and country and may play a role in the suicide rates of each group, these parameters should be taken into account in the design of suicide prevention measures.

AB The objective of this study is to address the question: are those who leave suicide notes representative of the larger population of those who commit suicide? The method involves an analysis of a full population of suicides by residents of Queensland, Australia for the full year of 2004, with the information drawn from Coronial files. Our overall results suggest that, and in support of previous research, the population who leaves suicide notes are remarkably similar to those who do not. Differences are identified in four areas: first, and in contrast to prior research, females are less likely to leave a suicide note; second, and in support of previous research, Aboriginal Australians are less likely to leave suicide notes; third, and in support of some previous research, those who use gas as a method of suicide are more likely to leave notes, while those who use a vehicle or a train are less likely to leave notes; finally, our findings lend support to research which finds that those with a diagnosed mental illness are less likely to leave notes. The discussion addresses some of the reasons these disparities may have occurred, and continues the debate over the degree to which suicide notes give insight into the larger suicide population.

TI Declines in the Lethality of Suicide Attempts Explain the Decline in
   Suicide Deaths in Australia
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CHOKING GAME; EPIDEMIOLOGY; RATES
AB Background: To investigate the epidemiology of a steep decrease in the incidence of suicide deaths in Australia.
   Methods: National data on suicide deaths and deliberate self-harm for the period 1994-2007 were obtained from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. We calculated attempt and death rates for five major methods and the lethality of these methods. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate the size and significance of method-specific time-trends in attempts and lethality.
   Results: Hanging, motor vehicle exhaust and firearms were the most lethal methods, and together accounted for 72% of all deaths. The lethality of motor vehicle exhaust attempts decreased sharply (RR = 0.94 per year, 95% CI 0.93-0.95) while the motor vehicle exhaust attempt rate changed little; this combination of motor vehicle exhaust trends explained nearly half of the overall decline in suicide deaths. Hanging lethality also decreased sharply (RR = 0.96 per year, 95% CI 0.956-0.965) but large increases in hanging attempts negated the effect on death rates. Firearm lethality changed little while attempts decreased.
   Conclusion: Declines in the lethality of suicide attempts-especially attempts by motor vehicle exhaust and hanging-explain the remarkable decline in deaths by suicide in Australia since 1997.

TI Association between antidepressant prescribing and suicide in Australia,
   1991-2000: trend analysis
SO BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID DEPRESSION; RATES
AB Objective To examine die association between trends in antidepressant prescribing and suicide rates in Australia for 1991-2000.
   Design Analysis of databases of suicide and rates of antidepressant prescribing according to age and sex.
   Setting Australian Bureau of Statistics data, sales data from the Australian pharmaceutical industry, prescribing data in general practice.
   Subjects Men and women aged 15 years and over in 10 year age groups.
   Main outcome measures Trends in suicide rates and trends in antidepressant prescribing. Association measured by Spearman's rank correlations.
   Results While overall national rates of suicide did not fall significantly, incidence decreased in older men and women and increased in younger adults. In both men (r(s)=-0.91; P<0.01) and women (r(s)=-.0.76; P<0.05) the higher the exposure to antidepressants the larger the decline in rate of suicide.
   Conclusions Changes in suicide rates and exposure to antidepressants in Australia for 1991-2000 are significantly associated. This effect is most apparent in older age groups, in which rates of suicide decreased substantially in association with exposure to antidepressants. The increase in antidepressant prescribing may be a proxy marker for improved overall management of depression. If so, increased prescribing of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in general practice may have produced a quantifiable benefit in population mental health.

TI Legal Bans on Pro-Suicide Web Sites: An Early Retrospective from
   Australia
SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
AB There are worldwide concerns that pro-suicide web sites may trigger suicidal behaviors among vulnerable individuals. In 2006, Australia became the first country to criminalize such sites, sparking heated debate. Concerns were expressed that the law casts the criminal net too widely; inappropriately interferes with the autonomy of those who wish to die; and has jurisdictional limitations, with off-shore web sites remaining largely immune. Conversely, proponents point out that the law may limit access to domestic pro-suicide web sites, raise awareness of Internet-related suicide, mobilize community efforts to combat it, and serve as a powerful expression of societal norms about the promotion of suicidal behavior.

AB Australia has one of the largest multicultural populations in the world, with cultural and linguistic diversity (CALD) a defining feature. CALD populations have unique identities and experiences of mental health and suicide, with multicultural differences, trauma and experiences of discrimination and stigma pertinent to effective suicide prevention approaches. Very little is known however about suicide and suicidality among this population in Australia. This systematic review explored literature on suicidality and suicide prevention in CALD communities as a means of informing suicide prevention research, policy and practice in the Australian context. Five electronic databases (Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, Emcare, and CINAHL) were searched. Studies were included if they examined factors associated with suicidality or described suicide prevention initiatives in CALD populations, and were conducted in OECD countries. Study quality was assessed using the CASP qualitative checklist for qualitative studies and the Quality Assessment Tool for quantitative studies. Thematic analysis was used to identify key themes in the included studies. Eighteen studies met the criteria for inclusion, including ten qualitative and eight quantitative studies. No Australian studies were identified. Key themes included acculturation difficulties, stigma, the influence of social networks and family, heterogeneity of CALD populations, and suggested prevention strategies. The review found no Australian studies looking at suicidality or suicide prevention in CALD communities. It highlights the need for a greater focus across policy, research and evaluation on suicide prevention in Australian CALD communities.

   COMMUNITY; CONTAGION; BEHAVIOR
AB Background: A suicide cluster has been defined as a group of suicides that occur closer together in time and space than would normally be expected. We aimed to examine the extent to which suicide clusters exist among young people and adults in Australia and to determine whether differences exist between cluster and non-cluster suicides.
   Methods: Suicide data were obtained from the National Coronial Information System for the period 2010 and 2012. Data on date of death, postcode, age at the time of death, sex, suicide method, ICD-10 code for cause of death, marital status, employment status, and aboriginality were retrieved. We examined the presence of spatial clusters separately for youth suicides and adult suicides using the Scan statistic. Pearson's chi-square was used to compare the characteristics of cluster suicides with non-cluster suicides.
   Results: We identified 12 spatial clusters between 2010 and 2012. Five occurred among young people (n = 53, representing 5.6% [53/940] of youth suicides) and seven occurred among adults (n = 137, representing 2.3% [137/5939] of adult suicides). Clusters ranged in size from three to 21 for youth and from three to 31 for adults. When compared to adults, suicides by young people were significantly more likely to occur as part of a cluster (difference = 3.3%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.8 to 4.8, p < 0.0001). Suicides by people with an Indigenous background were also significantly more likely to occur in a cluster than suicide by non-Indigenous people and this was the case among both young people and adults.
   Conclusions: Suicide clusters have a significant negative impact on the communities in which they occur. As a result it is important to find effective ways of managing and containing suicide clusters. To date there is limited evidence for the effectiveness of those strategies typically employed, in particular in Indigenous settings, and developing this evidence base needs to be a future priority. Future research that examines in more depth the socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with suicide clusters is also warranted in order that appropriate interventions can be developed.

TI Best strategies for reducing the suicide rate in Australia
SO AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE Population preventable fraction; risk ratio; suicide; suicide prevention
ID PREVENTION STRATEGIES; SELF-HARM; INTERVENTIONS; PROGRAM
AB Objectives: There is accumulating evidence about effectiveness of a number of suicide prevention interventions, and a multilevel systems approach seems promising in reducing suicide risk. This approach requires that components ranging from individual-level to public health interventions are implemented simultaneously in a localised region. This paper presents estimated reductive effects on suicide attempts and deaths that might be expected in Australia if active components of the systems approach were to be implemented.
   Method: The study estimated population preventable fractions which indicate the extent to which suicide attempts and deaths might be decreased if the each of the proposed interventions was fully implemented. The population preventable fractions were based on the best available evidence available in the literature for the risk ratio for each intervention. Prevalence estimates were assessed for each component of the proposed systems approach: reducing access to suicide means, media guidelines, public health campaigns, gatekeeper programmes, school programmes, general practitioner training, psychotherapy and co-ordinated/assertive aftercare.
   Results: There was insufficient evidence available for the impact of a number of strategies, including frontline staff gatekeeper training, on either suicide attempts or deaths. Taking prevalence of exposure to the intervention into consideration, the strategies likely to bring about the strongest reduction in suicide attempts were psychosocial treatments and co-ordinated/assertive aftercare. The greatest impact on reductions in suicide deaths was found for psychosocial treatment, general practitioner training, gatekeeper training and reducing access to means of suicide.
   Conclusion: The evidence regarding the overall efficacy of the systems approach is important in identifying what strategies should be prioritised to achieve the biggest impact. The findings of the population preventable fraction calculations indicate that the systems approach could lead to significant reduction in suicide attempts and suicide deaths in Australia. Potential synergistic effects between strategies included in the approach could further increase the impact of implemented strategies.

SO AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY

DT Article
DE Australia; cohort effects; period effects; suicide; youth
ID MORTALITY-RATES; PERIOD; AGE
AB Objective: This paper examines trends in the rate of suicide among young Australians aged 15-24 years from 1964 to 1997 and presents an age-period-cohort analysis of these trends.
   Method: Study design consisted of an age-period-cohort analysis of suicide mortality in Australian youth aged between 15 and 24 for the years 1964-1997 inclusive. Data sources were Australian Bureau of Statistics data on: numbers of deaths due to suicide by gender and age at death; and population at risk in each of eight birth cohorts (1940-1944, 1945-1949, 1950-1954, 1955-1959, 1960-1964, 1965-1969, 1970-1974, and 1975-1979). Main outcome measures were population rates of deaths among males and females in each birth cohort attributed to suicide in each year 1964-1997.
   Results: The rate of suicide deaths among Australian males aged 15-24 years increased from 8.7 per 100 000 in 1964 to 30.9 per 100 000 in 1997, with the rate among females changing little over the period, from 5.2 per 100 000 in 1964 to 7.1 per 100 000 in 1997. While the rate of deaths attributed to suicide increased over the birth cohorts, analyses revealed that these increases were largely due to period effects, with suicide twice as likely among those aged 15-24 years in 1985-1997 than between 1964 and 1969.
   Conclusions: The rate of youth suicide in Australia has increased since 1964, particularly among males. This increase can largely be attributed to period effects rather than to a cohort effect and has been paralleled by an increased rate of youth suicides internationally and by an increase in other psychosocial problems including psychiatric illness, criminal offending and substance use disorders.

ID CATALYTIC-CONVERTERS; PREVENTION; IMPACT
AB Objective: To compare secular trends in method-specific suicide rates among young people in Australia and England & Wales between 1968 and 1997.
   Methods: Australian data were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and for England & Wales from the Office for National Statistics. Overall and method-specific suicide rates for 15-34 year old males and females were calculated using ICD codes E950-9 and E980-9 except E988.8.
   Results: In both settings, suicide rates have almost doubled in young males over the past 30 years (from 16.8 to 32.9 per 100,000 in Australia and from 10.1 to 19.0 in England & Wales). Overall rates have changed little in young females. In both sexes and in both settings there have been substantial increases in suicide by hanging (5-7 fold increase in Australia and four-fold increase in England & Wales). There have also been smaller increases in gassing in the 1980s and '90s. In females, the impact of these increases on overall rates has been offset by a decline in drug overdose, the most common method in females.
   Conclusions: Rates of male suicide have increased substantially in both settings in recent years, and hanging has become an increasingly common method of suicide. The similarity in observed trends in both settings supports the view that such changes may have common causes. Research should focus on understanding why hanging has increased in popularity and what measures may be taken to diminish it.

AB Doubt about the reliability of official suicide statistics has been noted for over 200 years. Confounding issues include State or religious sanctions; there may be insurance considerations; there is family and community sensitivity about the recording of suicide; different professions are entrusted with the delineation of suicide; and there are differences between clinical and legal definitions of suicide. Systematic studies suggest that official figures provide a valid basis for broad comparisons, but that does not negate the importance of ensuring that suicide data are robust and reliable.

AB Suicide is a prominent public health issue in rural Australia and specifically in Tasmania, which has one of the highest suicide rates in the country. The Community Response to Eliminating Suicide (CORES) program was developed in rural Tasmania in response to a significant number of suicides over a short period of time. CORES is unique in that it is both a community-based and gatekeeper education model. CORES aims to build and empower communities to take ownership of suicide prevention strategies. It also aims to increase the individual community member's interpersonal skills and awareness of suicide risks, while building peer support and awareness of suicide prevention support services within the community itself. Pre- and post-test surveys after the CORES 1-day suicide awareness and intervention program (SAIP) showed significant increases in levels of comfort and confidence in discussing suicide with those who may be contemplating that action. CORES builds community capital through establishing new connections within communities. Establishment of local executive groups, funding and SAIP are key activities of successful CORES programs in communities around Australia. Over half of the initial leaders are still actively involved after a decade, which reflects positively on the quality and outcomes of the program. This study supports CORES as a beneficial and feasible community-based suicide intervention program for rural communities.

AB To investigate the role of cultural and economic factors on suicide attitudes and stigma toward suicide, we recruited 230 Australian adults for an online survey, assessing demographic characteristics (including ethnicity and socioeconomic status, SES), suicide attitudes, stigma toward people who die by suicide, and public knowledge of suicide prevention (suicide literacy). Regression analyses indicated that participants affiliated with non-Anglo cultures or with higher SES had higher suicide stigma and lower suicide literacy than Anglo participants and those in lower SES areas. Increased stigma in minority cultural groups may impact help-seeking behaviors that protect against suicide.

ID DEATH; AUSTRALIA; MORTALITY; AUTOPSY
AB All available data suggest that, like many other Indigenous peoples, Australian Aborigines are significantly more likely to kill themselves than are non-Aboriginal Australians. This statistical disparity is normally positioned an objective, ontological and undeniable social fact, a fact best explained as a function of endemic community disadvantage and disenfranchisement. This research explores the possibility that higher-than-normal Aboriginal suicide rates may also be a function of coronial decision-making practices. Based upon in-depth interviews with 32 coroners from across Australia, the following conclusions emerged from the data. First, coroners have differing perceptions of Indigenous capacity, and are less likely to have concerns about intent when the suicide is committed by an Indigenous person. Second, coroners have identified divergent scripts of Indigenous suicide, particularly its spontaneity and public location, and this supports rather than challenges, a finding of suicide. Third, the coronial perception of Indigenous life is a factor which influences a suicide determination for Indigenous deaths. Finally, the low level of Indigenous engagement with the coronial system, and the unlikelihood of a challenge to the finding of suicide by Indigenous families, means that a coronial determination of suicide is more likely.

This article focuses on the data relevant to the development of the suicide research agenda. This study was conducted using Delphi consensus method with two rounds of online questionnaires. A total of 138 and 86 participants, respectively, completed the first and second rounds of survey. Participants were policy makers, service providers, academics, service users, and carer advocates in Australia with expertise in mental health and/or suicide among people from immigrant and refugee backgrounds. Of the total 268 research questions included in the questionnaires, 70 questions about suicide were ranked as essential by over 50% respondents (i.e., the set level of consensus). In particular, research questions regarded as the greatest priority related to access and engagement with suicide prevention services, suicide protective and risk factors compared to populations not from immigrant and refugee backgrounds, and culturally appropriate assessment of suicide risk.

AB Background: A number of studies have examined the associations of suicide with meteorological variables (MVs) and socioeconomic status but the results are inconsistent. This study assessed whether MVs and unemployment were associated with suicide in eight Australian capital cities.
   Methods: Data on suicide, population and unemployment rate (UER) between 1985 and 2005 were from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. MVs was provided by Australian Bureau of Meteorology. A generalized linear regression model with Poisson link was applied to explore the association of suicide with MVs and UER.
   Results: Temperature difference (Delta T, the difference in mean temperature between current month and previous one month) was positively associated with suicide in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Hobart. There was also a significant and positive association between UER and suicide in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. MVs had more significant associations with violent suicide than that of non-violent suicide. There were no consistent associations between other MVs and suicide. A significant interaction between Delta T and UER on suicide was found in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, such that increased temperature amplified the magnitude of the association between UER and suicide.
   Conclusions: Delta T and UER appeared to jointly influence the occurrence of suicide in Australian capital cities. This finding may have implications for developing effective suicide prevention strategies.

AB In Australia from 1997 to 2006, there were 23,254 suicides recorded, with suicide being the 14th leading category of death in 2008. Of 2191 deaths in that year there were 1151 hangings (53% of cases), 506 poisonings (23%), 170 firearm deaths (8%), 121 falls from heights (6%), 45 drownings and submersions (2%), 43 deaths due to intentional contact with sharp objects (2%), and 155 deaths due to other methods (7%). However, the interpretation of data is not always straightforward. For example, problems arise in comparing Australian data with that from overseas due to different systems for reporting, gathering and classifying cases. Research that relies on national, international and/or large city suicide data may obscure specific local issues and trends, and care should be exercised when interpreting suicide data over particular time periods, as the number of 'open' coronial cases at the time of annual data collection may alter the number of suicide deaths reported yearly by central authorities. The conduct and quality of autopsies in different countries is also variable. Thus, when data are analysed and apparent trends discerned these issues should be born in mind.

AB Objective: This study explores the spatiotemporal variations of suicide across Australia from 1986 to 2005, discusses the reasons for dynamic changes, and considers future suicide research and prevention strategies.
   Design: Suicide (1986-2005) and population data were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. A series of analyses were conducted to examine the suicide pattern by sex, method and age group over time and geography.
   Results: Differences in suicide rates across sex, age groups and suicide methods were found across geographical areas. Male suicides were mainly completed by hanging, firearms, gases and self-poisoning. Female suicides were primarily completed by hanging and self-poisoning. Suicide rates were higher in rural areas than in urban areas (capital cities and regional centres). Suicide rates by firearms were higher in rural areas than in urban areas, while the pattern for self-poisoning showed the reverse trend. Suicide rates had relatively stable trend for the total population and those aged between 15 and 54, while suicide decreased among 55 years and over during the study period. There was a decrease in suicides by firearms during the study period especially after 1996 when a new firearm control law was implemented, while suicide by hanging continued to increase. Areas with a high proportion of indigenous population (eg, northwest of Queensland and top north of the Northern Territory) had shown a substantial increase in suicide incidence after 1995.
   Conclusions: Suicide rates varied over time and space and across sexes, age groups and suicide methods. This study provides detailed patterns of suicide to inform suicide control and prevention strategies for specific subgroups and areas of high and increased risk.

AB With rapid developments in life-prolonging technologies and increases in average life expectancy, euthanasia has become an increasingly topical issue. This paper contributes to the euthanasia debate an analysis of Australian attitudes to assisted suicide, active non-voluntary as well as passive non-voluntary euthanasia. Between 1993 and 2002, Australians supported access to voluntary euthanasia of the terminally ill, but had reservations when death was not imminent. The age of patients was relatively unimportant in these considerations. Non-voluntary euthanasia of babies and adults received widespread approval only when particular situations could be defined as 'letting die' rather than 'killing'.

AB Objective: To examine coroner's reports of completed suicide in Tasmania with the intention of characterizing the influence of gender and other factors.
   Method: One hundred coroner's reports from Tasmania 2010-2012 were examined and basic demographic details (age, gender), suicide method, medical, psychiatric, psychosocial and drug factors were collected. Data were organized using the Operationalized Predicament of Suicide tool and known risk factors, and analysed using SPSS software.
   Results: We found an overall male:female ratio of 3:1. When acute mental disorder was identified, the male:female ratio was 1:1. When a history of mental disorder is considered, the ratio becomes 1.44:1. When social/environmental factors triggered the event this changed greatly to 5.57:1.
   Conclusion: Males suicide more frequently than females; but this difference disappears when only those with mental disorder at the time of death are considered, and almost disappears when a history of mental disorder are considered. Higher suicide rates of males are driven by social/environmental stressors. These results have implications for understanding the key drivers of suicide, and developing appropriate preventative strategies.

AB Background: Suicide rates are higher in rural and remote areas of Australia compared with major cities.Aim: To evaluate the impact of a brief, community-based suicide prevention educational intervention on the attitudes and confidence of rural South Australian health and human service professionals. Method: Participants attended a 1-day suicide prevention education program, and completed a survey at four time points: baseline (T1), immediately pretraining (T2), immediately posttraining (T3), and 4-month follow-up (T4). Main outcome measures were self-reported attitudes and confidence when working with people vulnerable to suicide. Results: A total of 248 people attended the training, with 213 participants completing the survey at T1, 236 at T2, 215 at T3, and 172 at T4. There were significant improvements in 11 of the 14 attitude items between T2 and T3 (immediate change), and between T1 and T4 (maintained change). Further, there were significant improvements in all four confidence items between T2 and T3, and T1 and T4. Limitations: Despite the repeated-measures design, findings are limited by the lack of a control group. Conclusion: Findings extend the international evidence by indicating the value of brief suicide prevention education for improving health and human service professionals' attitudes and confidence in rural Australia.

AB Introduction: Farmers constitute an occupation group at a heightened suicide risk compared to the general population. To date, research has tried to explain this peculiarity by identifying suicide risk factors that are common to the whole of the farming population. There are, however, indications that risk factors may be different for different sub-populations of farmers, such as younger/older farmers or farm managers/farm labourers. This study compared the characteristics of suicides by farm managers and farm labourers, while controlling for the effect of age.
   Methods: A review of two datasets, the Queensland Suicide Register and the National Coroners Information System, was conducted in which a total of 78 cases of farm managers and 69 cases of farm labourers were identified as a suicide during 20002009, Queensland, Australia. The main outcome measures included various demographic characteristics, circumstances related to death, health and mental health variables, and history of stressful life events.
   Results: The two groups differed in marital status, living arrangements, ethnicity, physical and mental illness, alcohol and drug abuse, contact with a health professional prior to death, and specific life events such as relationship breakdown and recent/pending unemployment. The majority of these differences were not statistically significant once age was accounted for. However, differences in psychiatric variables and experience of a recent/pending unemployment remained significant.
   Conclusions: This study contributes towards better understanding of suicide among farmers in different job positions, and highlights the need for tailored suicide prevention initiatives that consider a combination of age-and job-specific suicide risk and protective factors among farmers.

AB Background: This study investigates the associations between railway suicide and neighborhood social, economic, and physical determinants using postcode level data It also examines whether the associations are influenced by having high concentration of high risk individuals in a neighborhood area.
   Methods: Railway suicide cases from Victoria, Australia for the period of 2001-2012, their age, sex, year of death, usual residential address and suicide location were obtained from the National Coronial Information System. Univariate negative binomial regression models were used to estimate the association between railway suicide and neighborhood level social, economic and physical factors. Variables which were significant in these univariate models were then assessed in a multivariate model, controlling for age and sex of the deceased and other known confounders.
   Results: Findings from the multivariate analysis indicate that an elevated rate of railway suicide was strongly associated with neighborhood exposure of higher number of railway stations (IRR=1.30 95% CI=1.16-1.46). Other significant neighborhood risk factors included patronage volume (IRR=1.06, 95% CI=1.02-1.11) and train frequency (IRR=1.02, 95% CI=1.01-1.04). An increased number of video surveillance systems at railway stations and carparks was significantly associated with a modest reduction in railway suicide risk (IRR=0.93, 95% CI=0.88-0.98). These associations were independent of concentration of high-risk individuals.
   Limitations: Railway suicide may be under-reported in Australia.
   Conclusions: Interventions to prevent railway suicide should target vulnerable individuals residing in areas characterized by high station density, patronage volume and train frequency. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   IMPACT; AVAILABILITY; GENDER; ACCESS; RISK
AB Objectives: To (a) quantify the lethality of suicide methods used in Australia in the period 1 July 1993 to 30 June 2003, (b) examine method-specific case fatality by age and sex, and (c) identify changes in case fatality during the study period.
   Methods: Two sources of data on episodes of self-harm in Australia were used, mortality and hospital separation data. Double counting of cases recorded in both sources was controlled by omitting fatal hospital cases from estimates of episodes of self-harm.
   Results: Overall case fatality was 12%. For each suicide method, case fatality was higher in males and older age groups. Firearms were the most lethal suicide means (90%) followed by hanging (83%). Rates of suicide involving firearms declined over time, and those involving hanging rose. Case fatality for firearm cases changed little over time, but declined for self-harm by hanging/suffocation, poisoning, sharp objects, and crashing a motor vehicle.
   Conclusions: This study (Australia) and two others (USA) show differences in method-specific lethality by gender and age. This study adds the finding of changes in lethality over time. Understanding of suicidality in populations, on which prevention efforts depend, requires explanation of these findings.

AB The aim of this study was to examine (1) suicide trends by most prevalent methods in Queensland, Australia, during 2000-2015, and (2) characteristics of people by choice of suicide method in 2000-2013. Data were obtained from the Queensland Suicide Register, which includes police and toxicology reports, post-mortem autopsy and Coroner's findings. Poisson and Joinpoint regression were used to study the first aim, and univariate and multi-variate logistic regression analyses were applied to investigate the second aim. Suicide method trends showed a significant increase in hanging for both sexes and poisoning with drugs for females, while there was a decline for poisoning by other means for both sexes, and 'other methods' decreased for males. Changes in the trends have altered the order of suicide methods, especially in males. Analyses of 8140 suicides were composed by the choice of method, distinguishable profiles by their demographic, clinical and social characteristics, such as having mental or physical illness or different recent life stressors were identified. This suggests that socio-cultural acceptability, and availability are the key drivers in the choice of suicide methods. Continuing increases in hanging is a big challenge in suicide prevention due to its lethality, easy realisation and its increasing acceptability.

TI Deaths in private and public prisons in Australia: A comparative
   analysis
SO AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Public opinion in Australia has been divided on the question of whether private prisons are welcome and one of the issues in dispute has been the question of whether or not private prisons are associated with proportionately more or fewer deaths of prisoners, particularly suicides, than public prisons. The available evidence is examined, and when the number of deaths, or suicides, per 1000 prisoner years served for all private and public prisons are calculated it is found that the rate for all deaths is significantly lower in private prisons at the 0.05 level of confidence. However, the difference in the suicide rates is not statistically significant. The lower overall death rate is particularly surprising as private prisons in Australia hold proportionately more unconvicted remandees, who are at higher risk, than public prisons. A close examination of the data for three relatively new remand and reception prisons, two private and one public, shows that all have much higher rates for both all deaths and for suicides than the national averages.

AB Motor vehicle exhaust gas suicide (MVEGS) is the second most frequent method of suicide in Victoria, Australia. It is a highly lethal method of suicide with 1.5 deaths for every hospital admission. Australian regulations require all vehicles manufactured since 1998 to have a maximum carbon monoxide exhaust emission level of 2.1 g/km, reduced from the previous level of 9.6 g/km. Information surrounding all Victorian MVEGS between 1998-2002 was analyzed to determine whether suicides occurred in vehicles with the lower emission levels. Between 1998-2002, 607 suicides by this means were recorded while just 393 hospital admissions were recorded for the same period. Mean carboxyhaemoglobin levels were significantly lower in fatalities using vehicles manufactured from 1998, however suicide still occurred in these vehicles (n = 25). The extent to which the new regulations contributed to the relatively low fate of suicide in vehicles less than 5 years old compared to their frequency in the fleet remains unknown. Based on international experience and the age of the Victorian vehicle fleet, it may take well over a decade until substantial decreases in MVEGS are observed in the absence of active preventive measures.

TI Economically inactive, unemployed and employed suicides in Australia by

   economic recession?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Recession; suicide; unemployment; employed; economic inactivity
ID TIME-TREND ANALYSIS; JOB INSECURITY; HEALTH; MORTALITY; DEATH; ENGLAND;
   COHORT; LIFE
AB Background: Suicide is higher among economically inactive and unemployed persons than employed persons. This paper investigates differences in this relationship by sex and age over the period 2001 to 2010 in Australia. It also examines changes in suicide among employed, unemployed and economically inactive persons during the recession of 2007-09.
   Method: Suicide data from the National Coroners Information System were utilised for this retrospective study. Negative binomial and Poisson regression was used to estimate the association between suicide and employment status and to investigate differences in suicide rates over the period of the recession (2007-09) compared with the year before the recession (2006).
   Results: Results suggest that during 2001-10 economically inactive/unemployed males had a suicide rate ratio (RR) of 4.62 [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.10, 5.19; P<0.001] compared with employed males (RR=1.00), whereas economically inactive/unemployed females had a suicide RR of 8.44 compared with employed females (95% CI 7.38, 9.67; P<0.001). There was an increase in suicide among both employed (7% rise in 2007, P=0.003) and economically inactive/unemployed males during the GFC (22% in 2008, P<0.001). Suicide also increased among economically inactive/unemployed females (12% in 2007, P=0.03; 19% in 2008, P=0.001) but not among employed females.
   Conclusions: These results suggest the need for adequate policy and social welfare responses to ameliorate the effects of the economic recession on the working age population. Particularly, these should target unemployed and economically inactive men and women in Australia, who may be at higher risk of suicide than previously thought.

AB BACKGROUND: Australia is one of the world's foremost mining nations. Over the past decade, the number of resources sector employees has risen steadily. It is increasingly suggested in lay press and popular discourse that mining industry employees (the majority of whom are men) face an elevated risk of suicide relative to the general population, and that suicide rates are higher among mining industry employees relative to other occupations. However, there has been no empirical evaluation of this proposal, which impedes the ability to develop appropriate policy responses.
   OBJECTIVE: This study begins to fill knowledge gaps, by providing the first quantitative examination of suicide rates in the mining industry. METHODS: Data from the Queensland Suicide Register were used to examine suicide rates in the resources sector, relative to other sectors.
   RESULTS: The mining industry was found to have lower male suicide rates relative to other occupations and the working-age male population overall.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings do not support the view that mining industry employment is necessarily associated with elevated suicide rates. Many factors, ranging from individual personality characteristics through to workplace policies, may contribute to this observation.

ID STATISTICS
AB Objectives: To describe the causes of death codes assigned in Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) mortality data to deaths in Australia from 2000 to 2005 that were coded as intentional self-harm (suicide) in the National Coroners Information System (NCIS).
   Methods: Data for deaths in the period mid-2000 to end-2005 were obtained from the National Coroners Information System database (NCIS). We selected cases recorded in the NCIS as having intent at completion = intentional self-harm. The record linkage was done by the ABS and NCIS and did not form part of this project.
   Results: During the study period, 12,786 deaths recorded in NCIS were assigned intent at completion = intentional self-harm. Of these, 9,937 (77.7%) had been assigned ICD-10 underlying cause of death codes in the range normally reported as suicide (X60-X84), 1,135 had been assigned other ICD-10 codes and the remaining 1,714 (13.4%) NCIS records did not hold any ICD-10 codes.
   Conclusions: These findings confirm that routine mortality data have underestimated suicide mortality in Australia in recent years probably due to incomplete coroner data being available to ABS coders. Certain types of unintentional injury deaths have been over-estimated. Incomplete linkage of NCIS and ABS data in the source data used for this project complicates calculations of adjusted estimates and trends.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Reducing suicide rates is a national mental health priority as over 2,200 people die from suicide each year in Australia. Increasingly, nongovernment organisations (NGOs) provide services to people experiencing severe and persistent mental illnesses-a significant cohort at risk of suicide. While clinical services are generally seen as the arbiters of risk, little is known of how suicide risk assessments are undertaken in NGOs. This article reports the findings of a survey-based pilot study of 44 frontline workers in mental health-focused NGOs in Tasmania, Australia, with the aim of sketching a preliminary picture of this under-studied terrain. We identified the assessment practices utilised by workers, and the challenges and dilemmas they experienced in navigating issues of trust in suicide risk assessment in contexts where they often felt vulnerable and under-prepared. We argue that these early findings demonstrate the need for organisations to foster cultures of trust to facilitate both the activities of relationship building between practitioners and clients, and those of monitoring risk.

AB A review of cases where inhalation of helium had been a cause of, or a major contributor to, death was undertaken at Forensic Science South Australia (FSSA) over a five-year period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2014. The data were compared with a previous study in the same population from 1985 to 2009. Sixteen cases were identified (age range 21-84years; mean 44years; median 37years). The male to female ratio was 11:5. The study has shown that helium suicides in South Australia are still increasing, with a doubling of the numbers in the period 2010-2014 compared with 2005-2009. This increase is not due to changes in the total population numbers. Although suicides utilising helium are still only a small percentage of suicides overall for the region (16/888; 1.8%), the rate of increase of these deaths is noteworthy.

TI A systematic review of suicide prevention interventions targeting
   indigenous peoples in Australia, United States, Canada and New Zealand
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Review
ID ALASKA NATIVE COMMUNITIES; ALCOHOL; BEHAVIOR; PROGRAM; DISEASE; INJURY
AB Background: Indigenous peoples of Australia, Canada, United States and New Zealand experience disproportionately high rates of suicide. As such, the methodological quality of evaluations of suicide prevention interventions targeting these Indigenous populations should be rigorously examined, in order to determine the extent to which they are effective for reducing rates of Indigenous suicide and suicidal behaviours. This systematic review aims to: 1) identify published evaluations of suicide prevention interventions targeting Indigenous peoples in Australia, Canada, United States and New Zealand; 2) critique their methodological quality; and 3) describe their main characteristics.
   Methods: A systematic search of 17 electronic databases and 13 websites for the period 1981-2012 (inclusive) was undertaken. The reference lists of reviews of suicide prevention interventions were hand-searched for additional relevant studies not identified by the electronic and web search. The methodological quality of evaluations of suicide prevention interventions was assessed using a standardised assessment tool.
   Results: Nine evaluations of suicide prevention interventions were identified: five targeting Native Americans; three targeting Aboriginal Australians; and one First Nation Canadians. The main intervention strategies employed included: Community Prevention, Gatekeeper Training, and Education. Only three of the nine evaluations measured changes in rates of suicide or suicidal behaviour, all of which reported significant improvements. The methodological quality of evaluations was variable. Particular problems included weak study designs, reliance on self-report measures, highly variable consent and follow-up rates, and the absence of economic or cost analyses.
   Conclusions: There is an urgent need for an increase in the number of evaluations of preventive interventions targeting reductions in Indigenous suicide using methodologically rigorous study designs across geographically and culturally diverse Indigenous populations. Combining and tailoring best evidence and culturally-specific individual strategies into one coherent suicide prevention program for delivery to whole Indigenous communities and/or population groups at high risk of suicide offers considerable promise.

AB Background: Mental illness is an established risk factor for suicide. To develop effective prevention interventions and strategies, the demographic characteristics and stressors (other than, or in addition to, mental illness) that can influence a person's decision to die by suicide need to be identified. Aim: To examine cases of suicide by the presence or absence of a diagnosed mental illness (mental illness status) to identify differences in factors associated with suicide in the groups. Method: Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate mental illness status and exposure to stressors among 2,839 persons who died by suicide in Victoria, Australia (2009-2013), using the Victorian Suicide Register. Results: Females, metropolitan residents, persons treated for physical illness/injury, those exposed to stressors related to isolation, family, work, education, and substance use and those who had made a previous suicide attempt had increased odds of having a diagnosed mental illness. Employed persons had decreased odds of having a diagnosed mental illness. Limitations: The retrospectivity of data collection as well as the validity and reliability of some of the data may be questionable owing to the potential for recall bias. Conclusion: The point of intervention for suicide prevention cannot always be a mental health professional; some people who die by suicide either do not have a mental illness or have not sought help.

AB Although suicide rates among prisoners are high and vary between countries, it is uncertain whether this reflects the importation of risk from the general population or is associated with incarceration rates.
   We collected data on suicides and undetermined deaths in 12 countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, England and Wales, Finland, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, and Sweden) directly from their prison administrations for 2003-2007. These were compared with rates of suicides in the general population separately by gender using Pearson's correlations. In addition, they were compared with rates of incarceration. Linear regression was used to examine any association after adjustment for rates of incarceration.
   Data were collected on 861 suicides in prison, of which 810 were in men. In the men, crude relative rates of suicide were at least three times higher than the general population. Western European countries had similar rates of prisoner suicide which were mostly higher than those in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. There was no association between rates of suicide in prisoners and general population rates or rates of incarceration. In the women, inmate suicide rates varied widely and were mostly raised compared with rates in the general population. In addition, these rates did not appear to be associated with general population rates of suicide.
   Rates of prison suicide do not reflect general population suicide rates, suggesting that variations in prison suicide rates reflect differences in criminal justice systems including, possibly, the provision of psychiatric care in prison.

AB Objective: To examine age, period and cohort effects on Australian suicide rates.
   Method: Male suicide rates for successive 5-year periods between 1919 and 1998, and for 1999 were displayed graphically to examine interactions between age, period and cohort effects.
   Results: There has been a pronounced period effect on male suicide rates in all age groups over the last few decades, with lower rates in wartime and peak rates for most cohorts in the 1960s. Peak rates of all adult female 5-year age cohorts occurred in the 1960s or early 1970s.
   Conclusion: Most so-called cohort effects appear to be associated with environmental changes that may not be a function of the cohort itself. While much attention has focused on the rising suicide rates in young males in Australia, local media and health authorities have given little emphasis to the high rates found in elderly males.

DT Article
DE older adults; suicide; Australia
ID PSYCHOLOGICAL AUTOPSY; PREVENTION; ENGLAND; PEOPLE; DIE
AB Background: Globally, suicide rates increase with age, being highest in older adults. This study analyzed differences in suicides in older adults (65 years and over) compared to middle-aged adults (35-64 years) in Queensland, Australia, during the years 2000-2012.
   Methods: The Queensland Suicide Register was utilized for the analysis. Annual suicide rates were calculated by gender and age group, and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were examined.
   Results: In Queensland, the average annual rate of suicides for older adults was 15.27 per 100,000 persons compared to 18.77 in middle-aged adults in 2000-2012. There were no significant changes in time trends for older adults in 2002-2012. Suicide methods differed between gender and age groups. Older adults who died by suicide were more likely to be male, widowed, living alone or in a nursing home, and out of the work force. The prevalence of untreated psychiatric conditions, diagnosed psychiatric disorders, and consultations with a mental health professional three months prior to death was lower in older adults than middle-aged adults. Somatic illness, bereavement, and attention to suicide in the media were more common among older adults than middle-age adults. Older females were particularly more likely to pay attention to suicide in the media.
   Conclusion: Our findings show older adults who died by suicide were more likely to experience somatic illnesses, bereavement, and pay attention to suicide in the media compared to middle aged. Preventing suicide in older adults would therefore require holistic and comprehensive approaches.

AB Gun Buyback programs have been implemented in various forms in countries such as the UK, USA, Brazil, Australia, and Argentina. Whether or not these programs are an effective approach for reducing national violent crime and homicides, however, remains unclear. Much of the uncertainty is due to the different ways in which Gun Buyback programs have been implemented. The Australian Gun Buyback program is distinguished from Gun Buyback programs in other countries by its abrupt implementation, its narrow focus on a particular class of firearms, and its broad application across the entire population. We assess the impact of Australia's 1996 Gun Buyback program on national homicide rates using a synthetic control group quasi-experimental design, comparing the results to suicide and motor vehicle fatality trends to test for plausible alternative hypotheses. Results suggest that the Gun Buyback program significantly reduced Australia's homicide rate in the decade following the intervention (1997-2007).

AB This study investigated the nature of media coverage of a national entertainer's suicide and its impact on subsequent suicides. After the celebrity suicide, the number of suicide-related articles reported surged around 80 times in the week after the suicide compared with the week prior. Many articles (37.1%) violated several critical items on the World Health Organization suicide reporting guidelines, like containing a detailed suicide method. Most gender and age subgroups were at significantly higher risk of suicide during the 4 weeks after the celebrity suicide. Results imply that massive and noncompliant media coverage of a celebrity suicide can cause a large-scale copycat effect.

AB PurposeFarmer suicide is a major public issue in Australia. Using the psychological autopsy method, this study aimed to examine the life and death circumstances of Australian male farmers who died by suicide through verbal reports from their close significant others.
   MethodsIndividual semistructured interviews were conducted with 12 relatives of male farmers who had died by suicide in Queensland or New South Wales, Australia (2006-2014). This study followed the COREQ checklist criteria for the reporting of qualitative research.
   FindingsSix interrelated themes were identified: (1) masculinity, (2) uncertainty and lack of control in farming, (3) feelings of failure in relationships and farming, (4) escalating health problems, (5) maladaptive coping, and (6) acquired capability with access to means.
   ConclusionsEffective clinical interventions, as well as suicide prevention strategies, need to consider the importance of 3 key issues in suicide among farmers: adherence to masculine norms and socialization; expectations of self in maintaining family traditions and occupation; and a male subtype of depression.

AB Background: Australian farming communities have up to twice the suicide rate of the general population. Men, particularly, demonstrate debilitating self-and perceived-stigma associated with an experience of suicide. The Ripple Effect is aimed to reduce suicide stigma within the social, cultural, geographical and psychological contexts in which it occurs.
   Methods: A mixed-method design with multi-level evaluation will be effected following the development and delivery of a personalised website experience (combining shared stories, education, personal goal setting and links to resources) to farming men, aged 30-64 years, with an experience of suicide. Pre-and post-surveys will be used to assess changes in self-and perceived-stigma and suicide literacy. Online feedback from participants and semistructured interviews during follow-up will be thematically analysed.
   Discussion: This project will provide information about increasingly accessible, innovative approaches to reducing the debilitating health and wellbeing effects of suicide stigma on a population of Australia's farmers.

AB It appears that mental illness was present in Australian Aboriginal culture prior to European colonization of Australia but was, most likely, a relatively rare occurrence. The much greater prevalence of mental illness and suicide in the current Aboriginal population is a reflection of the significant disruption to Aboriginal society and has a strong context of social and emotional deprivation. Management of the issues of mental illness in Aboriginal people requires a strong emphasis on cultural safety along with the recognition of family, culture and community in any therapeutic process.

AB This study aimed to determine whether media items about suicide were associated with differential increases in actual suicides. Data were available on 4635 suicide-related items appearing in Australian newspapers and on radio and television news and current affairs shows between March 2000 and February 2001. These data were combined with national data on completed suicides occurring during the same period, by a process that involved identifying the date and geographical reach of the media items and determining the number of suicides occurring in the same location in selected weeks pre- and post-item. Regression analyses were conducted to determine whether the likelihood of an increase in post-item suicides could be explained by particular item characteristics. We found that 39% of media items were followed by an increase in mate suicides, and 31% by an increase in female suicides. Media items were more likely to be associated with increases in both male and female suicides if they occurred in the context of multiple other reports on suicide (versus occurring in isolation), if they were broadcast on television (versus other media), and if they were about completed suicide (versus attempted suicide or suicidal ideation). Different item content appeared to be influential for males and females, with an increase in male suicides being associated with items about an individual's experience of suicide and opinion pieces, and an increase in female suicides being associated with items about mass- or murder-suicide. Item prominence and quality were not differentially associated with increases in male or female suicides. Further research on this topic is required, but in the meantime there is a need to remain vigilant about how suicide news is reported. Mental health professionals and suicide experts should collaborate with media professionals to try to balance 'public interest' against the risk of harm. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB BackgroundFarmers and farm workers have been recognised as a group at high risk of suicide in Australia; however this risk is not without geographic and demographic variation. This study aims to identify and better understand the complex interplay of risk and protective factors surrounding farmer suicide, with an emphasis on social influences, so as to inform tailored and effective suicide prevention initiatives.MethodsFocus groups were conducted in three diverse sites across two states in Australia with men and women separately to gain perceptions about suicide risk and protective factors and attitudes towards suicide and help seeking. The three communities in each state represented areas with a suicide rate similar to, above, and below the state average. The communities were also diverse in their population, types of farming, geographic location, distance from and access to services. There were a total of 33 female and 30 male participants.ResultsQualitative analysis indicated three major interrelated social factors: (1) changing rural communities, (2) community attitudes and stigma and (3) relationship issues.ConclusionsThe biopsycho-ecological model is considered useful to better understand and address social, as well as individual and environmental factors, pertaining to farmer suicide.

AB Objective: To examine factors that may contribute to elevated rates of suicide among rural communities in Australia.
   Method: A wide-ranging literature search reviewed possible factors that may contribute to the geographical variation in suicide. Literature was organized to enable examination of compositional and contextual explanations, as well as collective social functioning and social practices.
   Results: A variety of factors may contribute to elevated rates of suicide in rural compared with urban areas. Collective and contextual (place) factors seem to be of particular importance as possible contributors to the elevated rate of suicide among rural males. These include rural socioeconomic decline; facilitators and barriers to service utilization such as service availability and accessibility, rural culture, community attitudes to mental illness and help seeking; and exposure to firearms.
   Conclusions: Compositional, contextual and collective factors are hypothesized to influence the elevated rate of suicide in rural compared with urban areas. These factors need to be tested in empirical studies that consider both individual and community-based risk factors, and are designed to enable exploration of likely within-rural differences.

AB Objective: To identify characteristics that could distinguish males who completed suicide by hanging from males who completed suicide by firearms and non-domestic gas, and to suggest suicide prevention strategies targeted at hanging.
   Method: Using the psychological autopsy design, males who used hanging, firearms and non-domestic gas were compared on a range of variables covering social, psychological, and health related factors and aspects of the suicide incident. The sample consisted of 950 males who suicided in Queensland, Australia, between 1994 and 1996.
   Results: Compared with males who used firearms and non-domestic gas, males who used hanging were significantly younger, less likely to have left a suicide note, and more likely to have been diagnosed with a psychotic disorder. Compared with males who used firearms, males who used hanging were significantly more likely to have made prior suicide attempts and have had no physical illness. Compared with males who used non-domestic gas, males who used hanging were significantly more likely to have lived with others, have had prior legal trouble, and have suicided at their residence.
   Conclusions: The results are discussed in terms of the availability and socio-cultural acceptability of methods. The authors suggest a possible relationship between impulsive traits and method choice. This proposition requires further investigation using alternative methodologies. Some suicide prevention measures targeting hanging suicides are discussed in light of the results.

AB Since the 1950s, the suicide rate for adolescents more than tripled, and suicide currently ranks as the third-leading cause of death among 15-to-24 year-olds. Comprehensive school suicide prevention programs should include primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention components. This paper discusses these components as they relate to suicide prevention, and it provides practical steps for incorporating each component within a school system. All steps are based on a review of the professional literature. Three questions are explored: What can school professionals do to help in preventing adolescent suicide? What should school professionals do when a student threatens suicide? What should school professionals do after a student commits suicide?

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate choice of suicide method in individuals aged 65 years and over. Methods: Data were obtained from the Queensland Suicide Register, Australia. Univariate and multi-variate logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results: The predominant methods in older adults were hanging (21.5%), firearms and explosives (20.9%), drug poisoning (18.5%), followed by other poisoning (mainly MVCO) (12.6%), suffocation by plastic bag (8.5%), and drowning (6%). Some methods (e.g. firearms and explosives, drug poisoning, suffocation) appeared characterised by profiles (e.g., socio-demographic and clinical aspects), meanwhile others were not well distinguishable. Compared to other methods, those who died by firearms and explosives were significantly more likely to be males, Australian born, live in rural and remote areas, and less likely to have a mental illness, previous suicide attempt(s) or leave a suicide note. Those who died by drug poisoning were more likely to be females, leave a suicide note, experience interpersonal conflict and live in urban areas. Similarly, those who chose suffocation by plastic bag were more likely to be older females, leave a suicide note, and pay attention to suicide in the media, but less likely to experience interpersonal conflict. Conclusion: Acceptability, availability and lethality are important factors impacting choice of means and should be considered when designing suicide prevention activities in older adults.

AB Introduction: People who die by suicide have a higher risk of an alcohol-use disorder (AUD) at the time of death. The present study aims to compare 1) suicide cases with and without AUD, and 2) suicide and sudden-death controls with AUD.
   Methods: The psychological autopsy method was utilized to investigate suicide and sudden death in Australia (QLD and NSW). Initial information was gathered from coroners' offices. Potential informants were approached and semi-structured interviews were conducted. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were applied.
   Results: People with AUD who died by suicide were significantly more likely to have another substance use disorder, history of suicide attempt, recent serious arguments with spouse/partner and other family members, been unfaithful to partner/spouse, be victims of a crime, and were less likely to be from a non-English speaking background. They were also younger and had higher levels of aggression compared to non-AUD suicides. AUD suicides were more likely to have mood disorders, previous suicide attempt, expressing hopelessness, higher scores in aggression towards self, romantic relationship breakup, and serious arguments with other family members than AUD sudden deaths. Aggressive behavior, having another substance-use disorder, and history of serious arguments with family members remained significant in the final model comparing suicides with and without AUD.
   Conclusion: Our findings support that aggressive behavior, comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders as predisposing factors, and recent interpersonal conflicts such as breakup and family conflicts can trigger suicide in people with AUD. There is a need for proper diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment in suicidal people with AUD. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A trend of higher suicide rates in rural and remote areas as well as areas with low socioeconomic status has been shown in previous research. Little is known whether the influence of social deprivation on suicide differs between urban and rural areas. This investigation aims to examine how social deprivation influences suicide mortality and to identify which related factors of deprivation have a higher potential to reduce suicide risk in urban and rural Queensland, Australia.
   Suicide data from 2004 to 2008 were obtained from the Queensland Suicide Register. Age-standardized suicide rates (15+ years) and rate ratios, with a 95 % confidence interval, for 38 Statistical Subdivisions (SSDs) in Queensland were calculated. The influence of deprivation-related variables on suicide and their rural-urban difference were modelled by log-linear regression analyses through backward elimination.
   Among the 38 SSDs in Queensland, eight had a higher suicide risk while eleven had a lower rate. Working-age males (15-59 years) had the most pronounced geographic variation in suicide rate. In urban areas, suicide rates were positively associated with tenant households in public housing, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, the unemployment rate and median individual income, but inversely correlated with younger age and households with no internet access. In rural areas, only tenant households in public housing and households with no internet access heightened the risk of suicide, while a negative association was found for younger and older persons, low-skilled workers or labourers, and families with low income and no cars.
   The extent to which social deprivation contributes to suicide mortality varies considerably between rural and urban areas.

AB Background: With the exception of the United States, in recent years suicide rates have been declining in most western countries. Notoriously, suicide rates fluctuate - especially in males - in response to a range of socio-political and environmental factors, some of them difficult to identify. Our aim was to obtain an updated profile of main commonalities in suicide cases of Queensland residents between 2002 and 2011 to inform prevention strategies.
   Methods: Data were obtained from the Queensland Suicide Register (QSR), including police and toxicology reports, post-mortem autopsy and Coroner's findings. Data are crosschecked with records from the National Coronial Information System. Age-standardised rates (ASR) of suicide, Poisson regression and Chi(2) tests are presented.
   Results: A total of 5752 suicides by Queensland residents was registered between 2002 and 2011; 76.9% by males and 23.1% by females. The average ASR was 14.3 per 100,000, with a significant decrease between 2002 and 2011. Rates declined significantly in males, not in females. On average, rates were 3.41-times higher in males. ASR for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples was significantly higher than for other Australians. Overall, male suicide rates were particularly high in remote areas, as well as in the most disadvantaged ones. One third of suicide cases presented history of previous suicidal behaviour, and half a detected and treated mental disorder. Hanging was the most common method.
   Conclusions: Suicide rates have declined in Queensland, Australia. It is problematic to say if this was due to suicide prevention programs or other factors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the nature of homicide-suicides and determine the ways in which they differ from suicides without the perpetration of homicide in terms of their demographic characteristics, suicide, medical and psychiatric history, their psychological state leading up to the suicide, and their motives for their suicidal behavior. Cases of homicide-suicide from a 20-year period were extracted from the Coroner's inquest files and were matched to suicide-only cases on the basis of age and sex. The characteristics that predominantly distinguished the homicide-suicides were based on psychological state leading up to the act and motive for the act. It is proposed that homicide-suicides may be better understood within an expressive homicide framework. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

   review of the literature

ID FATALITIES; FARMERS; MORTALITY
AB Introduction: Australia's farmers constitute a heterogeneous group within the rural population. This literature review incorporates four broad areas: an understanding of farming communities, families and individuals and the contexts in which they live and work; an exploration of the challenges to morbidity and mortality that these communities face; a description of the patterns of suicide and accidental death in farming communities; and an outline of what is missing from the current body of research. Recommendations will be made on how these gaps may be addressed.
   Methods: In developing this comprehensive literature review, a snowballing and saturation approach was adopted. Initial search terms included suicid*, farm*, accident*, fatal*, death, sudden death, rural OR remote, Australia and NOT Australia. Databases searched included SCOPUS, PubMed, Proquest and SafetyLit; research from 1995 onwards was examined for relevance. Earlier seminal texts were also included. Reference lists of retrieved articles were searched and citations explored for further relevant research material. The primary focus was on Australian peer-reviewed research with supplementary grey literature. International material was used as examples.
   Results: The literature variously describes farmers as members of both rural farming communities and farming families, and as individuals within an occupational classification. Within each of these classifications, there is evidence of the cumulative impact of a multiplicity of social, geographical and psychological factors relating to work, living and social arrangements that impact the health and wellbeing of Australia's farmers and their families, particularly accidental death and suicide. Research consistently demonstrates traumatic death to be at a greater rate than in the general Australian population, with reductions found more recently in some modes of farming-related accidental death. Patterns of accidental death and suicide are commonly linked to the changing shape of contemporary farming. Suicide rates are also frequently described in relation to lethality and accessibility of means. The limitations of suicide and accidental death data are considerable.
   Conclusion: While there is consistent reporting of heightened levels of risk for suicide and accidental death in farming communities the limitations of the research remain significant. There are substantial gaps in current knowledge, and the body of research to date lacks clarity, inclusiveness and contextual specificity. Absent from the literature is any investigation of the impact of these frequently preventable deaths on the families and communities in which they occur. Recommendations for future research are suggested.

AB Objectives This study investigated secular trends in socio-economic status (SES) differentials in Australian suicide (1979-2003), which includes overall declines in male suicide from 1998. Method Suicide rates were stratified by approximate equal-population quintiles of area-based SES for the period 1979-2003 and examined across five quinquennia, centred on each Australian Census from 1981 to 2001, to determine if (1) SES differentials in suicide have persisted over time, and (2) if SES differentials have widened or narrowed. Suicide rates (per 100,000) were adjusted for confounding by sex, age, country-of-birth, and urban-rural residence using Poisson regression models, and secular changes in SES differentials were assessed using trend tests on suicide rate ratios (low to high SES quintiles). Results Socio-economic status (SES) differentials persisted across the study period for both males and females after adjusting for the effects of age, migrant status, and urban-rural residence, with the largest differences between low and high SES groups evident in males, and especially young males (20-34 years). For males, suicide rates increased significantly in all SES groups until 1998, before diverging significantly in the most recent 5-year period, particularly in younger males (P < 0.0001). In young males, suicide rates in the most recent period increased in the low SES group from 44.8 in 1994-1998 to 48.6 in 1999-2003 (an 8% increase). In contrast, suicide rates in the middle SES group decreased from a peak of 37.3 to 33.5 (a 10% decrease), and in the high SES group from a peak of 33.0 to 27.9 (a 15% decrease). A similar statistically significant divergence of a lesser magnitude was also evident in all age males and younger females (20-34 years). Conclusion This study shows that SES differentials in suicide persisted in Australia for most of the period 1979-2004. The decline in suicide in young males in the most recent quinquennium was limited to middle and high SES groups, while the low SES group displayed a continued increase. The continued increase in suicide in low SES males has implications for social and economic intervention and suicide control programs.

AB Military suicide has increased over the past decade and reports of Service Member and Veteran suicides receive media attention. Some methods of reporting suicide appear to cause a "media contagion'' effect, potentially increasing suicide. This effect is explored in relation to media reports of both military and civilian suicides. To reduce possible contagion, recommendations for media reporting of suicides were adapted by the Suicide Prevention Resource Center (SPRC). We assessed 240 military and civilian newspaper reports of suicide from 15 different sources for compliance with the SPRC guidelines. Nearly all reviewed articles violated at least one guideline. Results highlighted military news articles regarding Service Members included more pejorative language and discussion of failed psychological treatment. Conversely, civilian articles romanticized the victim and provided more details regarding the suicide. Further exploration of military suicide reporting bias is discussed as a need in future research.

AB Background Responses to mental disorders usually focus on treatment; socio-economic conditions are less likely to be considered.
   Aims To examine social determinants of mental disorders and attempted suicide in Australia.
   Method Data from the 1997 Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (n=10 641) were used to estimate associations between socioeconomic status, mental disorders and attempted suicide. Logistic regression was used to adjust for age, urban/rural residence and country of birth. Socioeconomic status differentials in suicide attempts were also adjusted for mental disorders.
   Results Significant increasing gradients from high to low levels of education and occupational status (employed) were evident for affective disorders and anxiety disorders in both men and women and for substance use disorders in men. Similar gradients were found for suicide attempts, which decreased after adjusting for mental disorders, but remained significant in the working-age employed.
   Conclusions These findings suggest social causation of mental disorders and suicide attempts, and the need for social and economic responses beyond provision of mental health services.

AB Background The relationship between unemployment and suicide may be sensitive to demographic factors, national unemployment rates, and length of time without employment. This study investigated these factors in relation to suicide in Australia for the period 1985-2006, in an ecological study.
   Methods The outcome variable was annual suicide rate by age group, sex and the eight states and territories over 22 years of observation (total observations=1760). The main predictor variable was the average duration of unemployment in the population, categorised into three time periods (<2 weeks, 2-4 weeks, >4 weeks). Poisson regression models were used to investigate the relationship between duration of unemployment and suicide over the years 1985-2006 in a series of cross-sectional analyses. Interaction analyses indicated significant differences during periods of declining or increasing labour market opportunity and by age group.
   Results During periods of declining unemployment rates in the country, longer durations of unemployment were associated with higher male suicide rates. During periods of increasing unemployment in the country, longer unemployment duration was associated with lower male suicide rates. Effect modification was also apparent by age-group, with stronger associations between unemployment duration and male suicide evident in those aged 25-34 and 55-64, and weaker associations in those aged 15-24 and 44-54 years. Longer length of unemployment was not associated with an increase in female suicide rates.
   Conclusions The labour market opportunities in Australia modified the effect of duration of unemployment on suicide, and the effect was more prominent in men and older age groups. This may reflect social norms and acceptability about unemployment, as well as life-stage influences associated with transitions into and out of the labour market.

AB Background: In the limited research into suicides in older adults, they have been treated as a homogenous group without distinguishing between different age groups. This study aimed to compare differences in sociodemographic variables, recent life events, and mental and physical illnesses between three age groups within older adults who died by suicide: young-old (65-74 years), middle-old (75-84 years), and oldest old (85 years and over) in Queensland, Australia, during the years 2000-2012 (N = 978).
   Methods: The Queensland Suicide Register was utilized for the analysis. Annual suicide rates were calculated. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals and (2) tests for trend were calculated to examine differences between the three groups.
   Results: Suicide rates were increasing with age for males, but not for females. Hanging and firearms were the predominant methods of suicides. However, suffocation by plastic bag and drowning as suicide methods increased with age, in contrast firearms and explosives decreased with age. Overall, psychiatric problems, suicidal behavior, legal and financial stressors, and relationship problems decreased significantly with age, meanwhile physical conditions and bereavement increased with age.
   Conclusion: Suicide across older adulthood is not a homogenous phenomenon. Our findings showed significant differences in the prevalence of potential risk factors within the three different age groups considered. To prevent suicide in older adults would require targeting specific factors for each subgroup while using holistic and comprehensive approaches.

AB Objective: The suicide rate in Australia is cause for concern, especially the increase in attempted and completed suicides in rural and regional locations. The present study examined reasons for choosing not to commit suicide as a function of residential location.
   Method: The study involved 655 Victorian residents from four population-based strata; urban, regional city, regional town, and rural.
   Results: Results from the Reasons for Living Inventory revealed significant differences as a function of residential location. Overall, residents in rural locations reported having significantly more to live for than their urban counterparts. Further analysis of six reasons for living (child, family, moral, social, coping and death-related concerns) showed a pattern whereby residents in rural locations reported having the most to live for, followed by regional residents, and urban residents who reported having the least to live for.
   Conclusions: These findings are in contrast to increase of suicide rates in rural areas, and highlight the need for a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying suicidal behaviour.

AB In 1997, Australia implemented a gun buyback program that reduced the stock of firearms by around one-fifth (and nearly halved the number of gun-owning households). Using differences across states, we test whether the reduction in firearms availability affected homicide and suicide rates. We find that the buyback led to a drop in the firearm suicide rates of almost 80%, with no significant effect on non-firearm death rates. The effect on firearm homicides is of similar magnitude but is less precise. The results are robust to a variety of specification checks and to instrumenting the state-level buyback rate.

AB In 1995, 434 suicide deaths of young people aged 15-24 were recorded in Australia. The most common methods were hanging, carbon monoxide poisoning and firearms. Rates of suicide from firearms have declined in recent years, but shootings still remain a substantial mode of suicide. Male youth suicide rates have trebled in Australia since 1960.
   This study was designed to determine the ease of access that young suicide victims had to guns. A review of the state coroner's records of 109 consecutive youth suicides by gunshot in Victoria was conducted and the findings analysed quantitatively and qualitatively. Issues explored included who were the owners of these guns, whether the owners were licensed, and the guns registered, and security of the storage to meet legislative requirements. The study also focused on how the guns were accessed, and factors which might have contributed to the choice of guns as the means of suicide. The findings included that, for young people who suicided by gunshot, access to guns was invariably easy. Key factors were that most guns were owned either by the victims themselves, their fathers, or other male relatives. Some were owned illegally, some were unlocked, and although many were kept in locked receptacles as required by legislation, the keys were easily accessible. Police investigations for the coroner often failed to record the legal status of guns; few prosecutions resulted.
   The principles of injury prevention can be applied to the reduction of gun suicides by youth. Legislative requirements for gun ownership and storage can be improved to require owners to secure the keys to lockable gun cabinets as well as securing the guns more adequately. The design of gun cabinets and guns can be improved to prevent unauthorised access by young people. There is a need for continuous community education about the dangers of storing guns within residential settings.

AB Factors that influence choice of methods of suicide include availability of the material or device that is being used. Certain drivers utilise motor vehicles to deliberately self-harm, although ascertaining what percentage of these deaths were intentional is difficult. The files of Forensic Science South Australia in Adelaide, Australia were examined over a 5-year period from January 2005 to December 2009 for cases of fatal single occupant, single motor vehicle collisions involving impacts with trees, and for comparison, all cases of suicide. Tree impacts were selected as these represented the largest group of clearly defined single motor vehicle and solid object impacts. A total of 73 cases were identified, with those aged 1724 years accounting for the highest proportion of deaths, compared with suicide victims who were predominately aged 2539 years. Suicides showed little seasonal variation in incidence whereas more fatal collisions occurred in winter. A significant number of the drivers had ingested alcohol. The lack of a seasonal similarity in the occurrence of fatal collisions and suicides, and differences in the most common ages would be supportive of these groups being aetiologically different. Other factors in favour of these crashes not being intentional include intoxication and winter conditions.

AB Public knowledge and attitudes toward suicide may influence help-seeking for suicidality. This study aimed to identify correlates of suicide attitudes and knowledge. Australian adults were invited to complete an online survey, with 1,286 responders. Less exposure to suicide, older age, male gender, less education, and culturally diverse backgrounds were associated with poorer knowledge; while younger age, male gender, and culturally diverse backgrounds were associated with more stigmatizing attitudes toward people who die by suicide. The results suggest suicide literacy and stigma reduction programs would benefit community members, particularly males and individuals from culturally diverse backgrounds.

AB The passive form of euthanasia is legalized almost in every civilized country. Its active form is not a generally accepted legal institution. In Europe, active euthanasia is legalized only in The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland. In Australia, the Act on the Rights of the Terminally Ill of 1995 legalized the institution of assisted suicide, which is not identical to active euthanasia. The difference lies in the fact that legalized active euthanasia means that the author of a murder is not punishable (under certain circumstances), whilst assisted suicide is not about murder, rather about suicide. In the first case, the patient is killed on his or her request by someone else. In the second case, the patient himself or herself executes the act of self-killing (by the assistance of a healthcare worker). In Australia, the institution of assisted suicide was repealed in 1997. Assisted suicide is legal in four USA member states: in Vermont, Washington, Montana and Oregon. In Uruguay, the active form of euthanasia has been legal since 1932.

TI Assessing the Adherence to Guidelines of Media Reporting of Suicide
   Using a Novel Instrument-the "Risk of Imitative Suicide Scale" (RISc)
SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
ID AUSTRALIA; COVERAGE
AB Media guidelines for reporting of suicide are considered important in suicide prevention because of the risk of imitative suicide. There are currently no established tools for the quantification of quality of reporting. We sought to develop and validate a quality assessment instrumentthe Risk of Imitative Suicide Scale (RISc). The RISc appears capable of discriminating reliably between adherent and nonadherent articles. Our data suggest that adherence to guidelines is inconsistent, and there are major differences between web-based and print media. The RISc could be used to evaluate effectiveness and consistency of media engagement with suicide prevention strategies.

AB Objective: To analyse trends in mortality from suicide over the period 1965 - 99.
   Method: Data were derived from the WHO database, including data for 47 countries.
   Results: In the European Union (EU), all age suicide mortality peaked at 16.1/100 000 in men in 1980 - 84, and declined thereafter to 14.4/ 100 000 in 1995 - 98. In females, the fall was 29% to reach 4.6/100 000. A similar pattern of trends was observed in several eastern European countries. In contrast, mortality from suicide rose substantially in the Russian Federation, from 37.7/100 000 in males in 1985 - 89 to 58.3/ 100 000 in 1995 - 98 (+ 55%), and to 9.5/100 000 (+ 12%) in females. In the USA and most other American countries providing data, no consistent pattern was evident for males, but falls were observed in females. Steady declines were registered for Japan, starting from the highest suicide rates worldwide in the late 1950s. Suicide rates were upwards in Ireland, Italy, Spain, the UK, Cuba, Australia and New Zealand. Substantial rises were observed in a few countries ( Ireland, Cuba, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand) for young males.
   Conclusion: In spite of mixed trends, suicide remains a significant public health problem worldwide.

AB Objective: To highlight issues relating to suicide coding that have an impact on the final reported mortality data by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
   Method: This paper presents an outline of the way in which the official Australian suicide data is captured and coded and highlights issues relating to the classification used, coronial processes, documentation requirements and data sources that have an impact on the final reported data, especially deaths associated with coronial investigations.
   Results: Issues related to the coding of Australian suicide data are:
   Disparity between jurisdictions due to differences in documentation about accidental or undetermined causes of death.
   Lack of standardisation in the way that coronial deaths are reported across Australia.
   Lack of a standard form for police reports.
   Administrative processes that cause delays in reporting the results of coronial investigations.
   Reluctance on the part of some coroners to report deaths as suicides.
   Conclusions: Researchers and policy makers need to be aware of the constraints under which suicide can be reported as such in the official data before interpreting time trends.

AB Homicide-suicide represents one of the rarest forms of lethal violence but often precipitates calls to revise social, health, and justice policies. However, there is little empirical information about this type of violence. The current study uses two unique data sets to examine a wide range of individual and situational characteristics of homicide-suicide, with particular emphasis on establishing whether and how homicide-suicide differs from homicide-only and suicide-only. Findings suggest homicide-suicide may have unique characteristics that set it apart from both homicide-only and suicide-only, as well as sharing certain other characteristics with those two types of events.

SO CRISIS-THE JOURNAL OF CRISIS INTERVENTION AND SUICIDE PREVENTION

DE suicide; method; media; copycat
AB Internationally, media guidelines on the reporting of suicide suggest that the method of suicide should not be explicitly reported. This paper presents quantitative data on the reporting of suicide in Australia, which suggest that the media present a skewed image of reality with an over-reporting of suicide by violent and unusual methods. It also presents qualitative textual analyses of examples of newspaper reports of suicide in an attempt to examine differences in reporting practices across media and genres and to explore the limits of the notion of "explicitness." The paper concludes that journalistic decisions to maximize the newsworthiness of a story often conflict with the promotion of the accurate, ethical, and responsible reporting of suicide.

DE Aboriginal; Indigenous; suicide; indicated; practitioners
AB Objectives: Suicide is an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (hereafter Indigenous') population health issue. Over 2015-2016, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Suicide Prevention Project (ATSISPEP) aimed to identify success factors in Indigenous suicide prevention.
   Conclusions: For non-Indigenous practitioners working with indigenous clients at risk of suicide, ATSISPEP identified important considerations to make treatment more effective. The start is acknowledging the differences in the historical, cultural, political, social and economic experiences of Indigenous peoples, and their greater exposure to trauma, psychological distress and risks to mental health. These mental health difficulties are specific and more prevalent amongst Indigenous peoples and communities due to the ongoing impacts of colonisation in Australia including a range of social determinants impacting on the well-being of Indigenous peoples today. Working effectively with Indigenous clients also includes being able to establish culturally safe work environments, and the ability of non-Indigenous practitioners to work in a culturally competent and trauma-informed manner. There are also considerations regarding time protocols and client follow-up. Further, postvention responses might be required. Supporting selective suicide prevention activity among younger people (and other groups at increased risk) and community-level work is an important complement to working with Indigenous individuals at risk of suicide.

AB It has been suggested that there is a connection between depression and an increased body mass index (BM). As depression is related to suicide, a South Australian cohort study was performed to test whether a high BM( may also characterize victims of suicide. Body mass indexes from 100 consecutive cases of suicide (male-to-female ratio, 1:1) taken from the files of Forensic Science South Australia in Adelaide, Australia, were compared with BMIs from 100 sex- and age-matched control cases, where deaths were due to accidents, homicides, or natural diseases. No significant differences in BMIs and BMI categories were found between the 2 groups. However, when cases were subclassified according to the method used, BMIs were noted to be considerably lower in hangings than in both the control group as well as in victims who died of alternative means of suicide (P < 0.001). An association between an increased BMI and suicide could not be substantiated in this local study. However, the reasons for the decreased BMIs in hangings require further consideration that may assist in understanding more about particular victim subgroups.

AB Background: The seasonality of suicide has long been recognised. However, little is known about the relative importance of socio-environmental factors in the occurrence of suicide in different geographical areas. This study examined the association of climate, socioeconomic and demographic factors with suicide in Queensland, Australia, using a spatiotemporal approach.
   Methods: Seasonal data on suicide, demographic variables and socioeconomic indexes for areas in each Local Government Area (LGA) between 1999 and 2003 were acquired from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Climate data were supplied by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. A multivariable generalized estimating equation model was used to examine the impact of socio-environmental factors on suicide.
   Results: The preliminary data analyses show that far north Queensland had the highest suicide incidence (e. g., Cook and Mornington Shires), while the south-western areas had the lowest incidence (e. g., Barcoo and Bauhinia Shires) in all the seasons. Maximum temperature, unemployment rate, the proportion of Indigenous population and the proportion of population with low individual income were statistically significantly and positively associated with suicide. There were weaker but not significant associations for other variables.
   Conclusion: Maximum temperature, the proportion of Indigenous population and unemployment rate appeared to be major determinants of suicide at a LGA level in Queensland.

ID UNDETERMINED DEATHS; TRENDS; MISCLASSIFICATION; RATES
AB Objectives: The aim of the present study was to clarify the extent to which the recorded marked decline in young male suicide (20-34 years) in Australia since 1998 is attributable to misclassification of cause of death information.
   Methods: Secular trends in young male suicide rates were investigated for the period 1976-2005. Suicide rates in the period after the peak of the epidemic in this age group (1998) were re-calculated based on published estimates of under-enumeration of suicide data, and misclassification of likely suicide cases to other unintentional and undetermined external causes. Two misclassification scenarios were used to revise young male suicide rates from 1998: previously reported estimates of 9% under-enumeration due to misclassification of unintentional causes of death, and 17% under-enumeration due to misclassification of open cases in addition to unintentional causes of death. All-cause mortality was also examined.
   Results: Recorded male suicide in the 20-34 year age group increased over the study period, peaking in 1998 at 39 per 100 000, before declining sharply in the period 19992005 by 44% to 22 per 100 000 in 2005. Following adjustment for misallocation under the first scenario, suicide rates declined 38% to 24 per 100 000, and under the second scenario declined 33% to 26 per 100 000. Revised suicide rates were not materially different from recorded suicide rates based on 95% confidence intervals over this period. All-cause mortality declined from 1999 due to reductions in suicide and other causes.
   Conclusion: The recent marked decline in young male suicide in Australia is real. The effects of misallocation of likely suicide cases to other causes did not substantially affect population trends in suicide rates in the period after 1998. There is still a need to account in detail for why young male suicide has declined so substantially during the period after 1998.

AB There are well-established training programmes available to support health and human services professionals working with people vulnerable to suicide. However, little is known about involving people with lived experience in the delivery of suicide prevention training with communities with increased rates of suicide. The aim of this paper was to report on a formative dialogical evaluation that explored the views of health and human services workers with regard to a suicide prevention training programme in regional (including rural and remote areas) South Australia which included meaningful involvement of a person with lived experience in the development and delivery of the training. In 2015, eight suicide prevention training workshops were conducted with health and human services workers. All 248 participants lived and worked in South Australian regional communities. We interviewed a subsample of 24 participants across eight sites. A thematic analysis of the interviews identified five themes: Coproduction is key, It is okay to ask the question, Caring for my community, I can make a difference and Learning for future training. The overall meta-theme was Involvement of a person with lived experience in suicide prevention training supports regional communities to look out for people at risk of suicide. This paper highlights the need for suicide prevention training and other workforce development programmes to include lived experience participation as a core component in development and delivery.

AB High suicide rates evident in Australian young adults during an epidemic period in the 1990s appear to have been sustained in older age-groups in the subsequent decade. This period also coincides with changes in employment patterns in Australia. This study investigates age, period, and birth cohort effects in Australian suicide over the 20th century, with particular reference to the period subsequent to the 1990s youth suicide epidemic in young males. Period- and cohort-specific trends in suicide were examined for 1907-2010 based on descriptive analysis of age-specific suicide rates and a series of age-period-cohort (APC) models using Poisson regression. Under-employment rates (those employed part-time seeking additional hours of work) and unemployment rates (those currently seeking employment) for the latter part of this time series (1978-2010) were also examined and compared with period- and cohort-specific trends in suicide. A significant increasing birth cohort effect in male suicide rates was evident in birth cohorts born after 1970-74, after adjusting for the effects age and period. An increasing birth cohort effect was also evident in female suicide rates, but was of a lesser magnitude. Increases in male cohort-specific suicide rates were significantly correlated with increases in cohort-specific under-employment and unemployment rates. Birth cohorts that experienced the peak of the suicide epidemic during the 1990s have continued to have higher suicide rates than cohorts born in earlier epochs. This increase coincides with changes to a labour force characterised by greater 'flexibility' and 'casualised' employment, especially in younger aged cohorts. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Current research is yielding an increasingly heteregeneous picture of suicide seasonalities: They seem to depend on methods and, moreover, they seem to have smoothed in recent decades. This work examines the latter issue by comparing suicide seasonalities in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland, in the 16(th)-18(th) centuries, 1901-1920 and 1969-94. The results indicate shifts of peaks and lows on suicide seasonalities over the centuries, with a smoothing of seasonalities toward the 21(th) century. The recent period does not show any suicide seasonality at all. The canton of Zurich seems to be ahead of the general trend found in other regions of Switzerland.

SO AUSTRALIAN PSYCHOLOGIST
LA English
DT Article
AB Recorded suicide overall has remained reasonably with changes occurring in its pattern of distribution constant throughout the twentieth century in Australia, amongst males. Increased frequency of suicide among young, rural, and Aboriginal males has led to speculation about the causes and calls for action from health care professionals.
   While the definition of suicide is still debated, suicide risk cannot be predicted accurately, and no useful clinical interventions exist to prevent it, this paper argues that psychologists should turn their attention to the social causes of known precursors. Given that we know suicide is more likely amongst people who feel hopeless, lonely, and alienated from their culture, suicide prevention at present might be best directed at reducing the number of people suffering these emotions.

AB Objective:
   To assess the influence of involuntary job loss on suicide and attempted suicide in young adults.
   Method:
   A population-based case-control study of young adults (18-34 years) was conducted in New South Wales, Australia. Cases included both suicides (n=84) and attempts (n=101). A structured interview was conducted with next of kin (for suicide cases) and suicide attempters admitted to hospital. Controls selected from the general population were matched to cases by age and sex. Job dismissal or redundancy (involuntary job loss) in the 12 months before suicide or attempt was the main study variable of interest. Suicide and attempts were modelled separately and in combination as outcomes using conditional logistic regression modelling. The analysis was also adjusted for marital status, socio-economic status and diagnosis of an affective or anxiety disorder.
   Results:
   Following adjustment for other variables, involuntary job loss was associated with an odds ratio of 1.82 for suicide and attempted suicide (combined) (95% CI 0.98 to 3.37; p=0.058). Low socio-economic status was associated with an odds ratio of 3.80 for suicide and attempted suicide (95% CI 2.16 to 6.67; p<0.001) compared to high socio-economic status (after adjustment). Diagnosis of a mental disorder was associated with a 7.87 (95% CI 5.16 to 12.01; p<0.001) odds ratio of suicide and attempted suicide compared to no diagnosis (after adjustment). Involuntary job loss was associated with increased odds of suicide and attempts when these were modelled separately, but results did not reach statistical significance.
   Conclusions:
   Involuntary job loss was associated with increased odds of suicide and attempted suicide. The strength of this relationship was attenuated after adjustment for socio-economic status and mental disorders, which indicates that these may have a stronger influence on suicide than job loss.

AB The authors report a case of suicide by hydrogen sulfide in Australia. A young woman was located in a car wearing protective eye-wear. A tub of foamy yellow substance and a quantity of hydrochloric acid and lime sulfur were also located in the rear of the vehicle. Morphological findings at autopsy were nonspecific. Toxicologic analysis of a specimen of leg blood detected elevated levels of methemoglobin.
   If Australia follows a similar trend to Japan and the United States, it is possible that incidences of such cases will rise, probably because of Internet dissemination. From a public health perspective, emergency service providers and forensic case workers should be aware of the potential hazards to themselves and others when dealing with such cases.

AB Objectives: This study describes the development of a decision support tool to identify the combination of suicide prevention activities and service priorities likely to deliver the greatest reductions in suicidal behaviour in Western Sydney (Australia) over the period 2018-2028.
   Methods: A dynamic simulation model for the WentWest - Western Sydney Primary Health Network population-catchment was developed in partnership with primary health network stakeholders based on defined pathways to mental health care and suicidal behaviour, and which represented the current incidence of suicide and attempted suicide in Western Sydney. A series of scenarios relating to potential suicide prevention activities and service priorities identified by primary health network stakeholders were investigated to identify the combination of interventions associated with the largest reductions in the forecast number of attempted suicide and suicide cases for a 10-year follow-up period.
   Results: The largest number of cases averted for both suicide and attempted suicide was associated with (1) post-suicide attempt assertive aftercare (6.1% for both attempted suicide and suicide), (2) improved community support and reductions in psychological distress in the community (5.1% for attempted suicide and 14.8% for suicide), and (3) reductions in the proportion of those lost to services following a mental health service contact (10.5% for both attempted suicide and suicide). In combination, these interventions were forecast to avert approximately 29.7% of attempted suicides and 37.1% of suicides in the primary health network catchment over the 10-year period.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates the utility of dynamic simulation models, co-designed with multi-disciplinary stakeholder groups, to capture and analyse complex mental health and suicide prevention regional planning problems. The model can be used by WentWest - Western Sydney Primary Health Network as a decision support tool to guide the commissioning of future service activity, and more efficiently frame the monitoring and evaluation of interventions as they are implemented in Western Sydney.

AB The suicide rate for ages 15-24 increased recently in South Korea. The purpose of this study was to understand the suicidal ideation using the qualitative content analysis in South Korean college students. The data were collected with non-structured open questions in 134 college students and were analyzed with qualitative content analysis. The collected materials were classified 2 categories, 6 themes, and 21 theme clusters. Two categories are emerged: (1) facilitators of suicidal ideation, and (2) inhibitors of suicidal ideation. This study identified that the facilitators of suicidal ideation are physical, psychological and societal concerns, and suggested that the inhibitors of suicidal ideation are influenced by religious and cultural context. These results presented that Buddhism and Confucianism had influence on reasons to not attempting suicide behavior as the inhibitor of suicidal ideation. In conclusion, cultural context should be considered to develop strategies for the suicide prevention in South Korean college student. (C) 2010 Royal College of Nursing, Australia.

   UNEMPLOYMENT; TRENDS; QUEST; BIRTH
AB Birth cohort effects in suicide rates are well established, but to date there is no methodological approach or framework to test the temporal stability of these effects. We use the APC-Detrended (APCD) model to robustly estimate intensity of cohort effects identifying non-linear trends (or 'detrended' fluctuations) in suicide rates. The new APC-Hysteresis (APCH) model tests temporal stability of cohort effects. Analysing suicide rates in 25 WHO countries (periods 1970-74 to 2005-09; ages 20-24 to 70-79) with the APCD method, we find that country-specific birth cohort membership plays an important role in suicide rates. Among 25 countries, we detect 12 nations that show deep contrasts among cohort-specific suicide rates including Italy, Australia and the United States. The APCH method shows that cohort fluctuations are not stable across the life course but decline in Spain, France and Australia, whereas they remain stable in Italy, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. We discuss the Spanish case with elevated suicide mortality of cohorts born 1965-1975 which declines with age, and the opposite case of the United States, where the identified cohort effects of those born around 1960 increase smoothly, but statistically significant across the life course.

AB Purpose of reviewTo provide an update on recent studies on suicide prevention in indigenous populations with a focus on recently colonised indigenous peoples in Canada, the United States, Australia and New Zealand.Recent findingsThere have been several recent reviews on suicide prevention in indigenous populations with high suicide rates. However most of them describe the problem and there is little new that is available on effective interventions. One randomized controlled trial of a package of measures focusing on cultural identity in Maori who had recently self-harmed compared to usual care found little effect on suicidal behavior but it did significantly reduce presentations to hospital for any reason after one year.SummaryThe reasons for the limited evidence include a lack of ring fenced funding and a lack of research infrastructure; the problem of high rates of suicide but small numbers; and the difficulty in creating effective collaborations between researchers and communities. Potential solutions include identifying specific research funding; improving capacity in indigenous research; putting effort into accurate identification and recording of ethnicity; and thinking about the problem of suicide in recently colonised populations as a global problem to enable large scale high quality studies to take place.

AB We sought to compare clusters of suicidal events between two different time periods and examine the extent to which earlier clusters predict later clusters. We included data on suicides and suicide attempts from New South Wales between July 2001 and June 2012 and Western Australia between January 2000 and December 2011. Suicide attempts included admissions to hospital for deliberate self-harm and suicides were deaths due to deliberate self-harm. We combined data on suicides and suicide attempts and grouped them into two equal time periods. We detected clusters in each period using Poisson discrete scan statistics adjusted for socio-economic status. We estimated the predictive values of earlier clusters on later clusters. The results showed that clusters from earlier time period had a moderate power (36%) in predicting later clusters. During the later time period, some additional cluster areas (14%) were found and some earlier cluster areas subsided (64%). Historical clusters predict 36% of the subsequent clusters, which is probably not sufficient for targeting interventions. Our study highlights the need for other strategies to detect emerging clusters, for example, up-to-date data.

Several countries had an obvious decline in firearm suicides: Norway, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia; and New Zealand. Multilevel modeling of longitudinal data confirmed the effect of the proportion of households owning firearms. Legislation and regulatory measures reducing the availability of firearms in private households can distinctly strengthen the prevention of firearm suicides.

AB Objectives The pilot study were (1) to test the technical and administrative feasibility of a full-scale study, including recruitment process, response and retention rate, questionnaire design for an investigation to improve understanding of the suicide bereavement processes compared with bereavement by sudden deaths and (2) to present the differences and changes in the main outcomes-grief reactions of close relatives exposed to suicide and sudden death over 2 years.
   Design A longitudinal prospective study comparing bereavement by suicide to other types of sudden deaths over time (6, 12 and 24 months).
   Setting Queensland, Australia.
   Participants 25 suicide-bereaved and 15 sudden-death-bereaved persons.
   Outcome measures Grief reactions (measured with the Grief Experience Questionnaire).
   Results The response rate was 52.1% in the suicide bereaved and 45.5% in the sudden-death group. There was a small number of dropouts, with the retention rate over 85% for both groups. Linear mixed modelling for repeated measures showed a significant group effect (higher in suicide bereaved) for total grief, responsibility, rejection and unique reactions. A significant time effect (reduction) was measured for total grief, somatic reactions, general grief reactions and search for explanation. One significant time and group interaction was measured; rejection showed a decline in suicide and an increase in sudden-death bereaved.
   Conclusions The pilot study presented the appropriateness of the study methodology. This type of study has implications for counselling and treating people bereaved by suicide and for designing postvention activities.

AB Background: Indigenous young people have significantly higher suicide rates than their non-indigenous counterparts. There is a need for culturally appropriate and effective suicide prevention programs for this demographic. Aims: This review assesses suicide prevention programs that have been evaluated for indigenous youth in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. Method: The databases MEDLENE and PsycINFO were searched for publications on suicide prevention programs targeting indigenous youth that include reports on evaluations and outcomes. Program content, indigenous involvement, evaluation design, program implementation, and outcomes were assessed for each article. Results: The search yielded 229 articles; 90 abstracts were assessed, and 11 articles describing nine programs were reviewed. Two Australian programs and seven American programs were included. Programs were culturally tailored, flexible, and incorporated multiple-levels of prevention. No randomized controlled trials were found, and many programs employed ad hoc evaluations, poor program description, and no process evaluation. Conclusion: Despite culturally appropriate content, the results of the review indicate that more controlled study designs using planned evaluations and valid outcome measures are needed in research on indigenous youth suicide prevention. Such changes may positively influence the future of research on indigenous youth suicide prevention as the outcomes and efficacy will be more reliable.

AB Objective Gender ratios of suicide rates differ greatly across countries. Victoria has a high male: female ratio in suicide that is typical in English-speaking and European countries, while in Hong Kong the low ratio is similar to other SouthEast Asian countries. This study investigates the effect of gender in the psychiatric and non-psychiatric populations to examine how psychiatric history may modulate the effect of gender in these two different communities. Method Review of coronial documentation of all suicide cases in 2000 in Hong Kong and Victoria, Australia. Log-linear model was used to test the gender-psychiatric history-location interaction. Results Gender difference in suicide was narrower in victims with psychiatric history than those without in both communities, albeit gender remained to have an effect even among those with a psychiatric history in Victoria. The impact of cultural-and gender-specific factors is most apparent in suicide cases with no prior psychiatric history in Victoria: the male: female ratio was as high as 8: 1 in this group of victims. Log-linear model results show that the gender-psychiatric history-location interaction was statistically significant. Conclusions The gender differentials in suicide rates in these two communities are mainly driven by gender's effect in the population with no psychiatric history. Severe clinical conditions can override some, but not all, of gender's effects in Victoria. Suicide prevention effort should target gender-specific factors to prevent suicides in men without history of psychiatric disorders.

   mental illness; suicide
ID DEPRESSION; REGISTER
AB Introduction: Maternal mortality in Singapore, as in other developed countries, has remained low in the past decade. In the United Kingdom and Australia, maternal deaths from suicide and psychiatric causes have been the leading cause of maternal mortality, and there have therefore been comprehensive healthcare programmes to address the mental health needs of mothers.
   Methods: In this study, we looked at maternal deaths from 2000 to 2004, by linking coronial cases of female suicide in the reproductive age group 15-45 years, with the birth registration database, to identify both early and late maternal deaths.
   Results: There was only one identified maternal death among 589 female suicides aged 15-45 years, occurring in a teenager within the first month postpartum. There was likely also another case that was unconfirmed and unreported.
   Conclusion: From this preliminary study, suicide and psychiatric causes are not significant causes of maternal mortality in Singapore. However, given that the epidemiology of postnatal depression statistics mirror that of the other countries, it is possible that maternal suicides have been under-reported, and the load may well be higher. There is a need for a similar confidential enquiry into maternal deaths to be set up here, as is already in place in various countries, notably the United Kingdom and Australia, for the past decade.

Participants. Two hundred and twenty-three methadone maintenance patients. Findings. Forty per cent of participants reported a history of at least one suicide attempt. Females were significantly more likely than males to have attempted suicide (50% vs. 31%), and to have done so on more than one occasion (28% vs. 15%). There was a large difference between males and females in the onset of attempted suicide. Females reported an initial attempt, on average, 6 years earlier than males (18.3 vs. 24.7 years), and were significantly more likely than males to have attempted suicide prior to the onset of heroin use (69% vs. 11%). While heroin overdose was common among the sample (66%), the most common methods employed for suicide attempts were overdose of a non-opioid drug (21%) and slitting of wrists (20%). A deliberate heroin overdose as a means of attempted suicide was reported by 10% of participants. Heroin overdoses appeared overwhelmingly to be accidental. Ninety-two per cent of those who had overdosed reported that their most recent overdose was accidental. Conclusions. Attempted suicide presents a major clinical problem to staff at drug treatment programmes, but one distinct from heroin overdose. While both overdose and suicide present increasing clinical problems, they are separate problems, and require different responses.

AB Investigating suicides following the death of Robin Williams, a beloved actor and comedian, on August 11th, 2014, we used time-series analysis to estimate the expected number of suicides during the months following Williams' death. Monthly suicide count data in the US (1999-2015) were from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-ranging ONline Data for Epidemiologic Research (CDC WONDER). Expected suicides were calculated using a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving averages model to account for both the seasonal patterns and autoregression. Time-series models indicated that we would expect 16,849 suicides from August to December 2014; however, we observed 18,690 suicides in that period, suggesting an excess of 1,841 cases (9.85% increase). Although excess suicides were observed across gender and age groups, males and persons aged 30 +/- 44 had the greatest increase in excess suicide events. This study documents associations between Robin Williams' death and suicide deaths in the population thereafter.

AB Farmers and farm workers have been recognized as a group at high risk of suicide in Australia. This study aims to identify and better understand environmental factors associated with suicide among Australian farmers and farm workers. Qualitative analysis was undertaken in accordance with the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research. Male and female focus groups were conducted separately with people who lived or worked on a farm in six farming communities. Qualitative analyses showed that a number of environmental influences may contribute to the increased risk of suicide: extreme climatic events; isolation; service availability; access to, and frequent use of firearms; death and suffering of animals; government and legislation; technology; and property values. Both the physical and socio-cultural environments in which farmers operate appear to contribute to farmer suicide and need to be considered in suicide prevention.

DE suicide; mortality; Australia
ID TRENDS; AVAILABILITY; RATES; YOUTH
AB To identify secular change in Australian suicide mortality over the period 1907-1998 and to seek possible explanations, a descriptive epidemiological study was conducted. Deaths due to suicide from 1907 to 1998 were identified according to the ICD-9. Trends in overall annual suicide mortality rates for all causes and individual causes were examined using the three-year moving average method, standardised by age and sex. Secular trends for mortality over the study period were examined in various age groups, using linear regression to test the slope. The results indicated that there has been a decline in overall age and sex standardised mortality from suicide over the study period. The death rate dropped from 15.2 per 100,000 in the early century to 13.9 per 100,000 in late century. Despite the overall decline, the female suicide mortality rates increased over the study period. Male suicide mortality rates were significantly higher than female rates over the study period (P<0.0001). Increased suicide rates were observed in the 15-24 and 25-44 year old age groups for both males and females. The group of 65+ year old females also bad increased rates. Decreased rates were observed in both the male and female 45-64 year old age group and in the 65+ year old male age group. The three most common suicide methods used by males in 1907 were guns, poisoning and banging, while for females they were drowning, banging and poisoning. In 1998 they were changed to banging, gas and guns for males and banging, gas and drowning and poisoning (equally third) for females. These trends can be attributed to numerous factors such as economic crisis, world wars, the availability of suicide methods, a person's gender.

AB Suicide attempt rates are on the rise in predominantly Islamic Republic of Pakistan. However, there exists an indigenous academic apathy toward exploring media-suicide relationships. This study, using content analysis and interviews, examines the lack of compliance with international ethical guidelines for suicide reporting by Pakistani newspapers. In 553 reported suicide cases, 2,355 guideline violations were detected. The overall tone of suicide news stories remained overwhelmingly irresponsible, and analysis indicates that both Urdu and English language newspapers made similar violations. Largely ignorant of international standards, Pakistani journalists report attempted suicide cases just like any other crime. This study suggests a prompt action on the part of appropriate bodies to amend relevant codes of ethics and eventually educate relevant journalist fraternities to report suicides in a socially responsible way.

AB The mental deterioration of the so called legacy caseload' (asylum seekers who arrived in Australia by boat between August 2012-December 2013) has become a national concern and is garnering international attention. Prolonged uncertainty is contributing to mental deterioration and despair. There have been at least 11 deaths by suicide since June 2014. Social support services have been limited and legal assistance in short supply; this is associated with lengthy delays with visa applications. Thwarted belongingness, purpose and identity, a shortage of available services, and barriers to legal support for processes attendant upon Refugee Status Determination increase the likelihood that the mental health of asylum seekers will deteriorate further, potentially developing into worsening decline, which will lead to increased self-harm and suicide. This article summarises recent suicide deaths in Australia, positing practical assistance and support for asylum seekers living in the community. Therapeutic engagement should be trauma-informed wherever possible, helping asylum seekers to reframe their sense of lethal hopelessness.

AB Background: We aimed to estimate the prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt among prisoners in New South Wales, Australia; and, among prisoners reporting suicidal ideation, to identify factors associated with suicide attempt.
   Methods: A cross-sectional design was used. Participants were a random, stratified sample of 996 inmates who completed a telephone survey. The estimated population prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt were calculated and differences by sex and Aboriginality were tested using chi(2) tests. Correlates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt were tested using logistic regression.
   Results: One-third of inmates reported lifetime suicidal ideation and one-fifth had attempted suicide. Women and Aboriginal participants were significantly more likely than men and non-Aboriginal participants, respectively, to report attempting suicide. Correlates of suicidal ideation included violent offending, traumatic brain injury, depression, self-harm, and psychiatric hospitalisation. Univariate correlates of suicide attempt among ideators were childhood out-of-home care, parental incarceration and psychiatric hospitalization; however, none of these remained significant in a multivariate model.
   Conclusions: Suicidal ideation and attempts are highly prevalent among prisoners compared to the general community. Assessment of suicide risk is a critical task for mental health clinicians in prisons. Attention should be given to ensuring assessments are gender-and culturally sensitive. Indicators of mental illness may not be accurate predictors of suicide attempt. Indicators of childhood trauma appear to be particularly relevant to risk of suicide attempt among prisoners and should be given attention as part of risk assessments.

   EXPERIENCES; PROVISION
AB Background: There is limited information available regarding community pharmacists' stigma of suicide. Pharmacists regularly interact with people at risk of suicide and stigmatizing attitudes may impact care. Objective: To measure community pharmacists' stigma of suicide. Method: Pharmacists in Canada and Australia completed an online survey with the Stigma of Suicide Scale-Short Form. Data were analysed descriptively and with univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Three hundred and ninety-six pharmacists returned completed surveys (Canada n = 235; Australia n = 161; female 70%; mean age = 38.6 +/- 12.7 years). The rate of endorsement of stigmatizing terms was low overall. Canadian and Australian pharmacists differed (p < 0.05) for several variables (e.g. age, friend or relative with a mental illness, training in mental health crisis). Pharmacists without someone close to them living with a mental illness were more likely to strongly agree/agree with words describing those who die by suicide as pathetic, stupid, irresponsible, and cowardly. Those without a personal diagnosis of mental illness strongly agreed/agreed with the terms immoral, irresponsible, vengeful, and cowardly. More Australian pharmacists strongly agreed/agreed that people who die by suicide are irresponsible, cowardly, and disconnected. Independent variables associated with a higher stigma were male sex, Australian, and negative perceptions about suicide preventability. Conclusion: Community pharmacists frequently interact with people at risk of suicide and generally have low agreement of stigmatizing terms for people who die by suicide. Research should focus on whether approaches such as contact-based education can minimize existing stigma.

AB Suicide in men is a global public health problem with complex etiologies. Numerous risk factors have been identified for suicide, with the most commonly cited being depression. Primary care physicians are well placed to help combat high suicide rates in men. They are often the first point of contact, provide continuity of care, are available in times of crisis, and have prior knowledge of the patient and local community. Many patients who commit suicide visit their primary care physician in the period immediately before death. This article aims to help primary care physicians minimize male suicide risk through better understanding of male suicidal behavior, active management of depression, and thorough assessment of suicide risk.

ID MASCULINITIES
AB The rate of suicide amongst Australia's rural men is significantly higher than rural women, urban men or urban women. There are many explanations for this phenomenon including higher levels of social isolation, lower socio-economic circumstances and ready access to firearms. Another factor is the challenge of climate transformation for farmers. In recent times rural areas of Australia have been subject to intense climate change events including a significant drought that has lingered on for over a decade. Climate variability together with lower socio-economic conditions and reduced farm production has combined to produce insidious impacts on the health of rural men. This paper draws on research conducted over several years with rural men working on farms to argue that attention to the health and well-being of rural men requires an understanding not only of these factors but also of the cultural context, inequitable gender relations and a dominant form of masculine hegemony that lauds stoicism in the face of adversity. A failure to address these factors will limit the success of health and welfare programs for rural men. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Firearm related deaths: the impact of regulatory reform
SO INJURY PREVENTION
LA English
DT Article
ID GUN OWNERSHIP; SUICIDE; HOMICIDE; LEGISLATION; HOME
AB Objectives: To examine trends in rates of firearm related deaths in Victoria, Australia, over 22 years in the context of legislative reform and describe and investigate impact measures to explain trends.
   Design: Mortality data were extracted from vital statistics for 1979-2000. Data on firearm related deaths that were unintentional deaths, assaults, suicides, and of undetermined intent were analyzed. Rates were calculated with population data derived from estimates by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. A quasi-experimental design that used a Poisson regression model was adopted to compare relative rates of firearm related deaths for Victoria and the rest of Australia over three critical periods of legislative reform. The Wilcoxon signed ranks test was used to assess changes in the types of firearm related deaths before and after 1998.
   Results: In Victoria, two periods of legislative reform related to firearms followed mass shooting events in 1988 and 1996. A national firearm amnesty and buyback scheme followed the latter. Victorian and Australian rates of firearm related deaths before reforms (1979-86) were steady. After initial Victorian reforms, a significant downward trend was seen for numbers of all firearm related deaths between 1988 and 1995 (17.3% in Victoria compared with the rest of Australia, p<0.0001). A further significant decline between 1997 and 2000 followed the later reforms. After the later all state legislation, similar strong declines occurred in the rest of Australia from 1997 (14.0% reduction compared with Victoria, p = 0.0372). Victorian reductions were observed in frequencies of firearm related suicides, assaults, and unintentional deaths before and after the 1988 reforms, but statistical significance was reached only for suicide.
   Conclusion: Dramatic reductions in overall firearm related deaths and particularly suicides by firearms were achieved in the context of the implementation of strong regulatory reform.

TI Crafting safe and effective suicide prevention media messages: outcomes
   from a workshop in Australia
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
ID MENTAL-HEALTH; CAMPAIGN
AB Background: Suicide and suicide-related behaviours are major public health concerns in Australia and worldwide. One universal intervention that has received an increased focus as a means of preventing suicide is the use of media campaigns. There is, however, a lack of understanding of the kinds of campaign messages that are safe and effective. The current paper aims to expand on this knowledge. The study objectives were to: (1) explore what suicide prevention experts consider to be essential characteristics of effective and safe suicide media campaigns; (2) develop suicide prevention media messages; and (3) explore the impact that these messages might have on different audiences.
   Methods: We conducted a workshop in July 2015 which was attended by 21 experts (professionals with knowledge about suicide prevention and/or media campaigns, and people with a lived experience of suicide). The experts were split into three groups, and each group developed a suicide prevention message for one of the following target audiences: people at risk of suicide; family and peers of people at risk of suicide; and people bereaved by suicide.
   Results: The three groups generally agreed that these messages had to include two key characteristics: (1) validate or reflect the target group's issues and needs; and (2) promote help-seeking behaviours. They noted, however, that messages that might have a positive impact for one target audience might inadvertently have a negative impact for other target audiences. In particular, they were concerned that messages designed for family and peers about being supportive and looking for warning signs might leave those who had been bereaved by suicide feeling isolated, guilty or traumatised. Workshop participants highlighted that gaps exist in relation to the use of appropriate language, were unsure of how to create destigmatising messages without normalising or sensationalising suicide and commented on the lack of evaluative evidence for the efficacy of media campaigns.
   Conclusions: Developing suicide prevention messages is complex and target and non-target audiences may interpret these messages differently to the way they were intended and the impact of such messaging may be detrimental. Caution needs to be applied when developing suicide prevention messages.

TI The decline in Australian young male suicide
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE suicide; unemployment; youth; Australia; prevention; men
ID UNEMPLOYMENT; ASSOCIATION; PREVENTION; DEPRESSION; HEALTH; TRENDS
AB Since the late 1990s there has been a sharp downward trend in Australian young male suicide. It is possible that a major government youth suicide prevention initiative, the National Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy (NYSPS), implemented during 1995-1999 may have influenced the decline. In this article, we examine time trends in age- and means-specific male and female Australian suicide rates in relation to unemployment rates and the NYSPS. Based on Australian suicide data over the period 1966-2003, we assess secular changes in the 20-24 year male suicide to total (crude) male suicide rate ratio in relation to the NYSPS, using interrupted time series analysis (ARIMA), since this was previously found to be significantly associated with the 20-24 year male unemployment to total employment ratio.
   Results show that a dramatic reduction in Australian young male (aged 20-34 years) suicide has occurred since 1997-1998, declining from approximately 40 per 100,000 in 1997-1998 to approximately 20 per 100,000 in 2003. Most of the decline is due to a decrease in suicide by hanging and to a lesser extent from motor vehicle carbon monoxide and other gases. Further, the previously established strong secular association (lasting over 3 decades from 1966) between the rate ratio of 20-24 year male suicide to total (crude) male suicide, and the rate ratio of 20-24 year male unemployment to total unemployment, appears to have been disrupted. ARIMA modelling of the suicide ratio against the initiative indicates a highly significant statistical association between the NYSPS and the suicide ratio reduction but not between the NYSPS and the unemployment indicator trend, suggesting a break in the link between young male suicide and unemployment. The recent sudden turnaround in Australian young male suicide trends and its extent appears to preclude explanations centring on slow-moving social indices traditionally associated with suicide, or on possible cohort effects. This sudden decrease has occurred mainly in non-impulsive means, and at the same time has broken a long-standing secular link between 20 and 24year-male suicide and unemployment, lending plausibility to the case for the NYSPS having had an impact on young male suicide in Australia.

AB Objective The aims of this study were to (1) investigate levels and correlates of suicide stigma and suicide literacy in a sample of individuals attending a tertiary depression clinic in Australia (N = 287), with comparison to a community-based Australian sample (N = 1,410), and (2) validate measures of suicide stigma and literacy in a clinical sample. Method Australian adults (N = 287) aged 18-78 years referred by their general practitioners for assessment at a psychiatric clinic for patients with difficult-to-treat mood disorders were recruited to complete a survey, including measures of suicide literacy, suicide stigma, mental health symptoms, and demographics. Results Compared to the Australian community sample, participants in the clinical sample reported lower suicide literacy, lower suicide stigma, greater glorification of suicide, and greater attribution of suicide to isolation. Suicide ideation was associated with greater glorification of suicide. Females had higher suicide literacy and lower suicide stigma than males. The psychometric properties of the suicide stigma measure appeared to be robust and consistent with previous evaluations. Conclusion Given the low levels of suicide literacy in this clinical sample, suicide prevention initiatives designed for community settings may also be important in clinical settings.

AB Introduction Research on suicide in childhood and early adolescence is sparse. We investigated suicide cases of children and young adolescents in terms of prevalence, gender differences, suicide methods and monthly distribution during a period of 32 years. Methods Registered suicides aged 14 or younger occurring between 1970 and 2001 (n = 275) in Austria were studied. Results The mean suicide rate for 10 to 14-year-olds was 1.4 per 100,000 with a male-female ratio of 3.1:1. The total child and young adolescent suicide rate and boys' suicide rates decreased over the study period. However, there was no significant fluctuation in girls' suicide rates. Hanging was the predominant suicide method in both genders. Use of this method decreased steadily over the study period, whereas the percentage of suicides by other methods, i.e., jumping and firearms suicides increased. Greater number of suicides in children and young adolescents was observed during the months of April/May and October/November. Conclusion Suicide rates of children and young adolescents in Austria are on the decrease, in accordance with a reported decrease in the general suicide rate in Austria.

That young offenders area high-risk population is confirmed, with a quarter of the youths reporting recent suicidal ideation and more than a quarter reporting having made a suicide attempt. Past suicide attempts are significantly predictive of fixture suicide attempts. Other variables both concurrently and prospectively associated with suicidal behaviors (even after controlling for prior suicide attempt status) are substance use, prolonged dysphoric mood, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder signs, and having a bad temper. These variables not only have predictive value but should also be considered as appropriate targets when intervening to reduce suicide risk. It is suggested that impulsiveness is art underlying common factor.

ID FIREARM-RELATED DEATHS; UNITED-STATES; FATALITIES
AB Two cases are reported from South Australia, where deaths occurred that were due to single self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the head in individuals who were visiting indoor firearm ranges. Case 1: A 54-year-old man visiting an indoor firing range placed a .357 magnum handgun to his head and fired one shot. Case 2: A 23-year-old woman who was being instructed in firearm usage at an indoor firing range placed a 9 mm handgun to her head and fired one shot. In both cases, deaths were due to cerebral laceration with skull fracture. Firing ranges may be utilized by individuals who are seeking weapons for suicide attempts, and suicide may be successfully undertaken at such locations even while a victim is under direct supervision. In jurisdictions, where firearm ownership is strictly legislated, it may be that clubs can inadvertently provide access to firearms for this type of activity.

AB Nonfatal heroin overdoses and suicide attempts are both common among heroin addicts, but there is limited knowledge about the association between them. The sample in the present study consisted of 149 regular heroin users in Malmo, Sweden. Out of these 98 had taken an unintentional heroin overdose at some time and 51 had made at least one attempt to commit suicide (but not using heroin). Suicide attempts were significantly more common among those who had taken unintentional overdoses as compared with those who had never taken any overdose (p < 0.01). The more overdoses, the greater the risk of suicide attempt.

DE alcohol; drugs; suicide; completed suicide
ID DEATHS
AB Background: The association between substance use and suicide is well-established, but evidence is scant regarding the relationship between the number, type, and level of substances and other risk factors in completed suicide across the lifespan. Aims: To examine the relationship between social/demographic characteristics and the number, type, and level of drugs present in an unrestricted age sample of completed suicides in Australia. Method: An analysis was undertaken of 893 substance-related suicides using data from the Government Statistician's Office for the years 1989-1992. Results: The number and type of substances present in suicide victims was related to the individual's gender, age, marital status, employment status, and method of suicide. Blood alcohol level was significantly different between the methods of suicide, but was unrelated to demographic characteristics of the individual. The level of antidepressants and minor tranquilizers in the individuals was also unrelated to demographic characteristics. Conclusion: Examination of the type and number of substances present in completed suicides is an important component in creating profiles of potential suicide victims.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate some features of suicide cases in Trakya region, Turkey. During the 21-year period from January 1984 to September 2004, there were 137 suicide cases autopsied by the Department of Forensic Medicine, Trakya University. Suicides comprised 16.1% of all forensic autopsies. Twenty-seven per cent of the cases were aged between 21 and 30 years and the mean age was 39.7 years. Males constituted 78.1% of the cases. The most frequent method of suicide was hanging (40.1%), followed by firearms, and poisoning. Overall, suicide rates in males showed an increase in the last five years. Most of the suicides occurred in the winter months.
   In conclusion, since suicides present a major public health problem, detection and prevention methods must be developed for high-risk groups.

SO JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID RECORD LINKAGE; EX-PRISONERS; MORTALITY; DEATH; RISK; PEOPLE; WALES
AB Background Previous research has demonstrated elevated mortality following release from prison. We contrasted the risk of opioid overdose death with the risk of suicide in a cohort of adults released from prison in Queensland, Australia over a 14-year-period. We examine risk factors for suicide in the cohort, and make comparisons with the general population.
   Method We constructed a retrospective cohort of all adults released from prison between 1994 and 2007 and linked this to the National Death Index for deaths up to 31 December 2007.
   Results We identified 41 970 individuals released from prison. Of the 2158 deaths in the community, 371 were suicides (crude mortality rate (CMR) 13.7/10 000 person-years) and 396 were due to drug-related causes (CMR 14.6/10 000 person-years). We observed a spike in drug-related deaths in the first 2 weeks after release from prison but no such pattern was observed for suicide. Being married (HR 0.40) and number of prior imprisonments (HR 3.1 for >= 5 prior incarcerations compared with none) independently predicted suicide. Age, sex, Indigenous status, length of incarceration and offence history were not associated with suicide. The standardised mortality ratios indicated that released women were 14.2 times and released men 4.8 times more likely to die from suicide than would be expected in the population.
   Conclusions This study demonstrates that the rate of suicide in adults released from prison is similar to the rate of drug-related deaths. Strategies that provide support to vulnerable people after release may reduce suicide in this population.

AB South Korea exhibited the highest crude suicide rate in the world. To better understand this phenomenon, the author analyzed all suicides in South Korea from 1997 to 2015 and charted the trend in suicide methods by gender. Over time, both genders rapidly chose hanging for suicide at the expense of drug/pesticide poisoning. Gassing was hardly used in the beginning, but its recent gain in use is noteworthy. Including undetermined deaths did not change the main results. The author regressed hanging on demographics and found that hanging was particularly chosen by ever-married men of prime working age with a respectable level of education.

AB Objective: Suicide and attempted suicide are common in individuals with schizophrenia, and evidence exists for a link between substance use disorders and suicidality in this disorder. However, alcohol has not been consistently implicated. We examined the relationship between substance use disorders and suicide attempts in schizophrenia.
   Methods: We recruited a schizophrenia sample in Australia (n = 821) for genetic analyses. We analysed demographic and clinical variables, including substance use disorders, and their relationship to suicide attempts using generalised equation modelling.
   Results: A significant association was identified between lifetime alcohol abuse/dependence and suicide attempts (OR = 1.66; 95% CI, 1.23 to 2.24; p= 0.001) after adjustment for potential confounders, but not between cannabis abuse/dependence and suicide attempts, nor between other illicit drug abuse/dependence and suicide attempts. Polysubstance abuse/dependence was also not implicated.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that the presence of alcohol abuse/dependence may be a risk factor for suicide attempts in individuals with schizophrenia, independent of comorbid substance abuse/dependence.

AB Suicide rates are high in later life, particularly among older men. Mood disorders are known risk factors, but the risk of suicide associated with poor physical health remains unclear. We completed a cohort study of a community representative sample of 38,170 men aged 65-85 in 1996 who were followed for up to 16 years. Data on suicide attempts and completion were obtained from the Western Australia Data Linkage System, as was information about medical and mental health diagnoses. 240 (0.6%) participants had a recorded history of past suicide attempt, most commonly by poisoning (85%). Sixty-nine men died by suicide during follow up (0.3% of all deaths), most often by hanging (50.7%). Age-adjusted competing risk regression showed that past suicide attempt was not a robust predictor of future suicide completion (sub-hazard ratio, SHR = 1.58, 95% CI = 0.39, 6.42), but bipolar (SHR = 7.82, 95% CI = 3.08, 19.90), depressive disorders (SHR = 2.26, 95% CI = 1.14, 4.51) and the number of health systems affected by disease (SHR for 3-4 health systems = 6.02, 95% CI = 2.69, 13.47; SHR for = 5 health systems= 11.18, 95% CI= 4.89, 25.53) were. The population fraction of suicides attributable to having 5 or more health systems affected by disease was 79% (95% CI = 57%, 90%), and for any mood disorder (bipolar or depression) it was 17% (95% CI= 3%, 28%). Older Australian men with multiple health morbidities have the highest risk of death by suicide, even after taking into account the presence of mood disorders. Improving the overall health of the population may be the most effective way of decreasing the rates of suicide in later life. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB It is well known that certain types of media reports about suicide can result in imitative suicides. In the last two decades, Japan has experienced two suicide epidemics and the subsequent excessive media coverage of these events. However, the quality of the media suicide reports has yet to be evaluated in terms of the guidelines for media suicide coverage. Thus, the present study analyzed Japanese newspaper articles (n = 4007) on suicides by charcoal burning or hydrogen sulfide gas between 11 February 2003 and 13 March 2010. The suicide reports were evaluated in terms of the extent to which they conformed to the suicide reporting guidelines. The mean violation scores were 3.06 (+/- 0.7) for all articles, 3.2 (+/- 0.8) for articles about suicide by charcoal burning, and 2.9 (+/- 0.7) for articles about suicide by hydrogen sulfide (p < 0.001). With the exception of not following several recommendations, newspaper articles about suicide have improved in quality, as defined by the recommendations for media suicide coverage. To prevent imitative suicides based on media suicide reports, individuals in the media should try not to report suicide methods and to make attempts to report the poor condition of suicide survivors.

ID SEASONAL-VARIATION; AIDS; STATISTICS; AUSTRALIA; MODEL
AB This paper uses a semi-parametric method to examine the reporting delay distribution in suicides in Hong Kong reporting system. The data arise from a rightly truncated situation in which only suicide cases registered before a specific time are known to have occurred; otherwise they are not recorded in the known death files even if they have occurred. It is shown that the poisoning-related suicide deaths have a longer reporting delay than other suicide methods. By modelling the reporting delay function, a Horvitz-Thompson-type estimator is suggested to adjust for reporting delay and to provide a more timely estimate of the suicide incidences for monitoring the suicide problem in Hong Kong. Based on these analyses, we recommended a suitable cut-off date to collect suicide cases occurring in the previous year and reported before this date in Hong Kong.

AB Background: Rates of suicide appear to be increasing, indicating a critical need for more effective prevention initiatives. To increase the efficacy of future prevention initiatives, we examined the spatial distribution of suicide deaths and suicide attempts in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, to identify where high incidence 'suicide clusters' were occurring. Such clusters represent candidate regions where intervention is critically needed, and likely to have the greatest impact, thus providing an evidence-base for the targeted prioritisation of resources.
   Methods: Analysis is based on official suicide mortality statistics for NSW, provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and hospital separations for non-fatal intentional self-harm, provided through the NSW Health Admitted Patient Data Collection at a Statistical Area 2 (SA2) geography. Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques were applied to detect suicide clusters occurring between 2005 and 2013 (aggregated), for persons aged over 5 years. The final dataset contained 5466 mortality and 86,017 non-fatal intentional self-harm cases.
   Results: In total, 25 Local Government Areas were identified as primary or secondary likely candidate regions for intervention. Together, these regions contained approximately 200 SA2 level suicide clusters, which represented 46% (n = 39,869) of hospital separations and 43% (n = 2330) of suicide deaths between 2005 and 2013. These clusters primarily converged on the Eastern coastal fringe of NSW.
   Conclusions: Crude rates of suicide deaths and intentional self-harm differed at the Local Government Areas (LGA) level in NSW. There was a tendency for primary suicide clusters to occur within metropolitan and coastal regions, rather than rural areas. The findings demonstrate the importance of taking geographical variation of suicidal behaviour into account, prior to development and implementation of prevention initiatives, so that such initiatives can target key problem areas where they are likely to have maximal impact.

AB Effects of weather variables on suicide are well-documented, but there is still little consistency among the results of most studies. Nevertheless, most studies show a peak in suicides during the spring season, and this is often attributed to increased temperatures. The purpose of this study is to test the relationship between monthly temperature and monthly suicide, independent of months or seasons, for five counties located across the United States. Harmonic analysis shows that four of the five counties display some seasonal components in the suicide data. However, simple linear regression shows no correlation between suicide and temperature, and discriminant analysis shows that monthly departure from mean annual suicide rates is not a useful tool for identifying months with temperatures that are colder or warmer than the annual average. Therefore, it appears that the seasonality of suicides is due to factors other than temperature.

LA English
DT Article
DE Occupation; Suicide; Geographical location; Farming
ID MENTAL-HEALTH PROBLEMS; RURAL SUICIDE; MORTALITY; RISK
AB Purpose Elevated suicide rates among farmers have been observed across a number of countries, including Australia. However, studies on farmer suicide have typically treated farmers as a homogenous group, and have predominately been focussed at a national level. This overlooks potential variability in suicide rates (and, by extension, contributory factors) within different groups of farmers (for example, different age groups), as well as across different geographical locations.
   Methods Using a unique data source, the Queensland Suicide Register, the current study examined variation in farmer suicide rates by age, sex, and location within Queensland.
   Results Although farmer suicide rates varied substantially across different regions of Queensland, no significant associations were found between rates of farmer and non-farmer suicide, or between the proportion of farmers in a region and farmer suicide rates.
   Conclusions This suggests that farmer suicide may be characterised by unique combinations of occupational and location-related effects that are likely to vary substantially within and between different regions, and provides caution against treating farmer suicide as a homogenous phenomenon. The highest rates of farmer suicide were observed among younger farmers (aged 18-34 years), highlighting a need for targeted suicide prevention initiatives for this group.

AB Identification of the attitudes to consumers admitted to hospital following a suicide attempt and the therapeutic optimism of nurses caring for this cohort is vital to ascertain the level of nursing care provided. A convenience sample of 72 Registered and enrolled nurses from a large metropolitan health service in South Eastern Melbourne, Australia, completed a demographic questionnaire, the Elsom Therapeutic Optimism Scale (ETOS), and the Attitudes to Attempted Suicide-Questionnaire (ATAS-Q). Data were analysed using SPSS (version 25). Whilst the ETOS & ATAS-Q correlate positively, themes of shame, blame, misunderstandings, and myths about suicide influence nurses' perspectives when providing suicide attempt aftercare. This may potentially lead to care that is tokenistic and task focused. To develop their professional skill set when providing suicide attempt aftercare, nurses need both formal and informal education and opportunities to reflect on their practice.

AB Objective: Prior research has suggested an association between suicide and certain occupations. The aim of the present study was to report on suicide rates in selected occupations in Queensland (QLD).
   Method: Suicide mortality data from the QLD Suicide Register and population data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics were obtained for the period 1990-2006. Suicide rates were calculated for each occupational group and compared to rates within the general population (15-64 year age group) and the employed population of QLD.
   Results: There was significantly higher risk of suicide for male subjects in the agricultural, transport and construction sectors of QLD. High suicide rates were also found in female nurses, artists, agricultural workers and cleaners, while education professionals (of both genders) appeared at lower risk.
   Conclusions: The significantly higher suicide rates for employees of the agriculture, construction, and transport industries indicate a need for further research into the occupation-specific conditions and individual or other social-environmental factors that may accentuate suicide risk within these professions. Use of higher quality occupational data is also warranted in future studies.

AB Australia has one of the higher rates of suicide among young people. Although a role for doctors and teachers in the prevention of youth suicide has been suggested, no prior Australian study has assessed adequately the level of suicide knowledge held by these professionals. Knowledge about adolescent suicide was investigated using the Adolescent Suicide Behaviour Questionnaire, a 39-item instrument developed for the purpose. The stratified random sample comprised 404 general practitioners and 481 teachers from 56 secondary schools. General practitioners and teachers scored, on average, 71% and 59% of the questionnaire items correct, respectively. There was wide individual variability: The number of items correct ranged from 4 to 38 for general practitioners and 0 to 34 for teachers. Strengths and deficits in knowledge across the two professions are discussed in terms of the potential gatekeeping role of these professionals in suicide prevention.

AB The promotion of suicide and description of suicide methods on the Internet have led to widespread concern that legal control is mandated. Apart from value concerns pertaining to attitudes about suicide, the guarantee of freedom of expression presents a serious challenge to the introduction of restrictive laws. Recent developments in Australia and Europe are presented, noting jurisdictional complexity as an obstacle to effective application. Finally, scientific data of an epidemiological nature are revealed to be insufficient to warrant making causal assertions about the Internet and its relation to suicidal acts, including those of vulnerable populations. Recommendations are made with respect to public education, suicide prevention, and future research.

AB Background. A suicide cluster is defined as a higher number of observed cases occurring in space and/or time than would typically be expected. Previous research has largely focused on identifying clusters of suicides, while there has been comparatively limited research on clusters of suicide attempts. We sought to identify clusters of both types of behaviour, and having done that, identify the factors that distinguish suicide attempts inside a cluster from those that were outside a cluster.
   Methods. We used data from Western Australia from 2000 to 2011. We defined suicide attempts as admissions to hospital for deliberate self-harm and suicides as deaths due to deliberate self-harm. Using an analytic strategy that accounted for the repetition of attempted suicide within a cluster, we performed spatial-temporal analysis using Poisson discrete scan statistics to detect clusters of suicide attempts and clusters of suicides. Logistic regression was then used to compare clustered attempts with non-clustered attempts to identify risk factors for an attempt being in a cluster.
   Results. We detected 350 (1%) suicide attempts occurring within seven spatial-temporal clusters and 12 (0.6%) suicides occurring within two spatial-temporal clusters. Both of the suicide clusters were located within a larger but later suicide attempt cluster. In multivariate analysis, suicide attempts by individuals who lived in areas of low socioeconomic status had higher odds of being in a cluster than those living in areas of high socioeconomic status [odds ratio (OR) = 29.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 6.3-135.5]. A one percentage-point increase in the proportion of people who had changed address in the last year was associated with a 60% increase in the odds of the attempt being within a cluster (OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.29-1.98) and a one percentage-point increase in the proportion of Indigenous people in the area was associated with a 7% increase in the suicide being within a cluster (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.00-1.13). Age, sex, marital status, employment status, method of harm, remoteness, percentage of people in rented accommodation and percentage of unmarried people were not associated with the odds of being in a suicide attempt cluster.
   Conclusions. Early identification of and responding to suicide clusters may reduce the likelihood of subsequent clusters forming. The mechanisms, however, that underlie clusters forming is poorly understood.

AB Understanding the spatial distribution of suicide can inform the planning, implementation and evaluation of suicide prevention actions. No previous study has assessed spatial clustering of the different methods of suicide in Quebec. The aim of this study was to assess spatial clustering of suicide in Quebec between 2004 and 2007 and neighborhood level predictors of the clusters. Scan statistics was applied to detect clusters of suicides by method and by sex. Smoothed standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for suicide for each neighborhood were also estimated and their association with neighborhood characteristics was investigated using the Bayesian hierarchical spatial model. The pattern of suicide rate was different among men and women; men showed higher standardized mortality rates. The most likely clusters of suicide were found in remote rural areas. However, some neighborhoods in urban areas also had noticeable suicide clusters. Firearms suicide was most likely found in remote rural areas while poisoning and hanging suicide methods clustered in urban areas. These findings suggest that it is important to take geographical variations into account in national policy and health services planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Backgrounds: Whether suicide in China has significant seasonal variations is unclear. The aim of this study is to examine the seasonality of suicide in Shandong China and to assess the associations of suicide seasonality with gender, residence, age and methods of suicide.
   Methods: Three types of tests (Chi-square, Edwards' T and Roger's Log method) were used to detect the seasonality of the suicide data extracted from the official mortality data of Shandong Disease Surveillance Point (DSP) system. Peak/low ratios (PLRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to indicate the magnitude of seasonality.
   Results: A statistically significant seasonality with a single peak in suicide rates in spring and early summer, and a dip in winter was observed, which remained relatively consistent over years. Regardless of gender, suicide seasonality was more pronounced in rural areas, younger age groups and for non-violent methods, in particular, self-poisoning by pesticide.
   Conclusions: There are statistically significant seasonal variations of completed suicide for both men and women in Shandong, China. Differences exist between residence (urban/rural), age groups and suicide methods. Results appear to support a sociological explanation of suicide seasonality. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

LA English
DT Article
ID GENDER; WOMEN; AUSTRALIA; EQUALITY; RATES
AB The traditional view that modernization is likely to increase male vulnerability to suicide while protecting females from such self-destruction was offered by Durkheim (1951). This implies a theory of divergence of suicide rates such that the male-female suicide ratio should increase with modernization. Contemporary researchers have questioned whether modernization has had such an impact. We conducted a time series analysis of male and female suicide data to determine the impact on the suicide ratio for India for the years 1967 to 1997. We developed a modernization index comprised of urbanization, female literacy, and female work participation rates. Moreover, to improve methodological efficacy, we controlled for the passage of time. However, we found that there is no significant relationship between modernization and the male-female suicide ratio. Our conclusion is that using national male-female suicide ratios to determine modernization effects may mask significant regional gender and age differences, particularly in developing countries such as India.

AB Objective: This study aimed to identify stressors over-represented in the 12 months prior to death among 553 Victorian adults who died by suicide. Methods: Age- and sex-specific suicide rates and relative risks of suicide were calculated using numerator data on suicides occurring in 2013 by people with a given exposure sourced from the Victorian Suicide Register and denominator data on the total Victorian population with that exposure sourced from the 2014 Australian Bureau of Statistics General Social Survey. Results: Mental illness was associated with increased suicide risk among people of all age groups and both sexes. Alcohol and/or other drug problems were associated with increased risk for males and females of all ages, with the exceptions of the oldest males and females, and the youngest females. Trouble with the police was associated with increased risk among all but the oldest males, whereas among females it was associated with elevated risk in those aged 25-44 years and 65+ years.

AB Homicide-suicides, the murder of one or several individuals followed by the suicide of the perpetrator, are rare but have devastating effects on families and communities. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing perpetrators of homicide-suicides with perpetrators of simple homicides and suicides and examined the proportion of firearm use and its correlation with firearm availability. We searched Medline and Embase from inception to July 2012 and identified 27 eligible studies. Perpetrators of homicide-suicides were older and more likely to be male and married to or separated from their victims than perpetrator of simple homicides or suicides. Influence of alcohol and a history of domestic violence or unemployment were less prevalent in homicide-suicides than in homicides. The proportion of firearm use in homicide-suicides varied across countries and was highest in the USA, Switzerland and South Africa, followed by Australia, Canada, The Netherlands and England and Wales, with a strong correlation between the use of firearms and the level of civilian gun ownership in the country. Our results indicate that homicide-suicides represent a distinct entity, with characteristics distinguishing them both from homicides and suicides. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective. Suicide prevention, including among youth, has been a national priority in Australia for some time. Yet despite this, rates of suicide, and related behaviour, remain high. The aim of this study was to review all suicide-prevention research that had been conducted in Australia between January 2007 and December 2011, with a specific emphasis on studies relating to young people, in order to determine whether or not we are prioritising the sort of research that can adequately inform policy development and guide 'best practice'.
   Methods. Data were collected from two sources. First, several electronic databases were searched in October 2012 in order to identify published journal articles relating to suicide, written by Australian authors. Second, summary data obtained from the National Health and Medical Research Council, the Australian Rotary Health Research Fund and the Australian Research Council were examined in order to identify currently funded studies that relate to suicide. Studies were then classified according to whether or not they had a focus on youth, and according to research type, type of suicide-related behaviour under investigation and method of suicide.
   Results. There were 224 articles published and 12 grants funded that specifically focussed on suicide-related behaviour over the period January 2007 to December 2011. Of these, 47 articles (21%) and five funded grants (42%) focussed on young people. Youth studies, in particular those reported in the published articles, tended to be epidemiological in nature and only six of the published articles (13%) and two of the funded grants related to intervention studies.
   Conclusions. Although the focus on youth is welcome, the lack of intervention studies is disappointing. Given that rates of suicide and related behaviour remain high, there is a clear need for a stronger body of intervention research that can inform national policy, if we are to successfully develop effective approaches to reducing suicide risk.

AB In this ecological study, we attempt to quantify the extent to which differences in homicide and suicide death rates between three countries, and among states/provinces within those countries, may be explained by differences in their social, economic, and structural characteristics. We examine the relationship between state/province level measures of societal risk factors and state/province level rates of violent death (homicide and suicide) across Australia, Canada, and the United States. Census and mortality data from each of these three countries were used. Rates of societal level characteristics were assessed and included residential instability, self-employment, income inequality, gender economic inequity, economic stress, alcohol outlet density, and employment opportunities). Residential instability, self-employment, and income inequality were associated with rates of both homicide and suicide and gender economic inequity was associated with rates of suicide only. This study opens lines of inquiry around what contributes to the overall burden of violence-related injuries in societies and provides preliminary findings on potential societal characteristics that are associated with differences in injury and violence rates across populations.

AB The present study was designed to examine whether age, gender, and depression level may moderate the effect of exposure to suicide news on the suicidality of college students in Taiwan. A representative sample of 3,222 college students were recruited from Southern Taiwan with a total of 2,602 useable surveys returned. Results showed that only depression level reached a significant moderating effect and further examination showed that the exposure to suicide news significantly predicted suicidality solely in the severely depressed group.

TI Risk of suicide in cancer patients in Western Australia, 1981-2002
SO MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
LA English
DT Article
ID POPULATION; MORTALITY; DIAGNOSIS
AB Objective: To describe the incidence and risk of suicide in cancer patients in Western Australia from 1981 to 2002.
   Design, setting and patients: Retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with cancer in WA from 1981 to 2002, using data from the WA Linked Database.
   Main outcome measure: Age-standardised mortality ratios (SMRs).
   Results: A total of 121533 patients were diagnosed with cancer, corresponding to a total of 543 696 person-years at risk. There were 129 suicides in this group (108 in men). The SMR for suicide in cancer patients was 1.61 (95% Cl, 1.36-1.92). An initial period of peak risk was seen in the first 3 months after cancer diagnosis (SMR, 5.75; 95% Cl, 3.89-8.51), mainly in patients with a poor prognosis. A second peak period of risk was found to occur 12-14 months after diagnosis (SMR, 2.33; 95% Cl, 1.11-4.89) in those with a good or moderate prognosis.
   Conclusion: The rate of suicide in cancer patients in WA is low and represents an excess of two to three suicides per year, or 0.3% of all cancer deaths, comparable to studies in other Western countries. The risk is highest in the first 3 months after diagnosis, and a second period of increased risk 12-14 months after diagnosis may occur in response to cancer recurrence or treatment failure.

AB This paper presents a review of literature, research, and practice relating to suicide and intentional self-injury. It incorporates both an international perspective and a particular focus on Australia. The paper reviews the epidemiological knowledge base, noting its complexity and the ways in which risk factors may Vary with the population or subpopulation being studied. While much of the recent focus on suicide has been shaped by the increase in youth suicide, suicide remains a significant problem across all adult age groups. Hence. this paper discusses suicide across the life span, but also identifies youth suicide and Indigenous suicide as two areas of particular concern. In relation to Indigenous suicide, it is important to move from a national focus to examine regional suicide patterns and conditions of risk within particular communities. The paper considers core principles of clinical assessment and intervention, acknowledging the powerful emotions and sensitive, complex judgments involved in this work. Mental health service provision is briefly reviewed and issues of concern identified, ranging from gaps in services to the need for more research and training in referral processes. Conceptualisations of suicide prevention and postvention are outlined, noting considerable debate about preferred approaches and a clear need for careful evaluation.

AB Telephone counselling is an accessible and confidential means by which distressed young people can seek help. Telephone counselling services were funded under Australia's National Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy between 1997 and 2000. In this study, the effectiveness of telephone counselling for young people seeking help in the context of suicidal ideation or intent was evaluated in an investigation of calls made by suicidal young people to a telephone counselling service. Independent raters measured callers' suicidality and mental state at the beginning and, end of 100 taped counselling sessions. Changes in suicidality and mental state were measured using a reliable rating scale developed for the study. Significant decreases in suicidality and significant improvement in mental state were found to occur during the course of counselling sessions, suggesting positive immediate impact.-Limitations of the study with respect to longer-term outcomes and the relevance of the results for suicide prevention are discussed. Notwithstanding the study limitations, the results lend support for continuing development of hotline services.

AB Background: Suicide is a leading cause of death among Indigenous youth worldwide. The aim of this literature review was to determine the cultural appropriateness and identify evidence for the effectiveness of current gatekeeper suicide prevention training programs within the international Indigenous community.
   Method: Using a systematic strategy, relevant databases and targeted resources were searched using the following terms: 'suicide', 'gatekeeper', 'training', 'suicide prevention training', 'suicide intervention training' and 'Indigenous'. Other internationally relevant descriptors for the keyword "Indigenous" (e.g. "Maori", "First Nations", "Native American", "Inuit", "Metis" and "Aboriginal") were also used.
   Results: Six articles, comprising five studies, met criteria for inclusion; two Australian, two from USA and one Canadian. While pre and post follow up studies reported positive outcomes, this was not confirmed in the single randomised controlled trial identified. However, the randomised controlled trial may have been underpowered and contained participants who were at higher risk of suicide pre-training.
   Conclusion: Uncontrolled evidence suggests that gatekeeper training may be a promising suicide intervention in Indigenous communities but needs to be culturally tailored to the target population. Further RCT evidence is required.

AB Retrospective review of 100 consecutive, nondecomposed cases of suicide because of hanging was conducted at Forensic Science SA, Australia. Alcohol was detected in 38 cases (38%). The percentage of victims who had ingested alcohol significantly decreased with age (r(2) = 0.81), with alcohol detected in 57.1% of those aged <= 24 years, compared to 28.5% of those aged between 55 and 64 years, and 0% of those aged >= 65 years. A similar linear relationship between alcohol ingestion and age was found for cases with blood alcohol levels > 0.05 g/100 mL (r(2) = 0.73). The mean ages of those with detectable alcohol (35.2 years) levels > 0.05 g/100 mL (35.1 years) and levels > 0.1 g/100 mL (37.2 years) were all significantly less than in those with no detectable alcohol (44.4 years) (p < 0.005, < 0.005, < 0.05 respectively). A clear relationship between alcohol ingestion and younger age was shown in hanging suicides.

AB Objectives The answer to the question whether suicide rates are higher in urban than in rural areas may have changed over the years. This study analyzes the longitudinal trends of rural and urban suicides in Austria from 1970 to 2005. The most recent decade, 1995-2005 was also investigated cross-sectionally in terms of age groups, gender, suicide methods and family status. Methods Official suicide statistics were calculated in a Poisson regression model to determine trends in suicide rates according to gender in rural and urban regions as well as the ratios of rural- to urban-suicide rates. Population density levels were used as a measure of urbanization. Differences in suicide rates across the rural-urban categories were investigated in terms of genders, age groups, suicide methods and family status using Spearman correlations. Results The ratio of rural to urban suicide rates has continuously increased in both genders over the past 35 years, indicating a growing risk in rural areas. Suicide methods used in rural and urban areas vary significantly and suicide rates among men, but not women, were found to decrease with increasing urbanicity. Conclusion In line with recent findings from other western countries, we showed a growing gap between rural and urban suicide rates. This suggests a need for rural-specific suicide prevention efforts, especially aimed at the male rural population.

AB Perinatal women are at risk of depression and/or suicidality. Suicide is the highest cause of indirect maternal deaths in the perinatal period. Midwives and maternal child health nurses (MCHN), as key clinicians, need to be able to detect these mental health issues. Little is known about these clinicians' attitudes to suicide. In this paper, we report on the results of a cross-sectional study of midwives' and MCHN attitudes to suicide. A convenience sample of midwives (n=95) and MCHN (n=86) from south-eastern Victoria, Australia, was recruited into the study. Participants completed the Attitudes to Suicide Prevention Scale. The results showed that MCHN have more positive attitudes towards suicide prevention than midwives, and younger participants have more positive attitudes to suicide prevention compared to older participants. Midwives and MCHN could benefit from continuing professional education to build their knowledge and skills in assessing suicide risk for childbearing women and their families, increasing positive attitudes, improving detection, and mental health referrals.

AB Objectives: In keeping with international public health policy development, suicide prevention in Australia has received increasing attention. The mid to late 1990s saw the introduction of a range of co-ordinated national prevention programmes. Since 1997. suicides have decreased, but the comparative rates of decline for males and females have not been well studied at the national level.
   Methods: Standardised suicide rates were calculated for males and females, using data from 1997 to 2005. Linear models (ordinary least squares) were used to calculate rates of decline, with trends compared for males and females.
   Results: Male suicides appear to have fallen more rapidly than female suicides.
   Conclusions: Australian males, an 'at risk' demographic. appear to be experiencing benefits from the existence of current national suicide prevention strategies and related social changes. It is recommended that greater consideration be given to researching risk factors such as intimate partner violence, sexual abuse, and substance dependence, for Australian female suicide.

AB Victims of interpersonal violence are known to be at increased risk of suicidal ideation and attempts; however, few data exist on the impact that violence has on the risk of death from suicide. This study examined 2153 suicides (1636 males and 517 females) occurring between 2009 and 2012. Information was sourced from the Coroners Court of Victoria's Suicide Register, a detailed database containing information on all Victorian suicides. Forty-two percent of women who died from suicide had a history of exposure to interpersonal violence, with 23% having been a victim of physical violence, 18% suffering psychological violence, and 16% experiencing sexual abuse. A large number of men who died from suicide had also been exposed to interpersonal violence, many of whom had perpetrated violence within the 6 weeks prior to their death. Targeted prevention, particularly removing barriers for men to seek help early after perpetrating violence is likely to have benefits in preventing suicide in both men and women.

AB There has been a sharp and steady increase in suicide rates in the US since 2000. We take a novel approach to contribute to the related policy measures. We analyze the cross-sectional and time-varying convergence of suicide rates across US states. Our results show that, in general, there is convergence in suicide rates across the states. While this may imply an extraordinary hike in a few 'previously well-performing' states, such convergence also opens an opportunity for uniform policies to work more effectively across the nation. We also find that the convergence-coefficients vary across various geographic regions and demographic groups. (C) 2019 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland. Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID RISK; AUSTRALIA; IDEATION; AGE
AB An important risk factor for suicide assessment is the suicide precipitant. This study explores suicide attempt precipitants across the lifespan. Three years of medical records related to suicide attempters who were admitted to the emergency department of a large teaching hospital in Singapore were subjected to analysis. These cases were divided into three age groups: Adolescence, Early Adulthood, and Middle Adulthood. A total of 540 cases were examined (70.9% females; 63.7% Chinese, 13.7% Malays, 15.9% Indians), whose ages ranged from 12 to 62. There were eight cases above the age of 65 years which were excluded from the analysis. Significant differences were found in precipitants for suicide attempts across the lifespan. Middle adults had relatively fewer relationship problems, and adolescents had comparatively fewer financial and medical problems. The models to predict medically severe attempts across the age groups using suicide precipitants were not significant. The findings were discussed in regards to implications in suicide assessment and primary prevention in Singapore, as well as limitations and recommendations for future research.

LA English
DT Article
ID SEASONAL-VARIATION; LIGHT THERAPY; DEPRESSION; DISORDER; HOMICIDE; WALES
AB Objective: Aside from diminished daily functional capacity, individuals with depression are at greatly higher risk of suicide. Given that both endogenous depression severity and the incidence of suicide peak during the spring and summer months, it would seem that an environmental cue-one that generates alterations in brain neuronal activity that result in depressed affect or suicidal ideation-might be important.
   Method: The authors examined the frequency of suicide and its relation to meteorological factors in the state of Victoria between January 1990 and April 1999.
   Results: The incidence of suicide had its nadir in winter and zenith in the spring and summer and paralleled closely the number of bright sunlight hours, This pattern was particularly marked for violent suicide. During the decade, the suicide rate significantly increased among men between 21 and 60 years of age and women between 41 and 60.
   Conclusions: The incidence of suicide in southeastern Australia displays a clear seasonal pattern, being positively linked with prevailing levels of sunlight. The rate of suicide increased in the latter half of the last decade.

ID INTERNATIONAL DIAGNOSTIC INTERVIEW; ADOLESCENT SUICIDE;

AB Background: Suicide in young adults remains an important public health issue in Australia. The attributable risks associated with broader socioeconomic factors, compared to more proximal psychiatric disorders, have not been considered previously in individual-level studies of young adults. This study compared the relative contributions of psychiatric disorder and socio-economic disadvantage associated with suicide in terms of relative and attributable risk in young adults.
   Method: A population-based case-control study of young adults (18-34 years) compared cases of suicide (n = 84) with randomly selected controls (n = 250) from population catchments in New South Wales (Australia), with exposure information collected from key informant interviews (for both cases and controls). The relative and attributable risk of suicide associated with ICD-10 defined substance use, affective, and anxiety disorder was compared with educational achievement and household income, adjusting for key confounders. Prevalence of exposures from the control group was used to estimate population attributable fractions (PAF).
   Results: Strong associations were evident between mental disorders and suicide for both males and females (ORs 3.1 to 18.7). The strongest association was for anxiety disorders (both males and females), followed by affective disorders and substance use disorders. Associations for socio-economic status were smaller in magnitude than for mental disorders for both males and females (ORs 1.1 to 4.8 for lower compared to high SES groups). The combined PAF% for all mental disorders (48% for males and 52% for females) was similar in magnitude to socio-economic status (46% for males and 58% for females).
   Conclusion: Socio-economic status had a similar magnitude of population attributable risk for suicide as mental disorders. Public health interventions to reduce suicide should incorporate socio-economic disadvantage in addition to mental illness as a potential target for intervention.

AB Background: The World Health Organisation SUicide PREvention-Multisite Intervention Study on Suicide (WHO/SUPRE-MISS) investigates suicidal behaviours in a number of nations. The feasibility of the different branches of the study was piloted in Queensland, Australia. This paper reports on the community survey component.
   Method: Randomised telephone interviews (n = 11,572) were conducted to determine the lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts, and corresponding socio-demographic and cultural characteristics. A subsequent postal survey sent to consenting individuals reporting lifetime suicide ideation/attempt (n=1311) was meant to ascertain the possible development of that behaviour along a continuum, psychiatric and psychological factors, suicidal transmission, help-seeking, and service utilisation.
   Results: Suicide ideation and attempts prevailed in individuals aged 25-44 years, and declined with increasing age. In most cases, suicidal experience/s did not develop over time with progressively increasing severity. Knowledge of someone else's suicidal behaviour significantly increased the risk of similar acts. Almost half of the subjects contended with their suicidal crisis by over-drinking alcohol, and 1/3 through other forms of reckless behaviour. The ratio completed/attempted suicide was 1 to 23. Less than 30% of subjects went to the hospital after their suicidal behaviour, and treatment received and staff attitudes were rated less favourably than that of General Practitioners.
   Conclusions: This survey provides a reliable picture of suicide ideation and behaviour in the general population. Information on the development of suicidal process, recklessness, and help-seeking attitudes may be valuable for future prevention strategies. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. Alrights reserved.

ID PSYCHIATRIC-INPATIENTS; PSYCHOLOGICAL AUTOPSY; AUSTRALIA; FIREARM
AB Objective: A first study to compare suicides by missing persons with other suicide cases.
   Design: Retrospective cohort study for the period 1994-2007.
   Geographical location: Queensland, Australia.
   Population: 194 suicides by missing persons and 7545 other suicides were identified through the Queensland Suicide Register and the National Coroners Information System.
   Main outcome measure: chi(2) statistics and binary logistic regression were used to identify distinct characteristics of suicides by missing persons.
   Results: Compared with other suicide cases, missing persons significantly more often died by motor vehicle exhaust gas toxicity (23.7% vs 16.4%; chi(2)=7.32, p<0.01), jumping from height (6.7% vs 3.2%; chi(2)=7.08, p<0.01) or drowning (8.2% vs 1.8%; chi(2)=39.53, p<0.01), but less frequently by hanging (29.4% vs 39.9%; chi(2)=8.82, p<0.01). They were most frequently located in natural outdoors locations (58.2% vs 11.1%; chi(2)=388.25, p<0.01). Persons gone missing were less likely to have lived alone at time of death (OR 0.45, 95% Cl 0.26 to 0.76), yet more likely to be institutionalised (OR 3.12, 95% Cl 1.28 to 7.64). They were less likely to have been physically ill (OR 0.64, 95% Cl 0.43 to 0.95) or have a history of problematic consumptions of alcohol (OR 0.52, 95% Cl 0.31 to 0.87). In comparison to other suicide cases, missing persons more often communicated their suicidal intent prior to death (OR 1.58, 95% Cl 1.13 to 2.22).
   Conclusions: Suicides by missing persons show several distinct characteristics in comparisons to other suicides. The findings have implications for development of suicide prevention strategies focusing on early identification and interventions targeting this group. In particular, it may offer assistance to police in designing risk assessment procedures and subsequent investigations of missing persons.

AB BACKGROUND: Emergency and protective services personnel (e.g., police, ambulance, fire-fighters, defence, prison and security officers) report elevated levels of job stress and health problems. While population-level research is lacking, there has been some research suggesting suicide rates may be elevated in emergency and protective services.
   OBJECTIVES: This paper compares suicide rates between emergency and protective services occupational groups over a 12-year period (2001-2012) in Australia.
   METHOD: Labour force data was obtained from the 2006 Australian Census. Suicide data was obtained from the National Coroners Information System (NCIS). Negative binomial regression was used to estimate the association between suicide and employment as an emergency or protective service worker (including prison and security officers) over the period 2001-2012, as compared to all other occupations. Information on suicide method was extracted from the NCIS.
   RESULTS: The age-adjusted suicide rate across all emergency and protective service workers was 22.4 (95% CI 19.5 to 25.2) per 100,000 in males and 7.8 in females (95% CI 4.6 to 11.00), compared to 15.5 per 100,000 (95% CI 15.2 to 15.9) for males and 3.4 (95% CI 3.2 to 3.6) for females in other occupations. The highest risk by subgroup was observed among those employed in the defence force, prison officers, and ambulance personnel. The major method of death for all occupational groups was hanging.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results clearly highlight the need for suicide prevention among emergency and protective service occupations.

AB The Gap Park Self-Harm Minimisation Masterplan project is a collaborative attempt to address jumping suicides at Sydney's Gap Park through means restriction, encouraging help-seeking, and increasing the likelihood of third-party intervention. We used various data sources to describe the Masterplan project's processes, impacts, and outcomes. There have been reductions in reported jumps and confirmed suicides, although the trends are not statistically significant. There has been a significant increase in police call-outs to intervene with suicidal people who have not yet reached the cliff's edge. The collaborative nature of the Masterplan project and its multifaceted approach appear to be reaping benefits.

AB A retrospective review was undertaken in South Australia over an 11-year period from July 1996 to June 2007 of all multiple, unnatural, non-accidental deaths in adults (>16 years) looking for cases of double suicide and murder-suicide. All cases had undergone a full police and coronial investigation and full, autopsy. There were seven cases of double suicide involving 14 individuals: nine males and five females ranging in age from 29 to 79 years (average 49 yrs). Over the same period there were eight murder-suicides involving 16 individuals: nine males and seven females ranging in age from 17 to 83 years (average 49 yrs). All the murder-suicide perpetrators were male and the majority of the victims were female (7/8). All eight perpetrators committed suicide with gunshot wounds to the head (N=8; 100%); one victim was manually strangled and the remainder died from gunshot wounds to the head, neck and upper chest. In contrast, all but two of the double suicide victims died of carbon monoxide toxicity, with the remaining couple dying from mixed drug toxicity. While differentiating between these two groups may be difficult;, double suicide victims used much less violent methods than perpetrators of murder-suicide and often had histories of chronic debilitating disease. Spousal and familial links characterised both groups.

AB In many motorized countries, inhalation of carbon monoxide from motor vehicle exhaust gas (MVEG) has been one of the leading methods of suicide. In some countries it remains so (e.g., Australia 16.0% of suicides in 2005). Relative to other methods it is a planned method and one often used by middle-aged males. The study provides a review of countermeasures aimed at restricting this method of suicide. The prevention measures identified were catalytic converters (introduced to reduce carbon monoxide for environmental reasons); in-cabin sensors; exhaust pipe modification; automatic idling stops; and helpline signage at suicide "hotspots." Catalytic converters are now in 90% of new vehicles worldwide and literature supports them being associated with a reduction in exhaust-gassing suicides. There remain, however, accounts of exhaust-gas fatalities in modem vehicles, whether accidentally or by suicide. These deaths and also crashes from fatigue could potentially be prevented by in-cabin multi-gas sensors, these having been developed to the prototype stage. Helpline signage at an exhaust-gassing suicide "hotspot" had some success in reducing suicides. The evidence on method substitution and whether a reduction in MVEG suicides causes a reduction in total suicides is inconsistent.

AB Background: Seasonality of suicide has been noted in several studies. A spring peak of suicide was observed, and associations between various climatic parameters and suicide have been suggested. This study sets out to verify seasonal patterns of suicide rates and to explore the association with climate in Taiwan.
   Method: The study used a nationwide mortality database in Taiwan from January 1997 to December 2003. An autoregressive integrated moving average model was applied to examine the presence of seasonality and the association of climate with suicidal death.
   Results: Seasonality with a spring peak was evident in suicidal death regardless of gender or age. Ambient temperature was positively associated with suicide after adjustment for trend and seasonality. Limitations: Misclassification and underreporting of suicidal death in the registry system might confound the results. Ecological fallacies might exist.
   Conclusions: The seasonal effect on suicide is significant in Taiwan. Suicide rates may be influenced by ambient temperatures. The findings are of research interest for future studies regarding mechanisms of suicidal behavior, and also of practical interest for better timing of suicide interventions and effective preventive strategies.

AB Background: The Hong Kong news media report suicide-related events more frequently and sensationally than Western countries. Little is known about Hong Kong media professionals' experiences and thoughts about such reporting. Aims: To understand Hong Kong media professionals' experiences and perceptions of suicide reporting and whether the news media can be better engaged into suicide prevention. Method: We conducted three focus groups of journalists from both the Cantonese and English language news media. Data were analyzed using grounded theory methods. Results: We discerned three rationales from participants regarding their intense coverage of suicide-related events: (1) satisfying commercial competitiveness, (2) addressing social problems, and (3) responding to readers' interests. The first rationale was a dominant and vigorous motivating factor, and often influenced suicide reporting among local Cantonese media. Media professionals recommended engagement strategies targeted at frontline journalists, media managers, and general media consumers. Conclusion: We see potential to involve news media professionals in Hong Kong as working partners in suicide prevention. To succeed, this effort requires engagement in a proactive, consistent, and sustained fashion.

AB The purpose of the study was to examine the association of suicide rates, firearm ownership, political conservatism, religious integration at the state level, and individual suicide risk. Social structural and social learning and social integration theories were theoretical frameworks employed. It was hypothesized that higher suicide rates, higher state firearm availability, and state conservatism elevate individual suicide risk.
   Data were pooled from the Multiple Cause of Death Files. Multilevel logistic regression models were fitted to all deaths occurring in 2000 through 2004 by suicide.
   The state suicide rate significantly elevated individual suicide risk (AOR = 1.042, CI = 1.037, 1.046). Firearm availability at the state level was associated with significantly higher odds of individual suicide (AOR = 1.004, CI = 1.003, 1.006). State political conservatism elevated the odds of individual suicides (AOR = 1.005, CI = 1.003, 1.007), while church membership at the state level reduced individual odds of suicide (AOR = 0.995, CI = 0.993, 0.996). The results held even after controlling for socioeconomic and demographic variables at the individual level.
   It was concluded that the observed association between individual suicide odds and national suicide rates, and firearm ownership cannot be discounted. Future research ought to focus on integrating individual level data and contextual variables when testing for the impact of firearm ownership. Support was found for social learning and social integration theories.

AB Purpose This study aims to investigate trends in socioeconomic inequalities of suicide from 1979 to 2013 for Australian males and females aged 15-34 years and 35-64 years.
   Methods Data on suicides and population were obtained from national registries. An area-based measure of socioeconomic status (SES) was used, and categorized into low, middle, and high SES areas. Suicide rates for each SES groups were estimated using a negative binomial regression model, adjusted for confounders. Socioeconomic inequalities in suicide were assessed using absolute and relative risk of low-to-high SES areas. Secular changes in socioeconomic inequalities were assessed using trend tests for relative risk.
   Results For young males, there was an increase in socioeconomic inequality driven by a significant decrease in suicide rates in high SES areas. For older males, inequality in suicide increased by 29%, which was related to a marked increase in suicide rates in low SES areas. Inequalities in both young and older female suicides also increased. These increases occurred when corresponding suicide rates in high SES areas decreased.
   Conclusions Recent widening socioeconomic inequalities in Australian suicide have been primarily associated with declines in suicide rates in high SES areas. However, an increasing inequality in older male suicide is linked with low SES. Efforts targeting people from poor areas, especially older males, should be considered when developing suicide prevention strategy.

AB Background: The impact of socio-environmental factors on suicide has been examined in many studies. Few of them, however, have explored these associations from a spatial perspective, especially in assessing the association between meteorological factors and suicide. This study examined the association of meteorological and socio-demographic factors with suicide across small areas over different time periods.
   Methods: Suicide, population and socio-demographic data (e.g., population of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (ATSI), and unemployment rate (UNE) at the Local Government Area (LGA) level were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the period of 1986 to 2005. Information on meteorological factors (rainfall, temperature and humidity) was supplied by Australian Bureau of Meteorology. A Bayesian Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) Model was applied to explore the association of socio-demographic and meteorological factors with suicide across LGAs.
   Results: In Model I (socio-demographic factors), proportion of ATSI and UNE were positively associated with suicide from 1996 to 2000 (Relative Risk (RR)(ATSI) = 1.0107, 95% Credible Interval (CI): 1.0062-1.0151; RRUNE = 1.0187, 95% CI: 1.0060-1.0315), and from 2001 to 2005 (RRATSI = 1.0126, 95% CI: 1.0076-1.0176; RRUNE = 1.0198, 95% CI: 1.0041-1.0354). Socio-Economic Index for Area (SEIFA) and IND, however, had negative associations with suicide between 1986 and 1990 (RRSEIFA = 0.9983, 95% CI: 0.9971-0.9995; RRATSI = 0.9914, 95% CI: 0.9848-0.9980). Model II (meteorological factors): a 1 degrees C higher yearly mean temperature across LGAs increased the suicide rate by an average by 2.27% (95% CI: 0.73%, 3.82%) in 1996-2000, and 3.24% (95% CI: 1.26%, 5.21%) in 2001-2005. The associations between socio-demographic factors and suicide in Model III (socio-demographic and meteorological factors) were similar to those in Model I; but, there is no substantive association between climate and suicide in Model III.
   Conclusions: Proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, unemployment and temperature appeared to be statistically associated with of suicide incidence across LGAs among all selected variables, especially in recent years. The results indicated that socio-demographic factors played more important roles than meteorological factors in the spatial pattern of suicide incidence.

TI Maternal mortality and psychiatric morbidity in the perinatal period:

SO MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
LA English
DT Editorial Material
ID PREGNANCY; POSTPARTUM; SUICIDE
AB Maternal mortality associated with psychiatric illness in the perinatal period (pregnancy to the end of the first year postpartum) has until recently been under-reported in Australia due to limitations in the scope of the data collection and methods of detection.
   The recent United Kingdom report Why mothers die 20002002 identified psychiatric illness as the leading cause of maternal death in the UK.
   Findings from the last three reports on maternal deaths in Australia (covering the period 1994-2002) suggest that maternal psychiatric illness is one of the leading causes of maternal death, with the majority of suicides occurring by violent means.
   Such findings strengthen the case for routine perinatal psychosocial screening programs, with clear referral guidelines and assertive perinatal treatment of significant maternal psychiatric morbidity.
   Data linkage studies are needed to measure the full extent of maternal mortality associated with psychiatric illness in Australia.

SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS

DT Article
DE physician-assisted suicide; voluntary euthanasia; patient autonomy;
   religious belief
ID PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; ATTITUDES
AB In Australia and Oregon, USA, legislation to permit statutory sanctioned physician-assisted dying was enacted. However, opponents, many of whom held strong religious views, were successful with repeal in Australia. Similar opposition in Oregon was formidable, but ultimately lost in a 60-40% vote reaffirming physician-assisted dying. This paper examines the human dilemma which arises when technological advances in end-of-life medicine conflict with traditional and religious sanctity-of-life values. Society places high value on personal autonomy, particularly in the United States. We compare the potential for inherent contradictions and arbitrary decisions where patient autonomy is either permitted or forbidden. The broader implications for human experience resulting from new legislation in both Australia and Oregon are discussed. We conclude that allowing autonomy for the terminally ill, within circumscribed options,results in fewer ethical contradictions and greater preservation of dignity.

SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH; FARMERS; ISSUES
AB It has long been argued that suicide prevention efforts in rural locations face not only structural barriers, such as a lack of accessible health care and specialized mental health services, but also a range of cultural barriers. A commonly discussed cultural factor that may contribute to higher rural suicide rates is low levels of help-seeking behavior, which in turn act as a barrier to accessing and receiving care. However, the assumption that suicide by rural men is more likely to be accompanied by low help-seeking behavior, relative to urban men, has not been well tested. Using data from the Queensland Suicide Register, this study evaluates one form of help-seeking behaviorcommunication of suicidal intentamong men who died by suicide. Contrary to the expectation that suicide in rural areas would be associated with lower levels of help-seeking behavior than suicide in urban areas, it was found that communication of suicidal intent was broadly comparable across rural and urban settings. The implications for suicide prevention policies and service delivery strategies are discussed.

DT Article
DE suicide; potential years of life lost; PYLL; Queensland
ID LIFE LOST; HONG-KONG
AB Background. Concern with suicide measurement is a positive, albeit relatively recent, development. A concern with "the social loss from suicide" requires careful attention to appropriately measuring the phenomenon. This paper applies two different methods of measuring suicide data: the conventional age-standardized suicide (count) rate; and the alternative rate, the potential years of life lost (PYLL) rate. Aims. The purpose of applying these two measures is to place suicide in Queensland in a historical and comparative (relative to other causes of death) perspective. Methods. Both measures are applied to suicide data for Queensland since 1920. These measures are applied also to two "largish" causes of death and two "smaller" causes of death, i.e., circulatory diseases, cancers, motor vehicle accidents, suicide. Results. The two measures generate quite different pictures of suicide in Queensland: Using the PYLL measure, suicide is a quantitatively larger issue than is indicated by the count measure. Conclusions. The PYLL measure is the more appropriate measure for evaluation exercise of public health prevention strategies. This is because the PYLL measure is weighted by years of life lost and, thus, it incorporates more information than the count measure which implicitly weights each death with a somewhat partial value, viz. unity.

AB While unintentional work-related injury is increasingly recognised as important and preventable, population studies of the full range of work related suicides have received less attention. The objective of this study is to investigate the epidemiology of work-related suicide in Victoria, July 2000-December 2007. The study draws on a database of all work-related deaths reported to the Victorian Coroner, inclusive of broadly defined work-relatedness. Inclusion criteria for work-related suicide were at least one of: suicide means was work related, work stressors were identified in police reports to the Coroners or the Coroner's finding, the suicide method involved another person's work (e. g. rail suicide, heavy vehicle) or the suicide location was a workplace. Cases still open for investigation were excluded. Of 642 work-related suicides, 55% had an association with work stressors; 32% jumped or lay in front of a train or heavy vehicle; 7% involved a work location and 6% involved work agents. Work stressor cases identified included business difficulties, recent or previous work injury, unemployment/redundancy or conflict with supervisors/colleagues (including workplace bullying). Work-related suicide is a substantial problem, for which few detailed population wide studies are available. Further research is required to understand the contribution of work stressors and effective interventions.

To evaluate participants' satisfaction with this project, 82 bereaved individuals completed surveys and 30 completed an interview. Results indicated that the Quilt was helpful in assisting participants in their bereavement. The Quilt project gave participants an opportunity to reflect on the life of their loved one and provided a space for them to grieve without fear of negative social reactions.

The sample (N = 313) were 88% male and 48% Aboriginal. Sixteen percent reported ever having suicidal thoughts and 10% reported a suicide attempt. Twenty-one percent reported thoughts of self-harm and 16% reported actual self-harm. Female young offenders reported higher rates of suicidal behavior and self-harm compared to males. Significant correlates of attempted suicide and self-harm included childhood adversity and psychiatric disorder. This study finds that young offenders are at high risk of suicidal and self-harm behaviors. Early identification and support among this vulnerable group are critical.

AB Study objective: Australia has had a two party parliamentary political system for most of the period since its Federation in 1901, dominated either by a social democratic (Labor) or a conservative ideological perspective. This paper investigates whether such political differences at Federal and State levels have influenced suicide rates in the state of New South Wales (NSW) for the period 1901-1998.
   Design: Federal government type, NSW State government type, and combinations of both Federal and NSW State government type were examined, Poisson regression models were stratified by sex and controlled for the effects of age, annual change in gross domestic product, sedative availability, drought, and both world wars.
   Results: When both Federal and NSW State governments were conservative the relative risk of suicide for NSW men was 1.17 (p<0.001) and for women 1.40 (p<0.001) compared with both governments being Labor (1.00). A statistically significant linear trend (p<0.001) in suicide risk was evident across the continuum of Federal/State government combinations, from both Labor (lowest), to mixed (intermediate), to both conservative (highest).
   Conclusion: Significantly higher suicide risk was associated with conservative government tenures compared with social democratic incumbents. Results are discussed in terms of the differences underpinning conservative and social democratic government programme ideology, and their relevance to Durkheim's theories of suicide, social regulation, and integration.

AB For more than half a century, Australian states and territories have criminalised the distinct offence of inciting another person to commit suicide. The maximum penalties for these offences vary and require the accused to have intended that the victim would commit suicide. In contrast, the offence of involuntary manslaughter does not require such an intention. Instead, a charge of manslaughter requires that the accused acted in a conscious and voluntary way that caused the victim's death, and that their conduct was either criminally negligent or unlawful and dangerous. Drawing on cases from the United States and United Kingdom, this article suggests that in appropriate circumstances in Australia, especially in the context of family violence, offenders should be held criminally liable for manslaughter if they cause another person to commit suicide.

TI Suicide Seasonality: Complex Demodulation as a Novel Approach in
   Epidemiologic Analysis
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article

AB Background: Seasonality of suicides is well-known and nearly ubiquitous, but recent evidence showed inconsistent patterns of decreasing or increasing seasonality in different countries. Furthermore, strength of seasonality was hypothesized to be associated with suicide prevalence. This study aimed at pointing out methodological difficulties in examining changes in suicide seasonality.
   Methododology/Principal Findings: The present study examines the hypothesis of decreasing seasonality with a superior method that allows continuous modeling of seasonality. Suicides in Austria (1970-2008, N = 67,741) were analyzed with complex demodulation, a local (point-in-time specific) version of harmonic analysis. This avoids the need to arbitrarily split the time series, as is common practice in the field of suicide seasonality research, and facilitates incorporating the association with suicide prevalence. Regression models were used to assess time trends and association of amplitude and absolute suicide numbers. Results showed that strength of seasonality was associated with absolute suicide numbers, and that strength of seasonality was stable during the study period when this association was taken into account.
   Conclusion/Significance: Continuous modeling of suicide seasonality with complex demodulation avoids spurious findings that can result when time series are segmented and analyzed piecewise or when the association with suicide prevalence is disregarded.

ID PSYCHIATRIC-PATIENTS; DEPRESSION; DIMENSIONS; SELF
AB Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between dimensions of perfectionism and suicide ideation in a tertiary student population in Australia.
   Method: The methodology involved 405 students completing the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) which includes a subset of questions which can be used to assess suicide ideation, and the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale.
   Results: The presence of suicide ideation was associated with higher scores on total perfectionism and two perfectionism dimensions, and total GHQ scores. There were significant differences between participants with high levels of perfectionism and participants with moderate to low levels of perfectionism on a measure of suicide ideation. Neither gender nor age were associated with differences in the scores, with results indicating high levels of perfectionism may indicate a vulnerability to suicide ideation.
   Conclusions: Perfectionism is a valued attribute in high-achieving populations. The question needs to be asked, however, at what cost? The findings indicate that high levels of perfectionism may be associated with an increased vulnerability to suicide ideation. Future research is needed to gain a better understanding of the complex interrelationship between personality and temperament, environmental factors and self-destructive behaviour.

TI Suicide in Indigenous people in Queensland, Australia: trends and
   methods, 1994-2007
SO AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE suicide; Indigenous population; epidemiology
ID MORTALITY DATA
AB Objective: Suicide among Indigenous Australians is a well-recognized public health issue. Due to scarcity of epidemiological investigations in this area the exact size of this problem and its main characteristics remain uncertain. In this paper we present trends and methods of Indigenous suicides based on the Queensland Suicide Register for the period 1994-2007.
   Methods: Trends of age-standardized suicide rates were calculated for Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations. Suicide methods were compared between the two groups, with particular focus on hanging. Discriminant analysis was used to ascertain the size of under-estimation of suicide rates due to a considerable number of cases with unknown ethnicity in the Queensland Suicide Register.
   Results: Between 1994 and 2007, Indigenous populations had suicide rates 2.2 times higher than non-Indigenous Australians. Age-specific suicide rates for Indigenous men were highest in the 25 - 34 age group, while in women they were highest among 15 - 24 year olds. In children younger than 15 years, Indigenous suicide rate was almost ten times higher than of non-Indigenous counterparts. More than 90% of Indigenous suicides occurred by hanging. It was estimated that lack of information about ethnicity for 7% of suicide cases might have caused an under-estimation of Indigenous suicide mortality for 15.4% in men and 9.1% in women in the period 1994-2007.
   Conclusions: Suicide mortality of Indigenous Australians has reached alarming levels, particularly among youths. The unique profile of Indigenous suicides indicates the need for specifically tailored preventative programmes.

AB Background. Few studies have focused on factors that uniquely distinguish suicide attempters from suicide ideators. This study assesses prevalence of suicide attempts among suicide ideators within a community sample; explores demographics, employment status, mental and physical health conditions, personality, life stresses and social environment as factors that may distinguish these groups; examines effects of age and gender upon suicide attempts and associated factors; and investigates the increase in suicide attempts when multiple factors related to this behaviour are present.
   Method. Data were drawn from the PATH Through Life Project, a community survey of 7485 people in Canberra, Australia. A subsample of 522 suicide ideators were used for this study.
   Results. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with suicide attempts. Physical medical conditions (OR 1.95) and negative interactions with friends (OR 1.20) were associated with an increased likelihood of suicide attempts among suicide ideators. Age and gender interaction effects for suicide attempts were found involving physical medical condition and mastery among men (OR 3.78 and 0.83 respectively) and not being employed for those aged 40-44 years (OR 8.94). A cumulative effect was found when multiple factors associated with suicide attempts were present, and the probability of an attempt was significantly elevated.
   Conclusions. Factors distinguishing those who attempt suicide from suicide ideators involve being unemployed, physical ill health and relationship difficulties. Contrary to expectation, this study found that ideators and attempters experience comparable levels of depression and anxiety.

AB In 2016 a Parliamentary Committee in Victoria, Australia, recommended the legalization of physician-assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia. Its report was deeply flawed. Its treatment of key objections to legalization, both principled and practical, was superficial and selective.

AB Objectives: Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, and disproportionately affects Indigenous populations. Seasonal suicide patterns are variable in the literature, and could offer novel approaches to the timing and focus of prevention efforts if better understood. With a suicide surveillance system in place since 1989, this study offers an unprecedented opportunity to explore seasonal variations in both fatal and non-fatal suicide behavior in an Indigenous Arctic region.
   Study design: Cross-sectional.
   Methods: In this descriptive study, we analyzed data collected from 1990 to 2009 in the rural northwest region of Alaska, both graphically and using the chi-squared test for multinomials.
   Results: We found a significant monthly variation for suicide attempts, with a peak in suicide behavior observed between April and August (P = 0.0002). Monthly variation was more pronounced among individuals <= 29 years of age, and was present in both males and females, although the seasonal pattern differed by sex.
   Conclusions: Our findings of a significant seasonal pattern in suicide behavior, with monthly variation (summer peak) in non-fatal suicide behavior among younger age groups, and among both males and females can assist planners in targeting subpopulations for prevention at different times of the year.

AB Objective: The Victorian Suicide Register (VSR) is a state-based suicide surveillance system that contains detailed information on people who die by suicide and the circumstances surrounding their death. In this paper, we provide an overview of the VSR and then describe the evaluation, which used the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for surveillance system evaluation as a framework. Methods: The evaluation drew on three data sources to assess whether the VSR: i) embodies the attributes of a good public health surveillance system; and ii) can be used to inform community-based suicide prevention efforts. Results: There was a high level of acceptability and enthusiasm for having an accessible data collection that can stimulate local action on suicide prevention planning. One of the key challenges identified was data quality, particularly around those data collected in the course of death investigations that are not designed for surveillance purposes. Conclusion: The VSR fills an important gap in the sustained and systematic collection of comprehensive information on suicide, with some key challenges identified. Implications for public health: Findings from the evaluation provide important strategic information for national and international jurisdictions seeking to establish their own suicide registers.

AB Background: Little is known of the appropriateness of existing gatekeeper suicide prevention programs for Indigenous communities. Despite the high rates of Indigenous suicide in Australia, especially among Indigenous youth, it is unclear how effective existing suicide prevention programs are in providing appropriate management of Indigenous people at risk of suicide.
   Methods: In-depth, semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with Indigenous communities in rural and regional areas of Southern Queensland. Thematic analysis was performed on the gathered information.
   Results: Existing programs were time-intensive and included content irrelevant to Indigenous people. There was inconsistency in the content and delivery of gatekeeper training. Programs were also not sustainable for rural and regional Indigenous communities.
   Conclusions: Appropriate programs should be practical, relevant, and sustainable across all Indigenous communities, with a focus on the social, emotional, cultural and spiritual underpinnings of community wellbeing. Programs need to be developed in thorough consultation with Indigenous communities. Indigenous-led suicide intervention training programs are needed to mitigate the increasing rates of suicide experienced by Indigenous peoples living in rural and remote locations.

SO PUBLIC HEALTH ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
ID EVIDENCE-BASED POLICY; PUBLIC-HEALTH ETHICS; MENTAL-HEALTH; AUSTRALIA;
   FRAMEWORK; ATTITUDES
AB Value judgements in research and political decision-making that exclude evidence for the social determinants of suicide suggest that evidence is not sufficient on its own to guide policy and practice, and that there is a lack of conceptual clarity with regard to decisions relating to the prioritization of problems, the allocation of resources, the translation of research into practice, as well as questions of responsibility for suicide prevention. In this work I seek to broaden conventional ethical debate about suicide through the use of public health ethics frameworks. I argue that despite espousing a public health approach, current suicide prevention strategies are based largely on individual-level theorizing. This emphasis on the individual works to responsibilize individuals and communities for suicide prevention and directs attention away from public policy and systemic inequities. Given continued high rates of suicide, especially among disadvantaged social groups and communities, comprehensive government action is required to address the social and political determinants of suicide. Normative justification for action in realizing these ends is critical. I conclude by proposing one practicable form of action to make values and value judgements in suicide prevention explicit so that alternative forms of ethical and political recognition and responsibility are acknowledged.

   1907-2003
SO HEALTH ECONOMICS POLICY AND LAW
LA English
DT Article
ID METROPOLITAN-AREAS; LIFE LOST; TRENDS
AB Rising suicide rates have been identified as a social problem in several Western countries. The application of a Welfare Economics argument justifies a role for policy that reduces the welfare impact of suicide, whereas the measurement of that impact can inform policy making. Two dimensions of the concept can be measured: the social loss from suicide, and the inequality in the distribution of that loss. In this study, an alternative measure of suicide to the conventional suicide headcount, viz. the potential years of life lost (PYLL), is employed. The PYLL measure is a proxy measure of the social impact of suicide, and involves the concept of 'premature' loss of life. The PYLL also lends itself to inequality measurement. We apply the approach to inequality measurement of health phenomena that was pioneered in the 1980s by Jacques Silber and Julian Le Grand, in a literature now described as measuring health inequality per se. The empirical part of the paper statistically estimates equations on Australian suicide data for the period 1907-2003 and determines the trends in the social loss from suicide and the inequality of its age distribution. Some illustrative examples assist in interpreting the welfare impact of suicide measured both ways, by the headcount rate and the PYLL rate.

AB This paper utilizes existing statistics on adolescent suicide to examine adolescent suicide trends and patterns in Hong Kong for the period of 1980 to 2003. Several trends and patterns are revealed from the analyses. First, there was a gradual rising trend where adolescent suicide rates in the 1990's and the early 2000's were higher than those in the 1980's. Second, suicide rates for adolescents aged 10-24 years were lower than those of other adult age groups. Third, although adolescent suicide rates in Hong Kong were lower than those reported in some English-speaking countries and Mainland China, the figures were higher than those reported in Taiwan. Fourth, suicide rates among teenagers in early adolescence were lower than those among adolescents in late adolescence. Fifth, although male adolescent suicide rates were in general higher than female adolescent suicide rates (10-24 age group), gender differences in suicide rates appeared to be moderated by age. Sixth, there was a gradual rising trend in adolescent proportional mortality rates for suicide since the 1990's. Seventh, proportional mortality rates for suicide among teenagers in early adolescence were lower than those among adolescents in late adolescence. Finally, although jumping from a height was a common method of adolescent suicide, there was a rising trend of using other methods, such as taking drugs, hanging and charcoal burning. The observed adolescent suicide phenomena are discussed in this study with reference to the socio-cultural context of Hong Kong.

DE suicide; media; newspaper; television; radio
AB Aims. To evaluate changes in Australian news media reporting of suicide between 2000/01 and 2006/07 against recommendations in the resource Reporting Suicide and Mental Illness. Methods. Newspaper, television, and radio items on suicide were retrieved over two 12-month periods pre- and postintroduction of Reporting Suicide and Mental Illness. Identifying and descriptive information were extracted for each item. Quality ratings were made for a stratified random sample of items, using criteria from the precursor to Reporting Suicide and Mental Illness. Results and Conclusions. There was almost a two-fold increase in reporting of suicide during the study period, with 4,813 and 8,363 items retrieved in 2000/01 and 2006/07, respectively. The nature of media reporting showed some variability, with an increased emphasis on items about individuals' experiences and a reduced emphasis on policy and program initiatives. Most strikingly, there was significant improvement on almost all individual dimensions of quality and overall quality. These findings are positive, although there are still clearly some opportunities for improving the way in which the media report and portray suicide. In order to improve standards, continued support should be provided for the dissemination and evaluation of Reporting Suicide and Mental Illness.

ID MENTAL-HEALTH
AB Objective: The objective of this study was to determine whether farming suicides increased in Victoria during the prolonged drought in south eastern Australia and gain an understanding of Victorian farming suicides during the period.
   Method: Intentional self-harm deaths of farmers and primary producers notified to the Victorian State Coroner from 2001 to 2007 were examined to identify characteristics and determine whether the annual number of farming suicides increased.
   Results: Farming suicides accounted for just over 3% of Victorian suicides. The total number of farming suicides was 110 for the period and ranged between 11 and 19 deaths per year, rising and falling inconsistently from year to year. Males accounted for nearly 95% of farming suicides, with firearms and hanging the most frequently used methods, and most deaths occurring between 30 and 59 years of age.
   Conclusions: The small number of relevant cases and fluctuations in the annual number of deaths provides no evidence of a pattern of increasing farming suicides during the drought years, when there was approximately one suicide every 3 weeks. Given the elevated suicide risk in male farmers and association with multiple psychosocial and environmental factors, it cannot be concluded, however, that suicide risk itself did not increase during this period of heightened uncertainty and stress. Drought should not be dismissed among the many risk factors, and it is possible that increased mental health awareness and community support programs targeting drought-affected areas contributed to improved management of stress and suicide risk in regional and rural Victoria over the past decade.

ID CHILDREN
AB Aim: The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with deaths by hanging among young people in Queensland, Australia.
   Method: An examination of coroner's reports for all deaths by hanging of people under 25 years of age that occurred in Queensland in the years 1995 and 1996.
   Results: All cases were recorded as suicides. Most were males and a quarter were indigenous persons. Half the deaths occurred in regional or rural areas. Unemployment, the experience of personal loss, psychiatric illness and alcohol use were possible precipitating agents. Early warning signs were the onset of uncharacteristic behaviours and threats of suicide.
   Conclusions: The private nature of hanging means that there are rarely opportunities to prevent it in the period immediately before the fatal event. Earlier interventions will have to be considered. To prevent hanging as a means of suicide, we need to understand more about the difficulties experienced by some young men who are living in rural areas. We need more information about the cultural problems experienced by indigenous youths in their teenage years. Young people in the justice system may need personal support. There is a pressing need to determine if young people, especially in rural areas, have adequate access to the professional expertise needed to diagnose and treat mental disorders.

AB Purpose
   This study examined trends in the suicide rates of persons with foreign background in Japan.
   Methods
   Using the nationwide death records in the Vital Statistics of Japan, we first reported the age-adjusted suicide rates of 8 foreign nationals (Brazil, China, Korea, Peru, the Philippines, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States) in Japan by sex from 1980 to the mid-2010s. We also computed rate ratios to compare the suicide rate of each group with those of the Japanese population. Second, we focused on Koreans, who had the highest suicide rate in Japan. We compared the suicide rates of Koreans in Japan with Koreans in South Korea to examine whether their suicide rates were more closely related to those of their country of origin or those of their host country.
   Results
   We found that the suicide rates of Koreans and Chinese in Japan were similar to or higher than those of Japanese, while other groups tended to show lower suicide rates. Most notably, Koreans displayed consistently high suicide rates from 1980 to the mid-2010s, which were nearly twice as high as those of the Japanese population. Korean males and females in Japan had higher suicide rates than those in South Korea.
   Conclusions
   Immigrants in Japan were not necessarily influenced by the suicide rates of the host country. The high suicide rates among Korean residents in Japan might be explained by various disadvantages and adversities that they face in Japan.

SO JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
LA English
DT Article
ID BEREAVEMENT; POPULATION; SURVIVORS; PREVALENCE; HEALTH
AB Background: Exposure to the suicide death of another may lead to distress and increase the risk of suicide in those connected to the deceased. Yet, the extent of this exposure across the population is ill-defined. This paper utilises representative data to quantify the extent of exposure to suicide in the Australian community and the reported effect of this exposure.
   Methods: A random digit dial, computer-assisted telephone interview survey was undertaken to understand how Australian's may assist someone in severe distress or at risk of suicide. Embedded within this survey were questions on exposure to suicide and the impact of this exposure.
   Results: Among a representative sample of 3002 Australians, 58% reported exposure to the suicide of someone known to them in their lifetime and 18.5% of exposed individuals reported their own suicidal thoughts in the past-year. Higher perceived impact of the suicide and concern for another person were associated with increased likelihood of current suicidal thinking.
   Limitations: Survey design limitations resulted in unknown psychological harms beyond past-year suicidal thinking in respondents.
   Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate a high level of exposure to suicide death among Australians, with multiple exposures common. How and why suicide manifests in some exposed to suicide and not others remains unknown and requires further research. However, these findings suggest suicide prevention efforts need to expand to include a focus on suicide exposure, and mental health clinicians should consider exposure to suicide in risk assessment to better understand an individual's vulnerability to suicide following exposure.

AB Suicide and non-fatal suicide behavior (NFSB) are significant problems faced by most countries. The objective of this research is to quantify the economic cost of suicide and NFSB in the Australian workforce and to examine the potential impact of introducing a workplace suicide prevention intervention to reduce this burden. The analysis used the best available suicide data, a well-established costing methodology, and a proven workplace intervention. In 2014, 903 workers died by suicide, 2303 workers harmed themselves resulting in full incapacity, and 11,242 workers harmed themselves resulting in a short absence from work. The present value of the economic cost of suicide and NFSB is estimated at $6.73 billion. Our analysis suggests the economic benefit of implementing a universal workplace strategy would considerably outweigh the cost of the strategy. For every one dollar invested, the benefits would be in excess of $1.50 ($1.11-$3.07), representing a positive economic investment. All variations of the key parameter hold the positive benefit-cost ratio. Rates of suicide and NFSB are far too high in Australia and elsewhere. More needs to be done to reduce this burden. Although workplace strategies are appropriate for those employed, these interventions must be used within a multifaceted approach that reflects the complex nature of self-harming behavior.

AB Objective: A recent increase in suicide among the Tiwi people of Bathurst and Melville Islands in the Northern Territory led to a review of recent suicides in the Top End of the Northern Territory using the coroner's records. The aim of the review was to establish through the coronial files whether there were any significant differences in the factors that related to suicide in Aboriginal people and other people in the Top End.
   Method: Coronial determinations of suicide in the Top End for the years 1991-1998 were examined using a structured coding instrument.
   Results: Hanging was a prominent method of suicide among Aboriginal people. Abor-i-ginals who committed suicide were more likely to have a history of self-harm behaviour. Suicide among Aboriginal people was irregular in distribution with a higher general risk for Aboriginal people resident in the east Arnhem region. A recent rise in suicide in the Tiwi community occurred against a background of social disruption similar to that which occurred against suicides in the Aboriginal population of the Kimberley region in Western Australia.
   Conclusions: There are some important differences in the factors attributed to suicide in the Aboriginal and other populations in the Top End. Furthermore, our study highlights regional differences in suicide risk among different Aboriginal populations in the Top End.

AB In this article, Professor McClurg makes the case for mandatory safe gun storage laws as a means of reducing adolescent suicides. He has argued in other articles in favor of safe storage as a means of reducing accidental shootings and criminal misuse of stolen guns. The article begins by analyzing firearms suicides in the U.S., which McClurg calls "the forgotten statistic in the gun control debate." He reviews numerous studies establishing a nexus between guns and suicide, particularly between guns in the home and adolescent suicide. He then examines ten different studies showing that large percentages of American gun owners engage in unsafe firearm storage practices. He concludes by calling for the passage of safe storage laws similar to those enacted in Australia and Canada as a way to reduce gun tragedies of all types-especially adolescent suicides-resulting from unauthorized users gaining access to unsecured guns.

AB Objectives: Improving the care that patients receive after a suicide attempt will reduce the risk of a subsequent suicide attempt. We described how care for these patients can be improved and identified the available guidelines.
   Methods: We reviewed the literature on crisis and aftercare, psychosocial assessment, risk assessment, brief contact interventions, and brief interventions.
   Results: People who have made a suicide attempt are at increased risk of suicide, and the period immediately after discharge from hospital is particularly risky. Patients require an empathic response at their first point of contact, comprehensive psychosocial assessment, effective discharge planning, rapid and assertive follow-up, and coordinated care in the subsequent months.
   Conclusions: Empathic and effective care that begins in the emergency department and extends through to community care is imperative. Enough is known about the risks of inadequate care and the key ingredients of effective care to proceed with changes to Australia's healthcare response to a suicide attempt.

AB Aim: The present study aims to analyse predicting factors of suicide among older adults compared to sudden death controls and middle-aged suicides.
   Methods: During the period 2006-2008, at two Australian sites, the psychological autopsy method was utilised to investigate suicides of individuals over the age of 35 by interviewing next-of-kin and healthcare professionals. A case-control study design was applied using sudden death cases as controls. Initial information was gathered, from coroner's offices. Potential informants were approached and interviews were conducted using a semi-structured format.
   Results: In total, 261 suicides (73 aged 60+) and 182 sudden deaths (79 aged 60+) were involved. Older adult suicides showed a significantly lower prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses (62%) when compared to middle-aged suicide cases (80%). In both age groups, subjects who died by suicide were significantly more likely to present a psychiatric diagnosis, compared to controls; however, diagnosis did not remain in the final prediction model for older adults. Hopelessness and past suicide attempts remained in the final model for both age groups. In addition, living alone was an important predictor of suicide in older adults.
   Conclusion: Although mood disorders represent an important target for suicide prevention in old age, there should be increased attention for other risk factors including psychosocial, environmental, and general health aspects of late life. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: This research aimed to identify significantly elevated areas of risk for suicide in Virginia adjusting for risk factors and risk factor uncertainty.
   Methods: We fit three Bayesian hierarchical spatial models for relative risk of suicide adjusting for risk factors and considering different random effects. We compared models with and without incorporating parameter estimates' margin of error (MOE) from the American Community Survey and identified counties with significantly elevated risk and highly significantly elevated risk for suicide.
   Results: Incorporating MOEs and using a mixing parameter between unstructured and spatially structured random effects achieved the best model fit. Fifty-two counties had significantly elevated risk and 18 had highly significantly elevated risk of suicide. Models without MOEs underestimated relative risk and over-identified counties with elevated risk.
   Conclusions: Accounting for uncertainty in parameter estimates achieved better model fit. Efficient allocation of resources for suicide prevention can be attained by targeting clusters of counties with elevated risk. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Previous research showed an increase in Australian suicide rates during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). There has been no research investigating whether suicide rates by occupational class changed during the GFC. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the GFC-associated increase in suicide rates in employed Australians may have masked changes by occupational class.
   Methods: Negative binomial regression models were used to investigate Rate Ratios (RRs) in suicide by occupational class. Years of the GFC (2007, 2008, 2009) were compared to the baseline years 2001-2006.
   Results: There were widening disparities between a number of the lower class occupations and the highest class occupations during the years 2007, 2008, and 2009 for males, but less evidence of differences for females.
   Conclusions: Occupational disparities in suicide rates widened over the GFC period. There is a need for programs to be responsive to economic downturns, and to prioritise the occupational groups most affected.

AB Objectives: Suicide rates in India are among the highest in the world, resulting in an estimated 250,000 suicide deaths annually. How the media communicates with the Indian public on the topic of suicide has thus far gone without sufficient scrutiny. The objective of our study was to assess the quality of newspaper reporting of suicide-related news in India against World Health Organization suicide reporting guidelines.
   Methods: We used content analysis to assess the quality of suicide reporting against World Health Organization guidelines in nine of the most highly read daily newspapers in the southern state of Tamil Nadu between June and December 2016. Five of the nine newspapers under review were in the top 20 most circulated daily newspapers in the country.
   Results: A total of 1681 suicide articles were retrieved. The mean number of suicide articles per day per newspaper was 0.9%, and 54.5% of articles were 10 sentences or less. The vast majority (95.9%) of articles primarily focused on reporting specific suicide incidents. Harmful reporting practices were very common (e.g. a detailed suicide method was reported in 43.3% of articles), while helpful reporting practices were rare (e.g. just 2.5% gave contact details for a suicide support service).
   Conclusions: We observed that a daily diet of short and explicit suicide-related news was served up to readers of newspapers. Attempts should be made to understand the perspectives of media professionals in relation to suicide reporting, and to devise strategies to boost the positive contribution that media can make to suicide prevention.

AB Background A growing number of studies indicate that sensationalist reporting of suicide is associated with increases in suicide rates, but in the light of some negative findings, the issue has remained controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the best current evidence on the association between celebrity suicide stories and subsequent suicides.
   Methods Literature searches of six data sources (Medline, Psychlit, Communication Abstracts, Education Resources Information Center, Dissertation Abstracts and Australian Public Affairs Database (APAIS)) were conducted. Studies were included if they (1) adopted an ecological design, (2) focused on celebrity suicide, (3) had completed suicide as outcome variable, (4) analysed suicide rates across all suicide methods, (5) used data from after World War II and (6) satisfied basic quality criteria.
   Results 10 studies with totally 98 suicides by celebrities met the criteria. The pooled estimate indicated a change in suicide rates (suicides per 100 000 population) of 0.26 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.43) in the month after a celebrity suicide. There was substantial heterogeneity between studies, which was explained by the type of celebrity (entertainment elite vs others) and the region of study, as indicated by mixed- effects meta- regression. The region- of- studyespecific effect of reporting a suicide by an entertainment celebrity was 0.64 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.73) in North America, 0.58 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.68) in Asia, 0.36 (95% CI -0.10 to 0.61) in Australia and 0.68 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.85) in Europe. There was no indication of publication bias.
   Conclusions Reports on celebrity suicide are associated with increases in suicides. Study region and celebrity type appear to have an impact on the effect size.

AB BackgroundThis brief report summarizes the international literature on the effectiveness of suicide prevention programs for protective and emergency services employees.
   MethodsA systematic search of 11 electronic databases was undertaken until June 30, 2015. Quantitative meta-analysis was undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of these programs on suicide rates at post-intervention. Qualitative analyses were also used to identify program components that may be associated with reductions in suicide rates.
   ResultsA total of 13 studies were included. Only six reported sufficient information on suicide rates to enable inclusion in quantitative analyses, however. On average, these programs were associated with an approximate halving in suicide rates over an average follow-up period of 5.25 years (SD=4.2; range: 1-11) (Incidence Rate Ratio 0.45, 95%CI 0.31-0.65; five studies; I-2 14.8%). Few programs integrated activities at the primary prevention level.
   ConclusionA greater focus on the relatively neglected area of workplace primary prevention could further improve suicide prevention effectiveness. Am. J. Ind. Med. 60:394-407, 2017. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Objective: Suicide rates in young people have increased during the past three decades, particularly among young males, and there is increasing public and policy concern about the issue of youth suicide in Australia and New Zealand. This paper summarises current knowledge about risk factors for suicide and suicide attempts in young people.
   Method: Evidence about risk factors for suicidal behaviour in young people was gathered by review of relevant English language articles and other papers, published since the mid-1980s.
   Results: The international literature yields a generally consistent account of the risk factors and life processes that lead to youth suicide and suicide attempts. Risk factor domains which may contribute to suicidal behaviour include: social and educational disadvantage; childhood and family adversity; psychopathology; individual and personal vulnerabilities; exposure to stressful life events and circumstances; and social, cultural and contextual factors. Frequently, suicidal behaviours in young people appear to be a consequence of adverse life sequences in which multiple risk factors from these domains combine to increase risk of suicidal behaviour.
   Conclusions: Current research evidence suggests that the strongest risk factors for youth suicide are mental disorders (in particular, affective disorders, substance use disorders and antisocial behaviours) and a history of psychopathology, indicating that priorities for intervening to reduce youth suicidal behaviours lie with interventions focused upon the improved recognition, treatment and management of young people with mental disorders.

ID CULTURAL RESEARCH; MEDIA
AB Suicide prevention has been an area of concern in Australia for several decades and recent statistics continue to highlight the extent to which this continues to be a community and public health issue. Historical and contemporary theories about why suicide occurs focus on a range of individual, social and broader societal factors and these are reflected in policy directions and program development. Community psychology principles can be applied to assist in understanding the phenomenon and this paper calls for action by community psychologists and policy and program developers to further enhance understandings based on evidence and principles of social justice and empowerment.

AB Background. Suicide mortality is usually higher among men than among women. In socially disadvantaged groups, this relationship can be reversed. We investigated whether this is the case among Turkish migrants in Germany.
   Material and methods. We calculated age and sex-specific suicide rates for Turkish nationals residing in (West) Germany (11186 suicides) and for Germans aged below 65 years based on death registration data covering the period 1980-1997.
   Results. Age-adjusted suicide rates among Turks were lower than among Germans (relative risk 0.3). Among Turkish girls and young women under 18 years, however, the relative risk compared to Germans was 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.4-2.3). The male-to-female ratio in this age group was 3.2 among Germans and 0.6 among Turks. Discussion. Overall,Turks living in Germany have a lower suicide mortality than Germans. Possible explanations include a high level of social coherence in the Turkish community and religious prohibitions. The high suicide rate among Turkish girls and young women could indicate the presence of social or cultural conflict situations.

AB This article describes the process of developing a suicide guideline in palliative care. Little literature was available, but utilizing the partnership model, a working party consulted with each discipline regarding specific requirements. The working party experienced significant challenges in creating policy that would adequately cover the diverse needs of all members of the palliative care team, as it was recognized that all staff needed guidance. The final guideline incorporated specific action plans for each discipline; mandatory training for all staff was endorsed through a recognized suicide alertness training program; advanced training in suicide intervention skills for key clinical staff will be required; and a Rapid Plan Team was recommended. This policy development has required significant work and the combined expertise of many disciplines.

AB Objective: A study on the incidence of suicide in the train system and a description of main characteristics of victims and attempters was commissioned by Queensland Rail in response to an apparent increase of suicide phenomena and their consequences.
   Methods: Two sources of data were used for the analyses: the Queensland Suicide Register (QSR) and the Queensland Rail Incident Surveillance Information System (ISIS). Data on suicide were cross-checked on the two systems for the years 1990-2004. ISIS provided information on cases of attempted suicide for the period 1993-2206.
   Results: One hundred and sixty-one train suicide victims were identified. Globally, they represented 2% of all cases of suicide in Queensland. During the examined period no significant changes in trends of suicide through that method were found. Of all suicide cases, 59 (36.6%) included victims aged 15-24 years. The ratio of male : female was 4: 1, equal to the sex distribution of suicide with all methods in Queensland. Positive blood alcohol content was found in nearly 50% of young people and in 29.8% of the total sample. A psychiatric diagnosis was documented in 40.4% of all train suicide victims. Only 18 suicide attempters were identified through the ISIS database; of them, 15 were male and three were female, with a gender ratio similar to that of suicide victims.
   Conclusions: This study involved the largest dataset ever published in Australia on this topic. In Queensland, train suicides presented a stable trend during 1990-2004. Subjects of very young age (15-24) seem to be particularly exposed to this method; in this age group one in two individuals had positive blood alcohol content.

AB This study seeks to establish whether medico-legal practitioners differ in their autopsy conclusions within and across medico-legal institutions. Data include 459 violent deaths (homicides, suicides, and accidents) autopsy reports written by more than 20 death certifiers from four medico-legal institutions in two countries (France and the United States). Multinomial models show that compared with accidental deaths, weapon use and decedents' characteristics both influence a homicide verdict, but not a suicide one. In addition, French practitioners are more likely than Americans to reach a conclusion of homicide or suicide compared with accident, and homicides are more likely to be certified by male practitioners.

TI The impact of strengthening mental health services to prevent suicidal
   behaviour
SO AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE Suicide; mental health services; epidemiology; system dynamics
ID RATES; AVAILABILITY; PROVIDERS; MODEL
AB Objective: Successive suicide prevention frameworks and action plans in Australia and internationally have called for improvements to mental health services and enhancement of workforce capacity. However, there is debate regarding the priorities for resource allocation and the optimal combination of mental health services to best prevent suicidal behaviour. This study investigates the potential impacts of service capacity improvements on the incidence of suicidal behaviour in the Australian context. Methods: A system dynamics model was developed to investigate the optimal combination of (1) secondary (acute) mental health service capacity, (2) non-secondary (non-acute) mental health service capacity and (3) resources to re-engage those lost to services on the incidence of suicidal behaviour over the period 2018-2028 for the Greater Western Sydney (Australia) population catchment. The model captured population and behavioural dynamics and mental health service referral pathways and was validated using population survey and administrative data, evidence syntheses and an expert stakeholder group. Results: Findings suggest that 28% of attempted suicide and 29% of suicides could be averted over the forecast period based on a combination of increases in (1) hospital staffing (with training in trauma-informed care), (2) non-secondary health service capacity, (3) expansion of mental health assessment capacity and (4) re-engagement of at least 45% of individuals lost to services. Reduction in the number of available psychiatric beds by 15% had no substantial impact on the incidence of attempted suicide and suicide over the forecast period. Conclusion: This study suggests that more than one-quarter of suicides and attempted suicides in the Greater Western Sydney population catchment could potentially be averted with a combination of increases to hospital staffing and non-secondary (non-acute) mental health care. Reductions in tertiary care services (e.g. psychiatric hospital beds) in combination with these increases would not adversely affect subsequent incidence of suicidal behaviour.

TI Trends in hanging and firearm suicide rates in Australia: Substitution
   of method?
SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
ID GUN-CONTROL; PREVENTION
AB This study examined the increase in the rate of suicide by hanging and an apparently simultaneous decrease in the rate of suicide by firearm as hypothetical evidence that Australian males have substituted one method of suicide for another. Trends in hanging and firearm suicide rates were examined from 1975 to 1998 for all Australian males and from 1971 to 1998 for a subset of Australian male. youth, as well as a group of Australian males aged over 64 years at the time of their death. When the firearm suicide rate for Australian males declined the hanging rate increased simultaneously, with no statistical difference in the rate of change of the two methods. A similar pattern of simultaneous divergence in hanging and firearm suicide rates of a 15- to 24-year-old subgroup occurred at a not dissimilar rate over a longer time period. Rates of suicide by hanging were found to have begun increasing prior to the decline in firearm suicide. The declining rate of firearm suicide in the 15- to 24-year-old subgroup coincided with an increase in the overall suicide rate. Relationships between trends in hanging and firearm suicide differed between states and between urban And non-urban areas within Queensland, with the firearm suicide rate falling more rapidly in urban areas, especially following the introductions of restrictions to weapon purchases. Individual suicide method choice may be related to independent changes in the social acceptability of each method, as well as to an increasing prevalence of suicide in younger males, who arc more likely to use the hanging method. The functioning and effect of social acceptability remains unclear, however. Intervention and prevention strategies should focus on challenging the social acceptability of hanging, especially among males aged 15 to 24 years.

AB Terminal sedation is a medically induced coma from which the patient does not recover. Professional guidelines for palliative care restrict its use to within a few days of death. The law relating to its use in Australia is governed by the law of homicide, assisted suicide and the law of trespass. In this article, I argue that the law in Australia does not justify the restrictions on its use imposed by the professional guidelines, and that, ethically and legally, it can be made available to patients with a terminal disease, those who are likely to suffer serious physical or existential pain by remaining conscious, and for those who refuse food and water. Its use should be regulated to ensure that those asking for it are competent to do so, and that they are suffering from a medical condition that makes life intolerable for them.

TI Railway suicide clusters: how common are they and what predicts them?
SO INJURY PREVENTION
LA English
DT Article
ID PHYSICAL BARRIERS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PREVENTION; BEHAVIOR; HOTSPOTS; RISK
AB Background A growing number of studies have sought to detect clusters of all suicides, but few have sought to identify clusters of method-specific suicides.
   Methods Data on railway suicides occurring in Victoria, Australia, between 2001 and 2012 were obtained from the National Coronial Information System. We used the Poisson discrete scan statistic to identify railway suicides that occurred close together in space and/or time. We then used a case-control design to compare clustered railway suicides with non-clustered railway suicides on a range of individual and neighbourhood factors.
   Results We detected four spatial clusters that accounted for 35% of all railway suicides. Railway suicides by individuals who were hospitalised for mental illness had nearly double the odds of being in a cluster compared with those individuals who had never been hospitalised (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.18). Higher frequency train services were associated with increased odds of being in a cluster (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.19). No other predictors were associated with being in a cluster.
   Conclusions Railway suicides that occur in clusters warrant particular attention because of the ripple effect they can have for communities and the risk that they may lead to copycat acts. Railway suicide prevention strategies should consider the fact that these suicides can occur in clusters, particularly among individuals who had previous hospitalisations for mental illness or live in areas with high-frequency train services.

AB Background: The elderly population size is growing worldwide due increased life expectancy and decreased mortality in the elderly. This has lead to an increase in the number of centenarians, and their numbers are predicted to increase further. Little is known about suicide rates in centenarians.
   Methods: Data on the number of suicides (ICD-10 codes, X60-84) in centenarians of both gender for as many years as possible from 2000 were ascertained from three sources: colleagues, national statisics office websites and e-mail contact with the national statistics offices of as many countries as possible. The number of centernarians for the corresponding years was estimated for each country using data provided by the United Nations website.
   Results: Data were available from 17 countries. The suicide rate was 57 (95% confidence interval 45-69) per 100, 000 person years in men and 6.8 (95% confidence interval 5.1-8.5) per 100,000 person years in women.
   Conclusions: Suicide rates were sufficiently large amongst centenarians for there to constitute a public health concern given the anticipated rise in the centenarian population and the paucity of data on risk and protective factors for suicide in this age group.

AB Objectives: To identify and describe suicide data for occupational classifications relating to farm managers and agricultural labourers for Australia for the period 1988 to 1997, and to relate resultant suicide rates to farmers' terms of trade.
   Method: Descriptive and linear regression analysis of aggregated mortality data.
   Results: In the period 1988 to 1997, 921 suicides were identified. The majority of these suicides were farm managers (67.4%). Farm manager suicides occurred predominantly in older age groups (55 + years). In comparison agricultural labourer suicides were younger, with the majority of suicides occurring in the 15-39 years age group. The most common methods for both groups were firearms (particularly hunting rifles and shot guns), hanging and motor vehicle exhaust gas. These methods accounted for approximately 81% of all male farm suicides. Firearms accounted for 51% of male farm suicide, in comparison to 23% for the wider Australian male population for the same period. Estimated age standardized rates per 100 000 for male farm managers for the 10-year period ranged from 24.8 to 51.4. For male agricultural labourers these rates ranged from 23.5 to 41.9. Analyses also revealed a negative correlation (r=-0.75, p<0.01) between farm manager suicide rates and farmers' terms of trade.
   Conclusion: Male farm manager and agricultural labourer suicide rates are higher than male national rates and rates in the wider rural population, particularly in the later years of the period investigated. Firearms prefigure as the most common method of suicide, despite decreases in this method in the wider rural population. Establishing more accurate denominator data for the farming community is a priority, as is preventative action that accounts for unique aspects of farm life.

ID CAR; FATALITIES; INTENT
AB Objective: Around the world, a substantial proportion of motor vehicle crash deaths are recognized as "hidden" suicides. This project sought to progress understandings of drivers who used a motor vehicle to die by suicide in Queensland, Australia, during the period 1990 to 2007.
   Methods: Data for this study were derived from the Queensland Suicide Register and forensic crash investigation case records. Analysis focused on life circumstances and events preceding the death, physical and mental illnesses, past suicidality, and indication of suicide intent (e. g., suicide notes or statements).
   Results: Compared to cases using other methods, confirmed driver suicides were more likely to be males aged between 25 and 44 years who were employed at the time of death. A large proportion of driver suicides had consumed alcohol immediately prior to the crash and experienced a number of life events, including relationship conflict, legal or criminal issues, and financial problems.
   Conclusion: These exploratory results indicate the need to educate crash investigators about the characteristics of those who use a motor vehicle to die. Improving the information available on the mental and physical health and background life-related factors of crash victims can help coroners and researchers determine whether these deaths were intentional. Further investigation is needed in order to formulate intervention strategies for those who may be vulnerable to driver suicide.

AB Introduction: Suicide in older people is a public health concern. Emergency nurses are ideally placed to identify suicide risk. Therefore, the aim of this research was to explore emergency nurses' knowledge, confidence and attitudes about suicide in older people.
   Methods: This descriptive exploratory study was conducted in four emergency departments in Sydney, Australia. Data were collected using a 28-item survey from a convenience sample of emergency nurses. Descriptive quantitative statistics and conventional content analysis were performed. Ethics approval was provided.
   Results: The response rate was 58% (n = 136); the majority were female with an average of seven years emergency experience. The majority (n = 124, 91%) reported that they frequently managed suicidal behaviour and recognized suicide as a common event (80%). 51% (n = 69) recognized that suicide was a common event for older people. Only 16% (n = 22) reported receiving suicide prevention training with 11% feeling confident in managing suicidal behaviour.
   Conclusion: The findings contribute to the discourse on how suicide in older people is recognised by emergency nurses. Few nurses considered it a problem for older people and were not confident about their knowledge. There is a need for suicide prevention training as a priority particularly to identify risks in older people.

AB Given the continued paucity of research into suicide in lesbian and gay (LG) people, there is a need to investigate the characteristics of those LG suicides that are able to be identified. The aim of this article was to analyze pathways to suicide in lesbian and gay individuals by way of life charts. Data were gathered through of 24 psychological autopsy interviews with next-of-kin of an LG person who had died by suicide. The female (n = 5) and male (n = 19) cases in this study clustered into younger and older suicides. The defining feature of the younger suicides was lack of acceptance by family and, to a lesser extent, self, and that of the older suicides was romantic relationship conflict, although this was also common in younger suicides. There appears to have been, furthermore, an accumulation of risk factors, particularly in the period prior to death where these specific risk factors combined with other life stressors, such as work problems. Initiatives to reduce stigma around diversity in sexuality and to support families and young people through the coming out process as well as services designed to assist those experiencing problems in same-sex relationships, in particular, would appear to be the most relevant within the trajectories presented.

The trained telephone counsellors of the service record information on many of their calls in Lifeline's Client Service Management Information System (CSMIS). This paper presents a descriptive summary of a national CSMIS data set, which was compiled during a 3-month period in 2003. The CSMIS data provided a clear national profile of the callers to the service. The results of this study support the hypothesis that callers are generally seeking social support from the service. The discussion explores the implications of this finding for Lifeline and other generalist counselling and referral services and their capacity to offer suicide intervention to the community.

AB This study investigated whether secondary schools in Australia and England had a plan to manage traumatic incidents and to identify practice and programs related to grief education and suicide intervention and prevention. Ninety-four percent of an Australian sample of 145 schools had such plans in place, compared with only 15% of an English sample of 200 schools. Differing policy contexts for grief, and the lack of teacher training and minimal education about grief in England, were discussed as possible explanations for the variation. It is concluded that a more proactive approach will only be achieved when there is system-level policy and training support, as well as school and individual teacher recognition of their potential contribution to young people's well being.

AB Objective: Our aim was (1) to examine global and Australian data with a view to determining the presence of an inverse relationship between suicide and homicide rates, and (2) to examine global Human Development Index (HDI) values and suicide and homicide rates, with a view to determining any statistical relationship.
   Method: Suicide and homicide rates and HDI values were available for 102 countries, and suicide and homicide rates were available for the states and territories of Australia. The three data sets had non-normal distributions, and the non-parametric Spearman's was used for correlation statistics with = 0.05.
   Results: We found a weak, statistically significant inverse relationship between the suicide and homicide rates of 102 countries ( = -0.244, p = 0.014). No relationship was established for the Australian values, however. As anticipated, we found a significant negative correlation between homicide and HDI values. We unexpectedly demonstrated a positive correlation between suicide rates and HDI values.
   Conclusion: The notion that suicide and homicide have an inverse relationship now has some scientific support; but additional research is warranted to characterise and explain this relationship. The unexpected finding of a positive correlation between suicide rates and HDI values requires further examination.

TI Do newspaper reports of suicides comply with standard suicide reporting
   guidelines? A study from Bangalore, India
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY

DT Article
DE Suicide; media; suicide reporting
ID MEDIA GUIDELINES; HONG-KONG; AUSTRALIA; CELEBRITY; STORIES; RATES; NEWS
AB Background: Several countries have prescribed standard guidelines for media professionals on suicide reporting. However, the implementation of these guidelines has been varied. Suicide rates in South Asia are one of the highest in the world, and it is known that media guidelines for suicide reporting are not followed adequately. However, there are no published reports available from this region.
   Aim: This study aimed at assessing newspaper reports of suicide for quality of reporting based on standard reporting guidelines and to study differences between English and vernacular (Kannada) newspapers in Bangalore, South India.
   Methods: A total of 341 newspaper reports of suicide from 550 newspapers (3 English and 3 Kannada) over 3 months were systematically assessed for compliance with reporting guidelines. Each report was evaluated on 2 domains and 36 parameters. Data were analyzed for frequency of inappropriate reporting and patterns compared between vernacular and English newspapers.
   Results: In all, 87% of the reports were those of completed suicide. Non-compliant reporting - method of suicide was reported in 89% and 32% of reports were in prominent pages of the newspaper, 95% mentioned gender, 90% reported the name, 80% reported age and suicide location, 75% reported life events related to suicide, 70% reported occupation, 69% had headline explicity on suicide and 61% reported monocausality. Only 16% reported mental disorder related to suicide, and less than 3% included information on suicide prevention and helplines. Vernacular papers showed significantly better compliance in 16 of the 20 areas. However, protective characteristics were better reported in English newspapers.
   Conclusion: Majority of reports on suicides in newspapers from Bangalore did not comply with standard guidelines of reporting. There is a strong need to evolve local guidelines and mechanisms for ensuring responsible reporting which have important implications in prevention of suicide.

   TRENDS
AB Although suicide accounts for a small percentage of deaths in Scotland (1.4% in 1999), it has been steadily increasing over the last two decades. In the US, Australia, England and Wales the greatest rises in suicide for this time period, occurred in rural areas. This study describes the pattern and magnitude of urban/rural variation in suicide in Scotland, examines methods of suicide within differing geographies and looks at trends in suicides over time.
   Scotland is split into four rurality types. Suicide data for all areas of Scotland (apart from Grampian which underwent changes in postcode sector boundaries in 1996) are investigated using Standardised Mortality Ratios (SMRs) and multilevel Poisson modelling, adjusting for age, sex and deprivation. SMRs for 1981-85, 1989-93 and 1995-99 are created across the four geographies, using the populations of Scotland in 1983, 1991 and 1997 as the standard populations (SMR = 100). The highest rates in 1995-99 are seen in "remote rural" areas, SMR = 125 (95% confidence interval 107-146). Models adjusted for age and deprivation show significantly greater risk of male suicide in remote rural areas relative to urban areas and significantly lower risk of female suicide in accessible rural areas. The method of suicide varies across ruralities for both males and females. The study considers how the relationship between suicides and rurality varies over time and how methods of suicide vary across different ruralities. The steepest rises in suicide amongst men, adjusting for age and deprivation, were seen to occur in accessible rural areas, however highest rates remain in remote rural areas. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB R U OK? is an Australian-based organisation that aims to prevent suicide by empowering and encouraging community members to have regular, meaningful conversations with those around them by asking, 'Are you ok?' One of the organisation's main activities is 'R U OK? Day', a national day of action held in Australia every year to remind people of the importance of connecting with and supporting those around them who may be troubled. This paper primarily examines data from a 2014 Australia-wide population survey evaluating the effectiveness of the R U OK? campaign in promoting its message. Following R U OK? Day in 2014, approximately two-thirds of participants reported being aware of R U OK?, with one in five of these participating in R U OK? Day activities. Overall, people believed that the R U OK? campaign has a positive impact on people's willingness to talk to others about their problems and seek professional help, and in reducing the stigma associated with help-seeking. The findings were positive, but future work should also investigate outcomes such as knowledge, stigma and help-seeking in order to demonstrate the efficacy of the campaign.

AB Objective: People bereaved by suicide, people who make suicide attempts and people who care for someone at risk of suicide may experience negative psychosocial and physical health outcomes. Provision of support to these populations is an important component of suicide prevention and postvention in Australia, including the Queensland Suicide Prevention Action Plan 2015-2017. This study aimed to identify, classify and review resources available in Queensland for people affected by suicide using an innovative classification framework. Method: Searches of the grey literature were completed in Google Chrome in August/September 2016 using seven search terms relevant to Queensland. The first three pages of results were recorded, assessed for suitability, and analysed using a classification framework created by the authors. Results: The study found 24 resources for people affected by suicide in Queensland. The majority of resources (n = 14, 58%) targeted the bereaved, four (17%) addressed carers of people affected by suicide, and six (25%) were general suicide prevention resources. None of the resources specifically targeted people who have made a suicide attempt. The quality of the resources varied and only two had been evaluated. Discussion: Using the classification framework the study identified several gaps, such as relative lack of resources for specific vulnerable populations, including minority subgroups, older adults and men. There is also space for improvement in both the implementation of rigorous evaluation and quality assurance mechanisms for the development of suicide prevention and postvention resources, and in their co-creation with consumers.

AB Suicide and self-harm represent serious global health problems and appear to be especially elevated amongst indigenous minority groups, and particularly amongst young people (aged 24 years or younger). This systematic review investigates for the first time the antecedents and prevalence of suicide, self-harm and suicide ideation among Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth. Web of Science, PubMed, PsychINFO, CINAHL databases and grey literature were searched from earliest records to April 2019 for eligible articles. Twenty-two empirical articles met the inclusion criteria. The data confirmed that indigenous youth in Australia have elevated rates of suicide, self-harm and suicidal ideation relative to the nonindigenous population. Risk factors included being incarcerated, substance use and greater social and emotional distress. Notably, though, information on predictors of suicide and self-harm remains scarce. The findings support and justify the increasing implementation of public health programs specifically aimed at tackling this crisis. Based on the review findings, we argued that Aboriginal communities are best positioned to identify and understand the antecedents of youth self-harm, suicide ideation and suicide, and to take the lead in the development of more effective mental health preventive strategies and public policies within their communities.

AB Background: The school system has been identified as an ideal setting for the implementation of prevention and early intervention programs for suicide. However, in Australia, suicide-prevention programs that are routinely delivered in the schools are lacking. Internationally, evidence exists for the effectiveness of peer-led interventions that take a social connectedness approach to improve help-seeking for suicide. The aim of the current trial is to test the effectiveness of the Sources of Strength program to promote help-seeking for suicide in adolescents in Australian high schools.
   Methods/design: This study is a two-arm, cluster-randomised, controlled trial that will compare the evidence-based Sources of Strength program to a wait-list control condition. Sixteen Australian high schools will be recruited to the trial, with all adolescents in years 7 to 10 (12-16 years of age) invited to participate. Peer leaders from intervention-condition schools will receive training in the Sources of Strength program and will integrate positive messages, across 3 months, with the support of adult advisors. Activities may take the form of class presentations, posters, videos, and messages on social media sites and will aim to change help-seeking norms, strengthen youth-adult connections, and promote positive coping. The primary outcome measure for the study is help-seeking intentions, whereas secondary outcomes include help-seeking behaviour, help-seeking attitudes and norms, referral of distressed peers, availability of adult help, positive coping, and suicidal behaviour. Data will be collected pre-intervention, post-intervention (after the initial 3 months of messaging), and at the end of the first (6-month follow-up) and the second year after implementation (18-month follow-up). Primary analyses will compare changes in help-seeking intentions for the intervention condition relative to the wait-list control condition using mixed-effect repeated-measures analyses to account for clustering within schools.
   Discussion: If proven effective, this universal social connectedness program for suicide could be more widely delivered in Australian high schools, providing a valuable new resource. The Sources of Strength program has the potential to significantly contribute to the mental health of young people in Australia by improving help-seeking for suicide. The findings from this research will also contribute to the evidence-base for peer-leadership programs internationally.

AB Objectives: 1) To compare the 2-year completed suicide and reattempt rates in a preintervention group of Hong Kong Chinese suicide attempters (aged 65 years and older) who received standard care and a postintervention group enrolled in a regional elderly suicide prevention program (ESPP) that adopts a two-tiered multifaceted care management model and 2) to examine the trend of suicide rates in older adults aged 65 years and older in the pre- and postintervention periods. Design: The first part is an observational cohort study with baseline, follow-up, and outcome data being identified from a clinical electronic registry. The second part examines changes in suicide rates from official mortality statistics. Setting: A government-funded suicide intervention program serving catchment population (852,796 people aged 65 years and older) in Hong Kong, China. Participants: Suicide attempters (aged 65 years and older) presenting to old-age psychiatric service in the pre- and postintervention phases. Measurements: 1) Two-year rates of completed suicide and suicide reattempt and 2) changes in population suicide rates in the pre- and postintervention periods. Results: The 2-year completed suicide rate was 7.58% in the preintervention group (N = 66) and 1.99% in the ESPP group (N = 351) chi(2) = 6.192; p value: 0.028; df = 1). Reattempt rates were not different. At a population level, suicide rate dropped significantly only in women aged 85 years and older, relative to the preintervention period. Conclusions: The ESPP was associated with a reduced rate of completed suicide in old-age suicide attempters and might have contributed to a fall of suicide rate in women aged 85 years and older.

AB The doctrine of double effect (DDE) is a principle of crucial importance in law and medicine. In medicine, the principle is generally accepted to apply in cases where the treatment necessary to relieve pain and physical suffering runs the risk of hastening the patient's death. More controversially, it has also been used as a justification for withdrawal of treatment from living individuals and physician-assisted suicide. In this paper, I will critique the findings of the controversial Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) hearing Syme vs the Medical Board of Australia. In that hearing, Dr Rodney Syme, a urologist and euthanasia advocate, was defending his practice of prescribing barbiturates to terminally ill patients. Syme claimed that he prescribed the drugs with the intention of relieving their existential suffering and not to assist in suicide; he argued that the DDE could be applied. Pace VCAT, I argue that this is an illegitimate application of DDE. I argue that a close scrutiny of Syme's actions reveals that, at the very least, he intended to give patients the option of suicide. He furthermore used what on a traditional definition of DDE would be considered a bad' meansthe prescription of Nembutalto achieve a good' endthe relief of suffering. The case demonstrates the crucial importance of analysing an agent's intention' and the effects' of their actions when applying DDE. Ethicists and, indeed, the judiciary need to attend to the ethical complexities of DDE when they assess the applicability of DDE to end of life care. If they fail to do this, the doctrine risks losing its legitimacy as an ethical principle.

AB The purpose of this study was to ascertain the prevalence and correlates of self-harm among young people in detention in Australia. The sample included 215 (177 male; 38 female) young people who were in youth detention in the state of Victoria, Australia. Participants were administered a series of questionnaires related to self-harm, mental health, socio-environmental experiences and behaviours. Overall, one-third (33%) of the sample reported previous self-harm and 12% reported at least one suicide attempt. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, a history of childhood trauma, contact with mental health services, and low educational interest significantly increased the likelihood of self-harm. Young people who reported a suicide attempt scored significantly higher on the measure of childhood trauma than did youth who had engaged in non-suicidal self-harm. Findings demonstrate a strong connection between childhood traumatic experiences and suicidal behaviours for youth in detention. Trauma histories and mental health concerns must be considered when identifying youth at increased risk of self-harm.

AB Study Design: Retrospective analysis of acute spinal cord injuries (ASCI).
   Objectives: Determine incidence of ASCI due to suicide attempt from 1970 to 2000. Describe demographics, injuries, mental illness, functional outcomes and nature of subsequent deaths.
   Setting: State spinal cord injury services, New South Wales, Australia.
   Methods: Retrospective record review and follow-up interview.
   Results: Of 2752 ASCI admissions, 56 were because of attempted suicide (55 falls, one gunshot wound). Thirty-six males and 20 females. Median age 30 years (15-74). Most common levels of vertebral injury were C5 and L1. Twenty-three had complete spinal cord injury. Thirty-two had an Injury Severity Score of > 415. Forty had more than one major injury. There was a significant rise in the incidence of ASCI following self-harm over time (Poisson regression, P = 0.004). There was a significant change in scene of injury away from hospitals over time (w 2 test, df = 1, P = 0.0001). Psychiatric diagnoses were personality disorder 27; schizophrenia 16; depression 14; chronic alcohol abuse 10; mood disorder 10; chronic substance abuse 10; other four. Follow-up was available in 47 cases (84%) at an average of 8 years. Four subsequent deaths were by suicide. Domiciliary arrangements were: home 28; hospital five; nursing home three; group home/hostel four.
   Conclusions: Community placement outcomes for survivors were good. Subsequent death by suicide was high. There was a significant rise in cases and a change in injury scene away from hospitals over time.

AB Background: The atrocity of 9/11 exemplified 'external' caused civil violent deaths, which have major policy implications for the countries contributing armed forces to the 'Coalition-In-Iraq' [C.I.I]. C.I.I Government's resources for perennial 'internal' violent deaths (suicide, homicide and road), are likely to be threatened by alternative priorities. C.I.I 'internal' deaths are compared with those of 9/11 to provide information to determine relative risks.
   Material/Methods: To uniformly compare mortality between countries we utilise the most recent WHO mortality data, taking the latest three years 1997-1999 and calculating an average annual number and rate of 'internal' deaths in each country, these are compared with the 9/11 fatalities, calculating a proportional ratio, as an indicator of differential damage to families and society.
   Results: USA 'external' deaths were 3,074 people and annual average suicides were 30,966. Total 'internal' deaths exceeded 'external' more than 30 times. Every fortnight there are more USA 'internal' violent deaths than on 9/11. Except Australia and Bulgaria, every country had more suicides than died on 9/11. Apart from Bulgaria, total 'internal' deaths exceeded the 'external' toll in all other CAI countries- by 14 times in Japan; 6 in Republic of Korea, 4 in Italy, 3 in Spain and the UK, twice in Canada and 1.5 times in Australia.
   Conclusions: The extent of 'internal' civil violent deaths, such as suicide, highlight the perennial pressures upon psychiatric services and the need to defend resources at a time of competing priorities.

AB Background: Indigenous Australians experience a suicide rate over twice that of the general population. With nonfatal deliberate self-harm (DSH) being the single most important risk factor for suicide, characterizing the incidence and repetition of DSH in this population is essential.Aims: To investigate the incidence and repetition of DSH in three remote Indigenous communities in Far North Queensland, Australia. Method: DSH presentation data at a primary health-care center in each community were analyzed over a 6-year period from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2011. Results: A DSH presentation rate of 1,638 per 100,000 population was found within the communities. Rates were higher in age groups 15-24 and 25-34, varied between communities, and were not significantly different between genders; 60% of DSH repetitions occurred within 6 months of an earlier episode. Of the 227 DSH presentations, 32% involved hanging. Limitations: This study was based on a subset of a larger dataset not specifically designed for DSH data collection and assesses the subset of the communities that presented to the primary health-care centers. Conclusion: A dedicated DSH monitoring study is required to provide a better understanding of DSH in these communities and to inform early intervention strategies.

DE young women; young men; suicide; gender; sexuality
ID RISK; GAY
AB The suicide rate among young people in Australia has caused considerable concern and been the focus of research and intervention. Issues related to sexuality and gender can be the source of conflict for young people within their communities, and have been implicated in suicide attempts. This paper examines the cultural context of youth suicide, and asks how youth suicide may be related to emerging sexual identity, which all young people must negotiate through the customs, discourse and taboos of their society. In particular, it focuses on the situation of young heterosexual women. The findings are based on interviews with 41 young people, parents and youth service providers regarding youth suicide. Interviews were semi-structured and open-ended, and conducted in a suburban community. They included the use of scenarios or vignettes. Finding, suggest that traditional constructions of gender remain widespread, and that these are often disadvantageous to both young women and young men. Parents may be unaware that they have little control over, or even knowledge about, their teenagers' behaviour. Young people are more inclined to confide in their friends, who may not be equipped to deal with crises.

A study in South Australia over 17 years from January 1986 to December 2002 revealed 20 cases (age range, 14 to 72 years; average, 30.7 years; male to female ratio, 15:5). There were 13 suicides consisting of 11 train-related deaths (age range, 14 to 72 years; average, 31.3 years; male to female ratio, 10:1), 1 hanging death, and 1 death using a ligature and a motor vehicle. Five cases related to motor vehicle crashes (age range, 19 to 46 years; average, 30.2 years; male to female ratio, 1:4) and 2 were associated with industrial trauma. Suicidal decapitation accounted for <1% of total suicides and showed a striking male predominance, with the favored method involving trains.

AB ObjectiveThe objective of this pilot study was to gather preliminary evidence on suicidal ideation in family carers of people with dementia.
   MethodsAn online, cross-sectional survey was conducted with 120 family carers, the majority of whom were located in Australia and USA. The survey included measures of suicidality, self-efficacy, physical health, depression, hopelessness, anxiety, optimism, caregiver burden, coping strategies and social support.
   ResultsTwenty-six percent of carers had contemplated suicide more than once in the previous year. Only half of these had ever told someone they might commit suicide and almost 30% said they were likely to attempt suicide in the future. Carers who had contemplated suicide had poorer mental health, lower self-efficacy for community support service use and greater use of dysfunctional coping strategies than those who had not. In a logistic regression, only depression predicted the presence of suicidal thoughts.
   ConclusionsA significant number of people might contemplate suicide while caring for a family member with dementia. Although more research is required to confirm this finding, there are clear implications for policy and clinical practice in terms of identifying and supporting carers who are already contemplating suicide.

AB Background: Research has associated some chronic conditions with self-harm and suicide. Quantifying such a relationship in mortality data relies on accurate death records and adequate techniques for identifying these conditions.
   Objective: This study aimed to quantify the impact of identification methods for co-morbid conditions on suicides in individuals aged 30 years and older in Australia and examined differences by gender.
   Method: A retrospective examination of mortality records in the National Coronial Information System (NCIS) was conducted. Two different methods for identifying co-morbidities were compared: International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) coded data, which are provided to the NCIS by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and free-text searches of Medical Cause of Death fields. Descriptive statistics and (2) tests were used to compare the methods for identifying co-morbidities and look at differences by gender.
   Results: Results showed inconsistencies between ICD-10 coded and coronial reports in the identification of suicide and chronic conditions, particularly by type (physical or mental). There were also significant differences in the proportion of co-morbid conditions by gender.
   Conclusion: While ICD-10 coded mortality data more comprehensively identified co-morbidities, discrepancies in the identification of suicide and co-morbid conditions in both systems require further investigation to determine their nature (linkage errors, human subjectivity) and address them. Furthermore, due to the prescriptive coding procedures, the extent to which medico-legal databases may be used to explore potential and previously unrecognised associations between chronic conditions and self-harm deaths remains limited.

AB Objective: This study aimed to identify the information that people who have attempted suicide and those who support them believed to be helpful to receive after an attempt.
   Methods: Thirty-seven people with lived experience of suicide attempt(s) (suicide attempt survivors and family members/friends of survivors) were recruited through two national lived experience community groups in Australia. Participants completed a semi-structured telephone interview that included questions about the types of information they believed important to receive after an attempt.
   Results: Using thematic analysis, the key information participants identified was helpful to receive following a suicide attempt was that which could challenge stigma and address negative community attitudes towards suicide. Participants spoke of a need for practical information and information that provided hope. Personal stories of recovery were identified as an important way of communicating this sort of health information.
   Conclusions: People who have attempted suicide and their family members and friends want information that challenges stigma and supports recovery expectations.
   Practice implications: Providing people with accurate information about recovery and using personal stories to communicate health information is one way people affected by suicide attempt identify can challenge stigma, and address information needs after a suicide attempt.

AB The aim of the current systematic review was to monitor and provide an overview of the research performed about the roles of media in suicide prevention in order to find out possible effects media reporting on suicidal behaviours might have on actual suicidality (completed suicides, attempted suicides, suicidal ideation). The systematic review was performed following the principles of the PRISMA statement and includes 56 articles. Most of the studies support the idea that media reporting and suicidality are associated. However, there is a risk of reporting bias. More research is available about how irresponsible media reports can provoke suicidal behaviours (the 'Werther effect') and less about protective effect media can have (the 'Papageno effect'). Strong modelling effect of media coverage on suicide is based on age and gender. Media reports are not representative of official suicide data and tend to exaggerate sensational suicides, for example dramatic and highly lethal suicide methods, which are rare in real life. Future studies have to encounter the challenges the global medium Internet will offer in terms of research methods, as it is difficult to define the circulation of news in the Internet either spatially or in time. However, online media can provide valuable innovative qualitative research material.

AB Over two-thirds of suicide loss survivors, those who have lost a loved one to suicide, seek individual therapy following their loss. However, nothing is known about what survivors find helpful about therapy or how therapy impacts their grief. An online survey was conducted June 2012-March 2013 with a convenience sample of 197 survivors primarily from the USA and Australia to develop a better understanding of treatment seeking loss survivors and their experiences in therapy. Questions explored the experience of the suicide death, the therapy received after the loss, and insights about improving therapy for loss survivors. Participants were generally positive about their therapy experiences. However, respondents endorsed symptoms of PTSD, though many did not report a formal diagnosis from a provider, suggesting a discrepancy that could lead to inadequate treatment of symptoms. The findings provide an understanding of treatment seeking loss survivors, along with implications for therapists treating this population.

AB Background: Suicide bereavement can have a lasting and devastating psychosocial impact on the bereaved individuals and communities. Many countries, such as Australia, have included postvention, i.e., concerted suicide bereavement support, in their suicide prevention policies. While little is known of the effectiveness of postvention, this review aimed to investigate what is known of the effects of postvention service delivery models and the components that may contribute to the effectiveness.
   Method: Systematic review and quality assessment of peer reviewed literature (Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, EBMReviews) and gray literature and guidelines published since 2014.
   Results: Eight studies and 12 guidelines were included, with little evidence of effectiveness. Still, providing support according to the level of grief, involvement of trained volunteers/peers, and focusing the interventions on the grief, seem promising components of effective postvention.
   Conclusions: Adopting a public health approach to postvention can allow to tailor the service delivery to needs of the bereaved individuals and to align postvention with suicide prevention programs.

AB Police use of lethal force occurs rarely and is legally permissible when used appropriately. When police use fatal force, their behavior is highly scrutinized by the legal system and the public. The present study analyzed factors characteristic of 45 coronial investigations of police engagements that culminated in civilian fatalities between 1980 and 2008 in Victoria, Australia. Findings suggest that fatalities commonly occurred at arrest during unplanned police operation, and the majority of incidents were of short duration. The majority of the decedents were armed, acted aggressively, resisted arrest, and escalated the incident. A third of the incidents met the criteria for possible suicide by police. Differences in mental health, incident, and police response characteristics were found between those who met these criteria and those who did not. The findings and their implications for law enforcement, the public, and the mental health system are presented and discussed.

AB Three theories have been proposed to explain the relationship between suicide and economic fluctuations, including the Durkheim (nonlinear), Ginsberg (procyclical), and Henry and Short (countercyclical) theories. This study tested the effect of economic fluctuations, measured by unemployment rate, on suicide rates in Canada from 1926 to 2008. Autoregressive integrated moving average time-series models were used. The results showed a significant relationship between suicide and economic fluctuation; this association was positive during the contraction period (1926-1950) and negative in the period of economic expansion (1951-1973). Males and females showed differential effects in the period of moderate unemployment (1974-2008). In addition, the suicide rate of mid-adults (45-64) was most impacted by economic fluctuations. Our study tends to support Durkheim's theory and suggests the need for public health responses in times of economic contraction and expansion.

AB Background
   Hanging is a frequent suicide method, but developing measures to prevent suicide by this method is particularly challenging. The aim of this study is to gain new knowledge that would enable the design of effective of measures that would help prevent suicide by hanging.
   Methods
   A total of 6,497 suicides registered across the eight Swiss Forensic Institutes (IRM) were analysed. Of these, 1,282 (19.7%) persons hung themselves. T-test and chi-square tests. and chi-square tests were used to analyse...(or determine, or investigate)...group differences regarding sociodemographic variables and triggers
   Findings
   Men and women who hung themselves showed no significant differences in sociodemographic variables. However, women were significantly more likely to have a psychiatric illness history, whereas men were more likely to have somatic diagnoses. In controlled environments, people used shelves, plumbing and windows more often than beams, pipes, bars and hooks to hang themselves. Compared with other suicide methods, hanging was more likely to have been triggered by partner and financial problems.
   Conclusions
   Suicide by hanging can be best prevented in institutions (e.g. psychiatric hospitals, somatic hospitals, prisons). These institutions should be structurally evaluated and modified with a primary focus on sanitary areas, windows and shelves. Otherwise, it is important to use general suicide prevention measures, such as awareness raising and staff training in medical settings, low-threshold treatment options and regular suicide risk assessment for people at risk.

TI Do Australian media apply recommendations when covering a suicide

SO JOURNAL OF PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Suicide; Prevention; Media recommendation
ID CELEBRITY SUICIDE; GUIDELINES; COVERAGE; WELL
AB Purpose Media reporting and portrayals of mental illness and suicide can play an important role in shaping and reinforcing community attitudes and perceptions. Depending on the content, a report about suicide can have either a negative (Werther-) or a positive (Papageno-) effect. Evidence-informed recommendations for the reporting of suicide in Australia are provided under the Mindframe initiative. The purpose of this paper is to assess the application of these recommendations in broadcasts associated with one of the largest national campaigns to promote suicide prevention, the R U OK? Day, a yearly campaign of the Australian suicide prevention charity R U OK?
   Design/methodology/approach The sample consisted of 112 (32 TV, 80 radio) Australian broadcasts discussing the R U OK? Day suicide prevention campaign during the month preceding the 2015 campaign and on the national R U OK? Day itself. Broadcasts were coded for medium (TV or radio), content (suicide focus, mental illness focus or both) and consistency with Mindframe recommendations.
   Findings Over 97 per cent of broadcasts used language consistent with Mindframe recommendations. None of the broadcasts used images that negatively portrayed mental illness or suicide; there were no instances of using mental illness to describe a person's behaviour; and no sensationalizing or glamorising terminology was used in the broadcasts. However, less than 40 per cent of the broadcasts included help-seeking information (e.g. helplines) and some of the broadcasts used negative or outdated terminology (e.g. commit suicide; suffering from mental illness).
   Originality/value The present study is the first to examine consistency with reporting recommendations around a national suicide prevention campaign (R U OK? Day). The results can steer improvements in current reporting and inform strategies to optimise future reporting.

ID CARE
AB Objective: Characteristics of patients who committed suicide were examined to provide a picture of the treatment they received before death and to determine whether and how the suicides could have been pre vented by the service system. Methods: The unnatural-deaths register was matched to the psychiatric case register in the state of Victoria in Australia to identify suicides by people with a history of public-sector psychiatric service use who committed suicide between July 1, 1989, and June 30, 1994. Data on patient and treatment characteristics were examined by three experienced clinicians, who made judgments about whether the suicide could have been prevented had the service system responded differently. Quantitative and qualitative data were descriptively analyzed. Results: A total of 629 psychiatric patients who had committed suicide were identified. Seventy-two percent of the patients were male, 62 percent were under 40 years old, and 51 percent were unmarried. They had a range of disorders, with the most common being schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (36 percent). Sixty-seven percent had previously attempted suicide. A total of 311 patients (49 percent) received care within four weeks of death. Twenty percent of the suicides were considered preventable. Key factors associated with preventability were poor staff-patient relationships, incomplete assessments, poor assessment and treatment of depression and psychological problems, and poor continuity of care. Conclusions: Opportunities exist for the psychiatric service system to alter practices at several levels and thereby reduce patient suicides.

AB The present study explored both socioeconomic and climatic factors to obtain a more comprehensive view of the asymmetric regional suicide death rate during 1998-2006 in Taiwan. The annual suicide death rate, population and meteorological data from 19 cities/counties in Taiwan were analysed by multiple regression. Five socioeconomic (sex ratio, no spouse, aged, unemployment and low income) and three climatic (temperature, rainfall and sunshine) factors were identified as significant, explaining 59.0% of the variance in the total suicide death rate. 'Without spouse' and 'aged' were associated with the highest risk, while low income with financial aids' was strongly protective. The most influential climatic factor was 'temperature,' which was negatively correlated with suicide. 'Sunshine' was positively associated with suicide. The socioeconomic and climatic factors contributed 52.7% and 6.8%, respectively, to the variance of the total suicide death rate. Limitations of the study included the fact that no individual events were considered, the study was of relatively short duration and it was confined to the territory of Taiwan. Socioeconomic factors outweighed climatic factors in explaining regional differences in the suicide death rate in Taiwan. Temperature weighed more than sunshine. 'Thermotherapy' seems more clinically relevant than the popular light therapy, at least in Taiwan. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Training for health services staff often focuses on improving individual practitioner's knowledge and skills, with less emphasis given to the broader organizational context, in particular those elements that support successful implementation of changes post-training. This paper compares the effectiveness of a standard training model for suicide prevention to an enhanced training model. The training involved the public mental health workforce throughout the State of Queensland, Australia and was developed in collaboration with the State health department and as such took place within a policy and practice context. The standard training involved participation in a one-day training workshop, which provided information on evidence-based suicide prevention strategies. The enhanced model took an organizational development approach and incorporated a focus on creating and strengthening networks to enhance the capacity of mental health service staff to undertake preventive strategies. Findings suggest that multi-component organizational approaches for suicide prevention produces benefits that should now be trialled through experimental approaches.

ID HEALTH-SERVICES
AB Background: A suicide prevention media campaign aimed at family members and friends may be one useful population-level suicide prevention strategy for Australia. However. currently there is limited evidence of what messages would be acceptable and appropriate for inclusion.Aims: This expert consensus study aimed to identify messages that experts with lived experience of suicide risk and suicide prevention professionals believed were most important to include in such a suicide prevention campaign. Method: Using an online survey method, 127 participants with lived experience (lived experience group) and 33 suicide prevention professionals (suicide prevention professionals group) rated 55 statements, drawn from an earlier Delphi study, from very low priority to very/ high priority for inclusion in a suicide prevention campaign. Results: There was significant agreement within and between the two participant groups on the most highly rated messages for inclusion. The mostly highly rated messages were that family members or friends should ask directly about suicidal thoughts and intentions, listen to responses without judgment, and tell the person at risk that they care and want to help. Limitations: We restricted ratings to just one round and may therefore have limited the level of consensus achieved. Use of a predefined set of suicide prevention messages might also have prevented us from identifying other important messages. Lived experience participants were drawn from one source and this might bias their responses through exposure to common suicide prevention messages that influence their points of view. Conclusion: There is substantial agreement between professionals and people with lived experience on the most important messages to include in a suicide prevention campaign. These most highly rated messages could be adopted in a suicide prevention media campaign.

TI Diversity and change in suicide seasonality over 125 years
SO JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID NONVIOLENT SUICIDE; SEX DIFFERENCE; AUSTRALIA; VIOLENT; TRENDS; RISK
AB Background: Recent research has corroborated the notion that seasonality in suicide is more heterogeneous and less consistent than postulated by former scholars. This work investigates the smoothing out of suicide seasonality in Switzerland between the late 19th and the end of the 20th century. It includes analyses by region and by suicide method.
   Methods: Monthly suicide frequencies in Switzerland are available for the period 1876 - 2000. Data on canton/region are available for the periods 1901 - 1920 and 1969 - 2000, and data on suicide method for the periods 1881 - 1920 and 1969 - 2000. Analyses focusing on the overall change rely on data aggregated by quinquennia. The Edwards' test and the peak-low ratio were used in univariate analyses of seasonality. Putative determinants of the peak-low ratio were examined using regression analysis with cantonal data.
   Results: The decrease of seasonal effects in suicide applies to a period of more than 100 years in Switzerland. Big differences of seasonal effects have existed all the time with regard to specific methods and to specific regions. No seasonality was apparent in poisoning, and in Geneva and Basle City, respectively. However, the seasonal effects have been most impressive in drowning and hanging suicides, and in rural Catholic regions. In regression analysis, the decline in suicide seasonality is associated with the decline in the agricultural work force.
   Conclusions: The smoothing out of suicide seasonality in Switzerland has been a continuous long term process, which probably started by the end of 19th century. Seasonal effects in suicide will probably fade away in most regions of Switzerland and in most suicide methods. This process is in parallel with the disappearance of the traditional rural society.

ID PROGRAM; AUSTRALIA
AB Background: Little research has been conducted into the cost and prevention of self-harm in the workplace. Aims: To quantify the economic cost of self-harm and suicide among New South Wales (NSW) construction industry (CI) workers and to examine the potential economic impact of implementing Mates in Construction (MIC). Method: Direct and indirect costs were estimated. Effectiveness was measured using the relative risk ratio (RRR). In Queensland (QLD), relative suicide risks were estimated for 5-year periods before and after the commencement of MIC. For NSW, the difference between the expected (i.e., using NSW pre-MIC [2008-2012] suicide risk) and counterfactual suicide cases (i.e., applying QLD RRR) provided an estimate of potential suicide cases averted in the post-MIC period (2013-2017). Results were adjusted using the average uptake (i.e., 9.4%) of MIC activities in QLD. Economic savings from averted cases were compared with the cost of implementing MIC. Results: The cost of self-harm and suicide in the NSW CI was AU $527 million in 2010. MIC could potentially avert 0.4 suicides, 1.01 full incapacity cases, and 4.92 short absences, generating annual savings of AU $3.66 million. For every AU $1 invested, the economic return is approximately AU $4.6. Conclusion: MIC represents a positive economic investment in workplace safety.

Methods: The study is based on a unique census-linked dataset based on the linkages between the records from death and cancer registers and the 2001 population census records. Standardized mortality ratios for suicide (SMRs) were calculated for patients diagnosed with cancer in Lithuania between April 6, 2001 and December 31, 2009, relative to suicide rates in the general population. Results: We found that the relative suicide risk was elevated for both males and females, with SMRs of 1.43 (95% CI 1.23-1.66) and 1.32 (95% CI 0.95-1.80), respectively. This relationship for females became statistically significant and stronger after excluding skin cancers. The highest suicide risks were observed at older ages and during the period shortly after the diagnosis. The groups showing an increased suicide risk include lower educated, non-married, and rural male patients. Conclusion: The results of our study point to inadequacies of the health care system in dealing with mental health problems of cancer patients. Interventions allowing early detection of depression or suicidal ideation may help to prevent suicide among cancer patients in Lithuania. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background Between 1950 and 1995 suicide rates in Sri Lanka increased 8-fold to a peak of 47 per 100000 in 1995. By 2005, rates had halved. We investigated whether Sri Lanka's regulatory controls on the import and sale of pesticides that are particularly toxic to humans were responsible for these changes in the incidence of suicide.
   Methods Ecological analysis using graphical and descriptive approaches to identify time trends in suicide and risk factors for suicide in Sri Lanka, 1975-2005.
   Results Restrictions on the import and sales of WHO Class I toxicity pesticides in 1995 and endosulfan in 1998, coincided with reductions in suicide in both men and women of all ages. 19 769 fewer suicides occurred in 1996-2005 as compared with 1986-95. Secular trends in unemployment, alcohol misuse, divorce, pesticide use and the years associated with Sri Lanka's Civil war did not appear to be associated with these declines.
   Conclusion These data indicate that in countries where pesticides are commonly used in acts of self-poisoning, import controls on the most toxic pesticides may have a favourable impact on suicide. In Asia, there are an estimated 300000 deaths from pesticide self-poisoning annually. National and international policies restricting the sale of pesticides that are most toxic to humans may have a major impact on suicides in the region.

AB Suicide mortality among immigrant groups is an important health issue, particularly in countries with growing segments of immigrant populations such as Norway. Through linkage of Norwegian national registers we wanted to estimate suicide rates (per 100,000 population) in immigrant groups and to profile characteristics of suicide by immigration background with respect to sex, age, method and seasonality of suicide as well as time since immigrating to Norway. Among all 11,409 suicides during 1992-2012, 1,139 (10%) were individuals with an immigration background. Suicide rate was lower in first-generation immigrants (foreign-born persons to two foreign-born parents) than native Norwegians (9.53 vs 12.22, P < 0.01), with a significant difference confined to male rates only. Foreign-born persons with at least one Norwegian-born parent had significantly higher suicide rates than natives in both sexes (22.42 vs 18.03 in males, 11.67 vs 6.54 in females, P < 0.01). The most frequently used suicide method in all the population groups was hanging; this method accounted for 44.0% of all suicides of first-generation immigrants, 45.2% of all suicides of foreign-born persons with at least one Norwegian-born parent, and 35.4% of all suicides of natives. Suicide by firearms accounted for a much smaller proportion of cases of first-generation immigrants (6.7%) and foreign-born persons with at least one Norwegian-born parent (6.8%) than cases of native Norwegians (20.7%). In terms of monthly distribution, suicides of first-generation immigrants displayed two peaks, in May and in November (P= 0.01). More than 25% of all first-generation immigrant suicides occurred in the first five years after immigration; but differences in time since immigration were observed by sex and country group of origin, in particular among those aged 35 years or less when moving to Norway. In conclusion, there are notable differences in characteristics of suicides by immigration background. Knowledge of immigrant mortality according to suicide method, seasonality of suicide, and time since immigration may be useful when planning suicide preventive measures.

DT Article
ID PSYCHOSOCIAL WORK-ENVIRONMENT; PHYSICIANS; BURNOUT; RATES
AB Objectives: To report age-standardised rates and methods of suicide by health professionals, and to compare these with suicide rates for other occupations.
   Study design: Retrospective mortality study.
   Setting, participants: All intentional self-harm cases recorded by the National Coronial Information System during the period 2001-2012 were initially included. Cases were excluded if the person was unemployed at the time of death, if their employment status was unknown or occupational information was missing, or if they were under 20 years of age at the time of death. Suicide rates were calculated using Australian Bureau of Statistics population-level data from the 2006 census.
   Main outcome measures: Suicide rates and method of suicide by occupational group.
   Results: Suicide rates for female health professionals were higher than for women in other occupations (medical practitioners: incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.52; 95% CI, 1.55-4.09; P < 0.001; nurses and midwives: IRR, 2.65; 95% CI, 2.22-3.15; P < 0.001). Suicide rates for male medical practitioners were not significantly higher than for other occupations, but the suicide rate for male nurses and midwives was significantly higher than for men working outside the health professions (IRR, 1.50; 95% CI 1.12-2.01; P = 0.006). The suicide rate for health professionals with ready access to prescription medications was higher than for those in health professions without such access or in non-health professional occupations. The most frequent method of suicide used by health professionals was self-poisoning.
   Conclusion: Our results indicate the need for targeted prevention of suicide by health professionals.

DT Article
ID INDIGENOUS SAMI; QUEENSLAND; AUSTRALIA; SUNSHINE; NORWAY; GENDER
AB Background: Suicide is an important world health issue, especially in territories inhabited by indigenous people. This investigated differences in suicide rates, suicide methods, and suicide occurrence by month and day of the week among the indigenous and non-indigenous populations of the Nenets Autonomous Okrug (NAO) and to compare the findings from the NAO with national Russian statistics.
   Methods: In this retrospective population-based mortality study we investigated all suicides that occurred in the NAO in 2002-2012 (N = 252). Suicide method and the month and day of the week suicide occurred was taken from autopsy reports and disaggregated by ethnic group (indigenous and non-indigenous) and sex. Data from the NAO were then compared with national data from the Russian Federal Statistics Service (Rosstat).
   Results: Hanging was the most common suicide method in the NAO in both indigenous and non-indigenous populations. The proportion of suicides by hanging among males was lower in the NAO than in national data (69.3 vs 86.2 %), but the inverse was true for females (86.5 vs 74.9 %). Suicide by firearm and by cutting was significantly higher among the indigenous population in the NAO when compared with national data. Peaks in suicide occurrence were observed in May and September in the NAO, whereas national data showed only one peak in May. Suicide occurrence in the indigenous population of the NAO was highest in April, while the non-indigenous population showed peaks in May and September. Suicide occurrence in the NAO was highest on Fridays; in national data this occurrence was highest on Mondays.
   Conclusions: We showed different relative frequencies of suicide by hanging, cutting, and firearm, as well as different suicide occurrence by month and day of the week in the NAO compared with Russia as a whole. These results can be used to plan suicide prevention activities in the Russian Arctic.

AB Introduction. Migrants generally have more favourable mortality outcomes than the Australian-born population. The aim of this study is to update knowledge and inform future research in this field by examining mortality from musculoskeletal conditions, asthma, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, injuries and mental conditions between 1981 and 2007 among migrants in Australia.
   Methods. Average annual sex- and age-standardised mortality rates were calculated for each migrant group, period of death registration and cause of death.
   Results and Conclusions. Mortality rates decreased among most groups for asthma, cardiovascular disease and motor vehicle accidents, with rates diverging in the later time periods. The reverse was true for mental disorders, where Australian-born individuals experienced the greatest increase in mortality. Migrants generally displayed more favourable mortality outcomes than their Australian-born counterparts. Migrants from Southern Europe appeared to have the greatest advantage. However, some migrants appeared to be over-represented in the areas of diabetes, suicide and mental health.

AB What was the influence of religious identity, beliefs and practices on attitudes to euthanasia in Australia during the 1990s? To address this question I analyse data from national representative surveys and find that denomination, church attendance and beliefs in personal God all made a difference to attitudes to voluntary and non-voluntary euthanasia in unique ways. Moreover, the acceptance of a scientific outlook, comprising elements of Darwinism and modern cosmology, enhanced support for the right to 'easy death' amongst the non-religious. Formal education did not directly polarize attitudes to this issue, but it raised the likelihood of accepting a scientific cosmology. A scientific outlook, in turn, strengthened the belief that, in some circumstances, the deliberate taking of life should be allowed. But even as levels of education increased and both church attendance and the intensity of religious beliefs declined, Australian churchgoers and worshippers maintained their fervent opposition to euthanasia.

ID DEATH; VERDICTS; CHILDREN; SYSTEM; HEALTH; IMPACT
AB This article examines the role of coroners in making legal determinations of suicide in Australia. Research indicates that the requirement to make findings of intent and capacity in unexpected, violent deaths can be difficult for coroners and recent government inquiries have suggested that the law contributes to the problem. A review of laws and commentary that guide coroners in Australian states and territories reveals not only that coroners are the only persons tasked with making routine legal determinations of suicide, but that such legal guidance lacks clarity. This article concludes that law reform would aid coroners by clarifying definitional issues, removing inconsistency between state jurisdictions and increasing the transparency of case law. Along with requirements for a determination of intent, which is a practical matter previously raised by the Victorian Coronial Council, such changes would go some way to ensuring that Australian suicide statistics are more reliably created.

DE Suicide; plant closure; unemployment
ID JOB LOSS; INTERVENTION; MORTALITY
AB Objective: There have been substantial changes in workforce and employment patterns in Australia over the past 50 years as a result of economic globalisation. This has resulted in substantial reduction in employment in the manufacturing industry often with large-scale job losses in concentrated sectors and communities. Large-scale job loss events receive significant community attention. To what extent these mass unemployment events contribute to increased psychological distress, mental illness and suicide in affected individuals warrants further consideration.
   Methods: Here we undertake a narrative review of published job loss literature. We discuss the impact that large-scale job loss events in the manufacturing sector may have on population mental health, with particular reference to contemporary trends in the Australian economy. We also provide a commentary on the expected outcomes of future job loss events in this context and the implications for Australian public mental health care services.
   Results and conclusion: Job loss due to plant closure results in a doubling of psychological distress that peaks 9 months following the unemployment event. The link between job loss and increased rates of mental illness and suicide is less clear. The threat of impending job loss and the social context in which job loss occurs has a significant bearing on psychological outcomes. The implications for Australian public mental health services are discussed.

TI Differing perspectives on what is important in media reporting of
   suicide
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Editorial Material
ID AUSTRALIA
AB There is a substantial literature which demonstrates that irresponsible reporting of suicide can lead to copycat acts and, as a result, many countries have developed guidelines for media professionals. Some of the recommendations in these guidelines draw directly on the evidence and describe how reporting can be done in a measured fashion that minimises any likely negative influence. Other recommendations relate more to good journalistic practice and are about showing respect for the bereaved in their time of grieving. The study by Chapple et al, in this issue, indicates that there may sometimes be tensions between what media guidelines recommend and what those bereaved by suicide believe is important. We would argue that in such cases common ground can be reached.

   RELATIVE EFFECTIVENESS
AB Objective: This review draws on current knowledge of risk for youth suicide to categorise strategies for intervention. Its goal is to identify areas of 'research need' and to provide an evidence base to identify 'best buy' preventive interventions for youth suicide.
   Method: The design, development, implementation and evaluation of prevention strategies ranging from clinical interventions to population-based universal approaches are considered within five risk factor domains: individual, family, community, school and peer.
   Results: There is a paucity of evidence on the effects of interventions targeting depression and suicidal behaviour. Nevertheless, there are effective indicated, selective and universal interventions for important risk factors for depression and suicidal behaviour. Little evidence has emerged to support the efficacy of some traditional approaches to suicide prevention, such as school based suicide education programs and telephone hotlines.
   Conclusions: Youth suicide prevention strategies in Australia have generally employed traditional approaches that focus on clinical interventions for self-harmers, restricting access to lethal means, providing services to high risk groups and enhancing general practitioner responses. Both program development and research evaluation of interventions for many important risk and protective factors for suicide have been neglected.

AB The relationship between ambient electromagnetic fields and human mood and behaviour is of great public health interest. The relationship between Ap indices of geomagnetic storm activity and national suicide statistics for Australia from 1968 to 2002 was studied. Ap index data was normalised so as to be globally uniform and gave a measure of storm activity for each day. A geomagnetic storm event was defined as a day in which the Ap index was equal to or exceeded 100 nT. Suicide data was a national tally of daily male and female death figures where suicide had been documented as the cause of death. A total of 51845 males and 16 327 females were included. The average number of suicides was greatest in spring for males and females, and lowest in autumn for males and summer for females. Suicide amongst females increased significantly in autumn during concurrent periods of geomagnetic storm activity (P=.01). This pattern was not observed in males (P=.16). This suggests that perturbations in ambient electromagnetic field activity impact behaviour in a clinically meaningful manner. The study furthermore raises issues regarding other sources of stray electromagnetic fields and their effect on mental health.

AB The death of a child by suicide is a severe trauma, placing parents at greater risk of psychological morbidity and physical health problems compared to other causes of death. However, few studies have examined the aftermath and bereavement experience for parents following the death of a child to suicide, limiting the ability to guide effective postvention services through empirical research. The current study, which was part of a larger longitudinal investigation of suicide bereavement in Queensland, Australia, examined the individual experiences of both mothers and fathers bereaved by suicide over time, specifically at the six month and 12 month time points after their loss. Bereaved parents who had provided written consent to be contacted for research purposes were identified through the Queensland Suicide Register, and took part in individual, semi-structured interviews. Generic qualitative analysis identified three key themes: searching for answers and sense-making, coping strategies and support, and finding meaning and purpose. Some participants showed indications of meaning-making and post-traumatic growth at 12 months after the suicide. According to the dual process model of bereavement, it is likely that participants were still oscillating between sense-making and meaning making, indicating that adapting to bereavement is a dynamic and fluctuating process.

ID SUICIDES
AB The files of the Forensic Science Center in Adelaide, South Australia, were examined for all cases listed as suicide in which death had been caused by the use of a sharp instrument during the 20-year period from January 1981 to December 2000. Fifty-one cases were identified, consisting of 35 men and 16 women. The age range was 23 to 83 years (mean 49 years) representing 1.6% of total suicides (51/3182). Fatal injuries included incised wounds to the arms in 51.4% of men (n = 18/35) compared with 87.5% of women (n = 14116), incised and stab wounds to the neck in 40% of men (n = 14/35) and 25% of women (n = 4116), and stab wounds to the chest or abdomen in 28.6% of men (n = 10/35) and 12.5% of women (n = 2/16). In 8 cases, multiple sites were involved. The use of sharp instruments in suicide was favored by older, rather than younger, individuals, with a tendency for women to incise their wrists. Hesitation marks were present in 23 cases (54%) and scarring of the wrists from previous suicide attempts in 5 cases. Although this study demonstrated a higher number of men than women committing suicide by using sharp objects, this method of suicide remains uncommon.

AB Objective: Most people who die by suicide never seek help, particularly members of ethnic minorities. This study compared the prevalence of contacts with mental health services, types of services accessed and factors related to help-seeking behaviors by Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.
   Method: All suicides by Indigenous and non-Indigenous persons from Queensland, Australia, during the period 1994-2007 were analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression models.
   Results: Non-Indigenous suicide cases were almost two times more likely than Indigenous counterparts to have ever received help for mental health problems (43.3% vs. 23.8%). The most common source of help for Indigenous persons was inpatient care, while for non-Indigenous persons, it was general practitioners. Factors increasing the likelihood of service utilization by Indigenous persons were suicide attempt in last year, living in metropolitan area and not being married. Among non-Indigenous persons, these factors were recent communication of suicidal intent or suicide attempt, recent treatment for physical illness and problematic consumption of alcohol.
   Conclusions: Indigenous Australians die by suicide at a rate twice higher than the non-Indigenous population, yet they are significantly less likely to seek professional help for mental health concerns. Help-seeking behavior among Indigenous Australians at risk of suicide should be promoted thorough provision of culturally appropriate services. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Veterinarians are more likely to experience mood disorders and suicide than other occupational groups (Fritschi, Morrison, Shirangi & Day, 2009; Platt, Hawton, Simkin, & Mellanby, 2010). The performance of euthanasia has been implicated as contributing determinately to the prevalence of suicide risk and psychological distress in veterinarians (Bartram & Baldwin, 2008, 2010). In contrast, the application of psychological approaches would suggest a possible protective role for euthanasia administration. This paper is the first to investigate the association between euthanasia-administration frequency and depressed mood and suicide risk. A cross-sectional survey sampled 540 Australia-registered veterinarians (63.8% women), ranging in age from 23 to 74. Results revealed that the administration of objectionable euthanasia (i.e., euthanasia that the veterinarian disagreed with) was not related to our mental health variables. In contrast, overall euthanasia frequency had a weak positive linear relationship with depression. Moreover, overall euthanasia frequency moderated the impact of depression on suicide risk. The nature of this moderation suggested that average frequency per week of performing euthanasia attenuated the relationship between depressed mood and suicide risk. The implications of these findings and directions for further research are discussed.

TI Who uses firearms as a means of suicide? A population study exploring
   firearm accessibility and method choice
SO BMC MEDICINE

   IMPACT; ASSOCIATION; LEGISLATION; PREVENTION
AB Background: The 1996 Australian National Firearms Agreement introduced strict access limitations. However, reports on the effectiveness of the new legislation are conflicting. This study, accessing all cases of suicide 1997-2004, explores factors which may impact on the choice of firearms as a suicide method, including current licence possession and previous history of legal access.
   Methods: Detailed information on all Queensland suicides (1997-2004) was obtained from the Queensland Suicide Register, with additional details of firearm licence history accessed from the Firearm Registry (Queensland Police Service). Cases were compared against licence history and method choice (firearms or other method). Odds ratios (OR) assessed the risk of firearms suicide and suicide by any method against licence history. A logistic regression was undertaken identifying factors significant in those most likely to use firearms in suicide.
   Results: The rate of suicide using firearms in those with a current license (10.92 per 100,000) far exceeded the rate in those with no license history (1.03 per 100,000). Those with a license history had a far higher rate of suicide (30.41 per 100,000) compared to that of all suicides (15.39 per 100,000). Additionally, a history of firearms licence (current or present) was found to more than double the risk of suicide by any means (OR = 2.09, P < 0.001). The group with the highest risk of selecting firearms to suicide were older males from rural locations.
   Conclusion: Accessibility and familiarity with firearms represent critical elements in determining the choice of method. Further licensing restrictions and the implementation of more stringent secure storage requirements are likely to reduce the overall familiarity with firearms in the community and contribute to reductions in rates of suicide.

TI Research Priorities in Suicide Prevention: Review of Australian Research
   from 2010-2017 Highlights Continued Need for Intervention Research
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Review
DE suicide; research; intervention studies
AB Suicide is a major public health concern in Australia and globally, requiring targeted research efforts to build the evidence base for its effective prevention. We examined current and future priorities in Australian suicide prevention research during the period 2010-2017, and compared these to 1999-2006 baseline data. We classified current research priorities in terms of the type of research published in 424 journal articles and 36 grants and fellowships funded during 2010-2017. A questionnaire administered to 390 stakeholders identified future research priorities. The total number of suicide prevention focussed journal articles and the value of funded grants increased dramatically. Congruent with baseline data, current research priorities in 2010-2017 reflected a strong emphasis on epidemiological studies, while funding for intervention studies declined. This is despite the fact that stakeholders continually identified intervention studies as being the highest future research priority. If we are to make real advances in suicide prevention, we need to know what works, and identify and test effective interventions. This study highlighted the existing dearth and continued need for intervention research. Mechanisms to support future intervention research in suicide prevention are likely to lead to significant gains in knowledge and population health.

TI Firearms regulation and declining rates of male suicide in Quebec
SO INJURY PREVENTION
LA English
DT Article
ID YOUTH SUICIDE; BILL C-17; AUSTRALIA; STORAGE; DEATHS; TRENDS; IMPACT
AB Objectives To examine whether significant changes in method-specific male suicide rates occurred in the province of Quebec after stronger firearms regulations were introduced in Canada in 1991; to ascertain whether more stringent firearms regulations influence firearms and total suicide trends among men and to determine whether different results are obtained according to the statistical methods used.
   Study design Descriptive analyses of time trends in method-specific suicide rates for men from 1981 to 2006 using Joinpoint regression models and pre-post firearms regulation analyses.
   Setting Quebec (Canada).
   Patients or Subjects Men who have commited suicide aged 15-34, 35-64 and 65 years and over, based on the Quebec mortality database, 1981-2006.
   Interventions A national firearms control initiative enacted in 1991.
   Results The Joinpoint regression models suggest that firearm suicide rates declined towards the end of the 1990s. Since 1996, the pace of decline was twice as great in men aged 15-34 years (annual percentage change (APC) - 11.1%) compared with men aged 35-64 years (APC - 5.6%). Total suicide rates also declined among men aged 15-34 and 35-64 years during this period. Pre-post firearms regulation Poisson regression analyses failed to detect the specific point in time when significant changes in the trend occurred.
   Conclusions Male firearm suicide rates declined following the introduction of restrictive firearms regulations in Canada. Whether this represents a causal relationship requires further study.

ID GENDER; AGE; ILLNESS; OLD
AB Objective: Asian culture venerates elderly people. It was hypothesized that elderly suicides would be proportionately lower in Asian societies than in English-speaking countries (ESC).
   Method: Elderly (i.e. aged 75 years or more) to general population suicide ratios were compared for six Asian societies and six ESC. based upon the latest 5-year suicide rates.
   Results: Males: The general population suicide rate was highest in rural China (227 per million) and third highest in Japan (217 per million), but other countries with high rates were all ESC (ranging from 224 to 198 per million). Asian countries had the six highest elderly suicide rates, 1327-1373 per million, whilst the highest ESC elderly rate was in the United States (507 per million). Asian societies had the widest range of elderly/general ratios, ranging from 6.62 to 2.6. Females: The overall suicide rates were higher in Asian countries (5795 per million) than in ESC (40-56 per million). Asian elderly suicide rates differed (932 per million in rural China to 154 per million in Korea) but the highest ESC rate was in Australia (76 per million). The Asian countries elderly/general ratios ranged from 5.82 : 1 to 2.70 : 1, but the widest ESC ratio was 1.71 : 1, in the United Kingdom.
   Conclusion: There is a need for country-specific prevention measures in elderly people, and particularly for older women in Asian countries.

AB Background: Russian suicide mortality rates changed rapidly over the second half of the twentieth century. This study attempts to differentiate between underlying period and cohort effects in relation to the changes in suicide mortality in Russia between 1956 and 2005.
   Methods: Sex-and age-specific suicide mortality data were analyzed using an age-period-cohort (APC) approach. Descriptive analyses and APC modeling with log-linear Poisson regression were performed.
   Results: Strong period effects were observed for the years during and after Gorbachev ' s political reforms (including the anti-alcohol campaign) and for those following the break-up of the Soviet Union. After mutual adjustment, the cohort-and period-specific relative risk estimates for suicide revealed differing underlying processes. While the estimated period effects had an overall positive trend, cohort-specific developments indicated a positive trend for the male cohorts born between 1891 and 1931 and for the female cohorts born between 1891 and 1911, but a negative trend for subsequent cohorts.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that the specific life experiences of cohorts may be important for variations in suicide mortality across time, in addition to more immediate effects of changes in the social environment.

ID HEALTH; BEHAVIORS
AB Objectives: This study investigates two approaches to estimate the potential impact of a population-level intervention on Australian suicide, to highlight the importance of selecting appropriate analytic approaches for informing evidence-based strategies for suicide prevention.
   Methods: The potential impact of a psychosocial therapy intervention on the incidence of suicide in Australia over the next 10years was used as a case study to compare the potential impact on suicides averted using: (1) a traditional epidemiological measure of population attributable risk and (2) a dynamic measure of population impact based on a systems science model of suicide that incorporates changes over time.
   Results: Based on the population preventive fraction, findings suggest that the psychosocial therapy intervention if implemented among all eligible individuals in the Australian population would prevent 5.4% of suicides (or 1936 suicides) over the next 10years. In comparison, estimates from the dynamic simulation model which accounts for changes in the effect size of the intervention over time, the time taken for the intervention to have an impact in the population, and likely barriers to the uptake and availability of services suggest that the intervention would avert a lower proportion of suicides (between 0.4% and 0.5%) over the same follow-up period.
   Conclusion: Traditional epidemiological measures used to estimate population health burden have several limitations that are often understated and can lead to unrealistic expectations of the potential impact of evidence-based interventions in real-world settings. This study highlights these limitations and proposes an alternative analytic approach to guide policy and practice decisions to achieve reductions in Australian suicide.

   METAANALYSIS; POPULATION; MILITARY; EXPOSURE; PROGRAM; ENGLAND
AB Background: Availability of lethal means is a significant risk factor for suicide. This study investigated whether occupations with greater access to lethal means had higher suicide rates than those without access, and further, whether this relationship differed for females versus males.
   Methods: A retrospective mortality study was conducted across the Australian population over the period 2001 to 2012. Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which collects Census information on occupation for the Australian population, and the National Coroners Information System, which records information on suicide deaths, were combined. Employed suicide records were coded by occupation and work-related access to lethal means. Descriptive analysis and negative binomial regression were used to assess the relationship between access to means and suicide.
   Results: Persons in occupations with access to firearms, medicines or drugs, and carbon monoxide more frequently used these methods to end their lives than those without access to means. Females employed in occupations with access to means had suicide rates that were 3.02 times greater (95% CI 2.60 to 3.50, p < 0.001) than those employed in occupations without access. Males in occupations with access had suicide rates that were 1.24 times greater than those without access (95% CI 1.16 to 1.33, p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Work-related access to means is a risk factor for suicide in the employed population, but is associated with a greater risk for females than males. The findings of this study suggest the importance of controlling access to lethal methods in occupations where these are readily available.

TI Seasonality of Suicides among Victims Who Are under the Influence of
   Alcohol
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE suicide; seasonality; alcohol dependence
ID EPIDEMIOLOGY; AUSTRALIA; MORTALITY
AB Introduction: Suicide is one of the most frequent causes of death. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), each year, over eight hundred thousand people worldwide die as a result of suicide. The most common risk factors for suicide are depressive disorders and alcohol dependence. Alcohol can directly influence a decision about suicide, or be a factor facilitating this decision. The aim of the study was to analyse the seasonality of suicides among persons under the influence of alcohol. Material and Methods: Data for analysis were obtained from the Department of Forensic Medicine (DFM) of the Medical University of Warsaw. A retrospective analysis was performed on 317 victims of suicides by hanging, those which were entered into the registry of deaths kept by the DFM in the years 2009-2013. The analysis took into account the age and sex of victims, initial cause of death, date of post-mortem examination, autopsy result and alcohol concentration in the blood or muscles of the victims. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20. Results: In the analysis, a spring peak of suicides was found for men, and an autumn peak was revealed for women. In addition, a significant correlation was observed between the age of victims and the concentration of alcohol; the older the victims, the higher the alcohol concentration. However, this correlation was reported only in the spring months. Conclusions: The results of the analysis seem to be consistent with seasonal patterns observed in other studies, and they indicate the occurrence of suicide seasonality. In order to improve the strategies of suicide prevention, it is necessary to identify factors which are related to the seasonal variation of suicidal behaviours, as well as to gain knowledge about the mechanisms behind this phenomenon.

AB A 20-year retrospective study of inhalant deaths in South Australia, autopsied at Forensic Science SA, was undertaken from January 1983 to December 2002. Thirty-nine cases were identified from an autopsy pool of 18,880 cases, with a male to female ratio of 12: 1. Sixty-four percent of the victims (N = 25) died during voluntary inhalation of volatile substances and 28% (N = 11) committed suicide utilizing a volatile substance or gas. The remaining 3 cases involved a workplace accident (N = 1) and 2 cases of autoerotic death where inhalants were being used to augment solitary sexual activity. The mean age of the 28 victims of accidental inhalant death of 21 years (range, 13-45 years) was considerably less than that of the 11 suicide victims of 31.5 years (range, 17-48 years). No homicides were found. Approximately one quarter of the victims were Aboriginal (N = 11), 10 of whom had died as a result of gasoline inhalation ("petrol sniffing"). Other common substances of abuse were aliphatic hydrocarbons such as butane. The study has shown that those most at risk for accidental or suicidal inhalant deaths were young males, with 92% of victims overall being male, and with 77% of victims being under 31 years of age. Gasoline inhalation remains a significant problem in Aboriginal communities in South Australia.

AB This study investigates changes in Australian urban-rural suicide differentials over time in the context of overall declines in (male) suicide in the late 1990s, and determines the extent to which differences in socio-economic status (SES) account for observed urban-rural trends. Suicide data were stratified for the period 1979-2003 by metropolitan, rural and remote areas and examined across five quinquennia, centred on each Australian census from 1981 to 2001. Suicide rates (per 100,000) were adjusted for confounding by sex, age, country-of-birth and the mediating effects of area SES, using Poisson regression models. Male suicide rates in metropolitan, rural and remote areas diverged significantly over time, especially in young males (15-24 years). Young male suicide rates increased significantly in metropolitan, rural and remote areas over 1979-1998, and in the most recent period (1999-2003) increased further in remote areas from 38.8 (per 100,000) to 47.9 (23% increase). In contrast suicide rates in rural areas decreased from a peak of 27.5 to 19.8 (28% decrease), and in metropolitan areas from a peak of 22.1 to 16.8 (24% decrease). Similar divergence in the 1999-2003 quinquennium, though of a lesser magnitude, was also evident for males aged 25-34 years. Female suicide rates in the earlier part of the period were significantly lower in rural and remote areas than in metropolitan areas, particularly for those aged 25-34 years, then increased in rural and remote areas to converge with female suicide rates in metropolitan areas. Adjusting for SES in addition to age and country-of-birth reduced urban-rural suicide differentials in both males and females, consistent with SES being an intermediary between rural residence and suicide. Nevertheless, urban-rural differences remained statistically significant. These results show that the largest urban-rural male suicide differentials for the 25-year study period occurred in the most recent period (1999 2003), in the context of decreasing male suicide rates overall.

AB This paper investigates the relationship between suicide rates and prevalence of mental disorder and suicide attempts, across socio-economic status (SES) groups based on area of residence. Australian suicide data (1996-1998) were analysed in conjunction with area-based prevalences of mental disorder derived from the National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being (1997). Poisson regression models of suicide risk included age, quintile of area-based SES, urban-rural residence, and country of birth (COB), with males and females analysed separately. Analysis focussed on the association between suicide and prevalences of (ICD-10) affective disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders and suicide attempts by SES group. Prevalences of other psychiatric symptomatology, substance use problems, health service utilisation, stressful life-events and personality were also investigated.
   Significant increasing gradients were evident from high to low SES groups for prevalences of affective disorders, anxiety disorders (females only), and substance use disorders (males only); sub-threshold drug and alcohol problems and depression; and suicide attempts and suicide (males only). Prevalences of mental disorder, other sub-threshold mental health items and suicide attempts were significantly associated with suicide, but in most cases associations were reduced in magnitude and became statistically non-significant after adjustment for COB, urban-rural residence, and SES. For male suicide the relative risk (RR) in the lowest SES group compared to the highest was 1.40 (95% CI 1.29-1.52, p < 0.001) for all ages, and 1.46 (95% CI 1.27-1.67, p < 0.001) for male youth (20-34 years). This relationship was not substantially modified in males when regression models included prevalences of affective disorders, and other selected mental health variables and demographic factors.
   From a population perspective, SES remained significantly associated with suicide after controlling for the prevalence of mental disorders and other psychiatric symptomatology. Mental conditions and previous suicidal behaviour may play an intermediary role between SES and suicide, but this study suggests that an independent relationship between suicide and SES also exists.

AB Objectives: We compare the prevalence of suicidal thoughts and attempts between Indigenous and non-Indigenous males in urban and regional Australia, and examine the extent to which any disparity between Indigenous and non-Indigenous males varies across age groups.
   Methods: We used data from the baseline wave of The Australian Longitudinal Study on Male Health (Ten to Men), a large-scale cohort study of Australian males aged 10-55years residing in urban and regional areas. Indigenous identification was determined through participants self-reporting as Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander or both. The survey collected data on suicidal thoughts in the preceding 2weeks and lifetime suicide attempts.
   Results: A total of 432 participants (2.7%) identified as Indigenous and 15,425 as non-Indigenous (97.3%). Indigenous males were twice as likely as non-Indigenous males to report recent suicidal thoughts (17.6% vs 9.4%; odds ratio=2.1, p<0.001) and more than three times as likely to report a suicide attempt in their lifetime (17.0% vs 5.1%; odds ratio=3.6; p<0.001). The prevalence of recent suicidal thoughts did not differ between Indigenous and non-Indigenous males in younger age groups, but a significant gap emerged among men aged 30-39years and was largest among men aged 40-55years. Similarly, the prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts did not differ between Indigenous and non-Indigenous males in the 14- to 17-years age group, but a disparity emerged in the 18- to 24-years age group and was even larger among males aged 25years and older.
   Conclusion: Our paper presents unique data on suicidal thoughts and attempts among a broad age range of Indigenous and non-Indigenous males. The disparity in the prevalence of suicidal thoughts increased across age groups, which is in contrast to the large disparity between the Indigenous and non-Indigenous suicide rates in younger age groups.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to examine trends in suicide among 15-34-year-olds living in Australian metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas between 1988 and 1997.
   Method: Suicide and population data were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. We calculated overall and method-specific suicide rates for 15-24 and 25-34-year-old males and females separately, according to area of residence defined as non-metropolitan (less than or equal to 20 000 people) or metropolitan.
   Results: Between 1988 and 1997 suicide rates in 15-24-year-old non-metropolitan males were consistently 50% higher than metropolitan 15-24-year-olds. In 1995-1997, for example, the rates were: 38.2 versus 25.1 per 100 000 respectively (p < 0.0001). The reverse pattern was seen in 25-34-year-old females with higher rates in metropolitan areas (7.5 per 100 000) compared with non-metropolitan areas (6.1 per 100 000, p = 0.21) in 1995-1997. There were no significant differences according to area of residence in 25-34-year-old males or 15-24-year-old females. Over the years studied we found no clear evidence that suicide rates increased to a greater extent in rural than urban areas. Rates of hanging suicide have approximately doubled in both sexes and age groups in both settings over this time. Despite an approximate halving in firearm suicide, rates remain 3-fold higher among non-metropolitan residents.
   Conclusion: Non-metropolitan males aged 15-24 years have disproportionately higher rates of suicide than their metropolitan counterparts. Reasons for this require further investigation. Hanging is now the most favoured method of non-metropolitan suicide replacing firearms from 10 years ago. Although legislation may reduce method-specific suicide the potential for method-substitution means that overall rates may not fall. More comprehensive interventions are therefore required.

AB Background: Australia introduced the Better Access scheme in late 2006, which resulted in a large increase in the provision of mental health services by general practitioners (GPs), clinical psychologists, other psychologists and allied health professionals. It is unknown whether this increase in services has had an effect on the mental health of the population. Methods: The following data were examined: per capita use of mental health services provided by GPs, clinical psychologists, other psychologists, allied health professionals and psychiatrists from 2006 to 2015 according to the Australian Government Department of Human Services; prevalence of psychological distress in adults (as measured by the K10) from National Health Surveys in 2001, 2004-2005, 2007-2008, 2011-2012 and 2014-2015; and the annual suicide rate from 2001 to 2015 according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Results: The large increase in the use of mental health services after the introduction of the Better Access scheme had no detectable effect on the prevalence of very high psychological distress or the suicide rate. Conclusion: Better Access has not had a detectable effect on the mental health of the Australian population.

AB There are disproportionately higher and inconsistently distributed rates of recorded suicides in rural areas. Patterns of rural suicide are well documented, but they remain poorly understood. Geographic variations in physical and mental health can be understood through the combination of compositional, contextual, and collective factors pertaining to particular places. The aim of this study was to explore the role of place contributing to suicide rates in rural communities. Seventeen mental health professionals participated in semi-structured in-depth interviews. Principles of grounded theory were used to guide the analysis. Compositional themes were demographics and perceived mental health issues; contextual themes were physical environment, employment, housing, and mental health services; and collective themes were town identity, community values, social cohesion, perceptions of safety, and attitudes to mental illness. It is proposed that connectedness may be the underlying mechanism by which compositional, contextual, and collective factors influence mental health and well-being in rural communities.

Subthemes included gatekeeping the medication supply, sole disclosure, planning for end of life, concerns of support people, assessing the validity of suicidality, gaps in the system, not directly asking, ill-equipped, resources in the pharmacy, relying on others to continue care, and attention seeking.ConclusionsCommunity pharmacists are caring for patients at risk of suicide frequently, and often with patients seeking the help of pharmacists directly. Pharmacists engage in activities and actions that would be considered outside of the traditional dispensing roles and provide support and intervention to people at risk of suicide through collaboration and other mechanisms. Further research to determine appropriate education and training and postvention supports is required.

AB A number of differences exist between the seasonality of suicide and suicidal behaviour. Case fatality is one index of the relationship between these phenomena. The purpose of this study was to use contemporaneous data to examine the impact of case fatality on the seasonality of suicidal behaviour. All deliberate self-harm (ICD9 E950-58) hospitalisations (DSH) and deaths (suicide) for 1984-93 were extracted from the Western Australia case register (N=22 883). Case fatality was calculated by method of suicide. Data were arranged in time series by standardised month according to case fatality; sex and age and analysed using spectral analysis. We found that DSH involving low case fatal methods is seasonal with a spring peak (95% confidence interval). The explained variance of the seasonal rhythm increases with age. Suicide involving high case fatal methods is not seasonal. The increase in DSH seasonality with age may be related to a parallel increase in case fatality.

AB Analysis of autopsy cases of suicide from Forensic Science South Australia files (2003-2017) where helium, nitrogen or nitrous oxide gas had been used revealed that only 2/58 (3.5%) cases utilised nitrous oxide; the remainder of cases had used helium or nitrogen. The two cases are presented here. In case 1, a 48-year-old man was found completely encased in a plastic bag with a hose connected to an opened cylinder of nitrous oxide. In case 2, a 27-year-old woman was found with a plastic bag over her head, tied around her neck, with a tube connected to a small canister of nitrous oxide. There were approximately 20 empty canisters of nitrous oxide nearby. Death in both cases was due to nitrous oxide augmentation of plastic bag asphyxia, manner suicide. The relative ease with which helium and nitrogen cylinders containing large amounts of gas can be obtained may explain the low numbers of suicides utilising nitrous oxide.

AB Background Suicide is one of the leading causes of premature mortality worldwide. Few studies have assessed long-term trends or sex differences in its incidence over time. We have investigated the age-, sex- and method-specific trends in suicide in England and Wales from 1861 to 2007.
   Methods Overall age-standardized suicide rates using the European Standard Population and age-, sex- and method-specific rates were calculated for ages epsilon 15 years from 1861 to 2007.
   Results Rates in males were consistently higher than females throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, although the male-to-female sex ratio fluctuated from 4 : 1 in the 1880s to 1.5 : 1 in the 1960s. Suicide rates increased in all age groups in the 1930s, coinciding with the Great Depression. The highest male rates (30.3 per 100 000) were recorded in 1905 and 1934 and have since been declining. Female rates peaked in the 1960s (11.8 per 100 000), declining afterwards. In both sexes the lowest recorded rates were in the 21st century. There was a rapid rise in the use of domestic gas as a method of suicide in both sexes following its introduction at the end of the 19th century. There was no evidence that this rise was accompanied by a decline in the use of other methods. Self-poisoning also increased in popularity from the 1860s (5% of suicides) to the 1990s (22% of suicides).
   Conclusions The epidemiology of suicide in England and Wales has changed markedly over the past 146 years. The rapid rise in gas suicide deaths in the 1920s highlights how quickly a new method of suicide can be established in a population when it is easily available. The increase in suicides during the Great Depression has implications in relation to the current economic crisis. Changes in the acceptability and lethality of various suicide methods may account for the large variations in sex ratios over time.

AB The effects of antidepressants on suicide are controversial; on the one hand they decrease the incidence of death by suicide, as reflected in epidemiological studies, and on the other hand, there are claims that they increase the risk of impulsivity and suicide. In 1998, primary care physicians in Israel were not allowed to prescribe selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and in 1999 this prohibition was lifted. We thus evaluated the association between patterns of antidepressant prescribing and the rate of death by suicide in Israel in 1998 compared with that in 2002. Data regarding deaths by suicide were obtained from the Central Bureau of Statistics. Annual rates of antidepressant prescribing were computed from the Intercontinental Marketing Services database. The Intercontinental Marketing Services data covers three out of the four Health Maintenance Organizations in Israel, encompassing 46% of all citizens. Prescribing of all antidepressants increased 2.6-fold between 1998 and 2002. This increase was significantly more pronounced for the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. A shift in prescription practices was noted, with a 1.37-fold increase in prescribing by primary care physicians. While the concomitant decrease in overall national rates of completed suicide did not reach significance (17-14 per 100000), the incidence decreased significantly in men aged 55-74 years (33-22 per 100 000; P=0.029). An overall reduction in suicides, which was significant only in elderly men, was noted in association with increased rates of antidepressant prescription. This study is limited in scope but adds a unique viewpoint related to the possible positive effect of increased antidepressant prescribing in primary care on suicide.

AB Introduction and Aims. The study aimed to determine the histories of self-harm and attempted suicide among therapeutic community entrants by primary presenting substance problem, and to determine predictors of these behaviours. Design and Methods. One hundred and eighty-eight consecutive new treatment admissions to We Help Ourselves drug-free treatment services were administered a structured interview. Results. Lifetime histories of self-harm were reported by 34% (9% within the preceding year), and 20% had done so on multiple occasions. Just over one-third reported a lifetime history of attempted suicide (15% within the preceding year), and 17% reported multiple attempts. There were no significant bivariate associations between primary drug and either behaviour. Multivariate analyses indicated that the alcohol and opioid groups were significantly more likely than the cannabis group to have a history of self-harm, but did not differ from each other or the psychostimulant group. Other independent correlates of self-harm were female gender, lifetime PTSD diagnosis, younger age at first intoxication and a history of attempted suicide. In multivariate analyses, the alcohol and opioid groups were significantly less likely than the cannabis group to have a history of attempted suicide, but did not differ from each other or the psychostimulant group. Other significant correlates of attempted suicide were female gender and a history of self-harm. Discussion and Conclusions. Both self-harm and suicide attempts were highly prevalent, and strongly associated with each other. Moreover, there were few differences between primary drug problems. All entrants should be screened for these behaviours, and appropriate responses implemented.[Darke S, Campbell G, Popple G. Self-harm and attempted suicide among therapeutic community admissions.

AB Background: The impact of suicide of adolescents is devastating, yet little is known about the distressing impact for teachers. The aim of this study therefore is to explore the impact student suicide on teachers personal and professional lives.
   Methods: A cross-sectional anonymous online survey of primary and secondary school teachers was conducted in Australia. The Impact of Event Scale Revised, questions about personal and professional impact, help seeking, perceived needs and experiences after student's suicide were included in the analysis.
   Results: In total, 229 teachers commenced the questionnaire, with 138 (60.3%) completing the full questionnaire. Questions about exposure to students' suicide were completed by 145 teachers (63.3%). In total, 35.9% (n=52) were exposed to at least the suicide of one student (two or more: 54.8%). The most recent suicide of a student had (some or great) impact on the personal life of 76% of teachers and on the professional life of 85.7%. Impact on personal life was significantly higher for female teachers. The most frequent source for help seeking was family or partner (65.3%); use of professional help was also reported, with the school counsellor being the most frequent (30.6%). Following the most recent suicide of a student, 27.1% of teacher; exposed to suicide felt that they needed more support.
   Limitations: The potential for selection bias through the use of an online survey, and the relatively small sample.
   Conclusion: The study showed high levels of distress among teachers after exposure to a student's suicide an greater need for help than that obtained.

AB Aims: To determine the lifetime and recent histories of attempted suicide among entrants to treatment for heroin dependence in three treatment modalities and a non-treatment comparison group; and to ascertain factors associated with a recent history of attempted suicide. Design: Cross-sectional structured interview. Setting: Sydney, Australia. Participants: Six hundred and fifteen current heroin users: 201 entering methadone/buprenorphine maintenance (MT), 201 entering detoxification (DTX), 133 entering drug free residential rehabilitation (RR) and 80 not in treatment (NT). Findings: A lifetime history of attempted suicide was reported by 34% of subjects, 13% had attempted suicide in the preceding year and 5% had done so in the preceding month. Females were more likely to have lifetime (44% versus 28%) and 12 month (21% versus 9%) suicide attempt histories. The 12 month prevalence of attempted suicide among treatment groups ranged between 11% (MT, NT) and 17% (RR). Factors associated with recent suicide attempts were: being an RR entrant, female gender, younger age, less education, more extensive polydrug use, benzodiazepine use, recent heroin overdose, Major Depression, current suicidal ideation, Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Conclusions: Recent suicidal behaviour is a major clinical problem for heroin users, and for females and RR entrants in particular. An essential adjunct to treatment for heroin dependence is routine screening for depression and suicidal ideation, with the provision of appropriate treatment where needed.

AB This study compares the frequencies of attempted suicide among immigrants and their hosts, between different immigrant groups, and between immigrants and their countries of origin.
   The material, 27,048 persons, including 4,160 immigrants, was obtained from the WHO/EURO Multicentre Study on Suicidal Behaviour, the largest available European database, and was collected in a standardised manner from 11 European centres in 1989-2003. Person-based suicide-attempt rates (SARs) were calculated for each group. The larger immigrant groups were studied at each centre and compared across centres. Completed-suicide rates of their countries of origin were compared to the SARs of the immigrant groups using rank correlations.
   27 of 56 immigrant groups studied showed significantly higher, and only four groups significantly lower SARs than their hosts. Immigrant groups tended to have similar rates across different centres. Moreover, positive correlation between the immigrant SAR and the country-of-origin suicide rate was found. However, Chileans, Iranians, Moroccans, and Turks displayed high SARs as immigrants despite low suicide rates in the home countries.
   The similarity of most immigrant groups' SARs across centres, and the correlation with suicidality in the countries of origin suggest a strong continuity that can be interpreted in either cultural or genetic terms. However, the generally higher rates among immigrants compared to host populations and the similarity of the rates of foreign-born and those immigrants who retained the citizenship of their country of origin point to difficulties in the acculturation and integration process. The positive correlation found between attempted and completed suicide rates suggests that the two are related, a fact with strong implications for suicide prevention.

AB We investigated the correlation of belonging to an ethnic cultural minority and nonfatal suicidal acts (suicide attempts), suicidal ideation, and self-injurious behavior in a group of 494 psychiatric inpatients at the time of admission. The frequency of nonfatal suicidal acts was 15.3% in the group of immigrants (n = 111) and 8.9% in the group of German patients. This difference is significant, but the impact of belonging to the immigration group covaries with the impact of female gender and young age (below 45 years). If all three factors come together the risk of suicide attempts increases threefold. In the immigrant group alone, nonfatal suicidal acts were correlated with "transcultural conflicts". In the group of suicide attempters,we tried to assess the risk of suicide with the help of the 'suicide risk list" (Poldinger) and the suicidal intention with the help of the "suicide intention scale" (Pierce). Additionally, we investigated the method of suicide attempts and categorized them into two groups: "hard" and "weak" methods. We did not find any significant difference between immigrants and German patients concerning suicide risk, suicide intention,and choice of the method. Although there are some methodological shortcomings, we interpret our findings as an indication that immigrant inpatients are more involved in managing the additional stress which results from their immigration. Perhaps nonfatal suicidal behavior represents a risky, but insufficient attempt at "solving" transcultural problems in the immigrant group.

AB This population-based study aims to investigate socio-economic factors, depression and psychosis as independent risk factors for a suicide attempt that requires hospitalization, and estimate the incidence of suicide attempts.
   Individual-level administrative data were analysed that were collected for all members of the Socialist Health Insurance Schemes in Belgium during the period 2011-2013 (N = 3,156,030) in the context of the financing of the health care services provided. Bivariate and multivariate odds ratios were calculated for multiple socio-economic factors, socio-demographic factors and the presence of depression and psychosis.
   During the study period, 4063 persons were hospitalized due to a suicide attempt. The incidence of suicide attempts with hospital admittance was 48.0/100,000 persons/year. Being unemployed, incapable of work over a shorter or longer period with substitute income, living on social welfare, having an increased healthcare reimbursement, living alone and using antidepressants or antipsychotics were identified as independent factors that contributed to the risk of hospitalization due to a suicide attempt.
   Persons from low income groups, however defined, those living alone, or persons using antidepressants or antipsychotics are at an increased risk of attempting suicide and needing hospitalization for it. A social policy that focuses on the improvement of these factors or their consequences may be expected to have a favourable effect on the number of suicide attempts. Funding of mental health care should also better match population needs.

ID FOLLOW-UP; MORTALITY; DEATHS; USERS; INMATES
AB Objective: To determine the risk of suicide and drug overdose death among recently released prisoners.
   Design, setting and participants: Retrospective cohort study of 85 203 adult offenders who had spent some time in full-time custody in prisons in New South Wales between I January 1988 and 31 December 2002.
   Main outcome measures: Association between time after release and risk of suicide and overdose death.
   Results: Of 844 suicides (795 men, 49 women), 724 (86%) occurred after release. Men had a higher rate of suicide than women both in prison (129 v 56 per 100000 person-years) and after release (135 v 82 per 1 00 000 person-years). The suicide rate in men in the 2 weeks after release was 3.87 (95% Cl, 2.26-6.65) times higher than the rate after 6 months. Male prisoners admitted to the prison psychiatric hospital had a threefold higher risk than non-admitted men both in prison and after release. No suicides among women were observed in the 2 weeks after release. No increased risk of suicide was observed among Aboriginal Australians in the first 2 weeks after release. Of 1674 deaths due to overdose, 1627 (97%) occurred after release. Drug-related mortality in men was 9.30 (95% Cl, 7.80-11.10) times higher, and in women was 6.42 (95% Cl, 3.88-10.62) times higher, in the 2 weeks after release than after 6 months.
   Conclusions: Prisoners are at a heightened risk of suicide and overdose death in the immediate post-release period. After 6 months post-release, the suicide rate approaches the rate observed in custody.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: It is estimated that every year 1 million people die all around the world due to suicide. The average rate of suicide in the world is reported as 16/100 000. In this study, we aimed to evaluate and discuss the suicide cases in our city Eskisehir that is located in western Anatolia.
   DESIGN AND SETTINGS: This is a retrospective study covering the period 1997-2011.
   METHODS: All deaths in Eskisehir caused due to the consumption of forensic medicines in a 15-year period between 1997 and 2011 were evaluated retrospectively. A total of 553 cases were determined to be suicidal following both forensic and criminal investigations, and were included in the study. Furthermore, death examination and autopsy reports were investigated, and judicial investigation records were also taken into account.
   RESULTS: In this period, the average rate of suicide in our city was determined as 5.1/100 000 of which 71.4% of the cases were male. It was determined that the suicides most commonly occurred between the ages of 19 and 29 (32.4%, n=179). The most commonly encountered suicide method was hanging (60.9%, n=337).
   CONCLUSION: It was ascertained that the suicide rate in our city was lower than the average rate in the world, but it was higher than the average rate in Turkey. Unemployment was determined as the most common risk factor in our study. A follow-up should be provided for people with a history of attempting to commit suicide or with a tendency to committing suicide due to a psychological disorder.

AB Background. The objectives were to assess thoughts about suicide, plans to commit suicide and suicide attempts in the community, to investigate the use of health services following a suicide attempt, and to describe basic socio-cultural indices of the community.
   Method. The community survey was one component of the larger WHO multisite intervention study on suicidal behaviours (SUPRE-MISS). In each site, it aimed at randomly selecting and interviewing at least 500 subjects of the general population living in the catchment area of the emergency department where the intervention component of the study was conducted. Communities of eight SUPRE-MISS sites (in Brazil, China, Estonia, India, Iran, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam) participated plus two additional sites from Australia and Sweden conducting similar surveys.
   Results. Suicide attempts (0(.)4-4(.)2%), plans (1(.)1-15(.)6%), and ideation (2(.)6-25(.)4%) varied by a factor of 10-14 across sites, but remained mostly within the ranges of previously published data. Depending on the site, the ratios between attempts, plans, and thoughts Of Suicide differed substantially. Medical attention following a suicide attempt varied between 22% and 88% of the attempts.
   Conclusions. The idea of the suicidal process as a continuous and smooth evolution from thoughts to plans and attempts of suicide needs to be further investigated as it seems to be dependent on the cultural setting. There are indications, that the burden of undetected attempted suicide is high in different cultures; an improved response from the health sector on how to identify and support these individuals is needed.

AB ObjectiveTo investigate differences in suicide risk among immigrant population in Norway compared with native Norwegians, with respect to associated country group of origin.
   MethodsBased on the entire national population, a nested case-control design was adopted using Norwegian national longitudinal registers to obtain 23073 suicide cases having occurred in 1969-2012 and 373178 controls. Odds ratios (ORs) for suicide were estimated using conditional logistic regression analysis adjusting for socio-economic factors.
   ResultsCompared with native Norwegians, suicide risk was significantly lower in first- and second-generation immigrants but higher in Norwegian-born with one foreign-born parent and foreign-born individuals with at least one Norwegian-born parent. When stratifying data by country group of origin, first-generation immigrants had lower ORs in most of the strata. Subjects born in Asia and in Central and South America with at least one Norwegian-born parent had a significantly higher risk of suicide. The observed results remained mostly unchanged in the analyses controlled for socio-economic status.
   ConclusionsSuicide risk is lower in first- and second-generation immigrants but higher in subjects born in Norway with one foreign-born parent and those born abroad with at least one Norwegian-born parent, with notable differences by country group of origin.

AB Objective: To investigate relationships between self-reported sexual abuse, depression, hopelessness, and suicidality in a community sample of adolescents. Method: In 1995, students (mean age 13 years) from 27 high schools in Australia (n = 2,603) completed a questionnaire including measures of depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale), hopelessness, sexual abuse, and suicidality. Data analysis included logistic regression. Results: Sexual abuse is associated with suicidality, both directly and indirectly through hopelessness and depressive symptoms in the model developed. High suicide risk (behavior exceeding thoughts such as plans and threats, or deliberate self-injury) is strongly correlated with suicide attempts (odds ratio 28.8, 95% Cl 16-52, p < .001). Hopelessness is associated with high suicide risk only, whereas depressive symptoms are associated with high suicide risk and attempts. Hopelessness is more strongly associated with sexual abuse in boys than girls. Depressive symptoms are more strongly associated with high suicide risk in girls than boys. Controlling for other variables, sexual abuse is independently associated with suicide attempts in girls but not boys. Conclusions: Clinical assessment should consider gender differences in relationships between sexual abuse, depressive symptoms, hopelessness, and suicidality. Sexually abused girls may be at increased risk of attempting suicide, independent of other psychopathology.

AB Background: Postvention services aim to ameliorate distress and reduce future incidences of suicide. The StandBy Response Service is one such service operating in Australia for those bereaved through suicide. Few previous studies have reported estimates or evaluations of the economic impact and outcomes associated with the implementation of bereavement/grief interventions. Aims: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of a postvention service from a societal perspective. Method: A Markov model was constructed to estimate the health outcomes, quality-adjusted life years, and associated costs such as medical costs and time off work. Data were obtained from a prospective cross-sectional study comparing previous clients of the StandBy service with a control group of people bereaved by suicide who had not had contact with StandBy. Costs and outcomes were measured at 1 year after suicide bereavement and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated. Results: The base case found that the StandBy service dominated usual care with a cost saving from providing the StandBy service of AUS $803 and an increase in quality-adjusted life years of 0.02. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicates there is an 81% chance the service would be cost-effective given a range of possible scenarios. Conclusion: Postvention services are a cost-effective strategy and may even be cost-saving if all costs to society from suicide are taken into account.

AB OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to highlight the differences in injury rates between populations through a descriptive epidemiological study of population-level trends in injury mortality for the high-income countries of Australia, Canada and the United States.
   METHODS: Mortality data were available for the US from 2000 to 2014, and for Canada and Australia from 2000 to 2012. Injury causes were defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision external cause codes, and were grouped into major causes. Rates were direct-method age-adjusted using the US 2000 projected population as the standard age distribution.
   RESULTS: US motor vehicle injury mortality rates declined from 2000 to 2014 but remained markedly higher than those of Australia or Canada. In all three countries, fall injury mortality rates increased from 2000 to 2014. US homicide mortality rates declined, but remained higher than those of Australia and Canada. While the US had the lowest suicide rate in 2000, it increased by 24% during 2000-2014, and by 2012 was about 14% higher than that in Australia and Canada. The poisoning mortality rate in the US increased dramatically from 2000 to 2014.
   CONCLUSION: Results show marked differences and striking similarities in injury mortality between the countries and within countries over time. The observed trends differed by injury cause category. The substantial differences in injury rates between similarly resourced populations raises important questions about the role of societal-level factors as underlying causes of the differential distribution of injury in our communities.

   DISORDERS; AUSTRALIAN ADULTS; IDEATION; CONTINUUM; RISK
AB Background: Delusional-like experiences (DLEs) are common in the general population. Whilst it is well known that psychotic disorders increase the risk of suicide, it is unclear if DLEs are also associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviour. This study aims to explore these variables in a large population-based sample.
   Method: Participants were drawn from a national survey of mental health (n = 8841) in Australia. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to identify DLEs, psychiatric disorders, and information related to suicidal ideation, suicide plan and suicide attempts. We examined the relationship between DLEs and suicidal ideation, plans and attempts using logistic regression, adjusted for a range of potentially confounding variables.
   Results: 8.4% of subjects endorsed one or more DLEs. 12.9% subjects reported suicidal ideation, 3.8% suicidal plans, and 3.0% a suicide attempt at some point in their lives. Those with any DLE were about two to four times as likely to report suicidal ideation, plans or attempts. There was a dose response relationship between DLEs and endorsement of suicide-related items.
   Conclusions: DLEs are common in the general population and appear to be independently associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviour. DLE may provide a marker of vulnerability to suicide, and thus could be of value in future suicide prevention research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID INTERVENTION; DISORDER; BEHAVIOR
AB The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Kaohsiung Suicide Prevention Center (KSPC) of Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, during the period from June 2005 to June 2008. We used a modified CIPP evaluation model to evaluate the suicide prevention program in Kaohsiung. Four evaluation models were applied to evaluate the KSPC: a context evaluation of the background and origin of the center, an input evaluation of the resources of the center, a process evaluation of the activities of the suicide prevention project, and a product evaluation of the ascertainment of project objectives. The context evaluation revealed that the task of the KSPC is to lower mortality. The input evaluation assessed the efficiency of manpower and the grants supported by Taiwan's Department of Health and Kaohsiung City government's Bureau of Health. In the process evaluation, we inspected the suicide prevention strategies of the KSPC, which are a modified version of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy of Australia. In the product evaluation, four major objectives were evaluated: (1) the suicide rate in Kaohsiung, (2) the reported suicidal cases, (3) crisis line calls, and (4) telephone counseling. From 2005 to 2008, the number of telephone counseling sessions (1,432, 2,010, 7,051, 12,517) and crisis line calls (0, 4,320, 10,339, 14,502) increased. Because of the increase in reported suicidal cases (1,328, 2,625, 2,795, and 2,989, respectively), cases which were underreported in the past, we have increasingly been able to contact the people who need help. During this same time period, the half-year suicide re-attempt rate decreased significantly for those who received services, and the committed suicide rate (21.4, 20.1, 18.2, and 17.8 per 100,000 populations, respectively) also decreased. The suicide prevention program in Kaohsiung is worth implementing on a continual basis if financial constraints are addressed.

AB Objectives: Suicide rates have widely been reported to peak in spring and summer. A frequent hypothesis is that increased sunlight exposure alters biological mechanisms. However, few attempts have been made to systematically untangle the putative suicidogenic risk of sunlight exposure from that of seasonality. We examined whether average hours of daily sunlight in a month confer additional risk over month of year when predicting monthly suicide rates.
   Design: Historical population-based ecological longitudinal study.
   Setting and participants: We used 3 longitudinal studies (n=31 060 suicides) with monthly suicide and meteorological data from Greece (1992-2001), Victoria, Australia (1990-1998) and Norway (1969-2009).
   Intervention: We used a negative binomial regression to observe (1) the association of month of year with suicides, adjusting for different sunlight exposures, and (2) the association of sunlight exposure with suicides, adjusting for month of year. We then investigated claims that suicides were associated with daily sunlight exposures, defined by us as 2550 sunlight exposure combinations corresponding to a 1-50 days exposure window with lags of 0-50 days.
   Results: Using monthly data, the association between month of year and suicides remained after adjusting for mean daily hours of sunlight and change in the mean daily hours of sunlight. Adjusted for month of year, the associations between sunlight exposure and suicides became non-significant and attenuated towards the null (the coefficient estimate for mean daily hours of sunlight decreased in absolute magnitude by 72%). The findings were consistent across all 3 cohorts, both when analysed separately and combined. When investigating daily sunlight exposures, we found no significant results after correcting for multiple testing.
   Conclusions: Using monthly data, the robustness of our month of year effects, combined with the transient and modest nature of our sunlight effects, suggested that the association between sunlight exposure and suicide was a proxy for the association between seasonality and suicide.

AB The reason why some persons seek help following a suicide attempt while others do not is still insufficiently clarified. Using data from the World Health Organization/SUicide PREvention-Multisite Intervention Study on Suicidal Behavior community survey, this study tried to shed more light on this problem by investigating the type and number of treatments sought by suicide attempters in 2 major cities of Queensland, Australia. Compared with those who did not attend services (n = 142), help-seekers (n = 257) had significantly greater odds of overdosing with medications and communicating suicidal thoughts. They also had greater odds of reporting a history of psychological problems, previous attempts, and help-seeking behavior. Those who sought multiple services were more likely to be female and suffer also from physical illness. Non help-seekers were more frequently males, with no history of having previously sought help or communicated intent. They also appeared at greater risk of using more lethal methods (hanging) and less likely to express mental health concerns at the time of the attempt. These findings underline the need to further understand the relationship between lethality, suicide intent, and help-seeking behavior. Improving motivation to seek treatment after a suicide attempt could substantially impact on suicide prevention success efforts.

AB Pathology files at Forensic Science South Australia were examined over a 14-year period, from January 1997 to March 2011 for cases of physician suicide. Nine cases were identified (ages, 3069 years; median = 41 years; M:F = 3:1). Three cases (33.3%) had a history of prescription drug abuse, and eight cases (88.9%) died from lethal drug self-administration. Intravenous administration of drugs was the favored method in seven cases. In only one case was an alternative method used, involving jumping from a high building. A history of depression and/or suicidal ideation was noted in six cases (66.7%). The methods of self-destruction contrasted with the general population where hanging, carbon monoxide poisoning, and gunshot wounds are more common. Availability and knowledge of lethal effects have been shown to be important determinants in the choice of methods of suicide. Access to drugs should therefore be carefully monitored in physicians with histories of depression and/or substance abuse.

AB Objective To examine the mortality experience of psychiatric patients in Western Australia compared with the general population.
   Design Population based study.
   Setting Western Australia, 1985-2005.
   Participants Psychiatric patients (292 585) registered with mental health services in Western Australia.
   Main outcome measures Trends in life expectancy for psychiatric patients compared with the Western Australian population and causes of excess mortality, including physical health conditions and unnatural causes of death.
   Results When using active prevalence of disorder (contact with services in previous five years), the life expectancy gap increased from 13.5 to 15.9 years for males and from 10.4 to 12.0 years for females between 1985 and 2005. Additionally, 77.7% of excess deaths were attributed to physical health conditions, including cardiovascular disease (29.9%) and cancer (13.5%). Suicide was the cause of 13.9% of excess deaths.
   Conclusions Despite knowledge about excess mortality in people with mental illness, the gap in their life expectancy compared with the general population has widened since 1985. With most excess deaths being due to physical health conditions, public efforts should be directed towards improving physical health to reduce mortality in people with mental illness, in addition to ongoing efforts to prevent suicide.

ID CHILDREN
AB A retrospective study of cases of drowning suicide was undertaken at the Forensic Science Centre in Adelaide, South Australia for the period April 1980 to March 2000. A total of 123 cases were found, with 76 males (age, 16-88 years; average, 50.5 years; standard deviation [SD], 20.1 years) and 47 females (age, 34-88 years; average, 60.6 years; SD, 13.9 years). There were 66 fresh water drownings and 57 saltwater drownings. Female victims were significantly older than male victims for both fresh water and saltwater drownings (P < .05 and P < .01, respectively). Deaths in young women were rare. No temporal trend in drowning suicides could be shown, with annual numbers varying from 0 to 12 cases (average, 6.15; median, 7). Women preferentially chose the ocean or bath to drown themselves in, whereas males chose rivers, ditches, and lakes. Swimming pools were rarely used for suicide in this population; alcohol use was not usual; and there was often a significant history of mental illness.

AB Objective: The aims were first, to describe deaths in a cohort of homeless people compared to the general population and secondly, to compare deaths among the individuals with schizophrenia to those without schizophrenia.
   Method: Mortality was assessed in a cohort of 708 homeless subjects, 506 with schizophrenia who were referred 10 years previously to psychiatric outreach clinics. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated.
   Results: Eighty-three people (12%) had died, 19 from suicide. The SMR was 3.76 for homeless men and 3.14 for homeless women. There was a non-significant trend for higher excess mortality among men without schizophrenia compared to men with schizophrenia. SMRs for suicide were significantly elevated among homeless men.
   Conclusion: Homeless people in inner Sydney have death rates three to four times higher than people in the general population of New South Wales. Excess mortality was greatest for younger age groups.

AB Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a population-based strategy designed to raise awareness in the community, in all regions of Queensland, Australia, about the nature and extent of suicide by older men and to provide preventive strategies.
   Method: Trained presenters conducted information and skills training sessions in all Queensland regions in 2001 - 2002. The evaluation included a questionnaire and post-session evaluation form which participants were invited to complete. Approximately 6 months following attendance at a session, a sub-set of participants were further surveyed by postal questionnaire.
   Results: Approximately 3016 persons attended an information session and participants' responses revealed that a large proportion had either been personally bereaved by suicide (20%) or knew someone who had been so bereaved (58%). Evaluation immediately following the session found that the majority of respondents considered that the session had been useful (88%) and most (90%) reported that the session had enhanced their understanding of risk factors for suicide by older men.
   Conclusion: The information kit and presentations developed for use in the project appear to be useful tools for presenting sensitive material and encouraging people to discuss suicide. The use of existing community resources ensured that the project was highly cost-effective and sustainable.

DT Article
ID BEHAVIOR; DEATHS
AB This study aimed to examine associations between health status and care needs of nursing home residents and risk of death from suicide compared to other causes through a retrospective data linkage cohort study examining nursing home resident deaths in Australia between 2000 and 2013. Data linkage was performed between aged care assessment tools-Resident Classification System and Aged Care Funding Instrument-and the National Coronial Information System. A competing risks survival analysis was performed to determine the association between care assessment variables (activities of daily living (ADL), behavior, and complex health care) and the risk of death from suicide and any other cause. Of the 146 nursing home residents who died from suicide, 130 (89%) were matched to their assessment data, with comparable information available for 95 residents (65%). Residents who required high levels of care with ADL, physical health care, and cognitive and behavioral issues had a higher risk of dying from all other causes, yet lower risk of dying from suicide. The study findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of linking these two data sets; highlight a need for improved data collection processes; and support a person-centered care approach for prevention of suicide among nursing home residents.

AB An advance care directive (ACD) is a written expression of a person's preferences in relation to health care, which can appoint a trusted substitute decision-maker, describe personal values, and make explicit decisions consenting to, or refusing, certain treatments. When a person with a directive refusing life-sustaining treatments attempts suicide, opinions are divided as to the degree to which health care staff are bound by such a directive. In this section, I will provide an example of a patient who presents to hospital after attempting suicide who has a valid ACD refusing life-sustaining treatment. I will then describe the legislation relevant to ACDs in Victoria, Australia and ethical arguments relating to the application of an ACD in this context. I will present a decision-making algorithm for health care staff faced with the difficult decisions arising from such a presentation.

AB A study was undertaken to investigate the range and nature of deaths that may result from explosions in a civilian population that has not been exposed to terrorist attacks or significant military activities. A search was conducted of autopsy files at Forensic Science SA, Adelaide, Australia, from July 2000 to June 2017 for all cases where death had been attributed to an explosion. Twenty cases were identified, consisting of 10 accidents, five suicides, two homicides, one murder-suicide with two decedents and one case where the manner of death was undetermined. Explosives were involved in nine deaths, petrol in seven and propane/butane/natural gas in a further four. Deaths caused by explosions were a rare event, with most cases being caused by accidents in a domestic or industrial environment. Although suicides formed the next most-common group, it is possible that explosions caused by petrol in cases of self-immolation were not intended.

AB Farmers have been found to be at increased risk of suicide in Australia. The Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicidal Behaviour suggests that the proximal factors leading to the suicidal desire or ideation include an individual's experiences of both perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. Suicidal desire with acquired capability to engage in lethal self-injury is predictive of suicidal behaviour. This study investigates the pathways to suicide of 18 Australian male farmers in order to understand the suicidal process and antecedents to suicide in Australian male farmers. The psychological autopsy (PA) method was used to generate life charts. Two pathways with distinct suicidal processes were identified: acute situational (romantic relationship problems and financial concerns/pending retirement) and protracted (long-term psychiatric disorder). Long working hours, interpersonal conflicts, physical illnesses and pain, alcohol abuse, access to firearms, and exposure to drought were additional common factors identified. An understanding of the interrelatedness of diverse distal and proximal risk factors on suicidal pathways in the wider environmental context for male farmers is required when developing and implementing rural suicide prevention activities.

AB Objectives: This research sought to investigate the influence of being a in male-dominated occupation on suicide. Methods: A population-level retrospective mortality study was conducted over the period 2001 to 2015. Data from the Australian Census and the National Coronial Information System were combined. Negative binomial regression was used to assess the relationship between occupational gender ratio and suicide rates, controlling for age, socioeconomic status and year of death. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis accounted for unmeasured confounding due to common mental disorders. Results: Males in male-dominated occupations had a rate ratio (RR) of 7.50 (95%CI 6.07 to 9.25) compared to males in female-dominated occupations. Females in male-dominated occupations had a RR of 0.13 (95%CI 0.07 to 0.26) compared to females in female-dominated occupations. Results for males were maintained after adjusting for common mental disorders. There was evidence of interaction on both additive and multiplicative scales. Conclusions: The gendered context of an occupation influences suicide, with varying risks for women and men. More research is needed to understand the mechanisms of this relationship. Implications for public health: These results suggest the need for targeted suicide prevention activities in male-dominated occupational groups.

AB Homicide followed by suicide (H-S) is a lethal event in which an individual kills another individual and subsequently dies by suicide. This article presents a review of research carried out in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, and the United States of America over the past 60 years on the prevalence of mental illness among the perpetrators of H-S. Analysis of the available data indicated a great disparity in the results of the different studies. Overall, depression was the most frequent disorder reported (about 39% of the cases in the 20 studies that assessed depressive disorders), followed by substance abuse (about 20% in 10 studies) and psychosis (about 17% in 11 studies). This review, therefore, indicated that mental illness plays an important role in H-S. The prevention of these events depends on the identification and treatment of psychiatric disorder in potential perpetrators. J Am Acad Psychiatry Law 40:462-8, 2012

TI Farmers' contact with health care services prior to suicide: evidence
   for the role of general practitioners as an intervention point
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PRIMARY HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID MENTAL-HEALTH; SOUTH-AUSTRALIA; ILLNESS; MORTALITY; STRESS
AB Suicide in Australian rural communities has received significant attention from researchers, health practitioners and policymakers. Farmers and agricultural workers have been a focus of particular interest, especially in relation to levels of help seeking for mental health concerns. A less explored area, however, is the level of contact that Australian farming and agriculture workers who die by suicide have had with health providers for physical, rather than mental, health conditions. It is often assumed that farmers and agricultural workers have lower levels of contact with health care services than other rural residents, although this assumption has not been well tested. Using data from the Queensland Suicide Register, this paper describes levels of contact with health care providers in the 3 months before death by suicide among men in farming and agriculture occupations and other occupations in rural Queensland. No significant differences were found in farming and agricultural workers' levels of contact with a general practitioner when compared with other rural men in Queensland. The current findings lend weight to the view that rural general practitioners represent an important intervention point for farming and agriculture workers at risk of suicide (whether or not those individuals exhibit accompanying psychiatric illness).

   AUSTRALIA; MORTALITY; BEHAVIOR; TRENDS
AB In this article we present evidence about the factors that determine four gradual decisions on the part of adolescents to attempt suicide. To that end, we estimate a series of binary choice models by using data drawn from the U.S. National Youth Risk Behavior Surveys corresponding to 1991, 1993, 1995, and 1997. Our results show that the decisions to attempt suicide are motivated by both demographic and psychosocial variables, such as gender, age, ethnicity, education failure, possession of a gun, habitual participation in sporting activities, individual weight perception, and taking pills or provoking vomiting to lose weight. Moreover, we also find that a significant degree of influence is exerted by another group of factors, such as the consumption of drugs, sexual relationships, and, finally, pregnancy.

TI The effect of a web-based depression intervention on suicide ideation:
   secondary outcome from a randomised controlled trial in a helpline
SO BMJ OPEN

DT Article
ID CRISIS HOTLINE OUTCOMES; ANXIETY; PSYCHOTHERAPY; HOPELESSNESS; EFFICACY;
   INTERNET; SCALE
AB Objectives: The effect of web-based interventions for depression on suicide ideation in callers to helplines is not known. The aim of this study was to determine if web-based Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) with and without telephone support is effective in reducing suicide ideation in callers to a helpline compared with treatment as usual (TAU). A secondary aim was to examine the factors that predict change in suicide ideation. Putative predictors included level of baseline depression, suicide behaviour, baseline anxiety and type of intervention.
   Design: Randomised controlled trial.
   Setting: Lifeline, Australia's 24 h telephone counselling service participants: 155 callers to a national helpline service with moderate-to-high psychological distress.
   Interventions: Participants were recruited and randomised to receive either 6 weeks of internet CBT plus weekly telephone follow-up; internet CBT only; weekly telephone follow-up only or a wait-list TAU control group.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures: Suicidal ideation was measured using four items from the 28-item General Health Questionnaire. Predictors of change in ideation were tested using logistic regression analysis.
   Results: Regardless of the intervention condition, participants showed significant reductions in suicidal ideation over 12 months (p<0.001). Higher baseline suicidal behaviour decreased the odds of remission of suicidal ideation at postintervention (OR 0.409, p<0.001). However, change in depression over the course of the interventions was associated with improvement in suicide ideation (OR 1.165, p<0.001).
   Conclusions: Suicide ideation declines with and without proactive intervention. Improvements in depression are associated with the resolution of suicide ideation. Specific interventions focusing on suicide ideation should be further investigated.

AB A sample of 183 current cocaine users, 120 primary injecting cocaine users (ICUs), and 63 primary noninjecting cocaine users (NICUs) were administered a structured interview to ascertain attempted suicide histories, methods used, and factors associated with suicide attempts. All respondents were volunteers and current cocaine users recruited through a wide range of sources. The mean age of participants was 30.1 years, and 65% were male. The ICUs were older (32.3 vs. 26.7 years, respectively), more likely to be male (72% vs. 54%, respectively), to be unemployed (84% vs. 23%, respectively) and to have a prison history (53% vs. 1%, respectively) compared to NICUs. Of the sample, 31% had attempted suicide, 18% had done so on more than one occasion, and 8% had made an attempt in the preceding 12 months. Overall, 28% of the sample had been treated by a medical practitioner after an attempt. ICUs (38%) were significantly more likely than NICUs (10%) to have attempted suicide and to have done so on more than one occasion (23% vs. 3%, respectively). The most common method used among both groups was self-poisoning (ICUs 28%, NICUs 8%), primarily by drug overdose. Violent methods had been used by 22% of ICUs and 3% of NICUs. Multivariate analyses revealed that injecting, female gender, and more extensive polydrug use were independent predictors of a suicide attempt. The prevalence of suicide in this study indicates that it represents a major clinical issue among ICUs and to a lesser extent among noninjectors of the drug. Those treating cocaine users for drug dependence need to be aware of the salience of suicide as a problem, among injectors in particular.

AB Mass murders in Dunblane, United Kingdom, and Port Arthur, Australia, provoked rapid responses from the governments of both countries. Major changes to Australian laws resulted in a controversial buy-back of longarms and tighter legislation. The Australian situation enables evaluation of the effect of a national buy-back, accompanied by tightened legislation in a country with relatively secure borders. AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) was used to predict future values of the time series for homicide, suicide and accidental death before and after the 1996 National Firearms Agreement (ATA). Men compared with observed values, firearm suicide was the only parameter the ATA may have influenced, although societal factors could also have influenced observed changes. The findings have profound implications for future firearm legislation policy direction.

   A total of 1723 cases of violent death were identified, comprising 478 homicide (HOM) cases and 1245 non-substance toxicity suicide (SUI) cases.
   Substances were detected in 65.5% of cases, and multiple substances in 25.8%, with no group differences. Illicit drugs were detected in 23.9% of cases, and multiple illicit in 5.3%. HOM cases were significantly more likely to have an illicit drug [odds ratio (OR) 2.09] and multiple illicits (OR 2.94), detected, HOM cases being more likely to have cannabis (OR 2.39), opioids (OR 1.53) and psychostimulants (OR 1.59) present. HOM cases were, however, significantly less likely to have benzodiazepines (OR 0.53), antidepressants (OR 0.22) and antipsychotics (OR 0.23) present. Alcohol was present in 39.6% of cases (median blood alcohol concentration = 0.12), with no group difference in prevalence.
   The role drugs play in premature death extends far beyond overdose and disease, with illicit drugs associated strongly with homicide.

AB Familicide-suicide following separation is under-researched and remains a poorly understood phenomenon. Findings from previous research are inconclusive in relation to both risk factors and perpetrator motivation. This article explores the relevance of long-term biopsychosocial antecedents in cases of familicide-suicide that occurred in Western Australia between 1986 and 2005. A conceptualisation of the hypothesised risk factors in familicide-suicide is proposed based on attachment theory, personality dysfunction, the neurobiology of trauma and the possible unconscious motivation of perpetrators, which may prove helpful in assessing the risk of familicide-suicide in family court cases. The research identified and articulated a number of warning signs to familicide-suicide that are often not identified, or appreciated, by decision makers. Suggestions are offered for changes to practice that may be helpful in identifying and responding to high-risk cases in a way that enhances safety.

DT Article
AB IMPORTANCE Rapid-fire weapons are often used by perpetrators in mass shooting incidents. In 1996 Australia introduced major gun law reforms that included a ban on semiautomatic rifles and pump-action shotguns and rifles and also initiated a program for buyback of firearms.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether enactment of the 1996 gun laws and buyback program were followed by changes in the incidence of mass firearm homicides and total firearm deaths.
   DESIGN Observational study using Australian government statistics on deaths caused by firearms (1979-2013) and news reports of mass shootings in Australia (1979-May 2016). Changes in intentional firearm death rates were analyzed with negative binomial regression, and data on firearm-related mass killings were compared.
   EXPOSURES Implementation of major national gun law reforms.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Changes in mass fatal shooting incidents (defined as >= 5 victims, not including the perpetrator) and in trends of rates of total firearm deaths, firearm homicides and suicides, and total homicides and suicides per 100 000 population.
   RESULTS From 1979-1996 (before gun law reforms), 13 fatal mass shootings occurred in Australia, whereas from 1997 through May 2016 (after gun law reforms), no fatal mass shootings occurred. There was also significant change in the preexisting downward trends for rates of total firearm deaths prior to vs after gun law reform. From 1979-1996, the mean rate of total firearm deaths was 3.6 (95% CI, 3.3-3.9) per 100 000 population (average decline of 3% per year; annual trend, 0.970; 95% CI, 0.963-0.976), whereas from 1997-2013 (after gun law reforms), the mean rate of total firearm deaths was 1.2 (95% CI, 1.0-1.4) per 100 000 population (average decline of 4.9% per year; annual trend, 0.951; 95% CI, 0.940-0.962), with a ratio of trends in annual death rates of 0.981 (95% CI, 0.968-0.993). There was a statistically significant acceleration in the preexisting downward trend for firearm suicide (ratio of trends, 0.981; 95% CI, 0.970-0.993), but this was not statistically significant for firearm homicide (ratio of trends, 0.975; 95% CI, 0.949-1.001). From 1979-1996, the mean annual rate of total nonfirearm suicide and homicide deaths was 10.6 (95% CI, 10.0-11.2) per 100 000 population (average increase of 2.1% per year; annual trend, 1.021; 95% CI, 1.016-1.026), whereas from 1997-2013, the mean annual rate was 11.8 (95% CI, 11.3-12.3) per 100 000 (average decline of 1.4% per year; annual trend, 0.986; 95% CI, 0.980-0.993), with a ratio of trends of 0.966 (95% CI, 0.958-0.973). There was no evidence of substitution of other lethal methods for suicides or homicides.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Following enactment of gun law reforms in Australia in 1996, there were no mass firearm killings through May 2016. There was a more rapid decline in firearm deaths between 1997 and 2013 compared with before 1997 but also a decline in total nonfirearm suicide and homicide deaths of a greater magnitude. Because of this, it is not possible to determine whether the change in firearm deaths can be attributed to the gun law reforms.

AB Worldwide, more than 1 million people take their life every year. In Australia, 3027 deaths by suicide were reported in 2015, the highest rate reported in 10 years. There is an alarming disparity between suicide rates across Indigenous and non-Indigenous people documented in many countries around the world. Between 2001 and 2010, the overall suicide rate for Indigenous Australians was twice that for non-Indigenous individuals. Compared to the general population, those with substance abuse disorders are almost 10 times more likely to die from suicide. In alcohol and other drug treatment (AOD) services, one in seven (15%) clients are Indigenous, despite representing only 3% of the entire Australian population. In order to better understand the current status of research in the field, a systematic review was completed aimed at identifying studies that reported the prevalence of suicidal behaviour in substance abuse treatment settings, with the additional aim of comparing rates and risk profiles across Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. We identified 20 studies reporting rates of suicidal behaviour in individuals who have attended AOD treatment. Rates of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and death by suicide were reported across multiple studies. Eleven studies reported rates of lifetime suicide attempts with prevalence rates ranging from 17.1 to 47% (median = 30.2%; mean = 29.2%). No studies were identified reporting Australian Indigenous rates of suicidal behaviour in substance abuse treatment settings, highlighting a significant gap in the literature.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Suicide and intentional self-harm are issues of major importance in public health and public policy, with rates widely used as progress indicators in these areas.
   Accurate statistics are vital for appropriately targeted prevention strategies and research, costing of suicide and to combat associated stigma.
   Underreporting of Australian suicide rates probably grew from 2002 to 2006; Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) suicide data were at least 11% or 16% undercounted (depending on case definitions) in 2004.
   In coronial cases with undetermined intent for 2005 to 2007, intentional self-harm was found in 39%.
   Systemic reasons for undercounting include: (i) absence of a central authority for producing mortality data; (ii) inconsistent coronial processes for determining intent, as a result of inadequate information inputs, suicide stigma, and high standards of proof; (iii) collection and coding methods that are problematic for data stakeholders; and (iv) lack of systemic resourcing, training and shared expertise.
   Revision of data after coronial case closure, beginning with ABS deaths registered in 2007, is planned and will reduce undercounting.
   Other reasons for undercounting, such as missing or ambiguous information (eg, single-vehicle road crashes, drowning), differential ascertainment (eg, between jurisdictions), or lack of recorded information on groups such as Indigenous people and gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people require separate responses.
   A systemic coordinated program should address current inaccuracies, and social stigma about suicide and self-harm must be tackled if widespread underreporting is to stop. MJA 2010; 192: 452-456

AB Background: High rates of suicidal behaviours among Indigenous Australians have been documented. Justice-involved individuals are also at a higher risk for engaging in suicidal behaviours. This study sought to ascertain the prevalence and correlates of suicidal behaviours for 107 Indigenous adult males in custody in Victoria, Australia.
   Methods: Participants undertook a structured interview comprising a psychiatric assessment Information on suicidal behaviours (ideation and attempts), socio-demographics, environmental stressors, negative life events and mental health was obtained.
   Results: A high proportion of Indigenous males in custody experienced lifetime suicidal ideation (63.7%) and over one-half had attempted suicide (54.5%). A smaller, yet significant number of participants experienced ideation over the past 12 months (27.9%). Having a loved one pass away within the past 12 months predicted recent ideation; lifetime ideation and a diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder predicted a lifetime suicide attempt.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of suicidal behaviours among Indigenous people in custody is remarkably high. Correlates of suicidal behaviours for Indigenous people in custody in this study likely manifest in the community, denoting an urgent public health response. Prevention must begin in communities at-risk for suicidal behaviours. The development of low intensity mental health service infrastructure in communities to promote awareness and provide accessible, least restrictive support and treatment is necessary. Correctional institutions must also continue to improve custodial suicide prevention and management initiatives.

AB How differences in drinking patterns may affect the impact of alcohol consumption on deliberate self-harm among adolescents is explored in this international comparative study. Schools in Australia, Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Norway (N=30,532) were surveyed. In all countries the risk of deliberate self-harm was significantly elevated among adolescents who reported some or numerous episodes of intoxication, controlling for confounding factors. The results support the assumption that intoxication is significantly related to the association between alcohol consumption and deliberate self-harm in adolescents.

AB In this small qualitative grounded theory study (21 interviews and focus groups with a total of 26 participants) investigating the understandings of and attitudes toward suicide and self-harm of Aboriginal peoples in a coastal region of New South Wales, Australia, we found that cultural factors particular to these communities influence the way such behavior is defined in an Aboriginal context. A continuation of certain "traditional" cultural forms of self-harm behavior was evident in participant definitions, notably the practice of female hair cutting, also described as a mourning ritual, which appears to serve as a marker both to the individual and others.

AB Background: Suicide officially kills approximately 30,000 annually in the United States. Analysis of this leading public health problem is complicated by undercounting. Despite persisting socioeconomic and health disparities, non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics register suicide rates less than half that of non-Hispanic Whites.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study uses multiple cause-of-death data from the US National Center for Health Statistics to assess whether race/ethnicity, psychiatric comorbidity documentation, and other decedent characteristics were associated with differential potential for suicide misclassification. Subjects were 105,946 White, Black, and Hispanic residents aged 15 years and older, dying in the US between 2003 and 2005, whose manner of death was recorded as suicide or injury of undetermined intent. The main outcome measure was the relative odds of potential suicide misclassification, a binary measure of manner of death: injury of undetermined intent (includes misclassified suicides) versus suicide.
   Results: Blacks (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.22-2.57) and Hispanics (1.17, 1.07-1.28) manifested excess potential suicide misclassification relative to Whites. Decedents aged 35-54 (AOR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.84-0.93), 55-74 (0.52, 0.49-0.57), and 75+ years (0.51, 0.46-0.57) showed diminished misclassification potential relative to decedents aged 15-34, while decedents with 0-8 years (1.82, 1.75-1.90) and 9-12 years of education (1.43, 1.40-1.46) showed excess potential relative to the most educated (13+ years). Excess potential suicide misclassification was also apparent for decedents without (AOR, 3.12; 95% CI, 2.78-3.51) versus those with psychiatric comorbidity documented on their death certificates, and for decedents whose mode of injury was "less active" (46.33; 43.32-49.55) versus "more active."
   Conclusions: Data disparities might explain much of the Black-White suicide rate gap, if not the Hispanic-White gap. Ameliorative action would extend from training in death certification to routine use of psychological autopsies in equivocal-manner-of-death cases.

AB Objective: To analyze the risk factors for suicide, premature death and all-cause death in a representative population of hospital-treated deliberate self-poisoning patients.
   Method: A prospective cohort study using data-linkage between the Hunter Area Toxicology Service Database and the National Death Index of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, from January 1991 to December 2000.
   Results: There were 4105 subjects, of whom 228 (5.6%) died, 122 (2.9%) by premature death and 58 (1.4%) by suicide. The probability of suicide after 10 years follow-up was 2%. The adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI) for suicide were: 'disorders usually diagnosed in infancy, childhood and adolescence', 5.28 (95% CI = 2.04-13.65): male gender, 4.25 (95% CI = 2.21-8.14); discharge to involuntary psychiatric hospital admission, 3.20 (95% CI = 1.78-5.76); and increasing age, 1.02 (95% CI = 1.01-1.04). Men and women showed different patterns of multivariate risks, although increased risk with increasing age and discharge to an involuntary psychiatric admission was true for both. The standardized all-cause mortality ratio (95% CI) was: for men, 6.42 (95% CI = 5.44-7.57), and for women 4.39 (95% CI = 3.56-5.41). The standardized suicide mortality ratio (95% CI) was: for men, 20.55 (95% CI = 15.24-27.73), and for women 22.95 (95% CI = 13.82-38.11).
   Conclusions: Men and women have different risk factors for subsequent suicide after self-poisoning. Hospital-treated self-poisoning patients have increased risk of subsequent suicide, premature and all-cause death. Psychiatric assessment, leading to discharge decisions, is worthwhile in identifying patients at long-term risk of suicide, premature and all-cause death.

AB There has been a substantial decline in mortality in Australia during the 20th century, with a major improvement in life expectancy.
   There has been a broad "health transition", from a pattern of high mortality from infectious diseases to one of lower overall mortality from non-communicable diseases and injury.
   From 1951, trends in death rates from major causes were evident, with the rise and partial fall of two epidemics (coronary heart disease and stroke, and lung cancer).
   This overall picture masks significant inequalities in health for Indigenous people and the socioeconomically disadvantaged.

AB Background: Several recent studies have reported that serious violence towards self and others is more common in the first episode of psychosis than after treatment.
   Aim: To estimate the proportion of survivors of suicide attempts during psychotic illness by jumping from a height who had not previously received treatment with antipsychotic medication.
   Methods: An audit of the medical records of patients admitted to nine designated trauma centres in New South Wales, Australia, after surviving a jump of more than 3 m. Jumping was defined using routine hospital ascribed International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. The height of the jump and all clinical data were extracted from case notes.
   Results: The files of 160 survivors of jumps of more than 3 m were examined, which included 70 who were diagnosed with a psychotic illness (44%). Thirty-one of the 70 diagnosed with a psychotic illness (44%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 32-56%) had never received treatment for psychosis and hence were in the first episode of psychosis. One in five (19.4%) of all survivors of a suicide attempt by jumping had an undiagnosed and untreated psychosis that was often characterized by frightening delusional beliefs.
   Conclusion: A large proportion of the survivors of suicide attempts by jumping were diagnosed with a psychotic illness, which confirms an association between psychosis and suicide by jumping. Some suicides might not have been linked to psychosis had the patient not survived the suicide attempt, suggesting that the contribution of schizophrenia to suicide mortality might have been underestimated in psychological autopsy studies. The finding that nearly half of the survivors diagnosed to have a psychotic illness had never received treatment with antipsychotic medication indicates a greatly increased risk of suicide by jumping in the first episode of psychosis when compared to the annual risk after treatment.

AB Gunshot residue (GSR) is a valuable form of forensic trace evidence in the investigation of firearms-related suicide and crime. In order to ensure that such evidence is given appropriate evidential weighting when it comes to case investigations, the dynamics of the deposition and distribution of GSR must be understood. As the activity of the subject after firing is a major factor in the retention of GSR, cases of suicide involving a firearm provide an opportunity to assess GSR distribution where post-shooting activity is not an issue, assuming the subject had not been moved. Seventy-one cases of suicide by gunshot in South Australia between 1998 and 2014 were examined to collect data on firearm type, calibre, and gunshot residue test results. Overall, 47% of cases were found to produce GSR results that were not of high probative value, even though it was known that the shooter had fired a firearm. Of particular interest were cases involving 0.22 rimfire ammunition, for which characteristic particles are not expected due to lack of antimony present in the primer. Despite this, 64% of these cases resulted in the detection of antimony-containing, three-component particles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

   evaluation of a mentoring approach to modify suicide risk for remote

SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Resilience; Suicide prevention; Wellbeing; Aboriginal; Torres Strait
   Islander; Remote; School students; Boarding school; Mentoring
ID GROUNDED THEORY; CULTURES; HEALTH; CONTEXT; BASE; TIME
AB Background: The proposed study was developed in response to increased suicide risk identified in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students who are compelled to attend boarding schools across Queensland when there is no secondary schooling provision in their remote home communities. It will investigate the impact of a multicomponent mentoring intervention to increase levels of psychosocial resilience. We aim to test the null hypothesis that students' resilience is not positively influenced by the intervention. The 5-year project was funded by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council from December 2014.
   Methods/Design: An integrated mixed methods approach will be adopted; each component iteratively informing the other. Using an interrupted time series design, the primary research methods are quantitative: 1) assessment of change in students' resilience, educational outcomes and suicide risk; and 2) calculation of costs of the intervention. Secondary methods are qualitative: 3) a grounded theoretical model of the process of enhancing students' psychosocial resilience to protect against suicide. Additionally, there is a tertiary focus on capacity development: more experienced researchers in the team will provide research mentorship to less experienced researchers through regular meetings; while Indigenous team members provide cultural mentorship in research practices to non-Indigenous members.
   Discussion: Australia's suicide prevention policy is progressive but a strong service delivery model is lacking, particularly for Indigenous peoples. The proposed research will potentially improve students' levels of resilience to mitigate against suicide risk. Additionally, it could reduce the economic and social costs of Indigenous youth suicide by obtaining agreement on what is good suicide prevention practice for remote Indigenous students who transition to boarding schools for education, and identifying the benefits-costs of an evidence-based multi-component mentoring intervention to improve resilience.

   rural; suicide
ID RISK-FACTORS; BEHAVIOR; POPULATION; PREVALENCE; DEATH; AGE
AB BackgroundIndividuals with intellectual disability (ID) have a higher likelihood of exposure to identified risk factors for suicide when compared with the general community and have been recognised as being both capable of forming intent for suicide and acting on this intent. However, in spite of research outlining these concerns from the 1970s, there remains a dearth of studies that examine suicide amongst the population of people with ID.
   MethodAn online cross-sectional survey was purposively developed, with questions aimed at identifying both the experiences and current practices of support staff who assist people with ID in relation to suicide, suicidal behaviour and suicide assessment. It was undertaken across both rural and metropolitan areas in Australia. The survey was open for a period of 12months. A total of 139 respondents (109 female/30 male), with a mean age of 41 and an average 12years of experience in supporting people with ID, completed the tool.
   ResultsA total of nine suicides by people with ID were reported. Seventy-seven per cent of the respondents reported that they had individuals with ID display suicidal behaviours, and 76% noted that a person had specifically talked about wishing to end their life. Only four participants (3%) noted that they did not support individuals with a dual diagnosis of ID and mental health concern. Sixty per cent of participants reported that no one in their organisation had ever completed a suicide risk assessment, and only 28% reported that they would do a suicide risk assessment if an individual that they supported was diagnosed with a mental health issue.
   ConclusionsThe current findings indicate that support staff recognise the capacity of people with ID to conceptualise suicide, note the existence of suicidal discussions and behaviours and report on actual suicides. This represents one of the few Australian studies that has specifically considered suicide amongst this cohort of people and reinforces the fact that suicide is not unknown in this population. The data indicate a possible divide between the reports of people with ID actively talking about and acting on suicidal thoughts and the lack of any proactive use of any tools to assess for this risk.

ID PARACETAMOL; AVAILABILITY
AB Background: Suicide has been a major community concern in Esperance, a geographically isolated port on the south coast of Western Australia.
   Aims: To evaluate the effect of three evidence-based initiatives for the primary prevention of suicide: (i) providing suicide awareness sessions for staff members in health, education and social services; (ii) limiting the sale of over the counter analgesics (aspirin and paracetamol) to packets containing less than the minimum lethal dose; and (iii) implementing Commonwealth media guidelines in the reporting of suicides by media.
   Methods: Changes in knowledge, awareness, attitudes, comfort and use, before and after each intervention were assessed using standardized instruments and pro forma derived from previous work, such as the Youth Suicide Prevention Training Manual and Suicide Intervention Beliefs Scale. Percentage changes in the number of retail outlets selling over the counter analgesics to less than potentially lethal quantities (less than 8 g of paracetamol or aspirin) were also measured. Media representatives were interviewed to gain their perceptions of Commonwealth Guidelines for the reporting of suicide, and encouraged to consult the project team before reporting suicide related issues.
   Results: The baseline survey illustrated that mental health staff and general practitioners were more aware of suicide issues, risk factors for suicide and awareness of professional and ethical responses than staff from other services, and were more willing to raise the issue with a person at risk. Thirty-three subjects participated in suicide awareness training of whom 21 (66%) returned questionnaires. There were significant increases in awareness of suicide-related issues and risk factors, as well as reported levels of knowledge of professional and ethical responses and comfort, competence and confidence levels when assisting a person at risk. Only three media representatives were aware of the Commonwealth Health Department Guidelines for reporting suicide and only one believed that the guidelines influenced their reporting. The local newspapers subsequently contacted the researchers to check that their reporting met the guidelines. As regards access to analgesics, one out of seven retailers agreed to implement the strategy (pending agreement from other retailers), another claimed increased awareness of the danger of analgesics, and three maintained that they would attempt to monitor excessive amounts sold to one individual.
   Conclusions: Local initiatives can improve the awareness and knowledge of staff in the assessment of suicide risk, as well as of local media. These need to be complemented by initiatives at State or Commonwealth level to produce change in statewide media, or sales of over the counter analgesics.

AB OBJECTIVE: Suicide rates in Quebec over the second half of the 20th century show a wide range of variation depending on age and time period. However, few studies have verified the presence of a cohort effect affecting trends in Quebec suicide rates. This study is designed to evaluate the potential effects of age, period and cohort (APC) on trends in suicide between 1950 and 2009 in Quebec.
   METHOD: For these APC analyses, we used a multiphase approach combining a graphical inspection followed by an analysis that isolates the cohort effect from age and period effects (linear regression of the residuals from a median polish of the rates).
   RESULTS: The graphical inspection of trends in rates points to combined effects of age, period and cohort among both men and women. However, the median polish analysis attributes primary importance to period effects, followed by age effects, but also shows weak cohort effects that are significant only among men born between 1950 and 1979.
   CONCLUSION: The variation in Quebec suicide rates appears to be primarily a reflection of period, age and, to a lesser degree, birth cohort. Thus, in addition to sex, selection of risk groups should be based more on age and time period than on birth cohort.

AB Recent studies have demonstrated that immigrants and ethnic minorities may be at higher risk of suicidal behaviour as compared to the general population. We conducted a literature search to identify studies in English from 1980 to 2017 related to suicide risk among immigrants and ethnic minorities. Six hundred and seventy-eight reports were screened, and 43 articles were included in the qualitative synthesis of the review. Some studies reported lower rates of suicide attempts, while other findings suggested higher rates of suicidal behaviour and deaths among immigrants as compared to the native population. Also, a positive correlation was found between suicidal behaviour and specific countries of origin. Non-European immigrant women were at the highest risk for suicide attempts, a group which included young women of South Asian and black African origin. Risk factors among migrants and ethnic minorities were found to be: language barriers, worrying about family back home, and separation from family. The lack of information on health care system, loss of status, loss of social network, and acculturation were identified as possible triggers for suicidal behaviour. Overall, results suggest that specific migrant populations and ethnic minorities present a higher risk of suicidal behaviour than native populations, as well as a higher risk of death by suicide.

AB Background: Little is known about the psychiatric state of patients who stab themselves in the brain (intracranial self-stabbing), including whether the behavior is usually an attempt to commit suicide and whether it is performed in association with symptoms of psychotic illness.
   Method: A search for cases of intracranial self-stabbing in New South Wales, Australia (NSW), and a systematic search for published case reports of intracranial self-stabbing.
   Results: We located 5 cases in NSW in the last 10 years and 47 published case reports of intracranial self-stabbing since 1960. Intracranial self-stabbing was associated with a diagnosis of a psychotic illness in 27 of 49 (55%) cases in which a diagnosis was available. Intracranial self-stabbing was not always performed with the intention of committing suicide and does not usually have a fatal outcome.
   Conclusions: Intracranial self-stabbing appears to be an under-recognized form of self-harm that is associated with, but not limited to, psychotic illness.

AB Background: Methamphetamine (MA) use is a growing public health concern in many settings around the world. While some physical and mental health effects associated with injection MA use have been well described, little is known about the relationship between injecting MA and suicidal behavior. We sought to determine whether MA injection was associated with an increased risk of attempting suicide among a prospective cohort of injection drug users (IDUs) in Vancouver, Canada.
   Methods: Between 2001 and 2008, eligible participants enrolled in the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study (VIDUS) completed semi-annual questionnaires that elicited information regarding sociodemographics, drug use patterns, and mental health problems including suicidal behavior. We used Cox proportional hazards models with time-dependent covariates to determine whether self-reported MA injection was an independent predictor of attempting suicide at subsequent time points.
   Results: Of 1873 eligible participants, 149 (8.0%) reported a suicide attempt, resulting in an incidence density of 2.5 per 100 person-years. Participants who attempted suicide were more likely to be younger (median: 35 vs. 40, p < 0.01), female (48.3% vs. 35.1%, p < 0.01), and of Aboriginal ancestry (43.6% vs. 31.3%, p < 0.01). In a Cox proportional hazards model, MA injection was associated with an 80% increase in the risk of attempting suicide (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.08-2.99, p = 0.02).
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that IDUs who inject MA should be monitored for suicidal behavior. Improved integration of mental health and suicide prevention interventions within harm reduction and drug treatment programs may be fruitful. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID HOPELESSNESS; IDEATION; SCALE
AB Objectives Rates of youth suicide in Australian Indigenous communities are 4 times the national youth average and demand innovative interventions. Historical and persistent disadvantage is coupled with multiple barriers to help seeking. Mobile phone applications offer the opportunity to deliver therapeutic interventions directly to individuals in remote communities. The pilot study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-help mobile app (ibobbly) targeting suicidal ideation, depression, psychological distress and impulsivity among Indigenous youth in remote Australia.
   Setting Remote and very remote communities in the Kimberley region of North Western Australia.
   Participants Indigenous Australians aged 18-35years.
   Interventions 61 participants were recruited and randomised to receive either an app (ibobbly) which delivered acceptance-based therapy over 6weeks or were waitlisted for 6weeks and then received the app for the following 6weeks.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was the Depressive Symptom InventorySuicidality Subscale (DSI-SS) to identify the frequency and intensity of suicidal ideation in the previous weeks. Secondary outcomes were the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) and the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11).
   Results Although preintervention and postintervention changes on the (DSI-SS) were significant in the ibobbly arm (t=2.40; df=58.1; p=0.0195), these differences were not significant compared with the waitlist arm (t=1.05; df=57.8; p=0.2962). However, participants in the ibobbly group showed substantial and statistically significant reductions in PHQ-9 and K10 scores compared with waitlist. No differences were observed in impulsivity. Waitlist participants improved after 6weeks of app use.
   Conclusions Apps for suicide prevention reduce distress and depression but do not show significant reductions on suicide ideation or impulsivity. A feasible and acceptable means of lowering symptoms for mental health disorders in remote communities is via appropriately designed self-help apps.

TI Suicide and desert men:: the power and protection of <i>kanyirninpa</i>

SO AUSTRALASIAN PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE Aboriginal health; Aboriginal men's health; holding; suicide
AB Objective: Fred Myers described kanyirninpa (holding) as a deeply embedded value for desert Aboriginal people. He explained it as authority with nurturance where older people 'grew up' and protected younger people. Can a cultural understanding of kanyirninpa provide any insight or response to the high rates of suicide among young Aboriginal men today?
   Method: This paper draws on qualitative health research that was conducted among desert communities in the southeast Kimberley region of Western Australia between 2001 and 2004. The research was primarily with men and explored cultural understandings of the particular male expressions and praxis of kanyirninpa. The research also occurred at a time when the first suicides of young men, who had grown up within this desert region, were taking place.
   Results: Research showed that the fracture of kanyirninpa over recent generations has seriously affected key social processes and generational relationships within desert society. This wounding has implications for men's health and can provide an understanding as to why young men attempt self-harm and suicide. However, the social expression of kanyirninpa can also sustain important meanings for young men as they grow up. It can protect them from high-risk behaviour and self-harm.
   Conclusions: While the experience of suicide continues to deeply wound Aboriginal families and communities, desert people's efforts to sustain and express kanyirninpa offers hope. This is a social process and relationship that can help inform health policy and practice in response to self-harm, suicide ideation and behaviour, particularly for young Aboriginal men.

   TRENDS
AB Background: As in other Mediterranean countries, suicide mortality rates in Italy are generally lower than they are in Northern and Central European countries and on other continents (eg, North America, Australia). Yet, no studies to date have examined the prevalence of and risk factors for suicide ideation, plans, and attempts, in the general population ill Italy.
   Methods: Suicide ideation, plans, and attempts and potential risk factors were assessed in a community survey conducted with 4712 adult respondents (response rate, 71.2%). The participants had been selected from Italian municipality resident registries and made up a stratified, multistage, clustered probability sample. The project was part of the World Health Organization World Mental Health (WMH) Survey Initiative.
   Results: The lifetime prevalence (SE) of suicide ideation, plans, and attempts was 3.0% (0.3), 0.7% (0.1), and 0.5% (0.1), respectively. Prevalence rates of these suicide-related phenomena did not differ by Italian geographic macro-area (Northern, Central, and Southern Italy, including the islands of Sicily and Sardinia). Among ideators, the probability of ever making a plan was 24.6% (4.0) and attempt was 18.2% (4.5). The probability of making an attempt for ideators having made a suicide plan was nearly 50%. Risk factors for lifetime suicide-related phenomena were female sex, younger cohort, fewer years of education, and earlier onset age of suicide ideation. The presence of a common mental disorder, especially if comorbid, was associated with a significantly increased risk for all suicide phenomena investigated (ideation, plans, and attempts suicide). There were no substantial differences in the frequency of these phenomena among the 3 main macro-areas examined, that is, Northern, Central, and Southern Italy (including Sicily and Sardinia), which conversely show marked climate, socioeconomic, and cultural differences.
   Conclusion: As shown in previous studies examining suicide, suicide continuum phenomena (in terms of ideation, plans, and attempt) in Italy were lower than typically observed for other European countries and did not differ for different macro-areas presenting remarkably different socioeconomic conditions. Prevalence rates of common mental disorders were equally lower in Italy than in other European countries. Although the detection of mental disorders represents an important step in suicide prevention, the correlations observed between various suicidal continuum manifestations suggest that timely recognition of suicide ideation and plans is an equally crucial factor in the implementation of effective preventive policies.

AB The nature of rurality varies considerably across the world, and there is no single pattern of suicide in rural areas. However, some common themes are evident from countries as diverse as India, the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, and China. Suicide rates tend to be higher in rural populations compared with urban, with relatively higher female rates in some areas. North American and Australian data suggest that indigenous people may be at particularly high risk. Specific rural occupations, such as farming, often seem to be associated with higher risk. Although mental illness plays an important role in suicide in rural areas, as it does elsewhere, it is unclear whether higher rural suicide rates are linked to a correspondingly higher prevalence of mental illness in such populations. Instead, other factors may be important including: adverse socio-economic conditions; higher rates of alcohol or substance misuse; greater access to potentially lethal methods, such as pesticides or firearms; cultural attitudes which promote independence and discourage help-seeking behaviour; poor access to services providing help at times of psychological crisis; and cultural discontinuity in traditional societies. Not all factors apply in all areas, hence, the literature on rural suicide prevention initiatives varies considerably. Strategies have involved: the restriction of access to lethal methods; improving attitudes to, and knowledge of, mental illness in high-risk populations; improving the accessibility of conventional mental health services; making the use of such supports more culturally acceptable; and the development of context-specific supports, such as programmes addressing specific cultural issues.

ID AUSTRALIA; 1ST-GENERATION
AB Objective: Suicide rates vary across different cultural groups and some immigrant or refugee populations display higher risk for suicide. This study aimed to produce guidelines to help members of the public provide assistance to a person from an immigrant or refugee background who is having suicidal thoughts or displaying suicidal behaviour.Method: The Delphi expert consensus method was used to identify warning signs and first aid actions to include in guidelines. Forty-four professionals and/or advocates with lived experience were asked to rate whether each statement contained in an online questionnaire should be included in the guidelines and to suggest additional statements considered by the respondent to be particularly relevant to a person from an immigrant or refugee background. The Delphi process started with 473 statements and 80 new items were written based on suggestions from panel members.Results: Out of the total 553 statements, 345 were endorsed as appropriate warning signs or helping actions. These statements were used to develop the guidelines.Discussion: The guidelines specific to people from immigrant or refugee backgrounds contain additional items to those included in similar guidelines for English-speaking countries. The guidelines may be used for gatekeeper training for suicide prevention in culturally diverse societies.

AB Introduction: Although spatial examination of mortality and morbidity is becoming more common in health studies, the investigation of suicide death clusters within the neighborhood context is underutilized. The purpose of this ecological study is to detect high- and low-risk clusters of suicide deaths in Florida and determine which neighborhood characteristics distinguish clusters from non-clusters.
   Methods: The scan statistic method was used to detect overall clusters of completed suicides in Florida from 2001 to 2010. Regression analysis was used to investigate the association of neighborhood characteristics with identified clusters. All data synthesis and statistical analyses were conducted in 2015.
   Results: Twenty-four high- risk and 25 low-risk clusters were identified. The risk of suicide was up to 3.4 times higher in high- risk clusters than in areas outside of clusters (relative risk ranged from 1.36 to 3.44, p <= 0.05). Low-risk clusters were associated with 30%-94% decreased risk of suicide (relative risk ranged from 0.06 to 0.70, p <= 0.05). Areas with high levels of elderly concentration and household singularity were more likely to be in high- risk clusters, whereas areas with higher economic deprivation and residential density were more likely to be in low-risk clusters.
   Conclusions: This study identified general suicide patterns across space in the state of Florida and described the characteristics of those areas. (C) 2016 American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The dominant understandings of suicide have privileged the professional observations of health professionals and sociologists over the lived experiences of persons who have reported feeling suicidal. The current study explores what it is like to feel suicidal by examining comments posted voluntarily in an online forum. Adopting an inductive thematic analysis, a number of themes were uncovered which shed light on the following questions: Who has suicidal thoughts? What triggers suicidal thoughts? What is it like to feel suicidal? Also drawn from the data, was information relating to the types of treatments that people received, as well as ongoing survival strategies that people have relied on. The findings indicated people with suicidal thoughts form a heterogeneous group with mixed opinions about the causes of suicidal thoughts. The findings also highlighted a variety of experiences, descriptions and means for survival highlighting the depth of insight that those with first-hand experience have about suicidal thoughts, highlighting also the deep gap in knowledge and understanding in the existing literature about suicide and suicidal ideation. The recommendations for future direction in practice and research include, listening to, and valuing more, the voices and perspectives of suicidal people themselves.

AB Objectives. To investigate the impact of the Australian National Firearms Agreement (NFA) on suicide and assault mortality.
   Methods. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional difference-in-difference study of the impact of the NFA on national mortality rates in the Australian population from 1961 to 2015.
   Results. The NFA had no additional statistically observable impact on firearm-related suicides in women (P = .09) and was associated with a statistically significant increase in the trend in men (P<.001). Trends in non-firearm-related suicide deaths declined by 4.4% per year (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.1%, 4.8%) in men after the introduction of the NFA and increased in women by 0.3% (95% CI = 0.1%, 0.7%). Trends in non-firearm-related homicides declined by 2.2% per year (95% CI = 1.5, 3.8%) in women and 2.9% per year (95% CI = 2.0%, 3.7%) in men after the introduction of the NFA, with a statistically significant improvement in trends for women (P = .04)but not for men (P = .80).
   Conclusions. The NFA had no statistically observable additional impact on suicide or assault mortality attributable to firearms in Australia.

AB This chapter examines the 'Werther effect' (the phenomenon where there is an increase in rates of completed or attempted suicide following the depiction of an individual's suicide in the media). There is strong evidence for the Werther effect operating in traditional news media (e.g., newspapers, television news), and there would also seem to be a significant risk of it operating in entertainment media (e.g., fictional television shows/series, fictional films, stage plays) and newer media (e.g., the Internet), although the findings from studies in these areas are somewhat more equivocal. Various interventions have been put in place to address the Werther effect across the three forms of media. Guidelines for journalists and editors appear to be effective in promoting responsible reporting in traditional news media, providing media professionals are engaged. Resources for stage and screen writers may also have potential in the entertainment media, although to date these have not been well evaluated. Several solutions have been proposed to address the issue of pro-suicide websites (e.g., the use of voluntary guidelines and the self-regulation of sites, the use of filtering software, collaboration between the mental health sector and the mass media, the development of alternative websites that promote help-seeking behaviour, and legal controls), but again these have not been subject to rigorous evaluation. Further work is required to fully understand the mechanisms by which the Werther effect might operate, but it is clear that addressing the Werther effect across the full gamut of different media has the potential to prevent suicide.

ID SUICIDE
AB The right to die is an issue is predicated on larger cultural understandings of autonomy. Autonomy, in turn, is centered around assumptions of choice, that individuals are able to make health-related decisions based on a rational calculation. In such a way, a medically assisted death is differentiated from suicide. Through an ethnographic study of right-to-die activists in North America and Australia and how they understand ideals of good deaths, this article will complicate this view by examining the ethical subject constructed by such activism that reveals autonomy to be a useful guiding fiction that mask larger ethical relationships.

ID WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; HEALTH; SUICIDE; LINKAGE; RISK
AB Background: Maternal loss can have a deep-rooted impact on families. Whilst a disproportionate number of Aboriginal women die from potentially preventable causes, no research has investigated mortality in Aboriginal mothers. We aimed to examine the elevated mortality risk in Aboriginal mothers with a focus on external causes.
   Methods: We linked data from four state administrative datasets to identify all women who had a child from 1983 to 2010 in Western Australia and ascertained their Aboriginality, socio-demographic details, and their dates and causes of death prior to 2011. Comparing Aboriginal mothers with other mothers, we estimated the hazard ratios (HRs) for death by any external cause and each of the sub-categories of accident, suicide, and homicide, and the corresponding age of their youngest child.
   Results: Compared to non-Aboriginal mothers and after adjustment for parity, socio-economic status and remoteness, Aboriginal mothers were more likely to die from accidents [HR = 6.43 (95 % CI: 4.9, 8.4)], suicide [HR = 3.46 (95 % CI: 2.2, 5.4)], homicide [HR = 17.46 (95 % CI: 10.4, 29.2)] or any external cause [HR = 6.61 (95 % CI: 5.4, 8.1)]. For mothers experiencing death, the median age of their youngest child was 4.8 years.
   Conclusion: During the study period, Aboriginal mothers were much more likely to die than other mothers and they usually left more and younger children. These increased rates were only partly explained by socio-demographic circumstances. Further research is required to examine the risk factors associated with these potentially preventable deaths and to enable the development of informed health promotion to increase the life chances of Aboriginal mothers and their children.

AB Objective: Several studies have shown that acute alcohol use is associated with suicidal behavior, but the magnitude and nature of the relationship remain unclear. We report a study on the impact of acute alcohol use on suicide attempts treated in the emergency room (ER) using the case-crossover design. Method: Seven ER studies carried out in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Australia from 1984 to 1996 with probability samples and similar methodology were merged yielding a total of 102 suicide attempters (overall 52% were male and 59% under 30 years of age). Results: Thirty-six patients reported alcohol use within 6 hours prior to the suicide attempt. When usual alcohol consumption during the past 12 months served as the control value, the estimated relative risk (RR) for patients who reported alcohol use within 6 hours prior to the suicide attempt was 9.6 (95% confidence interval: 5.7-16.3). Although the prevalence of alcohol use differed by sex, there was no statistically significant difference in the estimated RRs (RR = 13.6 men and RR = 5.3 women, p = 0.11 for the heterogeneity test). Conclusions: A positive association was found between alcohol use 6 hours prior and suicide attempts in 102 ER cases in four countries. The case-crossover methodology is well suited to studies for which an external control group is not easily obtainable.

AB An exclusion period (usually from 12 months to 2 years) is usually found in life insurance policies as a precautionary measure to prohibit people from insuring their lives with the intent to kill themselves shortly thereafter. Several studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of exclusion periods on the risk of suicide among the insured in the US and Australia. However, while Hong Kong has experienced an increase in the number of suicides among the insured, little is known about the dynamic between the exclusion period and suicide in Asia. Here we make use of death claims data from one of the major life insurance companies in Hong Kong to ascertain the impact of a 12-month exclusion period on suicide risk. We also use utility functions derived from economic theory to better understand individual choices regarding suicide among the insured. More specifically, we sought to determine whether there is a greater risk of suicide immediately following the 12-month exclusion period. We also examined whether the risk of suicide claims was higher than that of other non-suicidal claims. The study period for this investigation was from January 1, 1997 to December 31, 2011, during which time there were 1935 claims based on 1243 deaths. Of these, 197 were suicide-related claims for 106 suicide deaths. The mean number of life policies held by suicidal claimants and non-suicidal claimants was 1.6 and 1.4, respectively. The average/median size of the claims (total payment made on all policies held by the insured life) was HK$665,8001426,600 and HK$497,700/276,200 for suicidal and non-suicidal deaths, respectively. The policy lifetime of the claims, or the number of days from policy issuance to suicide occurrence, ranged from 38 to 7561 days, with a mean of 2209 days, a median of 1941 days, and a standard deviation of 1544 days. The peak density of suicide claims occurred on day 1039 of the policy. Our results revealed that suicide claims tend to occur earlier than other claims and that there is a greater risk of suicide observed following the 12-month exclusion period. Some suggestions are made in terms of extending the exclusion period, which is anticipated to significantly reduce suicide at the global level. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   DEXTROPROPOXYPHENE; DRUGS; ALCOHOL; WALES; RATES; ANTIDEPRESSANTS
AB Restricting means for suicide is a key element in suicide prevention strategies of all countries where these have been introduced. Preventing deaths from analgesic overdoses is highlighted in the National Suicide Prevention Strategy for England. The problem of self-poisoning with the prescription-only drug co-proxamol (dextropropoxyphene plus paracetamol) has received attention in several countries. We have conducted a review of the international literature related to possible strategies to tackle this problem. In England and Wales in 1997-1999, 18% of drug-related suicides involved co-proxamol; these constituted 5% of all suicides. Death usually results from the toxic effects of dextropropoxyphene on respiration or cardiac function. Death from co-proxamol overdose may occur rapidly, the lethal dose can be relatively low, and the effects are potentiated by alcohol and other CNS depressants. The majority of co-proxamol overdose deaths occur before hospital treatment can be received. The risk can extend to others in the household of the person for whom the drug is prescribed. While there is limited evidence that educational strategies have been effective in reducing deaths from co-proxamol poisoning, initiatives in Scandinavia, Australia and the UK to restrict availability of co-proxamol have produced promising results. Given the paucity of evidence for superior therapeutic efficacy of co-proxamol over other less toxic analgesics, there are good reasons to question whether it should continue to be prescribed.

TI Mortality variation across Australia: descriptive data for States and
   Territories, and statistical divisions
SO AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID DEATH RATES; DECLINE
AB OBJECTIVE: To describe variation in all cause and selected cause-specific mortality rates across Australia.
   METHODS: Mortality and population data for 1997 were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. All cause and selected cause-specific mortality rates were calculated and directly standardised to the 1997 Australian population in 5-year age groups. Selected major causes of death included cancer, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, accidents and suicide. Rates are reported by statistical division, and State and Territory.
   RESULTS: All cause age-standardised mortality was 6.98 per 1000 in 1997 and this varied 2-fold from a low in the statistical division of Pilbara, Western Australia (5.78, 95% confidence interval 5.06-6.56), to a high in Northern Territory-excluding Darwin (11.30, 10.67-11.98). Similar mortality variation (all p<0.0001) exists for cancer (1.01-2.23 per 1000) and coronary artery disease (0.99-2.23 per 1000), the two biggest killers. Larger variation (all p<0.0001) exists for cerebrovascular disease (0.7-11.8 per 10,000), diabetes (0.7-6.9 per 10,000), accidents (1.7-7.2 per 10,000) and suicide (0.6-3.8 per 10,000). Less marked variation was observed when analysed by State and Territory. but Northern Territory consistently has the highest age-standardised mortality rates.
   CONCLUSIONS: Analysed by statistical division, substantial mortality gradients exist across Australia, suggesting an inequitable distribution of the determinants of health. Further research is required to better understand this heterogeneity.

AB In 2015-2016, the Clarence Valley in Northern New South Wales, Australia, experienced an unexpectedly high number of deaths by suicide, and the resulting distress was exacerbated by unhelpful press coverage. The local response was to adopt a community-wide positive mental health and wellbeing initiative. This paper describes the process and achievements of the initiative called 'Our Healthy Clarence'. Key stakeholders were interviewed at year two and relevant documents reviewed. Data were analysed using document and thematic analysis. Our Healthy Clarence was established following community consultation, including forums, interviews, surveys and workshops. It adopted a strengths-based approach to suicide prevention, encompassing positive health promotion, primary and secondary prevention activities, advocacy, and cross-sectoral collaboration. A stakeholder group formed to develop and enact a community mental health and wellbeing plan. Factors contributing to its successful implementation included a collective commitment to mental health and wellbeing, clarity of purpose, leadership support from key local partners, a paid independent coordinator, and inclusive and transparent governance. Stakeholders reported increased community agency, collaboration, optimism and willingness to discuss mental health, suicide and help-seeking. Our Healthy Clarence draws ideas from mental health care, community development and public health. This initiative could serve as a model for other communities to address suicide, self-harm and improve wellbeing on a whole-of-community scale.

AB Using a post-structuralist narrative approach, this article focuses on insights gained from a qualitative study with 11 Australian intercountry adult adoptees with particular reference to their adoption experiences and post-adoption support needs. From thematic analysis, six interrelated, overlapping themes are reported. These are as follows: connecting to the past, the ambiguous self, the experience of racism, being grateful, safe and unsafe zones, and post-adoption support needs. Key findings relate to the Australian experience of unmet need and support the importance of the adoptee voice in determining appropriate support.

AB Farmer suicides have lead to a problematization of the mental health of farmers against the backdrop of farming as an occupation. In Australia, the dominant discursive framework shaping this problematization is one of 'drought stress' constituted through a positivist empiricism and 'psy' discourses of mental health. The contours of this dominant framework operate to limit other possible renderings of farmer suicide and narrow the frame of appropriate response. In particular, this framework marginalizes political, economic and cultural dimensions relevant to understanding farmer suicide. This paper draws on theoretical and empirical resources to disrupt the dominant discourse of 'drought stress'. The study on which it is based involved in-depth interviews with primary producers of wine grapes and was initiated by the Wine Grape Growers Association in the context of concerns about the social and economic effects of drought. What emerged during the interviews however, were issues arising from agri-business. This paper engages with Foucault's analyses of neoliberal political economy to explore the micro-politics of the wine industry within the broader regulatory apparatus of agriculture. It considers how the state and corporate agriculture constrain autonomy, economic conditions and the ability of farmers to continue to farm thereby creating distress and at times suicide. From this perspective, the paper argues that farmer's suicides are rendered political and warrant interventions which go beyond the individual and beyond the external and almost insurmountable conditions of drought and climate change.

AB Contemporary sociological research indicates rural men face increasing pressure to comply with hegemonic masculine gender norms. Adopting Butler's poststructural theory of gender performativity, this study presents findings from qualitative interviews with twenty-five self-identified male Goths living in rural Australia, revealing how participants enacted masculinity and how rurality shaped gender performance. Despite participants' believing their Goth identity transcended geographic location, Goth self-expression of counternormative masculinity was met with societal pressure. Rural Australian communities were presented as strongly upholding normative, traditional gender expectations as most participants experienced adverse responses, namely, homophobic hostility, employment discrimination, bullying, and/or physical assault, which necessitated modification of gender performance for individual safety and well-being. Participants largely attributed negative reactions to rural communities' closed-mindedness in contrast with the open-mindedness they experienced in urban communities. Overall, participants believed urban communities in Australia and beyond displayed greater acceptance of diverse gender performances than rural Australia.

AB Background Previous research suggests that first-generation immigrants have a lower suicide risk than those both born in Sweden and with both parents born in Sweden (natives), while the suicide risk in the second generation seems higher. The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent suicide risk in first-generation and second-generation (both parents born abroad) and intermediate-generation (only one parent born abroad) immigrants compared with natives is associated with sociodemographic factors, labour market marginalisation and morbidity.
   Methods A prospective population-based cohort study of 4 034 728 individuals aged 16-50 years was followed from 2005 to 2010. HRs for suicide were calculated for first-generation, intermediate-generation and second-generation immigrants compared with natives. Analyses were controlled for sociodemographic factors, morbidity and labour market marginalisation.
   Results The HR of suicide was significantly lower in first-generation immigrants (HR 0.83 CI 0.76 to 0.91), and higher in second-generation (HR 1.32, CI 1.15 to 1.52) and intermediate-generation immigrants (HR 1.20, CI 1.08 to 1.33) in comparison to natives. The excess risk was explained by differences in sociodemographics, morbidity and labour market marginalisation. In the fully adjusted models, a higher HR remained only for the Nordic second generation (HR 1.29, CI 1.09 to 1.52). There were no sex differences in HRs.
   Conclusions The risk of suicide was shown to be lower in the first generation and higher in the second generation compared with natives. The higher HR in the Nordic second generation was not explained by differences in sociodemographics, labour market marginalisation and morbidity. Further research is warranted to investigate factors underlying this excess risk.

   Participants 251 Australian men aged 18years and over who had made a suicide attempt 6-18months prior to completing the survey.
   Outcomes The survey canvassed the language men use to describe their depression and suicidality, warning signs, barriers to accessing help and what is needed to interrupt a suicide attempt. ORs and (2) were used to test for differences by age, geographic location and current depression severity.
   Results Of 299 men screened and eligible to participate, 251 completed all or part of the survey. Participants identified different words and warning signs for depression compared with suicidality. The most commonly endorsed barriers to accessing help were not wanting to burden others (66%) and having isolated themselves (63%). Men overwhelmingly endorsed I thought about the consequences for my family' as the factor which stopped a suicide attempt (67%). I need support from someone I really trust and respect' was also strongly endorsed. There were few differences by age, region or depression severity.
   Conclusions Participants were able to identify signs, albeit often subtle ones, that they were becoming depressed or suicidal. Similarly, most were able to identify active strategies to interrupt this downward spiral. Men wanted others to notice changes in their behaviour, and to approach them without judgement.

AB The demographic and toxicological characteristics of deliberate (SUI, n = 50) and accidental (ACC, n = 927) fatal heroin overdose cases were examined. SUI cases were more likely to be female, had lower body mass indices, were more likely to be enrolled in treatment and less likely to have hepatic pathology. The median blood morphine concentration of SUI cases was significantly higher than that of ACC cases (0.70 vs. 0.40 mg/L, p < 0.001). Blood morphine concentrations of > 1 mg/L were seen among 38.0% of SUI cases compared to 13.9% of ACC cases. Being a member of the SUI group remained a significant independent predictor of higher morphine concentrations after controlling for the effects of potential confounders (p < 0.001), other significant predictors being the absence of alcohol (p < 0.001), the presence of methadone (p < 0.05), and the presence of cocaine (p < 0.05). The current data are consistent with the view that suicide forms a small, but distinct, category of heroin overdose cases, rather than overdose being a parasuicidal phenomenon per se.

AB Despite implicating the same biological systems, the relationship between suicide seasonality and season-of-birth has not been examined previously. The purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction between season-of-birth and the seasonality of suicidal behaviour. All adult suicides (N = 2923) and deliberate self harm (DSH) hospitalizations (N = 33321) in Western Australia (1970-96) were examined. A variable population at risk approach was used to determine season-of-birth. Seasonality was established by spectral analysis. We found that DSH has a significant season-of-birth (p = 0.047) and seasonality of occurrence, both peaking in spring. Individuals born in the 90 days centred on the peak birth period, however, show no DSH seasonality. In contrast, suicide has no season-of-birth (p = 0.53). We also found a season-of-birth effect among the DSH group that eliminates any seasonality of DSH among the high-risk by birth group. Further work is needed to identify the possible biological and environmental determinants of this interaction.

AB Background: Volunteer crisis tine responders are a valuable resource for suicide prevention crisis lines worldwide. Aim: The aim of this study was to gain a deeper understanding of how volunteers operating a diaconal crisis line in Norway experienced challenges and how these challenges were met. Method: A qualitative, explorative study was conducted. A total of 27 volunteers were interviewed through four focus groups. The material was analyzed using systematic text condensation. Results: The greatest challenge to the volunteers was the perception of a gap between their expectations and the practice field. The experience of many volunteers was that the crisis line primarily served a broad ongoing support function for loneliness or mental illness concerns, rather than a suicide prevention crisis intervention function. Limitations:The focus group design may have made the participants more reluctant to share experiences representing alternative perspectives or personally sensitive information. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that a uniform response to callers using crisis lines as a source of ongoing support is warranted and should be implemented in volunteer training programs.

AB Study design: Mortality review was undertaken of patients who suffered traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) between 1955 and 1994 inclusive.
   Objectives: The study objective was to provide evidence of reasons for the observed reduction in long-term life expectancy for the SCI population.
   Setting: Patients were those who had most, if not all, of their inpatient and outpatient care at Royal North Shore Hospital, Spinal Injuries Unit, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.
   Methods: Data on causes of death for 195 patients fitting the inclusion criteria were analysed by actuarial methods using ICD9CM classifications.
   Results: The incidence of death in the spinal cord injured, from septicaemia, pneumonia and influenza, diseases of the urinary uystem and suicide, are significantly higher than in the general population. The findings confirm variations in potentially treatable causes of death depending on neurological impairment, attained age and duration since injury. Unlike septicaemia and pneumonia, which have shown a significant reduction since 1980, the death rate for suicide alone has risen.
   Conclusion: This analysis identified complications which affect mortality and morbidity in patients suffering from the effects of SCI.

AB In Stuart v Kirkland-Veenstra [2009] HCA 15, the High Court of Australia considered the duty of care owed by police to a person at risk of suicide in the community where the duty was alleged to arise in common law or as a consequence of a power conferred on police by the Mental Health Act 1986 (Vic) to detain and arrange for a psychiatric examination of the person. The High Court considered the principles relevant to determining the legislative intention of the specific provisions of the Mental Health Act and whether the existence of a discretion to exercise a power was inconsistent with existence of a statutory duty. The High Court also examined whether a person who appears to have been contemplating suicide was omentally illo. Concerns arise from the decision in the context of the difficulties in assessing suicidal intent and satisfying the statutory requirement of omental illnesso to enable a person who is at risk to be detained for the purposes of an assessment.

AB Objective To learn the evolution of antidepressant and lithium use in Castilla y Leon (Central Spain) and its relationship with suicide rates.
   Methods A search in the ECOM (Especialidades Consumo de Medicamentos) database of the Spanish Ministry of Health for antidepressants and lithium was carried out for the period 1992-2005. Defined daily doses (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day were obtained as consumption data. Population and suicide rates data come from the Spanish National Statistics Institute.
   Results Antidepressant consumption increased 7-fold, from 6.9 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day in 1992 to 47.3 in 2005; the corresponding increase in cost was more than 10-fold. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) comprised 77% of the total consumption. Venlafaxine consumption multiplied by 2.2. The consumption of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) decreased after venlafaxine and mirtazapine were marketed. Lithium consumption increased by 76% during the period studied, but it plateaued in 2000.
   Conclusions The consumption of antidepressants in Castilla y Leon has increased remarkably and the pattern has changed; there is an increase in the consumption of the new and more expensive antidepressants such as venlafaxine and escitalopram. No association was observed between suicide rates and antidepressant consumption. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Background: Recent studies have reported that serious violence toward self and others is more common in the first episode of psychosis than after treatment. Aims: To estimate the proportion of survivors of potentially lethal suicide attempts with sharp objects who have a diagnosis of psychotic illness, and the proportion of those patients who had never received treatment for psychosis with antipsychotic medication. Methods: An audit of the medical records of patients from three major teaching hospitals in Sydney, Australia, who survived a self inflicted stab wound to the abdomen, torso, or a laceration to the neck. Results: The files of 95 survivors of self-inflicted wounds by cutting or stabbing who met the inclusion criteria for the study were examined. A psychotic illness was diagnosed in 46 cases (48%), of which 26 (57%) had never received treatment with antipsychotic medication and, hence, were in the first episode of psychosis. Conclusions: Psychosis is strongly associated with potentially lethal suicide attempts using sharp objects and patients who have never received treatment for psychosis appear to be at particular risk.

AB All cases presenting to the New South Wales Department of Forensic Medicine between January 1, 2001 and September 31, 2010 in which zolpidem was detected, were retrieved. A total of 91 cases were identified. The mean age was 49.4 years, 65.9% were male, and 61.5% were suicides. Zolpidem was a factor contributing to death in 35 (37.3%) cases, of which 31 (34.1%) involved zolpidem toxicity. The median blood zolpidem concentration was 0.20 mg/L (range 0.053.50 mg/L), with no significant gender difference. Drug toxicity cases involving zolpidem had significantly higher median blood zolpidem concentrations than other cases (0.50 vs. 0.10 mg/L). In 83.5% of cases, psychoactive substances other than zolpidem were detected, most commonly antidepressants (46.2%), benzodiazepines (35.2%), opioids (26.4%), and alcohol (39.6%). In summary, zolpidem was a factor contributing to death in a large proportion of cases, predominately involving drug toxicity and suicide.

AB Background: Routine monitoring of depression symptoms and suicide risk is essential for appropriate treatment planning and risk management, but not well implemented by clinicians. We developed a brief online monitoring tool to address this issue. Aims: To investigate whether the online tool can feasibly improve monitoring; whether it is acceptable and useful for young people and their clinicians; and to determine whether a shorter tool could be implemented. Method: In a naturalistic longitudinal cohort study, 101 young people with depression completed the online tool on a tablet, prior to their consultation. Their results were immediately available to their clinician. Clients and clinicians answered questionnaires about acceptability and usefulness. Results: The tool was feasible to implement. Young people and clinicians found the tool acceptable and useful for understanding symptoms and risk. A brief three-item suicidal ideation screening measure correlated well with a validated measure of suicidal ideation. Conclusion: The online tool facilitates the quick exchange of key information about suicide risk, allowing clinicians to immediately address this. This level of responsiveness is likely to improve treatment outcomes. The brief version allows full integration into clinical practice to support clinicians managing those at risk of suicide.

ID WORDS
AB Background: Henry Hellyer was an accomplished surveyor and explorer in Australia in the early 1800s whose apparent suicide at the age of 42 has puzzled historians for generations. He left behind several written works, including letters, journals, and reports. Aims: The current study assessed changes in the ways Hellyer used words in his various written documents during the last 7 years of his life. Methods: Hellyer's writings were analyzed using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program. Results: Hellyer showed increases in first-person singular pronoun use, decreases in first-person plural pronoun use, and increases in negative emotion word use. As this is a single, uncontrolled case study, caution is recommended in generalizing from the current results. Conclusions: Results suggest Hellyer's increasing self-focused attention, social isolation, and negative emotion. Findings are consistent with increasing depression and suicidal ideation. Implications for using computerized text analysis to decode people's psychological states from their written records are discussed.

AB Suicide is the primary cause of death in Australia for youth between the ages of 15 and 24. This is common worldwide as well. Unfortunately, very few treatments have been developed, tested, and successful for treating this difficult clinical problem. Attachment-Based Family Therapy (ABFT) is one of the therapies demonstrating a significant decrease in suicide ideation and attempts. The effectiveness of this model may rest on the fact that ABFT targets the clinical context (e.g., family, trauma, etc.) of this problem as well as intrapsychic processes. Based on attachment theory, the model aims to help adolescents recover a more secure attachment relationship with parents so that secure-based parenting can help protect the adolescent from future stress and self-harm. A case study is used to demonstrate how the model unfolds, systemically seeking to repair the attachment relationships while also keeping the adolescent safe from suicidal thoughts and behaviours.

AB Background: Risk factors for suicide and fatal accidental intoxication are extensively studied, while risk factors for intoxications/injuries of undetermined intent are less well known. The latter have shown an overlap with suicides, but also with fatal accidental intoxications. The objective was to analyze potential differences and similarities in the patterns of risk factors for accidental intoxications, injuries/intoxications with undetermined intent, and suicides, respectively.
   Methods: A follow-up register study was conducted, using data from ASI interviews with clients in the criminal justice system in Sweden (n=6744), followed in the National Causes of Death Register. A set of risk factors from the ASI interview were tested in bivariate analysis with the respective cause of death, yielding significant risk factors further analyzed in three Cox regression models.
   Results: In Cox regression analyses, death from fatal accidental intoxication was associated with male gender (HR 4.09), use of heroin (HR 2.86), and use of cannabis (HR 1.94), and death from intoxication/injury of undetermined intent was associated with use of heroin (HR 3.48), binge drinking of alcohol (HR 2.46) and previous psychiatric hospitalization (HR 2.41), while negatively associated with depression (HR 0.33). Death from suicide was associated with previous suicide attempts (HR 2.78) and use of sedatives (HR 2.17).
   Conclusions: In this population of criminal justice clients with reported substance use problems, fatal injuries/intoxications with undetermined intent - like fatal accidental intoxications - appear to be associated with substance use variables, and cannot readily be assumed to represent the same background factors as suicide.

AB BackgroundThe expression of suicidal ideation is considered to be an important warning sign for suicide. However, the predictive properties of suicidal ideation as a test of later suicide are unclear.AimsTo assess the strength of the association between suicidal ideation and later suicide measured by odds ratio (OR), sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV).MethodWe located English-language studies indexed in PubMed that reported the expression or non-expression of suicidal ideation among people who later died by suicide or did not. A random effects meta-analysis was used to assess the pooled OR, sensitivity, specificity and PPV of suicidal ideation for later suicide among groups of people from psychiatric and non-psychiatric settings.ResultsThere was a moderately strong but highly heterogeneous association between suicidal ideation and later suicide (n=71, OR=3.41, 95% CI 2.59-4.49, 95% prediction interval0.42-28.1, I-2=89.4, Q-value=661, d.f.(Q)=70, P0.001). Studies conducted in primary care and other non-psychiatric settings had similar pooled odds to studies of current and former psychiatric patients (OR=3.86 v. OR=3.23, P=0.7). The pooled sensitivity of suicidal ideation for later suicide was 41% (95% CI 35-48) and the pooled specificity was 86% (95% CI 76-92), with high between-study heterogeneity. Studies of suicidal ideation expressed by current and former psychiatric patients had a significantly higher pooled sensitivity (46% v. 22%) and lower pooled specificity (81% v. 96%) than studies conducted in non-psychiatric settings. The PPV among non-psychiatric cohorts (0.3%, 95% CI 0.1%-0.5%) was significantly lower (Q-value=35.6, P<0.001) than among psychiatric samples (3.9%, 95% CI 2.2-6.6).ConclusionsEstimates of the extent of the association between suicidal ideation and later suicide are limited by unexplained between-study heterogeneity. The utility of suicidal ideation as a test for later suicide is limited by a modest sensitivity and low PPV.Declaration interestM.M.L. and C.J.R. have provided expert evidence in civil, criminal and coronial matters.

AB Background: Young adult (aged 20-34) males experience higher mortality than females, and in age groups immediately younger and older, and with considerable variation in death rates over time. Trends in mortality and the cause structure of deaths among young adult Australian males over 1979-2011 are investigated, with a focus on suicide and drug overdose.
   Methods: Mortality data by age for the period 1979 to 2011 and Australian population figures were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Cause of death was investigated using relevant International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, and mortality by cause was examined graphically over time according to various ICD aggregations. Mortality trends were contextualised in relation to labour market changes occurring in Australia from the 1980s to early 2000s.
   Results: Although motor vehicle accident (MVA) mortality declined by half between 1980 and 1998 in males, this did not translate into a reduction in total young male mortality because of simultaneous increases in suicide, and drug-related deaths classified as either poisoning (external cause) or drug dependence (mental disorders). When both suicide and drug-related deaths declined concurrently after 1998, total 20-34 year male mortality declined by almost half (46%) over 1998-2011. Declines in external cause mortality accounted for 63% of the total mortality decline in 20-34 year males over 1998-2011. The close temporal coincidence (statistically significant) of increases and declines in suicide and drug-related deaths over a decade suggests related causality.
   Conclusions: The coincidence of young male suicide and drug overdose mortality epidemics over the study period (excess deaths: 5000) suggest related causality such as exposure to common factors, including the labour market liberalisation and de-regulation of the 1990s, and deserves further investigation.

AB Aim To explore differences between suicide victims among Russian immigrants in Estonia and native Estonians, according to socio-demographic background, substance use pattern, and recent life events to find out immigration-specific factors predicting suicide.
   Methods The psychological autopsy study included 427 people who committed suicide in 1999 and 427 randomly selected controls matched by region, gender, age, and nationality.
   Results The only variable that differed significantly between Russian and Estonian suicide cases was substance use pattern. Logistic regression models showed that factors associated with suicide for both nationalitics were substance dependence and abuse (Russians: odds ratio [OR], 12.9; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 4.2-39.2; Estonians: OR, 8.1; 95% Cl, 3.9-16.4), economical inactivity (Russians: OR 5.5; 95% CL 1.3-22.9; Estonians: OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.3-7.1), and recent family discord (Russians: OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.1-9.9; Estonians: OR, 4.5; 95%, CI, 2.1-9.8). The variables that remained significant in the final model were having no partner (Estonians: OR, 3.0; 95% Cl, 1.6-5.5), being unemployed (Estonians: OR, 5.5; 95% CI, 2.0-15.4), and being an abstainer (Estonians: OR, 6.7; 95% CI, 2.5-17.6) for Estonians, and somatic illness (Russians: OR, 4.1; 95% Cl, 1.4-11.7), separation (Russians: OR, 32.3; 95% Cl, 2.9-364.1), and death of a close person (Russians: OR, 0.2; 95% Cl, 0.04-0.7) for Russians.
   Conclusion Although the predicting factors of suicide were similar among the Estonian Russians and Estonians, there were still some differences in the nature of recent life events. Higher suicide rate among Estonian Russians in 1999 could be at least partly attributable to their higher substance consumption.

AB Research has shown that suicide rate in Australia is on the rise and that most people who die by suicide are not in contact with mental health services. They most likely communicate their suicidal thoughts to family members or close friends, whose responses may sound unhelpful and/or dismissive, thus reinforcing suicidal ideation. This national emergency has been tackled via a social media campaign, #YouCan Talk, launched by a government-supported digital platform, BeyondBlue. This article adopts a multimodal discourse analysis approach to investigate how peer support is encouraged and articulated in the context of mental health discourse for suicide prevention. The two case studies selected for analysis from the BeyondBlue platform are (1) the #YouCanTalk social media campaign, designed to teach carers to identify severe depression and effectively respond to suicide warning signs and (2) a sample of posts from a thread for peer support in a monitored online forum devoted to help carers who seek peer advice. Unlike previous research, the article focuses on how pronouns and verbs index interpersonal relations in a systemic-functional perspective as well as other multimodal resources, such as visuals, layout and hyperlinking, to understand how identities are entextualised by both professional health providers and peer carers in digital platforms that address mental health issues.

AB The current state of knowledge of genetic predisposition towards the suicidal behavior allows for a question whether genetic risk factors account for the variation in suicide rates through time and space. Accordingly, the presented study will attempt to tackle the genetics behind suicidal behavior from the perspective of the populational genetics, First, the variability of suicide rates across Europe is discussed. This is followed by a brief discussion of the J curve (on a map of Europe, the countries with a higher suicide rate form a so-called J curve, which starts in Finland and extends down to Slovenia), which maps on to the second principal component identified for European gene distribution, representing the ancestral adaptation to cold climates and the Uralic language dispersion. Furthermore, we will discuss whether the group of people living within the J-curve could share genes, which may not tolerate excessive amounts alcohol, the combination of which is more likely to end in suicidal behavior. Further along we list possible ways in which suicidal behavior could have been selected for genetically in populations and identify those specific populations in which it may have appeared. Finally, we point at other locations in the world where a similar interplay of genes and environment has probably occurred, Greenland being the best example of the malignant interaction of alcohol consumption and the trait-like characteristics, which might constitute the vulnerability to suicidal behavior.

AB When a person injured as a result Of a breach of duty subsequently commits Suicide in the context of mental illness Caused by the breach of duty, difficult questions of Causation arise. At one level it might seem unfair that those dependent upon the deceased are not able to recover against the tortfeasor if the personal injury constituting the pathology within which the suicide was committed was foreseeable. At another level, though, it might seem unfair for a tortfeasor to be held liable if suicide itself was a highly remote risk and not reasonably foreseeable. The House of Lords in Corr v IBC Vehicles Ltd [2008] UKHL 13; [2008] 2 WLR 499; [2008] 2 All ER 943 hits adopted it liberal approach toward the Causation question, but not finally resolved the circumstances and extent to which suicide by a person whose psychiatric state still allows them a level of autonomy will constitute contribution and therefore reduction in compensation by the defendant. The decision sits somewhat uncomfortably with the approach of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in AMP General Insurance Ltd v Roads & Traffic Authority of NSW [2001] NSWCA 186 and Sarkis v Summitt Broadway Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 358. In Australia, authoritative determination of the issue is required from the High Court so its to clarify whether the approach of the House of Lords is to be preferred to that of the New South Wales Court of Appeal.

AB Objective: Hospital-treated deliberate self-poisoning (DSP) is common and the existing national monitoring systems are often deficient. Clinical Practice Guidelines (UK and Australia) recommend universal psychosocial assessment within the general hospital as standard care. We compared presentation rates, patient characteristics, psychosocial assessment and aftercare in UK and Australia.
   Methods: We used a cross sectional design, for a ten year study of all DSP presentations identified through sentinel units in Oxford, UK (n = 3042) and Newcastle, Australia (n = 3492).
   Results: Oxford had higher presentation rates for females (standardised rate ratio 2.4: Cl 99% 1.9, 3.2) and males (SRR 2.5: CI 99% 1.7, 3.5). Female to male ratio was 1.6:1, 70% presented after-hours, 95% were admitted to a general hospital and co-ingestion of alcohol occurred in a substantial minority (Oxford 24%, Newcastle 32%). Paracetamol, minor tranquilisers and antidepressants were the commonest drug groups ingested, although the overall pattern differed. Psychosocial assessment rates were high (Oxford 80%, Newcastle 93%). Discharge referral for psychiatric inpatient admission (Oxford 8%, Newcastle 28%), discharge to home (Oxford 80%, Newcastle 70%) and absconding (Oxford 11%, Newcastle 2%) differed between the two units.
   Conclusions: Oxford has higher age-standardised rates of DSP than Newcastle, although many other characteristics of patients are similar. Services can provide a high level of assessment as recommended in clinical guidelines. There is some variation in after-care. Sentinel service monitoring routine care of DSP patients can provide valuable comparisons between countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Suicide is the second leading cause of death for the university aged population globally. A significant proportion of students with suicidal ideation or behaviours do not seek professional help. Few primary suicide prevention programs have specifically targeted help seeking for suicidal ideation or behaviours among university students.
   Methods: This study reported the development and pilot test of a brief, two-module online psychoeducational program (ProHelp) that aimed to encourage help seeking for suicidal ideation and behaviours among university students. The program consists of two five-minute modules that address the risk factors and warning signs of suicide, stigmatising attitudes, and perceived barriers to help seeking. 156 Chinese university students and 101 Australian university students were recruited to evaluate the effectiveness of this program at post-test and one-month follow-up. Participants were randomly assigned to the psychoeducational program or an attention control program.
   Results: Of the Chinese and Australian students who were randomised into the study, around 50% completed the twoday posttest survey, and 30% completed the one-month followup survey. Although no significant difference was found between the control and experimental group on professional help-seeking beliefs and intentions, both groups' help-seeking attitudes increased during the study (p = 0.003 for the posttest survey, and p = 0.008 for the followup survey). The experimental group in both countries demonstrated a significant improvement in suicide literacy at the post-test survey (p = 0.015) compared to control. Qualitative feedback indicated that the ProHelp program was user-friendly, clear, and helpful.
   Conclusions: This study provides initial evidence that a brief online psychoeducational program could enhance university students' suicide literacy in both China and Australia. It also suggests that increasing suicide literacy might not be sufficient to improve students' help seeking, although effect sizes indicated that this lowintensity online approach shows promise in encouraging more positive beliefs towards help seeking and preparedness to help individuals with suicidal ideation among young people.

AB A questionnaire on substance abuse was distributed electronically to the heads of 185 Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists accredited anaesthesia departments in Australia and New Zealand. The response rate was 57%. From January 2004 to December 2013, 61 cases of substance abuse were identified, giving an estimated incidence of 1.2 cases per 1000 anaesthetist years. Of 44 detailed reports completed, the majority were aged between 30 and 49 years, were male and of specialist grade. However, when corrected for gender and grade, the estimated overall incidence was higher in females and twice as high for trainees compared with specialists. When compared with prior surveys, the pattern of substance abuse in Australia and New Zealand appears to have changed significantly, with a notable increase in propofol and alcohol abuse and a decrease in reported cases of opioid abuse. Common presenting features of abuse included intoxication and witnessed abuse. Seventy percent of cases had more than one comorbid condition, most frequently either mental health or family problems. Only 32% of abusers had made a long-term recovery within the specialty. Death was the eventual outcome in 18% overall,. with a particularly high mortality associated with propofol abuse (45%). Trainee suicide from all causes was reported at three times the rate of specialists. The findings indicate that substance abuse remains a significant problem in Australia and New Zealand and is associated with a significant mortality rate.

AB The aim of this article is to review the Australian literature about suicidality in minority sexual identity and/or behavior groups in order to determine the evidence base for their reported higher vulnerability to suicidal behaviors than heterosexual and non-transgendered individuals in the Australian context, as well as to identify the factors that are predictive of suicidal behaviors in these groups in Australia. A literature search for all available years (until the end of 2012) was conducted using the databases Scopus, Medline, and Proquest for articles published in English in peer-reviewed academic journals. All peer-reviewed publications that provided empirical evidence for prevalence and predictive factors of suicidal behaviors among LGBT individuals (or a subset thereof) in Australia were included. Reference lists were also scrutinized to identify "gray" literature for inclusion. The results revealed that there is only limited research from Australia. Nevertheless, although no population-based studies have been published, research indicates that sexual minorities are indeed at a higher risk for suicidal behaviors. In order to further the understanding of suicidal behaviors and potential prevention among LGBT groups in the Australia, further research is needed, particularly on fatal suicidal behaviors.

   Analysis of linked population-wide data
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID QUALITY-OF-LIFE; MARITAL-STATUS; HEALTH; IDEATION; CARE; MORTALITY
AB Background
   An elevated risk of suicide after a diagnosis of prostate cancer has been reported previously in the USA and Sweden. We aimed to identify whether prostate cancer survivors resident in New South Wales Australia are at higher risk of suicide and if so, who is most at risk.
   Methods
   Data were obtained from the New South Wales (NSW) Cancer Registry for all men diagnosed with prostate cancer in NSW during 1997 to 2007. These were linked by the Centre for Health Record Linkage (CHeReL) to Australian Bureau of Statistics Mortality Data to the end of 2007 to determine vital status and cause of death. We compared the number of suicides observed for prostate cancer survivors with the expected number of suicides based on age-and calendar year-specific rates for the NSW male population using standardised mortality ratios (SMRs). Suicide rate ratios (RR) by disease and patients' characteristics were estimated using multivariable negative binomial regression to determine the most at risk groups.
   Results
   During the study period 51,924 NSW men were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Forty nine of these men were subsequently recorded as committing suicide up to 10 years after diagnosis with an SMR of 1.70 (95% Cl:1.26-2.25). Twenty six (53%) of these suicides occurred within 12 months after diagnosis. Risk diminished over time since diagnosis (RR in 1-2 years after diagnosis = 0.29, 95% Cl: 0.12-0.71, 2-4 years RR = 0.30, 95% Cl: 0.14-0.16 and 4+ years RR = 0.26, 95% Cl: 0.11-0.60 compared with <1 year since diagnosis). Men with non-localised disease had a higher risk of suicide compared to men with localised disease (RR = 2.68, 95% Cl: 1.15-6.23). Men living outside major cities had lower risk of suicide compared to those resident in major cities (rate ratio = 0.42, 95% Cl: 0.20-0.87). Single, divorced, widowed or separated men were more likely to commit suicide than married men (RR = 4.18, 95% Cl: 2.36-7.42).
   Conclusion
   Risk of suicide is higher for NSW men diagnosed with prostate cancer than the general age matched male population. Vulnerable or lonely men and those with pre-existing depression or suicidal ideation who are diagnosed with prostate cancer should be offered additional psychological support.

AB The connection between divorce and suicide risk in Asia is unclear. To understand the contribution of cultural transitions to suicide among the divorced, we compare age- and sex-specific suicide rates among divorced men and women from five Pacific Rim populations: Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and the state of Victoria in Australia. On a cultural spectrum, we consider Hong Kong and Taiwan to lie between the more individualistic Australian culture and the more collectivistic Japanese and Korean cultures. Coefficients of aggravation (COA) are also compared.
   Suicide rates were found to be higher among the divorced than among other marital status groups in all five populations, but this difference was small in Victoria. The effect of divorce was significantly greater for men than for women only in Japan and South Korea. In the other populations, divorced men and women were at equal risk. Age trends in suicide rates for the divorced groups differed across populations. The COAs for the divorced group aged 40 or younger in the East Asian populations were higher than the COAs for older divorced groups, though this was not the case in the Victorian population.
   Suicide patterns among the divorced in the East Asian populations can be understood in terms of the legacy of Confucian traditions. Gender differences in Japan and South Korea may reflect either gender inequality (male dominance in formal interactions and emotional dependence in domestic life within a deteriorating Confucian family support system) or unique socio-cultural factors among married women. Divorced East Asian groups aged 40 or younger may be at a higher risk of suicide due to individual-level cultural ambivalence combined with a desire for systemic-level emotional interdependence. Social welfare regimes in the four East Asian populations need to fill the vacancy left by retreating traditional family systems. Research implications are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

SO ANNALS OF LEISURE RESEARCH

DT Editorial Material
DE Leisure; sport; protectors of health and suicide; lack of access
ID GAMES
AB Johan Huizinga (1872-1945), distinguished Dutch historian and philosopher of culture, called the play element in human culture Homo ludens [Huizinga, Johann. 1938. Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play Element in Culture. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul. (1945 edition)]. Play involves time out from work - leisure embracing respite, repose, amusement, fun and games, even watching games. Leisure and physical exertion are key moderators of stress-illness relationships, significantly safeguarding against suicide. For Aborigines it is also an avenue out of anger. Australia's Aborigines once had a multitude of traditional pastimes, most now lost, some re-found [see Edwards, Ken. 2009. "Traditional Games of a Timeless Land: Play Cultures in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Communities." Australian Aboriginal Studies (2): 32-43]. Many men took to Western sports, excelling in Australian Rules football, boxing, cricket, darts, professional athletics and rugby league. Traditionally, food-gathering was essential but also leisure and pleasure. Whether leisured respite or organized sporting competition, clans beset by serious illness need venues - and Aboriginal access to facilities falls far short of what is needed and what is available to mainstream Australia.

AB Objectives: To compare the prevalence of mental health disorders and the use of professional help by area of residence, age and sex; and to determine whether the differences parallel differences in suicide rates.
   Design: Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of Australian national mortality data (1997-2000) and the National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (1997), using broad area-of-residence classifications based on the Rural, Remote and Metropolitan Area (RRMA) index.
   Main outcome measures: (a) Suicide rates; (b) prevalence of depression, anxiety and substance-use disorders; and (c) use of health professionals for mental health problems - by age, sex and area of residence.
   Results: Higher suicide rates were evident for men, particularly young men in rural (40.4 per 100000; z, 3.2) and remote (51.7 per 100000; z, 7.2) populations compared with metropolitan (31.8 per 100000) populations. Although the proportion of young men reporting mental health disorders did not differ significantly between rural (23.5%; z, -0.5) and remote (18.8%; z, -1.6) areas compared with metropolitan (25.6%) areas, young men with a mental health disorder from non-metropolitan areas were significantly less likely than those from metropolitan areas to seek professional help for a mental health disorder (11.4% v 25.2%; z, -2.2).
   Conclusions: There is a need to investigate why young men in non-metropolitan areas, the population with the greatest suicide risk, do and do not engage with mental health services.

AB Objective: To examine the evidence for a national policy response to depression among gay, lesbian and other homosexually active people in Australia.
   Methods: A literature review using database searches on depression among non-heterosexual people then a web-based search of national policy investigating how mental health needs in this population are addressed in Australia.
   Results: The literature review found that non-heterosexual people experience depression at higher rates, but the literature on interventions was sparse. The policy analysis found no mention of depression or the broader mental health needs of non-heterosexual people in key national mental health policy documents. These documents outline a policy approach for population groups with a higher prevalence of mental health problems, and stigma and discrimination are relevant associated factors, but only the National Suicide Strategy considers non-heterosexual people an 'at-risk group'.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that the evidence on higher rates of depression in non-heterosexual people is strong, but that this is not recognised in current national policy.
   Implications: Defining non-heterosexual people as an 'at-risk' group is appropriate, as is prioritising access to mental health services that are socially and culturally appropriate. Addressing homophobia as an associated factor would require a strategic policy approach across a range of sectors.

AB This study evaluated the characteristics of suicide news articles in the digital press, their adherence to World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, and the effectiveness of interventions. We assessed adherence, avoidability, frequency and typology of suicide news over a six-month period in the four main digital media outlets of the Canary Islands (Spain). A brief training and information package intervention to the Canary Islands media outlets was carried out. We compared the quality of media reporting at both the pre-intervention and post-intervention timepoints, and compared the quality of reporting at the post-intervention timepoint in Victoria (Australia), where media interventions have been well-resourced and running for several years. We evaluated 339 suicide news articles: 38 from the pre-intervention period, 64 from the post-intervention period, and 237 from Victoria. News articles showed a very low degree of adherence to WHO recommendations, especially to those recommendations thought to have a protective effect. Post-intervention news articles showed better adherence than pre-intervention ones, but lower than those of Victoria, where constant interventions have been developed for years. We conclude that adherence to WHO recommendations is low. Simple interventions aimed at media professionals can improve adherence. However, constant and complex interventions seem to be more effective.

AB Objectives: To investigate the trends and correlations of gross domestic product (GDP) adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita on suicide rates in 10 WHO regions during the past 30 years.
   Design: Analyses of databases of PPP-adjusted GDP per capita and suicide rates. Countries were grouped according to the Global Burden of Disease regional classification system.
   Data sources: World Bank's official website and WHO's mortality database.
   Statistical analyses: After graphically displaying PPP-adjusted GDP per capita and suicide rates, mixed effect models were used for representing and analysing clustered data.
   Results: Three different groups of countries, based on the correlation between the PPP-adjusted GDP per capita and suicide rates, are reported: (1) positive correlation: developing (lower middle and upper middle income) Latin-American and Caribbean countries, developing countries in the South East Asian Region including India, some countries in the Western Pacific Region (such as China and South Korea) and high-income Asian countries, including Japan; (2) negative correlation: high-income and developing European countries, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and (3) no correlation was found in an African country.
   Conclusions: PPP-adjusted GDP per capita may offer a simple measure for designing the type of preventive interventions aimed at lowering suicide rates that can be used across countries. Public health interventions might be more suitable for developing countries. In high-income countries, however, preventive measures based on the medical model might prove more useful.

AB Objective: Assess the incidence and determinants of hospitalization for deliberate self-harm and mental health disorders, and suicide after bariatric surgery.
   Background: Limited recent literature suggests an increase in deliberate self-harm following bariatric surgery.
   Methods: A state-wide, population-based, self-matched, longitudinal cohort study over a 5-year period between 2007 and 2011. Utilizing the Western Australian Department of Health Data Linkage Unit records, all patients undergoing bariatric surgery (n = 12062) in Western Australia were followed for an average 30.4 months preoperatively and 40.6 months postoperatively.
   Results: There were 110 patients (0.9%) hospitalized for deliberate self-harm, which was higher than the general population [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.94, P = 0.005]. Compared with before surgery, there was no significant increase in deliberate self-harm hospitalizations (IRR 0.79, 95% CI 0.54-1.16; P = 0.206) and a reduction in overall mental illness related hospitalizations (IRR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63-0.91; P = 0.002) after surgery. Younger age, no private-health insurance cover, a history of hospitalizations due to depression before surgery, and gastrointestinal complications after surgery were predictors for deliberate self-harm hospitalizations after bariatric surgery. Three suicides occurred during the follow-up period, a rate comparable to the general population during the same time period (IRR 0.61, 95% CI 0.11-2.27, P = 0.444).
   Conclusions: Hospitalization for deliberate self-harm in bariatric patients was more common than the general population, but an increased incidence of deliberate self-harm after bariatric surgery was not observed. Hospitalization for depression before surgery and major postoperative gastrointestinal complications after bariatric surgery are potentially modifiable risk factors for deliberate self-harm after bariatric surgery.

AB Background
   Risk assessment of patients in general practice is a challenging area of clinical practice. Competing interests of managing patient wishes, consideration of duty to warn others and invoking the Mental Health Act while practising in a medicolegally accountable manner can be difficult.
   Objective
   This article summarises the risk assessment of patients with possible mental disorders and provides suggestions regarding measures that may be undertaken to manage risk in psychiatric emergencies.
   Discussion
   The evidence of effectiveness for risk assessment interventions in acute settings is limited. While it is not possible for general practitioners to predict the future, and particularly to predict fatal outcomes, they can be expected to meet a standard of care that identifies those at risk and provide an acceptable clinical response.

AB Debate about euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide has been increasing in many countries over recent years, including Australia. Recent Australian studies found support for euthanasia ranging from 33 to 60% for doctors, 38 to 77% for nurses, and 65 to 75% for community members. This paper reports on three large postal surveys, which investigated attitudes of doctors, nurses and community members to a range of end-of-life issues. Results are reported for those questions directly related to medical decisions at the end of life, including physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia. Across the three studies responses to the 38-page questionnaire were received from almost 3000 participants. Response rates ranged from 76% for health professionals in the first study to 50% for community members in the third study. A majority of respondents said that, if asked by a competent patient, doctors or nurses should (a) give additional pain relief even if they believe that this will hasten the patient's death; and (b) turn off a life-support machine. There was strong support from community members for the legalization of physician-assisted suicide/euthanasia, moderate support from nurses, but much less support from doctors. Qualitative data indicated that these are complex issues, requiring further discussion and investigation.

AB ObjectivesTo report worldwide trends in suicidemortality during a period that covers 7years after the 2008 global crisis.MethodsWe performed a time trend analysis with joinpoint regression.ResultsOver the 2000s, suicide mortality decreased with the largest declines observed in some Eastern European countries. The downward trends were followed by an increase in concomitance with the 2008 global crisis in some countries, including Greece (annual percentage change=+6 in men and +11.8 in women), the Netherlands (+4.2 in men and +4.0 in women), and the UK (+1.6 in men), while the pre-crisis downward trends stopped in Germany, Italy, and Spain. The joinpoint analysis also revealed long-term rises in Brazil (+0.8 since 1990 in men and +1.8 since 1999 in women), Mexico (+1.3 since 1995 in men and +3.6 since 1990 in women), the USA (+1.7 since 2005 in men and +4.2 since 2010 in women), and Australia (+1.8 in men and +3.7 in women, since 2006 in both sexes).ConclusionsDespite downward trendsin several areas of the world, in some countries suicide rates increased since the 2008 global crisis.

TI The fallen hero: masculinity, shame and farmer suicide in Australia
SO GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE
LA English
DT Article
DE shame; suicide; rurality; masculinity; farmer
ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; MENTAL-HEALTH; GENDER; AGRICULTURE; LIFE
AB The drought-stricken Australian rural landscape, cultures of farming masculinity and an economy of value, moral worth and pride form a complex matrix of discourses that shape subjective dynamics that render suicide a possibility for distressed farmers. However, the centrality of a 'mental health' perspective and reified notions of 'stoicism' within this discursive field operate to exclude consideration of the ways in which cultural identity is linked to emotions. To illuminate and explore complex connections between subjectivity, moral worth and affect in relation to understanding farmer suicide, this article draws on theory and literature on agrarian discourses of masculine subjectivity and shame to analyze empirical data from interviews with farmers during times of environmental, social and economic crisis. The idealized notion of the farming man as 'Aussie battler' emerges from romantic agrarian mythology in which pride and self-worth are vested in traditional values of hard work, struggle and self-sacrifice. However, the structural context of agriculture, as it is shaped by the political economy of neoliberalism, threatens farm economic viability and is eroding the pride, self-worth and masculine identity of farmers. The article suggests that the notion of the 'fallen hero' captures a discursive shift of a masculinity 'undone', a regress from the powerful position of masculine subjectivity imbued with pride to one of shame that is of central importance to understanding how suicide emerges as a possibility for farmers.

   KNOWLEDGE
AB Objective: Numerous institutions, including the World Health Organization, recommend education campaigns targeted at the general public to improve awareness of suicidal crises and, more broadly, of depression; to improve access to care; and to combat the stigma associated with these illnesses and discrimination against people who have them. The purpose of this literature review was to gather information on campaigns about depression or suicide awareness and summarize data on the impact and effectiveness of these campaigns. Methods: A search was conducted of MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, HDA (Health Development Agency) Evidence Base, DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects), and the ISI Web of Science to identify articles written in English and published between 1987 and 2007 that described depression or suicide awareness programs that targeted the public. Results: Among the 200 publications for which references were found, 43 publications that described 15 programs in eight countries met inclusion criteria. Comparing the programs was difficult because of the diversity of their objectives and the methods used to deliver the programs and to evaluate them. Results suggest that these programs contributed to a modest improvement in public knowledge of and attitudes toward depression or suicide, but most program evaluations did not assess the durability of the attitude changes. No study has clearly demonstrated that such campaigns help to increase care seeking or to decrease suicidal behavior. Conclusions: Developing guidelines for assessment of public education campaigns to improve knowledge about suicide and depression is essential for the sharing of knowledge among scientists and stakeholders.

AB The training needs of staff working in mainstream (i.e., noncrisis) health settings with client groups that have moderate levels of suicide risk have not been extensively addressed. An initiative to train rehabilitation and disability staff working in the field of traumatic brain injury TBI) is described. A program was adapted from a generic state health department training program, and disseminated by means of established training networks within the brain injury field. Program efficacy was evaluated as the training was provided across the state of Victoria in a series of 1-day workshops. Participants (n = 86) completed two evaluation measures designed for this purpose (objective knowledge test, self-rating of knowledge and skills) on three occasions (pre- and postworkshop, 6-month follow-up). Compared to a control group of rehabilitation and disability workers who did not receive the training (n = 27), the workshop participants made significant gains in objective knowledge and reported skills, and maintained these gains at the 6-month follow-up. The Suicide Interview Response Inventory-2 (Neimeyer & Pfeiffer, 1994) was administered to a subgroup of participants as a validating measure, and correlated significantly with scores from the objective knowledge test. This process may provide a template for developing more fine-grained suicide prevention strategies among other health-related at-risk groups.

   service use
SO MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
LA English
DT Article
ID CARE; AUSTRALIA; CONTACTS
AB Objective: To examine the extent to which suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are predictive of service use.
   Design and setting: The National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing considered service utilisation in relation to self-reported mental health problems. Service utilisation was inquired of in relation to hospital-based care (including both specialist mental health and general care settings), as well as consultations with a range of health professionals (both specialist and non-specialist mental health professionals, including psychiatrists, psychologists and general practitioners) on an outpatient basis.
   Participants: Secondary analysis of self-report data from 10 641 randomly selected Australian adults who participated in the National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing in 1997. The key predictor variables were reported suicidal ideation and suicide attempts over the past 12 months.
   Main outcome measures: Use of services for mental health problems (past 12 months).
   Results: When considered in isolation, individuals reporting suicidal ideation were more likely to make use of at least one type of service for mental health problems than non-suicidal individuals (OR, 17.3; 95% Cl, 13.2-22.6), and individuals reporting suicide attempts were even more likely to do so (OR, 32.3; 95% CI, 9.0-115.4). In the case of suicidal ideation, this effect remained significant after controlling for a range of potential confounders. For suicide attempts, the effect of mental health service use was no longer significant after other variables were taken into account.
   Conclusions: Suicidal individuals are likely to make use of services, and a high proportion of suicides may be preventable through appropriate healthcare system responses.

AB Aims To examine suicidal behaviour and the associated risk factors among opioid-dependent cases and non-opioid-dependent controls. Design Case-control study. Setting Sydney, Australia. Participants A total of 726 opioid-dependent cases and 399 non-opioid-dependent controls, matched on age, sex and employment status. Findings Cases had significantly higher life-time prevalence of suicidal thoughts (66% versus 55%), suicide attempts (31% versus 20%) and multiple attempts (19% versus 11%) compared to controls. Cases were significantly more likely to indicate a severe intent to die (63% versus 43%). Both cases and controls who had attempted suicide were significantly more likely than others to suffer from substance use and psychological disorders, as well as childhood maltreatment. Risk factors which predicted suicide attempts were the same among cases and controls, including screening positive for borderline personality disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and persistent suicidal thoughts. Conclusions Although controls had elevated levels of suicidal behaviour compared to those seen in general population surveys, the prevalence of suicidal behaviour among cases was still much higher. Although opioid dependence was related to suicidal behaviour, it did not make a unique contribution to the risk of suicide attempts over and above the other risk factors identified.

TI Prevalence and Correlates of Suicidal Thoughts and Suicide Attempts in

AB Objectives:
   The main objectives of the paper were (1) to examine the prevalence of suicidality in a large community-based chronic pain sample taking prescribed opioids for chronic pain; and (2) to examine general and pain-specific factors that predict such ideation, and the transition from ideation to making a suicide attempt (ideation-to-action).
   Materials and Methods:
   Baseline data from the Pain and Opioids IN Treatment (POINT) study with a cohort of 1514 community-based people prescribed opioids for chronic noncancer pain across Australia.
   Results:
   Past 12-month suicidal ideation was reported by 36.5% of the cohort and 16.4% had made a lifetime suicide attempt (2.5% in the last 12 mo), after the onset of their pain condition. Suicidal ideation in the past 12 months was independently associated with a past suicide attempt [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=4.82; 95% confidence interval, 2.43-9.56] and past 12-month depression (AOR=4.07, 95% confidence interval, 1.88-8.78). Only a lower pain self-efficacy score was independently associated with past 12-month ideation-to-action (AOR=0.98, 95%CI0.88-0.99). Notably, only general-suicide risk factors were associated with 12-month suicidal ideation; but for past year ideation-to-action, pain-specific factors also had independent associations.
   Discussion:
   The study is one of the first to comprehensively examine general and pain-specific risk factors for suicidality in a large chronic pain sample in which suicidal ideation was common. A low pain self-efficacy score was the only factor independently associated past 12-month ideation-to-action.

TI Evaluating the effectiveness of a website about masculinity and suicide
   to prompt help-seeking
SO HEALTH PROMOTION JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
LA English

DE health behaviours; mass media; men's health; mental health
ID MEN; GENDER
AB Issue addressed A website was designed to form the core of a multimedia strategy surrounding the Man Up documentary - a three-part documentary that aimed to address the problem of male suicide in Australia. Together these formed a media-based, public health intervention that explored the link between masculinity and suicide and promoted help-seeking. This is of great importance given the demonstrated link between masculine norms, men's reduced help-seeking and suicidal thinking. This study assesses the website's effectiveness in facilitating help-seeking and fostering conversations about suicide, mental health and help-seeking. Help-seeking indicators included website clicks to helping organisations, downloads of health information from the website and request for help received via emails. Methods Google Analytics data, emails to the Man Up team received through the website and open-ended responses to an online survey were analysed. Results The website reached 43 140 users. Indictors of help-seeking activity on the website included 307 outbound clicks to helping organisations and 802 downloads of health information. Qualitative analysis of emails received and responses to the survey demonstrated that Man Up's messages resonated with viewers and provided further evidence of help-seeking. Conclusion The findings demonstrate that the website provided an important opportunity for people to engage with Man Up and seek help. So what? Media-based public health interventions offer enormous potential to provide suicide prevention interventions and promote help-seeking. The website evaluation findings provide insight into the ways in which websites can be used as part of a multimedia strategy to address the problem of male suicide.

TI Relationship of suicide rates with climate and economic variables in

AB Background: It is well known that suicidal rates vary considerably among European countries and the reasons for this are unknown, although several theories have been proposed. The effect of economic variables has been extensively studied but not that of climate.
   Methods: Data from 29 European countries covering the years 2000-2012 and concerning male and female standardized suicidal rates (according to WHO), economic variables (according World Bank) and climate variables were gathered. The statistical analysis included cluster and principal component analysis and categorical regression.
   Results: The derived models explained 62.4 % of the variability of male suicidal rates. Economic variables alone explained 26.9 % and climate variables 37.6 %. For females, the respective figures were 41.7, 11.5 and 28.1 %. Male suicides correlated with high unemployment rate in the frame of high growth rate and high inflation and low GDP per capita, while female suicides correlated negatively with inflation. Both male and female suicides correlated with low temperature.
   Discussion: The current study reports that the climatic effect (cold climate) is stronger than the economic one, but both are present. It seems that in Europe suicidality follows the climate/temperature cline which interestingly is not from south to north but from south to north-east. This raises concerns that climate change could lead to an increase in suicide rates. The current study is essentially the first successful attempt to explain the differences across countries in Europe; however, it is an observational analysis based on aggregate data and thus there is a lack of control for confounders.

Few studies report the longitudinal associations between these phenomena and clinical and functional outcomes. This study examined whether prior suicide attempts predict poorer outcomes in mental health service attendees.
   Methods: Clinical and functional data from 1143 individuals (aged 12-30) attending a primary care-based mental health service in Australia were collected over 3-60 months (median = 21 months). Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals for the effect of a prior suicide attempt on follow-up outcomes were estimated (adjusted for confounders).
   Results: Prior suicide attempts were common (n = 164; 14%) and prospectively associated with suicidal thoughts (OR = 1.71), suicide attempts (OR = 2.59), self-harm (OR = 1.71), an increased likelihood of being diagnosed with bipolar disorder (OR = 2.99), and the onset of an alcohol/substance use disorder (OR = 2.87). Over the course of care, no suicide attempts were reported in 1052 (92%) individuals, but 25 (2%) had recurrent attempts, and 66 (6%) had new onset of an attempt. New onset was associated with being female and previous suicidal ideation or self-harm; recurrent attempts were associated with being older and comorbid alcohol/substance use disorder.
   Limitations: The cohort includes only individuals who remained in clinical contact, and the consistency of their documentation varied (across clinicians and over time).
   Conclusions: Young people with prior suicide attempts are vulnerable to ongoing suicidal behaviours, and poorer clinical and functional outcomes. More intensive management strategies may be needed to directly address these behaviours and the long-term risks they confer. These behaviours also emerge over the course of care among those with no previous history, which has important implications for active service-level strategies that target these behaviours for all of those who present to such services.

AB Objectives Root cause analysis (RCA) is the model of accident investigation mandated by the New South Wales Ministry of Health in Australia to review all serious incidents. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the RCA model is not suitable for reviewing adverse events in mental health services such as suicides and homicides. The aims of the research were to evaluate the impact of RCA on improving patient outcomes in a regional mental health service in New South Wales, Australia, and to discover whether the RCA model is the most appropriate model in mental health.
   Methods The literature on RCA was reviewed. The effectiveness of implementation of RCA recommendations was evaluated using quantitative and qualitative data.
   Results Suicides and homicides, which constitute 90% of serious critical incidents in mental health, do not always lend themselves well to identification of a root cause. There is evidence for low clinician engagement in the recommendations that arise from RCAs and a poor level of evidence that implementation of RCA recommendations results in safer patient care. Most troubling is the finding that RCAs frequently make recommendations that repeat existing policy or previous recommendations.
   Conclusions Although the RCA model offers a formal and systematic approach to the review of serious critical incidents in mental health, it is not the model of best fit. Only 65% of recommendations made through RCA reviews are implemented within 12 months.

AB Purpose To identify occupations and socio-economic groups with detrimental or protective effect on suicide mortality. Methods For every occupation and economic activity/industry, we computed directly age-standardized mortality rates (DSRs) using the age structure of the European population (2010) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for suicide using national cause-specific mortality rates. We further stratified analyses by socio-economic variables, job-skill level, and by three calendar periods (1990-1998/1999-2006/2007-2014). Results The study sample comprised 5,834,618 participants (94,918,456 person-years). The highest DSRs were observed among unemployed/job-seeking group, in agricultural, fishery and related male workers, and in health and social activities female workers. The lowest DSRs were observed in real estate and renting, research and development, IT and other business activities in men and in agriculture, hunting and forestry industry in women. A consistent reduction in DSRs across three calendar periods was observed in men. In female corporate managers, DSRs increased over the 2007-2014 period compared with 1999-2006. Compared to general working-age population, unemployed/job-seeking people, manufacturing labourers, personal care and related workers, and motor vehicle drivers of both sexes were identified at risk of suicide. Moreover, an excess of suicide was observed among male material recording and transport clerks; nursing and midwife-associated professionals; and agricultural workers as well as among female writers and performing artists. Conclusions The findings suggest the detrimental effect of low socioeconomic positions, including unemployment, with respect to suicide mortality and a relationship between suicide and poor psychosocial working conditions in elementary occupations. Sex-specific results need further investigation.

AB Introduction: An increasing demand for physicians' involvement in lifeending decisions has led to extensive debate on euthanasia and right-todie issues by social, political and medical groups. The Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care commissioned an evaluation of the need to educate undergraduate medical students on suicide prevention, euthanasia and life-ending issues. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted on samples of medical school coordinators, medical students and general practitioners (GPs). Key academics in Curriculum and/or Accreditation Committees from 10 of 15 Australian Medical Schools (AMS) participated in a survey on the possible implementation of suicide prevention, euthanasia and lifeending issues in undergraduate courses. Medical students (n = 373) were asked to rate their attitude toward the same issues. Twenty-four GPs from six different states (rural/urban environments) were asked to rate the level of importance of a specific curriculum on suicide prevention, euthanasia and life-ending issues. Results: Medical students showed high interest in learning about euthanasia and life-ending issues (76.8%), quality of life and quality of death (85.1%), and different types of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (70%). They reported that physicians should be involved in ending-life decisions (89%). Forty per cent of AMS thought education on euthanasia and life-ending issues was essential. Fifty-four per cent of GPs considered education in euthanasia and related issues a high priority. Discussion: The increasing aging population and the high prevalence of chronic illness call for a growing involvement of physicians in this difficult area of medical practice. Globally, the need for undergraduate education on these matters is perceived as important and urgent.

AB Objective Male farmers in Australia have an elevated risk of suicide. The aims of this study were to investigate the rate of mental health problems amongst farmers compared with non-farmer rural residents and to investigate what additional factors might contribute to an increased risk of suicide amongst farmers. Method This study used a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches. First, using self-report questionnaire data, we compared rates of mental health problems (a common correlate of suicide) and a number of personality measures between farmers (n= 371) and non-farming rural residents (n= 380). In addition, semi-structured interviews with farmers (n= 32) were used to gain a richer understanding of how the context of farming and mental health interact. Results Five key findings emerged from the study. First, in the quantitative study, we found no support for the proposition that farmers experience higher rates of mental health problems than do non-farmer rural residents, but we identified potentially important personality differences between farmers and non-farmers, with levels of conscientiousness being significantly higher amongst farmers and levels of neuroticism being significantly lower. A strong association between maleness and farming was also found. In the qualitative study, participants indicated that farming is an environment in which individuals experienced a range of stressors but have limited capacity to acknowledge or express these. In addition, there appeared to be significant attitudinal barriers to seeking help for those who may have mental health problems, particularly male farmers. Conclusion The elevated rate of suicide amongst farmers does not seem to be simply explained by an elevated rate of mental health problems. Individual personality, gender and community attitudes that limit a person's ability to acknowledge or express mental health problems and seek help for these may be significant risk factors for suicide in farmers.

AB This brief overview of psychological research with indigenous people of Australia attempts to apprehend the broad, underlying narratives of previous research in terms of its sociopolitical aims. It then considers the debate about whether the moral precept of social responsibility is compatible with scientific values that underpin psychological research, and argues that a socially responsible psychology is one that engages in self-reflection on its biases and prejudices, methodologies, and systems of ethics. Each of these self-reflective goals is analysed in turn, with a view to establishing dialogue between non-indigenous researchers and practitioners and Indigenous people about the role a socially responsible psychology might have in contemporary Indigenous society.

AB Background: Suicide death rates in Australia are higher in rural than urban communities however the contributors to this difference remain unclear. Geographical differences in suicidal ideation and attempts were explored using two datasets encompassing urban and rural community residents to examine associations between socioeconomic, demographic and mental health factors. Differing patterns of association between psychiatric disorder and suicidal ideation and attempts as geographical remoteness increased were investigated.
   Methods: Parallel cross-sectional analyses were undertaken using data from the 2007 National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (2007-NSMHWB, n = 8,463), under-representative of remote and very remote residents, and selected participants from the Australian Rural Mental Health Study (ARMHS, n = 634), over-representative of remote and very remote residents. Uniform measures of suicidal ideation and attempts and mental disorder using the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI-3.0) were used in both datasets. Geographic region was classified into major cities, inner regional and other. A series of logistic regressions were undertaken for the outcomes of 12-month and lifetime suicidal ideation and lifetime suicide attempts, adjusting for age, gender and psychological distress. A sub-analysis of the ARMHS sample was undertaken with additional variables not available in the 2007-NSMHWB dataset.
   Results: Rates and determinants of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts across geographical region were similar. Psychiatric disorder was the main determinant of 12-month and lifetime suicidal ideation and lifetime suicide attempts across all geographical regions. For lifetime suicidal ideation and attempts, marital status, employment status, perceived financial adversity and mental health service use were also important determinants. In the ARMHS sub-analysis, higher optimism and better perceived infrastructure and service accessibility tended to be associated with a lower likelihood of lifetime suicidal ideation, when age, gender, psychological distress, marital status and mental health service use were taken into account.
   Conclusions: Rates and determinants of suicidal ideation and attempts did not differ according to geographical location. Psychiatric disorder, current distress, employment and financial adversity remain important factors associated with suicidal ideation and attempts across all regions in Australia. Regional characteristics that influence availability of services and lower personal optimism may also be associated with suicidal ideation in rural communities.

ID DEATHS
AB A retrospective study was undertaken of all cases of death due to suicidal electrocution in Sydney, Australia between 1996 and 2005. A total of 25 cases were identified with 20 cases (80%) as a result of direct attachment to an electrical outlet and five cases (20%) as a result of immersion in a body of water with an electrical appliance. Twenty of the 25 individuals were men (mean age = 57 years, range 22-90) and five were women (mean age 67, range 53-88). At least 35% of decedents were either currently working or had worked as electricians. Electrical timers had been used in eight (32%) cases, the fuse blown in one case, but the remaining 16 (64%) bodies were "live" on arrival of witnesses or electricity personnel. This study demonstrates the phenomenon of electrical suicide as a regular occurrence in Sydney. We highlight the need for investigators and emergency workers to remain vigilant upon discovery of electrical suicides, due to the fact that most bodies remain electrically active after death.

AB ObjectiveTo undertake a systematic review of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) prevalence, patterns, functions, and behavioural correlates for the Indigenous populations of Australia (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders) and New Zealand (NZ; Maori).
   MethodWe searched the following electronic databases: PubMed, MedLine, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, PsycInfo, and PsycArticles, CINAHL, and the Informit Health and Indigenous Peoples collections. Studies were included for review if they were published within the last 25 years and reported on NSSI in Australia and NZ's Indigenous populations.
   ResultsSeven studies were included, six of which came from Australia. The prevalence of NSSI in Australia ranged from 0.9% up to 22.50%; statistics varied by the different samples, types of prevalence, and relationship to alcohol. Several studies found that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples had higher rates of NSSI than other Australians, but that this was not significantly higher. Two studies indicated that NSSI was linked to alcohol use, incarceration, and a younger age. The one NZ study was of injury and not specifically NSSI.
   ConclusionsFindings are limited due to a small pool of literature. Cultural variations in NSSI presentation should be considered when working with Indigenous populations. Further research is required to help determine what cultural variations may exist.

AB Objective To describe the trends in suicide and emergency department (ED) visits for self-harm in youth by immigration status and immigrant characteristics.
   Design Population-based longitudinal cohort study from 1996 to 2012 using linked health and administrative datasets.
   Setting Ontario, Canada.
   Participants Youth 10 to 24 years, living in Ontario, Canada.
   Exposure The main exposure was immigrant status (recent immigrant (RI) versus long-term residents (LTR)). Secondary exposures included region of birth, duration or residence, and refugee status.
   Main outcome measure Trends over time in suicide and ED self-harm were modelled within consecutive 3-year time periods. Rate ratios were estimated using Poisson regression models.
   Results 2.5 to 2.9 million individuals were included per cohort period. LTR suicide rates ranged from 7.4 to 9.4/100 000 male person-years versus 2.2-3.4/100 000 females. RI's suicide rates were 2.7-7.2/100,000 male versus 1.9-2.7/100 000 female person-years. Suicide rates were lower among RI compared with LTR (adjusted relative rate (aRR)=0.70, 95% CI=0.57 to 0.85) with different mechanisms of suicide. No significant time trend in suicide rates was observed (p=0.40). ED self-harm rates for LTR and RI were highest in females (2.6-3.4/1000 LTR females versus 1.1-1.5/1000 males, 1.2-1.8/1000 RI females versus 0.4-0.6/1000 males). RI had lower rates of self-harm compared with LTR (aRR=0.60, 95% CI=0.56 to 0.65). Stratum-specific rates showed a steeper decline per period in RI compared with LTR (RI: aRR=0.85, 95% CI=0.81 to 0.89; LTR: aRR=0.91, 95% CI=0.90 to 0.93). Observed trends were not universal across region of origin and by refugee status.
   Interpretation Suicide rates have been stable and ED self-harm rates are declining over time among RI youth. These trends by important subgroups should continue to be monitored to allow for early identification of subpopulations of immigrant youth in need of targeted and culturally appropriate public health interventions.

AB Droughts may increase the risk of mental health problems, but evidence suggests a complex story with some groups being vulnerable while others are not. Previous studies from Australia have found associations with suicide, depression and distress that vary by age, gender and remoteness. Understanding the effects of drought on mental health is important because drought is predicted to be more intense in some areas in the future. We investigated the associations between drought and distress in a survey of rural Australians by age, gender and farming status. We collected distress data using a survey of 5312 people from across the state of Victoria, Australia, in 2015. Respondents completed the Kessler 10 (K10) Psychological Distress Index, and demographic and general health data were collected. We linked a climatic drought index to the locality of residence of respondents. Associations between distress and drought were analyzed using multivariable regression models with interactions by age, gender and farming occupation. Parts of Victoria were in drought in 2015. Drought duration was associated with higher distress in younger rural women (aged 40-54: odds ratio 1.18 per inter-quartile range increase in drought duration) but not older rural women or men. This pattern did not vary between farmers and non-farmers. Drought was associated with increased distress, but this differed between subgroups. Our results suggest that supporting younger women may be particularly important, and understanding ways older Australian rural women cope may enable us to build adaptive capacity and resilience.

AB Glyphosate surfactant (GlySH) is a commonly used herbicide that has been used in attempted suicide. Most reports of GlySH toxicity in patients have followed ingestion of the commercial product "Round-up" (Monsanto Ltd: Melbourne, Victoria, Australia), which consists of a mixture of glyphosate (as a iso-propylanine salt) and a surfactant (polyoxyethyleneamine). Ingestion of Round-up is reported to cause significant toxicity including nausea, vomiting, oral and abdominal pain. Renal and hepatic impairment and pulmonary oedema may also occur. Impaired consciousness and encephalopathy have been reported as sequelae but there are limited data on the central nervous system (CNS) effects of Round-up toxicity. We report a 71-year-old male who attempted suicide with GlySH and developed a prolonged but reversible encephalopathy suggestive of acute CNS toxicity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A recent study in Western Australia identified area level associations between soil salinisation and hospital admissions for depression. Our study assessed the quantitative relationship between mental health measures at the individual level and location specific environmental measurements on salinity, as well as two other indicators of environmental degradation and change: land surface temperature and normalised difference vegetation index, a proxy for rainfall. Location-specific environmental measurements were linked to individual mental health scores of women in three age cohorts from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health using a geographic information system. Bayesian geostatistical linear regression models were developed to assess associations between environmental exposures and mental health scores of women. In contrast to previous studies using area level measures, our study found no associations between individual level measurements of mental health scores for women in south-west Western Australia and salinity, LST or NDVI.

AB Introduction: Public health organizations have recommended restricted access and safe storage practices as means to reduce firearm injuries and deaths. We aimed to assess the effect of four firearm restrictions on firearm deaths in Norway 1969-2009. Methods: All deaths due to firearm discharge were included (5,660 deaths, both sexes). The statistical analysis to assess impact of firearm legislations was restricted to males because of the sex disproportionality (94% were males). Results: A total of 89% of firearm deaths (both sexes) were classified as suicide, 8% as homicide, and 3% as unintentional (accident). During the past four decades, male accidental firearm death rates were reduced significantly by 90%. Male firearms suicide rates increased from 1969 to 1991 by 166%, and decreased by 62% from 1991 to 2009. Despite the great reduction in male accidental firearm deaths, we were unable to demonstrate effects of the laws. In contrast, we found that a 1990 regulation, requiring a police permit before acquiring a shotgun, had a beneficial impact on suicide in the total sample and in those aged 15-34 years. Male firearm homicides decreased post-2003 regulation regarding storing home guard weapons in private homes. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that two laws could have contributed to reduce male firearm mortality. It is, however, a challenge to measure the role of four firearm restrictions. The null findings are inconclusive, as they may reflect no true impact or study limitations.

AB Education is state-run in Australia, and within each of the eight states and territories there are both government and independent schooling systems. This paper details the position of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (GLBTIQ) students within Australian education policy documents nationally, focusing on the three largest states and educational sectors in Australia. Survey data are used to report on the schooling experiences of over 3000 Australian GLBTIQ young people aged 14-21 years. Data from interviews with key policy informants identify both the obstacles to implementing policies, and how such obstacles have been overcome. Much official policy sees sexuality education as promoting inclusive, protective and affirming messages around GLBTIQ students. There exist significant correlations between policy and a variety of well-being and psycho-social outcomes for GLBTIQ students, including lowered incidence of homophobic abuse and suicide, and the creation of supportive school environments. Ideal policy visions are outlined, along with practical recommendations of relevance to a variety of stakeholders.

AB Low numbers of hospital-based psychiatric beds create problems for people with severe mental illness (SMI), when they face extended emergency department (ED) waits, higher thresholds for admission to an acute bed, and short revolving-door stays with high rates of rehospitalisation. Limited access to inpatient treatment has been associated with higher suicide risk, premature mortality, homelessness, violent crime and incarceration. Ultimately, people with SMI can be transinstitutionalised to the criminal justice system. In the USA, for example, prisons have replaced mental hospitals as the largest institutions housing people with SMI. There is no international consensus on the safe minimum numbers of acute, forensic and rehabilitation beds needed to reduce these risks. As a consequence, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries have wide variations in the mix of hospital beds with an average of 71 beds per 100 000 population. Policymakers face difficult choices with few studies to guide decisions on supplying beds. The UK Royal College of Psychiatrists offered a policy framework, which was adapted for Australia. The government of the State of South Australia increased the supplies of crisis, acute and forensic beds to meet a mandatory target to safely reduce mental health boarding in the EDs.

AB Background: Suicidal behaviour and deliberate self harm are common among adolescents. Limited evidence exists regarding interventions that can reduce risk; however research indicates that maintaining contact either via letter or postcard with at-risk adults following discharge from services can reduce risk. The aim of the study is to test a postcard intervention among people aged 15-24 who presented to mental health services but are not accepted, yet are at risk of suicide.
   Methods/design: The study is a 3-year randomised controlled trial conducted at Orygen Youth Health Research Centre in Melbourne Australia. Participants are young help-seekers aged 15-24 who are at risk of suicide. Participants will be recruited over a 12 month period. The intervention comprises a regular postcard to be sent monthly for 12 months. The postcard enquires after their well being and includes information regarding individual sources of help and evidence-based self help strategies. Participants are assessed at baseline, 12 and 18 months.
   Discussion: This paper describes the development of a study which aims to reduce suicide risk in a sample of young help-seekers. If effective, this intervention could have significant clinical and research implications for a population who can be hard to treat and difficult to research.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the prevalence of attempted suspect-provoked shootings (SPS) in Victoria, Australia, and explore nonlethal tactics police officers use to resolve such incidents.
   Design/methodology/approach - A random sample of 20 percent of police-attended incidents was sourced from a police contact-based database. The narrative of each incident was coded using established criteria for "suicide-by-cop." Incidents that met the criteria were further analyzed to elucidate historical and situational characteristics. To supplement these data, operational police officers were invited to participate in a survey about particulars of an attempted SPS incident that they had attended and resolved non-fatally.
   Findings - Police are encountering these incidents up to three times a week in Victoria, Australia. While they engage in a range of tactics, police report that communication and negotiation skills are the most effective means of successful resolution.
   Research limitations/implications - Although the survey attempted to correct for the potential limitations of using administrative data for research purposes, its weakness is in the modest sample size that utilizes self-report data that may lead to recall biases. Further research would benefit from using complementary methodologies that seek to examine police tactics and elucidate decision-making processes using video-based or written vignettes.
   Practical implications - Officers' awareness of both the commonalty of this phenomenon and of the important situational characteristics may lead to greater skill and confidence in managing these.
   Originality/value - This is one of the very few published studies investigating prevalence and characteristics of attempted SPS incidents.

AB Objective: To review the content, method and process of the Australian Study of Health and Relationships (ASHR).
   Results: ASHR achieved a large sample, a high response rate and documented the sexual life histories and current sexual health-related knowledge, attitudes and practices of the Australian population aged 16-59. Its cross-sectional nature limited our ability to partition observed variation between age and time despite clear evidence of both age-related and cohort-related changes in sexual practice. Similarly, its reliance on a sample of individuals reporting on their sexual experiences rather than a sample of sexual relationships or encounters and their participants limits our ability to understand the dynamics of those relationships and encounters. Finally, our understanding of sexuality in Australia could have been improved through qualitative studies with a subsample of ASHR participants.
   Conclusion: ASHR represents a significant contribution to our understanding of sexual health-related knowledge, attitudes and practices in Australia.

AB Aims To (1) assess trends in the number and mortality rates of methamphetamine-related death in Australia, 2009-15; (2) assess the characteristics and the cause, manner and circumstances of death; and (3) assess the blood methamphetamine concentrations and the presence of other drugs in methamphetamine-related death. Design Analysis of cases of methamphetamine-related death retrieved from the National Coronial Information System (NCIS). Setting Australia. Cases All cases in which methamphetamine was coded in the NCIS database as a mechanism contributing to death (n=1649). Measurements Information was collected on cause and manner of death, demographics, location, circumstances of death and toxicology. Findings The mean age of cases was 36.9years, and 78.4% were male. The crude mortality rate was 1.03 per 100000. The rate increased significantly over time (P<0.001), and at 2015 the mortality rate was 1.8 [confidence interval (CI)=1.2-2.4] times that of 2009. Deaths were due to accidental drug toxicity (43.2%), natural disease (22.3%), suicide (18.2%), other accident (14.9%) and homicide (1.5%). In 40.8% of cases, death occurred outside the major capital cities. The median blood methamphetamine concentration was 0.17mg/l, and cases in which only methamphetamine was detected had higher concentrations than other cases (0.30 versus 0.15mg/l, P<0.001). The median blood methamphetamine concentration varied within a narrow range (0.15-0.20mg/l) across manner of death. In the majority (82.8%) of cases, substances other than methamphetamine were detected, most frequently opioids (43.1%) and hypnosedatives (38.0%). Conclusions Methamphetamine death rates doubled in Australia from 2009 to 2015. While toxicity was the most frequent cause, natural disease, suicide and accident comprised more than half of deaths.

ID CHOKING GAME; AUTOEROTIC DEATH; MENTAL-HEALTH; CHILDREN
AB Review of 69 cases of lethal asphyxia in individuals aged from 10 to 18 years was undertaken in South Australia. There were 62 cases of suicide due to hanging (89.9%) (age range 10-18 years; mean = 16.6 years; M:F = 3.4:1), 4 accidents (5.8%) (3 crush asphyxias in motor vehicle rollovers, and 1 positional asphyxia associated with marked alcohol intoxication) and 3 homicides (4.3%). In the suicide group, there were 46 whites (74.2%), 12 Aboriginal (19.4%), 3 Asians (4.8%) and 1 African (1.6%). There were no deaths due to sexual asphyxia or the "choking game". However, the percentage of Aboriginal victims was disproportionately high compared to the percentage of the population aged 10-19 years listed as Aboriginal (approximately 3%). Thus, constant monitoring of local trends in mortality will identify if new activities such as the "choking game" have emerged, and also characterize specific problems that may exist in particular communities or cultural groups.

AB BACKGROUND: Firearm injuries (FI) are the most common cause of death among military personnel. In this study, postmortem examination and autopsy records of deaths resulting from firearm injuries recorded in the Department of Forensic Medicine of Gulhane Military Medical Academy between 1993-2010 were examined retrospectively.
   METHODS: We evaluated the characteristics of 153 firearm deaths accounting for 36.6% of all medical-legal autopsies. The cases included 152 men (99.3%) and 1 woman (0.7%).
   RESULTS: The mean age of the cases was 23.1 years (+/- 4.7; range, 20-43 years). The manner of death was determined in all cases with 41.8% of cases identified as suicide and 39.9% as homicide. The most common sites of firearm entrance wounds were the head and neck region (n=109, 71.2%), the chest (n=26, 17%), or the abdomen (n=14, 9.2%). The type of firearm was not clear in most cases.
   CONCLUSION: In conclusion, complete forensic and medical records will facilitate the rapid and accurate conclusion of the legal process and will enhance future retrospective studies.

AB People with serious mental disorders (PSMDs) are overrepresented both in prison deaths and during fatal encounters with the police in the community (deaths after police contact, DAPC). To identify common factors present across cases of who died during contact with the criminal justice system in Queensland, publicly available coroners reports were analysed (N = 38). The findings of the study indicated psychosis and mood disorders were the most common diagnosis in incarcerated PSMD deaths, and suicide was the most common cause of death for incarcerated PSMDs. Within incarcerated settings, access to healthcare records, medication compliance, risk assessment and monitoring, and safe housing of at-risk prisoners may be potential areas to explore with regard to prevention. Similarly, PSMD DAPCs were more likely to be experiencing mood or psychosis disorders than other forms of mental disorder, and suicide and police shootings were the most common causes of death. In PSMD DAPC, inadequate mental health access, treatment noncompliance and comorbid substance use were included as potential areas that could direct research efforts toward prevention.

AB Aim: A considerable proportion of suicide attempts are made on impulse. However, knowledge of characteristics of impulsive attempters is still limited. The present study investigated some of these characteristics and aimed to identify the pattern (if any) of suicidal ideation before an impulsive attempt.
   Methods: Data from a randomized and stratified population of 5130 individuals from Brisbane, Australia, were analysed. Computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) were adopted to recruit subjects. Those reporting previous suicidal behaviour were sent a questionnaire by mail.
   Results: One hundred and twelve subjects reported a suicide attempt. One quarter of these described a pattern consistent with an impulsive attempt. Most impulsive attempters experienced suicidal thoughts before their attempt. They were less likely to believe that their attempt would cause death, and less likely to experience depression. Impulsive attempters did not differ significantly from non-impulsive attempters in regards to age, gender, and motivations for the attempt. Surprisingly, no differences in mean scores of trait impulsivity between impulsive and non-impulsive attempters were found. In addition, the majority of suicide attempters (whether impulsive or not) experienced the suicidal process as fluctuating and not as developing along a continuum.
   Limitations: The number of attempters who validly entered the study limited our ability to identify potential confounders. Due to the retrospective nature of the survey, the reliability of the information collected may have been affected by recall biases. In addition, as the surveys were administered by mail, it is possible that some questions may have been misinterpreted.
   Conclusions: The presence of suicidal feelings prior to an attempt constitutes an opportunity for intervention also in impulsive attempters. However, the identification of impulsiveness requires more research efforts. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Using data from a nationwide project on young people in Australia aimed at assessing suicidality in general health settings, we present a brief screening tool for suicidality (the depressive symptom index suicidality subscale). Two thousand eight hundred and fifty-one (15-24 year old) patients presenting to 247 Australian general practitioners between 1996 and 1998 were assessed. In addition to the suicide screen, patients completed the general health questionnaire-12 and the Center for Epidemiological Studies depression scale. Patients' chief complaints were taken from the summary sheets completed by their general practitioners. Using inter-item correlational and factor-analytic techniques, as well as a general approach to construct validity, we show that the measure has favorable reliability and validity characteristics. We also provide results on cut-points that may facilitate its use in clinical and research settings. Because the screen is brief, easy to use, reliable, and valid, we encourage its use to combat the vexing international health problem of suicide. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study explores associations of IQ at age 14 with adult symptoms of suicidal thoughts and attempts at age 21. Analysis was based on the Mater University Study of Pregnancy and its outcomes, an Australian prospective birth cohort study started in Brisbane Australia in 1981. We assessed associations with suicide thoughts, plans, and attempts. We used two measures of IQ: the Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices and the Wide Range Achievement Test. In multivariable analyses, there was an inverse association between Raven's IQ and suicide thoughts, plans, and attempts, but no strong evidence of an association between the WRAT3 and the three suicidal items. Specific aspects of intelligence may be associated with suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts.

AB The characteristics of people who use telephone counseling are not well understood. This secondary analysis used data from a nationally representative community survey of 8,841 Australian adults to compare callers and non-callers to telephone counseling services. Callers have a poorer clinical profile, including a higher risk of suicide, than people who do not use telephone counseling. They also use a variety of other mental health services. Repeat calls are associated with anxiety disorders, receipt of mental health care from general practitioners, and social disadvantage. All callers have a potential need for telephone counseling and further population studies that distinguish between telephone services intended to provide crisis (one-off) and ongoing counseling are warranted.

ID DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; STRESS; SUICIDE; FARMERS; INJURIES; ENGLAND;
   SATISFACTION; PREDICTORS; COMMUNITY
AB Background: Farmers experience one of the highest rates of suicide of any industry and there is growing evidence that those involved in farming are at higher risk of developing mental health problems. This article provides an overview of the literature examining mental health issues experienced by farming populations in the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States and identifies areas for further research.
   Method: A literature review (Medline, Science Direct, Ingenta, Proquest and PsychINFO) was carried out using the words 'farmers', 'agriculture', 'depression', I mental health', 'mental illness', 'stress', and 'suicide', as well as a review of relevant papers and publications known to the authors. (Papers not written in English and those published prior to 1985 were excluded.)
   Results: Fifty-two papers were identified with the majority focusing on stress and coping styles in farmers (24). A number of studies also focused on neuropsychological functioning and agricultural chemical use (7), depression (7), suicide (9), general mental health (4) and injury and mental health (1). This body of research studied male farmers, female farmers, farm workers, farming families, and young people living on farms. Research to date indicates that farmers, farm workers and their respective families face an array of stressors related to the physical environment, structure of farming families and the economic difficulties and uncertainties associated with farming which may be detrimental to their mental health.
   Conclusion: Whilst suicide rates in some groups of farmers are higher than the general population, conclusive data do not exist to indicate whether farmers and farming families experience higher rates of mental health problems compared with the non-farming community. It is clear, however, that farming is associated with a unique set of characteristics that is potentially hazardous to mental health and requires further research.

AB Objective: Bipolar disorder (BD) is one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions and is associated with high suicide risk. To explore the reasons for this link, this study examined the interaction between traumatic stress and BD polygenic risk score in relation to suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) in adolescent and young adult offspring and relatives of persons with BD (BD-relatives) compared with adolescent and young adult offspring of individuals without psychiatric disorders (controls).
   Method: Data were collected from 4 sites in the United States and 1 site in Australia from 2006 through 2012. Generalized estimating equation models were used to compare rates of ideation, attempts, and NSSI between BD-relatives (n = 307) and controls (n = 166) and to determine the contribution of demographic factors, traumatic stress exposure, lifetime mood or substance (alcohol/drug) use disorders, and BD polygenic risk score.
   Results: After adjusting for demographic characteristics and mood and substance use disorders, BD-relatives were at increased risk for suicidal ideation and attempts but not for NSSI. Independent of BD -relative versus control status, demographic factors, or mood and substance use disorders, exposure to trauma within the past year (including bullying, sexual abuse, and domestic violence) was associated with suicide attempts (p =.014), and BD polygenic risk score was marginally associated with attempts (p =.061). Importantly, the interaction between BD polygenic risk score and traumatic event exposures was significantly associated with attempts, independent of demographics, relative versus control status, and mood and substance use disorders (p =.041).
   Conclusion: BD -relatives are at increased risk for suicide attempts and ideation, especially if they are exposed to trauma and have evidence of increased genetic vulnerability.

AB The National Empowerment Project (NEP) is an innovative Aboriginal-led community-based project. Since 2012, it has been working with communities in 11 sites across Australia to develop a culturally appropriate health promotion and primary prevention intervention strategy to reduce the high rates of psychological distress and suicide among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The NEP is built around the use of localized participatory action research (PAR) processes to support communities to identify key factors negatively impacting on their lives as well as strategies for promoting well-being and building resilience. This article details the application of the PAR approach by the NEP Aboriginal community-based researchers. It provides some unique insights into how PAR facilitated communities to have a voice and the ways in which it supported important change processes at both an individual and a community level.

AB Objective Adolescent refugees encounter traumatic stressors and are at risk of developing psychosocial health problems; limited research data exist internationally. This study aims to identify health risk behaviours among adolescent refugees resettling in Western Australia and assess the feasibility of using a standardised adolescent health questionnaire for this purpose.
   Design Refugees aged 12 years and above attending a tertiary Refugee Health Service (RHS) were recruited over 12 months. Sociodemographic data were collected. Psychosocial assessments based on the 'Home, Education/Eating, Activities, Drugs, Sexuality, Suicide/mental health' (HEADSS) framework were undertaken utilising interpreters where required. Health concerns identified were managed through the RHS.
   Results A total of 122 adolescents (20 ethnicities) participated; 65% required interpreters. Median age (range) was 14 (12-17) years. Most (80%) had nuclear family separation. Almost half (49%) had a deceased/missing family member. A third (37%) had lived in refugee camps and 20% had experienced closed detention. The median time (range) since arrival in Australia was 11 (2-86) months. Every adolescent had at least one health concern identified during the psychosocial assessment. Frequency of health concerns identified in each domain were 87% for home, 66% for education, 23% for eating, 93% for activities, 5% for drugs, 88% for sexuality and 61% for suicide/mental health. Most adolescents (75%) required intervention, consisting of counselling for health risk behaviours and/or referral to health or community services.
   Conclusion It is feasible to use a standardised adolescent health questionnaire to identify health risk behaviours among a cohort of ethnically diverse adolescent refugees. Use of the questionnaire identified a large burden of psychosocial health issues requiring multidisciplinary intervention.

AB Objectives This study aimed to investigate Australian pharmacists' views about their role in physician-assisted suicide (PAS), their ethical and legal concerns and overall thoughts about PAS in pharmacy.
   Design Semistructured interviews of pharmacists incorporating a previously validated vignette and thematic analysis.
   Setting Australia (face to face or phone call).
   Participants 40 Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency registered pharmacists, majority women (65%) with varied experiences in community, hospital, industry, academia, government and other fields.
   Results Emergent themes from the interviews were: legal and logistical framework, ethical framework, training and guidance and healthcare budget. More than half the participants supported the role of pharmacists in the supply of medicines for PAS, while less than half were either against or unsure of the legislation of PAS in Australia. Shared concerns included transparency of prescribing practices and identification of authorised physicians involved in PAS, which were consistent with existing literature. Religious faith, emotion and professional autonomy were key indicators for the implementation of conscientious objection to the supply of medicines in PAS. Re-evaluation of current guidelines, pharmacist training and government reimbursement was also of significance from participants' perspectives.
   Conclusion This study revealed current concerns of practising pharmacists in Australia, including previously undocumented perspectives on the pharmacoeconomic impact of and barriers relating to PAS. The need for training of all healthcare professionals involved, the provision of clear guidelines, including regulation around storage, administration and disposal of medicines dispensed for PAS and the updating of current therapeutic guidelines around end-of-life care were all issues delineated by this study. These findings highlighted the need for current and future policies to account for all stakeholders involved in PAS, not solely prescribers.

AB This paper examines the mental wellbeing of children of Australian migrants. Migration can be viewed as a natural experiment in which persons of one culture have their beliefs, values and behaviours challenged by the host culture. Such a process could be expected to lead to impaired mental health amongst migrants and their children. This paper investigates the relationship between migrants' region of origin, length of stay in Australia and indicators of impaired mental health. The data were taken from the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy (MUSP). a longitudinal study of mothers and children which started in Brisbane, Australia, in 1981. The study comprises a cohort of over 5.000 women interviewed at their first ante-natal clinic visit and followed up at 3-5 days, six months, 5 and 14 years after the baby was born. Results showed no significant differences between the mental health of 'second generation' children and their Australian counterparts. Length of stay in Australia was not associated with internalising symptoms (anxiety and depression). There was a positive association, however, between the length of stay in Australia and increased externalising problems (aggression and delinquency) amongst the children at both 5- and 14-years follow-up. We conclude that children of migrants do not differ from comparable children of Australian-born parents in their mental health. Children of migrant parents have fewer symptoms of some behaviour problems in the years after their arrival in Australia. but these rates increase to the Australian level over time.

AB A majority of patients with cancer have been reported to endorse euthanasia and physician assisted suicide (PAS) in general and a substantial proportion endorse these for themselves. However, the potential influence of mental health and other clinical variables on these decisions is not well understood. This study of 228 outpatients attending an oncology clinic in Newcastle, Australia used a cross-sectional design and logistic regression modelling to examine the relationship of demographic, disease status, mental health and quality of life variables to attitudes toward euthanasia and PAS. The majority reported support for euthanasia (79%, n = 179), for PAS (69%, n = 158) and personal support for euthanasia/PAS (68%, n = 156). However, few reported having asked their doctor for euthanasia (2%, n = 5) or PAS (2%, n = 5). Three outcomes were modelled: support for euthanasia was associated with active religious belief (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.21, 95% Cl: 0.10-0.46); support for PAS was associated with active religious belief (AOR 0.359 95%CI:18-0.70) and recent pain (AOR 0.87, 95% Cl: 0.0.76-0.99); and personal support for euthanasia/PAS was associated with active religious belief (AOR 0.26, 95% Cl: 0.14-0.48). Depression, anxiety, recent suicidal ideation, and lifetime suicide attempt were not independently associated with any of the three outcomes modelled. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB ObjectiveThe suicide rate for Queensland's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people is over four times that of their non-Indigenous counterparts, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children (under 15) dying by suicide at 12 times the non-Indigenous rate. There is a need for interventions that are culturally validated and community-endorsed. The aim of this article is to describe the design and implementation of a group-based intervention, as well to report the results of the various qualitative and quantitative measures.
   MethodSixty-one Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons aged 11-21 years completed a social-emotional wellbeing (SEWB) program at headspace Inala. Data were available through to 2-month follow-up for 49 participants. The program was designed and delivered in collaboration with the local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community.
   ResultsThere was a statistically significant decrease in suicidal ideation experienced by the participants after completing the program. Qualitative measures indicated that participants experienced improved understanding of holistic health and an increased number of coping skills.
   ConclusionsNot only was this the first evaluated intervention in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth to ever report a decrease in individual suicidality, the program was carefully designed and implemented in consultation with community in a culturally sensitive manner and thus provides an invaluable framework for future SEWB work.

AB The article traces the far-flung descendants of George Keats, brother of the poet. In the nineteenth century a middle-class group emerged, tilting upward educationally and professionally. A matriarchy of sorts included strong women whose brothers and sons often struggled. Patterns of alcoholism, homosexuality, and suicide were evident, albeit not provably genetic. A dominant theme is the Keats' peripatetic nature, as they moved to America, Spain, Australia, and a dozen other countries pursuing opportunities. Only one family remains in London, with the largest cluster in California.

AB Objectives: This study aimed to identify rates and correlates of psychotropic drug utilization in children and adolescents in inpatient and outpatient settings.
   Methods: A retrospective chart review examined 122 inpatient and 126 outpatient charts from a metropolitan child and youth mental health service in Brisbane, Australia.
   Results: Inpatients received more psychotropic medication than outpatients (71% vs. 25%; p < 0.01). Patients receiving medication were older, had longer hospital admissions, and more complex presentations, including history of abuse or suicide attempts and more diagnoses (all p < 0.01). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were the most frequently used drug class (44% inpatients; 14% outpatients), primarily indicated for mood disorders (31%). SSRIs and newer antidepressants (ADs) were used more frequently in patients with a high suicide risk (p < 0.01). Atypical antipsychotics (APs) were also used (inpatients 23%; outpatients 3%), primarily for behavioral disturbances. Half of those receiving medication (51%) received polypharmacy (> 1 concurrent drug), with up to four drugs used at one time. Rates of polypharmacy were highest among patients receiving antipsychotics.
   Conclusions: Use of psychotropic medication is frequent in this population. Future research should initially focus on inpatients and intensive treatment settings and examine both safety and efficacy of interventions for depression in young people, atypical antipsychotics for behavioral disturbances, and polypharmacy.

AB Climate Change and severe drought conditions are having a strong and pervasive effect on Australia's farming community. Australia has long been stereotyped as a nation of people who persevere to overcome hardship, but the psychological consequences of living and working on drought-stricken properties has pushed many farming families to breaking point. This chapter focuses on the negative impact that drought-related stress is having on Australian farmers' intimate relationships. After first considering the nature of the Australian farming community, the chapter identifies key stressors that contribute to relationship distress in this population. The impact of stress on fanning couples is discussed and potential risk factors are identified. The chapter also presents some suggested therapeutic goals to improve farming relationships and briefly discusses issues that couples need to be mindful of when navigating through possible separation. The chapter concludes with a collection of web sites and references that list support services for Australian fanning families living with the stress of extended drought conditions.

AB The Suicide Ridge Barren Breccia Pipe (similar to 1527 +/- 4 Ma) is one of numerous breccia occurrences that characterize the Cloncurry district, Australia. Interest in breccia systems in the Cloncurry district is related to their possible link with iron oxide copper-gold deposits. The Suicide Ridge Barren Breccia Pipe is temporally and spatially associated with a granite that outcrops at its southwestern boundary and which is ascribed to the Williams and Naraku magmatic event (ca. 1550-1500 Ma). The breccia is characterized by clasts of variable dimensions, degree of rounding and composition that includes dominant calc-silicate clasts of the Corella Formation that underlie rocks of the Soldiers Cap Group that host the pipe, indicating a dominant upward transport of the fragments. Other breccia fragments include granite bodies characterized by albite-quartz mineralogy and textures typical of the magmatic-hydrothermal transition. These rocks are interpreted to have formed in a fractionated granite carapace during the exsolution and accumulation of volatiles associated with the cooling magma. Two dominant types of inclusions have been identified at the Suicide Ridge Barren Breccia Pipe. These include early primary and pseudosecondary carbonic fluid inclusions, observed only in magmatic-hydrothermal transitional textures of granite breccia clasts, and secondary sodic (-calcic) brine inclusions that occur in all the collected samples. Variable homogenization temperatures in the primary and pseudosecondary pure CO2 fluid inclusions indicate that they were trapped under different pressure conditions. Pressures estimated from the primary CO2 fluid inclusions suggest that they were trapped at 4.2 kbar, at least 1 kbar above the inferred lithostatic pressure. This likely represents the overpressuring produced by release of CO2-rich volatiles during the crystallization of magma and which ultimately caused the subsequent brecciation. Estimated pressures for pseudosecondary CO2 fluid inclusions indicate pressure entrapment conditions around 2.7 kbar, similar to the lithostatic pressure and 1.5 kbar lower than pressures recorded by type la fluid inclusions. This significant drop of pressure likely represents the sudden pressure depression occurring in response to brecciation. Evidence from field relationships, breccia characteristics, mineralogy and textures of granite clasts within the pipe and fluid inclusion studies support an origin of the Suicide Ridge Barren Breccia Pipe in response to overpressuring generated by the release, expansion and possibly phase separation of fluids of dominant carbonic composition from a crystallizing magma beneath and adjacent to the pipe. Sodic (-calcic) fluid inclusions represent a later influx of fluids in the breccia system that produced widespread albitization. Significantly, high temperature, ultrasaline multisolid fluid inclusions abundant in IOCG deposits and considered to be samples of the mineralizing fluid were not observed at the Suicide Ridge Breccia Pipe. Their absence in the barren systems suggests that they were critical for the formation of IOCG deposits. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID BLUE LIGHTS; INSTALLATION
AB Objective To assess the impact of the "Pause. Call. Be Heard" campaign on help-seeking and suicidal behaviors within rail environment in Victoria, Australia. Methods An anonymous online survey was conducted to measure noticeability of and engagement with the campaign and help-seeking intentions and behaviors among rail commuters at 10 rail stations. We generated descriptive statistics to report these data and used logistic regression models to examine the association between campaign-related factors and help-seeking. Changes in Lifeline crisis calls and rail suicide behaviors from precampaign to campaign periods were examined using proportion tests. Results About 25% of rail commuters noticed the campaign and rated the materials as "moderately noticeable." Over half of these individuals correctly identified the campaign intentions and 75% engaged with the materials. Approximately 80% indicated that the materials increased their help-seeking intentions and about half indicated that they had engaged with help-seeking and/or self-caring behaviors. Engaging with the campaign was positively associated with help-seeking. A significant increase in crisis calls but not in suicide-related calls, and a nonsignificant decrease in rail suicidal behaviors were found during the campaign period. Conclusions Continued implementation of the campaign is warranted as it showed some desirable effects on help-seeking among rail commuters.

AB Objective: To investigate sociodemographic variation in antidepressant utilisation.
   Design and setting: Cross-sectional analysis of antidepressant prescription under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in Australia, 2003-2005.
   Main outcome measures: Antidepressant utilisation (defined daily dose/1000/day) by sex, age, socioeconomic status (SES) and geographical area.
   Results: Total antidepressant utilisation increased with age. Among those aged >= 15 years, female utilisation was about double that of males. About half of antidepressant utilisation was accounted for by sertraline, venlafaxine, citalopram, and paroxetine. SES differentials in antidepressant utilisation changed across age groups for males and females: among those aged <= 19 years, total antidepressant utilisation was significantly less in lower SES groups (P < 0.001); there was no relationship to SES among 20-29-year-olds; and among those aged >= 30 years, antidepressant utilisation was significantly higher in lower SES groups (P < 0.001). SES differences were attenuated after adjusting for urban or rural residence, but remained statistically significant. Antidepressant utilisation rates were highest in regional centres.
   Conclusion: Antidepressant utilisation in Australia partially reflects sociodemographic differences in the prevalence of affective disorder. Discrepancies between treatment provision and treatment need suggest that not all social strata in Australia have equal access to these treatments.

DT Review

ID MEDIA GUIDELINES; HONG-KONG; AUSTRALIA; PERSPECTIVES; STIGMA; RISK
AB Introduction. - After more than 50 years of dedicated research, media coverage of suicide is now well known to have a significant influence on the suicide epidemiology. This influence is supposed to result from two opposite effects. The Werther effect (WE) refers to the robust increase of suicide rates following the publication of a suicide story. This specific kind of mass cluster implies a suggestion process, i.e. imitation of the depicted death by vulnerable persons. In contract, the preventive potential of medias has been labeled the "Papageno effect" (PE). Although more recently discovered and far less known, PE predicts that journalists can help prevent suicidal behaviors beyond a simple WE reduction. Because PE and WE directly bridge journalistic productions to suicidal events, several national and international health organisms (including the World Health Organization) started to see the media as new prevention opportunities. In this paper, we intend to assess the extent to which journalists can be considered as public health actors in the specific field of suicide prevention.
   Methods. - Based on a critical review of the so-called Media effect studies, we explore the opportunities, limits and constraints of collaborating with media professionals for public health actions. For that purpose, we focus on the main strategy employed so far, namely providing recommendations for more cautious coverage of suicide. An overview of the efficacy of these recommendations serves not only as a starting point for understanding how public health and journalistic perspectives can confront, but also how they can be combined in a fertile way.
   Results. - Numerous suicide prevention organisms developed strategies in order to assist journalists in reporting suicide stories in a safer way. As a formal support to these strategies, around 30 national or international guides have been produced around the word, with the shared aim of reducing WE and, eventually, promoting PE. The recommendations about articles' style and content that compose these guides were shown to be similar across the countries. They mostly meet public health concerns, rest on the available knowledge about the two effects' determinants and thus advocate for a less quantitatively and qualitatively prominent coverage. However, the way the guides were produced and implemented shows considerable variations. While most countries solely edited and/or distributed the recommendations with no complementary measures, several organisms associated their publication with promotion actions towards the journalists and general public. Evidence for the impact of the guides' publication on suicide rates, although encouraging, are seriously limited by methodological considerations. As a consequence, their efficacy is more often assessed in terms of media compliance to the recommendations. The extent to which media items respect the guidelines depends considerably on the way journalists are invited - or not - to resort to them. While the strategy seems inefficient when limited to a simple publication, the quality of suicide portrayal significantly improves when the guides are part of a whole prevention campaign dealing with suicide coverage. Moreover the journalist's implication at each step of the process seems a crucial point for its success.
   Discussion. - Media professionals are submitted to their own codes, constraints and missions which do not necessarily fit with public health concerns. If considered as prescriptions to reduce the suicide rates, journalists might see recommendations for a more cautious coverage to be a threat to their independence, thus accounting for their non-compliance. On the other hand, a real collaborative approach based on shared skills and knowledge could help sensitize journalists to a responsibility that PE and WE inevitably give them. Under these conditions, recommendations can become a precious resource to help media professional when facing a sensitive issue and finally contribute to fight against suicide.

AB Background: There is an increasing interest in engaging people with lived experience in suicide prevention research. However, young people with suicidal thoughts have been described as a "hard-to-include" population due to time, distance, stigma, and social barriers.
   Objective: This study aims to investigate whether conducting synchronous Web conferencing technology-based online focus groups (W-OFGs) is a feasible method to engage young people with lived experience of suicidal thoughts in suicide prevention research.
   Methods: Young people aged between 16 and 25 years and living in Sydney, Australia, were recruited through flyers, emails, and social media advertisements. The W-OFGs were established using a Web conferencing technology called GoToMeeting. Participants' response rate, attendance, and feedback of the W-OFGs were analyzed to determine whether the W-OFG system is feasible for suicide prevention research. Researchers' reflections about how to effectively implement the W-OFGs were also reported as part of the results.
   Results: In the pre-W-OFG survey, 39 (97.5%) young people (n=40) chose to attend the online focus group. Among the 22 participants who responded to the W-OFG invitations, 15 confirmed that they would attend the W-OFGs, of which 11 participants attended the W-OFGs. Feedback collected from the participants in the W-OFG and the post-W-OFG survey suggested that online focus groups are acceptable to young people in suicide prevention research. Considerations for selecting the Web conferencing platform, conducting the mock W-OFGs, implementing the risk management procedure, inviting participants to the W-OFGs, and hosting and moderating the W-OFGs as well as a few potential ethical and pragmatic challenges in using this method are discussed in this study.
   Conclusions: The Web conferencing technology provides a feasible replacement for conventional methods, particularly for qualitative research involving vulnerable populations and stigmatized topics including suicide prevention. Our results indicate that this modality is an optimal alternative to engage young people in the focus group discussion. Future studies should compare the data collected from the Web conferencing technology and conventional face-to-face methods in suicide prevention research to determine if these two methods are equivalent in data quality from a quantitative approach.

AB Objective: We aim to report on the practice of psychiatry in the Kingdom of Tonga.
   Method: We provide a description of the findings from a visit to Vaiola Hospital and data provided by the chief psychiatrist of Tonga.
   Results: The practice of psychiatry in Tonga reflects the difficulties of providing health care in a middle-income micro state. Interesting features include the use of kava as a calmative for some acutely disturbed and anxious patients, the high proportion of patients receiving treatment with fluphenazine decanoate and the possibility that the observed increase in psychosis among Tongan migrants to Australia is at least partly due to a high prevalence of psychosis in Tonga itself.
   Conclusions: A prevalence of psychosis study would need to be undertaken to confirm the report of a higher rate of psychosis in Tonga compared with that in Australia

AB Australia and New Zealand have a long and rich tradition of hospice care and palliative medicine. Hospices were originally founded by Christian nuns. Today, being centrally coordinated, care is founded on evidence-based principles and funding is divided to meet the needs of the people served. Current challenges include the rapidly aging population which suffers from a variety of chronic nonmalignant diseases, the assurance of adequate financing, and the debate on euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. In Germany as in Down Under, a future-oriented uniform strategy is necessary in order to ensure that palliative care-with participation from all palliative medicine and hospice programs-is recognized as an integral part of the healthcare system, is promoted in aged and nursing home care, and is delivered to ethnic minorities in a culturally sensitive.

TI Lifetime Prevalence of Suicide Attempts Among Sexual Minority Adults by
   Study Sampling Strategies: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Review
ID MENTAL-HEALTH; BISEXUAL MEN; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; RISK-FACTORS; GAY
   MEN; ORIENTATION; POPULATION; IDEATION; PARTNERS; GENDER
AB Background. Previous reviews have demonstrated a higher risk of suicide attempts for lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) persons (sexual minorities), compared with heterosexual groups, but these were restricted to general population studies, thereby excluding individuals sampled through LGB community venues. Each sampling strategy, however, has particular methodological strengths and limitations. For instance, general population probability studies have defined sampling frames but are prone to information bias associated with underreporting of LGB identities. By contrast, LGB community surveys may support disclosure of sexuality but overrepresent individuals with strong LGB community attachment.
   Objectives. To reassess the burden of suicide-related behavior among LGB adults, directly comparing estimates derived from population-versus LGB community-based samples.
   Search methods. In 2014, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and Scopus databases for articles addressing suicide-related behavior (ideation, attempts) among sexual minorities.
   Selection criteria. We selected quantitative studies of sexual minority adults conducted in nonclinical settings in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
   Data collection and analysis. Random effects meta-analysis and meta-regression assessed for a difference in prevalence of suicide-related behavior by sample type, adjusted for study or sample-level variables, including context (year, country), methods (medium, response rate), and subgroup characteristics (age, gender, sexual minority construct). We examined residual heterogeneity by using tau(2).
   Main results. We pooled 30 cross-sectional studies, including 21 201 sexual minority adults, generating the following lifetime prevalence estimates of suicide attempts: 4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3%, 5%) for heterosexual respondents to population surveys, 11% (95% CI = 8%, 15%) for LGB respondents to population surveys, and 20% (95% CI = 18%, 22%) for LGB respondents to community surveys (Figure 1). The difference in LGB estimates by sample type persisted after we accounted for covariates with meta-regression. Sample type explained 33% of the between-study variability.
   Author's conclusions. Regardless of sample type examined, sexual minorities had a higher lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts than heterosexual persons; however, the magnitude of this disparity was contingent upon sample type. Community-based surveys of LGB people suggest that 20% of sexual minority adults have attempted suicide.
   Public health implications. Accurate estimates of sexual minority health disparities are necessary for public health monitoring and research. Most data describing these disparities are derived from 2 sample types, which yield different estimates of the lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts. Additional studies should explore the differential effects of selection and information biases on the 2 predominant sampling approaches used to understand sexual minority health.

   databases; Coding and classification
ID UNDETERMINED MANNER; SUICIDE; CLASSIFICATION; PREVENTION; TIME
AB Background: In countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, systematic variation in the classification of intent in pharmaceutical poisoning deaths have been identified between jurisdictions. This study aimed to explore whether the coronial determination of intent (unintentional, intentional, undetermined) for pharmaceutical-related poisoning deaths may have affected death rates over time and by jurisdiction in Australia.
   Methods: A retrospective examination of mortality records in the National Coronial Information System (NCIS) during 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2013 was conducted. The NCIS is a national internet-based data storage and retrieval system for deaths that were notified to a coroner. Pharmaceutical deaths due to unintentional, intentional or undetermined intent were identified using the NCIS classification. Proportions of the different intent classifications and the mortality rates by intent over time were compared between jurisdictions.
   Results: There were 17,895 pharmaceutical-related poisoning deaths in Australia between 2001 and 2013 that had closed cases in the NCIS. Proportions of deaths classified as unintentional (48.3-66.3%), intentional (24.7-35.9%) and undetermined (6.7-24.7%) varied significantly among Australian jurisdictions. There were significant increases in the rate of classification of unintentional poisoning for some states, and significant increases in intentional poisoning classification in Western Australia, and decreases in New South Wales and Victoria. There was no significant change in classification of undetermined intent.
   Conclusions: Significant variation in classifications of intent, both between state jurisdictions and over time, may be the result of regional differences in demographics and increases in prescription drug misuse. However, the inconsistent use of 'undetermined' intent between state jurisdictions suggests coroners may experience varying difficulty in retrospectively ruling on intent in the equivocal circumstances of pharmaceutical poisoning. The widespread use of psychological autopsy may assist coroners to classify intent, while the implementation of new classifications for pharmaceutical poisoning death may overcome some of the inherent difficulty in intent classification and improve the potential for injury surveillance irrespective of intent.

AB Australia's intermittent attempts to legalise euthanasia are typically fraught with brief, polarised, and often sensationalised, public debate. Yet beyond the sensitive arguments in favour and in opposition of reform, the practical antecedents of change that may determine Australia's genuine aptitude to enact reforms have been largely neglected. Phronetic legal inquiry thus offers insights into the euthanasia law reform experience, using Australian and international case comparisons to examine covert power dynamics, cultural discourses, and social and institutional structures that affect the practices of the legislature. On this basis, it is argued that Australia's medical profession, and particularly its dominant providers of palliative care, are hampered by an entrenched culture of medicalisation and paternalism, within which patient autonomy provides only a veneer of self-determination. This can be strikingly contrasted with the Dutch approach of patient-centred care, which seeks to produce collaborative, respectful dialogue between physician and patient and to integrate the principles of autonomy and beneficence. Furthermore, these contrasting medical cultures represent issues in the broader policymaking context, as Australia's health policy remains unduly subject to the pressure of unrepresentative yet influential conservative interest groups, most prominently including the Australian Medical Association. This pressure serves to suppress public opinion on the issue of euthanasia in a parliamentary climate that remains stifled by bipartisan alliances and political inertia. It is therefore argued that Australia's prospects for successful voluntary euthanasia law reform rest on the dual pillars of developing a more patient-centred medical culture and challenging the prevailing paternalistic approach to health policymaking in Australia's currently unrepresentative political landscape.

ID MASS-MEDIA; NEWSPAPER STORIES; SUICIDE; VIOLENCE; SUGGESTION;
   FATALITIES; TIME
AB Data available on the characteristics of all Australian homicides over ten years since mid 1989 provide an opportunity to investigate whether child homicide is subject to temporal clustering. If this were found to be the case, then contagion resulting from media publicity might be a possible explanation. This follows from studies indicating some influence from media publicity given to suicides. No temporal clustering could be detected and results indicate that any given child homicide in Australia has no effect on the subsequent rate of child homicides. The study suggests that caution is needed before assuming that proximate events are necessarily related. It remains a possibility that child homicide may be the product of contagion over a longer time frame, as a consequence of intense media publicity given to high profile events. The media should respect community sensibilities in reporting such events and avoid sensational coverage in an ethical and balanced way.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB The status of prisoners' mental health has wide-reaching implications for prison inmates, prison authorities and institutions, and the general community. This article presents the mental health findings from the 2008 Health of Prisoner Evaluation (HoPE) pilot project in which 146 maximum security prisoners were interviewed across two prisons in Western Australia. Results revealed significant discrepancies across gender and Indigenous status regarding the history and treatment of mental health complaints, use of prescribed psychiatric medication, and experience of psychosocial distress. Illicit drug use and dependency, as well as patterns of self-harm and suicide are also reported. These findings highlight that imprisonment is an opportune time to screen for mental health problems and provide appropriate evidence-based treatment. Although this process may initially increase government costs, it will reduce overall expenditure by improving prisoners' ability to cope with prison to community transitions, and reduce the high rate of recidivism.

AB Background GPs are the most frequently accessed health professional among suicidal individuals in the community.
   Aim To determine the prevalence of psychological distress and suicidal ideation among patients aged 60 years and older presenting to GPs, and the relationship between these variables in detecting patients who may be contemplating suicide.
   Design of study Cross-sectional analysis of older patients presenting to Australian GPs between 2002 and 2003.
   Setting One thousand and sixty-one consecutive patients aged 60 years or over attending one of 54 randomly selected Western Australian GPs.
   Method Prior to their medical consultation, patients completed a self-report questionnaire, which included questions about current suicidal ideation (Depressive Symptom Inventory Suicidality Subscale [DSI-SS]) and depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale [CES-D]). Patients' chief complaints were obtained from consultation summary sheets completed by their GP.
   Results Although only 5.1% of patients presented with psychological complaints, 5.8% acknowledged current suicidal ideation and 23.8% had clinically significant levels of depressive symptomatology. Suicidal ideation was associated with CES-D scores greater than 16 (odds ratio [OR] = 3.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5 to 8.9), feelings of depression (OR = 7.7, 95% CI = 3.4 to 17.7), and previous suicide attempt (OR = 7.4, 95% CI = 2.7 to 20.2) in a logistic regression model, but not with poor self-perceived health, use of licit drugs (smoking, alcohol, and hypnotics), or type of presenting complaint at the time of assessment.
   Conclusions Although older general practice patients tend to present for issues related to their physical health, approximately a quarter of this cohort also possess high levels of psychological distress, including current thoughts of suicide. Older patients who show any signs of depression or distress should be asked about psychological symptoms, including suicidal ideation.

AB Background: The effect of safety planning for people in suicidal crisis is not yet determined, but using safety plans to mitigate acute psychological crisis is regarded as best practice. Between 2016 and 2017, Australian and Danish stakeholders were involved in revising and updating the Danish MYPLAN mobile phone safety plan and translating the app into a culturally appropriate version for Australia.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the negotiation of stakeholders' suggestions and contributions to the design, function, and content of the MYPLAN app and to characterize significant developments in the emerging user-involving processes.
   Methods: We utilized a case study design where 4 focus groups and 5 user-involving workshops in Denmark and Australia were subjected to thematic analysis.
   Results: The analyses identified 3 consecutive phases in the extensive development of the app: from phase 1, Suggesting core functions, through phase 2, Refining functions, to phase 3, Negotiating the finish. The user-involving processes continued to prevent closure and challenged researchers and software developers to repeatedly reconsider the app's basic user interface and functionality. It was a limitation that the analysis did not include potentially determinative backstage dimensions of the decision-making process.
   Conclusions: The extended user involvement prolonged the development process, but it also allowed for an extensive exploration of different user perspectives and needs.

AB This study explored the preliminary evidence for a relationship between constructive and affirming newsprint stories about depression or anxiety in males and use of helpline services by males. With the help of a Consumer Reference Group, we identified ten positive newsprint stories about males and depression or anxiety. We then obtained phone contact data from four national helplines in Australia: Lifeline, MensLine Australia, SANE Australia, and beyondblue. For each contact, we extracted the date, location and gender of the caller. Poisson regression analysis was used to determine the change in contact volume in the two weeks following each story, as compared to the two weeks prior to the story. Contact volume from males increased significantly in the two weeks after four of the ten stories, decreased after one story with no change after five of the stories. The stories that were associated with increased contacts were about men (including publicly revered role models) that male readers could identify with and tended to be stories of hope and recovery. The findings suggest newsprint media can positively influence male help-seeking and point to a need for articles to provide accurate representations of depression and anxiety, whilst maintaining an optimistic focus on recovery.

TI Our hearts and minds - What would it take for Australia to become the
   healthiest country in the world?
SO MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective: To highlight recent reductions in mortality rates in Australia and identify conditions and population groups with the greatest potential for further reduction in mortality rates.
   Design: International benchmarking and intranational comparisons of mortality rates were used to identify areas with the greatest potential for improvement.
   Results: Latest data from Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries confirm that, while Japan's death rates remain the lowest in the world, Australia's are decreasing rapidly and we now rival Switzerland for second overall ranking. When the contributions of specific conditions are compared, the areas with the greatest potential for reductions are circulatory diseases (especially ischaemic heart disease); suicide; injury and violence; smoking-related conditions; and cancers amenable to prevention/early detection. Intranational comparisons show considerable scope for reduction in inequalities, especially those between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and other Australians, between males and females, and between low and high socioeconomic groups. These conditions and inequalities are highly interrelated, as differentials in health status are often mediated through broader societal inequalities.
   Conclusions: Australia should aim to become the country with the lowest mortality rate in the world. This could realistically be achieved by benchmarking performance nationally and internationally, applying current knowledge and available interventions, matching policies with funding, and implementing systemic national programs and activities to promote health and prevent "illth".

AB Aim To examine the demographic characteristics, circumstances of death, toxicological results and major organ pathology of methamphetamine-related deaths in Australia. Design Retrospective review of coronial files. Setting Australia. Methods Cases in which methamphetamine was listed as a cause of death were identified from the National Coronial Information System (NCIS). Findings A total of 371 cases were identified. The mean age of decedents was 32.7 years; 77% were male and 35% were employed. Route of administration was predominantly by injection (89%). Drugs other than methamphetamine were detected in 89% of cases, most commonly benzodiazepines (41%) and morphine (36%). The median blood methamphetamine concentration was 0.2 mg/l (range 0.02-15.0 mg/l). Deaths were overwhelmingly accidental, with 14% determined to be suicides, and occurred in a private home (71%). Cardiovascular pathology, typically coronary artery atherosclerosis, was detected in 54% of decedents. Cerebrovascular pathology, most commonly cerebral haemorrhage and hypoxia, was present in 20% of cases. Conclusions Methamphetamine has contributed to a substantial number of deaths in Australia. Users need to be informed of the potential harms of methamphetamine use, particularly those associated with the cardiotoxicity of methamphetamine and the use of methamphetamine in conjunction with other drugs.

AB Objectives: To estimate rates of suicidal ideation and attempts, and psychological characteristics of demoralization among Australian income support recipients. To provide information for policy-makers to inform the current welfare reform discussion.
   Method: Data from the 1997 National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing were analysed using sequential logistic regression models, comparing working age people dependent on government income support payments with those having other main sources of income.
   Results: Three groups of income support recipients, unemployed, lone mothers and disability payment recipients, reported significantly higher levels on all psychological measures related to demoralization (hopelessness, worthlessness and dissatisfaction with life) than non-recipients. A similar pattern was demonstrated for measures of suicidal ideation and reported suicide attempts, with increased odds of between 3 and 9 for these high-risk groups of welfare recipients. The elevated rates of suicidal ideation, attempts and demoralization among income support recipients were in part explained by sociodemographic characteristics (socioeconomic status, age, educational qualification, experience of serious violence, loneliness, experience of psychiatric disorders), though the unemployed and disability payment recipients remained elevated on the psychological measures.
   Conclusions: Demoralization, poor mental health and suicidal behaviour are common among income support recipients targeted by recently announced welfare reforms. This needs to be considered in the design and implementation of Australian Government policies. Psychiatric epidemiology has a key role in policy development and evaluation.

AB The purpose of this article is to describe and assess-as well as identify and rectify gaps in-intervention and prevention initiatives that specifically address poor mental health outcomes and suicidal behaviors in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) populations in Australia. It begins with an overview of the evidence base for heightened vulnerability to suicidal behaviors among LGBTI people in Australia. It then provides a discussion on the public health implications for LGBTI-targeted mental health initiatives and the prevention of and timely intervention in LGBTI suicidal behaviors. We conclude that the literature supports an increased risk for poorer mental health outcomes and suicidal behaviors in LGBTI populations in the Australian context. Psychological distress and suicidal behaviors in LGBTI people in Australia have social determinants that can and have been addressed through the provision of interventions with a strong evidence base in reducing these outcomes, implemented at a nationwide level, including training of health professionals and gatekeepers to mental health services and the general public. We conclude that the current Australian focus appears to address many of the social determinants of suicidal behaviors and poor mental health in LGBTI people but requires sustained and uniform government support if it is to continue and to produce measurable results.

DT Article
ID GENERAL-PRACTITIONERS; SUICIDE; DRUGS
AB Objective: To examine trends in types of antidepressant medications prescribed in Australia between 1975 and 2002.
   Design: Sales data from the Australian pharmaceutical industry were used to examine trends in overall antidepressant prescribing and changes in the types of antidepressants prescribed between 1975 and 2002.
   Main outcome measures: Antidepressant sales were expressed as defined daily doses (DDDs) per 1000 people per day, using the estimated Australian population for each year obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
   Results: Average annual growth in the sales of antidepressants was 1.1% per year from 1975 to 1990, after which growth rose steeply to reach 29% in 1995. By 2002 the rate of growth had slowed to 6.6%. Eighty per cent of total sales were accounted for by four drugs in 1975, 1980 and 1985; five in 1990; seven drugs in 1995 and 2000; and six drugs in 2001 and 2002.
   Conclusions: The rapid growth in antidepressant prescribing that was characteristic of the early 1990s, and reflected the emergence of new classes of agents, did not continue into the late 1990s. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors now dominate antidepressant prescribing in Australia.

AB In Australia the movement toward evidence based practice was supported by the first National Mental Health Strategy. For mental health clinicians the shift from evaluating process to outcome measurement also brought greater focus on specific disorders and targeted interventions, raising questions about the efficacy and effectiveness of treatment. The gap between research and practice is well documented, and has engendered much debate particularly in regard to empirically supported treatments (ESTs) and the technologies to widely disseminate practice whilst supporting treatment adherence. In this paper we first, describe the Attachment Based Family Therapy (ABFT) model before giving consideration to the criticisms of ESTs, and reviewing the dissemination of ABFT in Australia, and the perspectives of Australian clinicians in respect to the model and its relevance to their practice. Finally, we turn to the mission of this Special Issue which is to increase the awareness of ABFT primarily amongst practicing clinicians as we introduce the selected papers that demonstrate the application of the model to a variety of clinical presentations, and clinical settings.

AB Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of the Neurological Depressive Disorders Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E) and the depression component of the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS-D) for identifying depression and suicide risk in adults with epilepsy.
   Methods: A total of 147 (87 female [59%]) outpatients attending a tertiary epilepsy center in Sydney Australia completed the NDDI-E and HADS-D. They then completed the depression and suicide sections of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Inventory (MINI) with a clinician blind to symptom measure scores. Receiver operator characteristic analysis was performed for the clinical cutoff scores for depression on the NDDI-E >= 15 and HADS-D >= 8 to identify MINI-determined depression and suicidality.
   Results: The NDDI-E indicated strong sensitivity (84%) and acceptable specificity (78%), whereas the HADS-D had poor sensitivity (42%) but good specificity (97%) for identifying depression. For identifying suicide risk, the NDDI-E indicated strong sensitivity (81%) and reasonable specificity (66%), whereas the HADS-D had poor sensitivity (43%) but acceptable specificity (90%). Area under the curve comparisons for these measures were not significant.
   Conclusion: In clinical practice, it is essential that screening measures have the highest possible sensitivity values to limit the chances of false-negative results. In accordance with these guidelines, the NDDI-E was a superior screening measure compared with the HADS-D. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the NDDI-E for identifying both major and minor depression and serious suicide risk. The poor sensitivity of the HADS-D suggests that it should not be used as a screen for depression or suicidality in adults with epilepsy. Neurology (R) 2012;79:371-375

DT Article
DE Suicide; suicidal behaviour; mental health; children; adolescents;

ID IDEATION
AB Objective: To (1) estimate the lifetime and 12-month prevalence of suicidal behaviours in Australian young people aged 12-17years, (2) describe their co-morbidity with mental illness and (3) describe the co-variation of these estimates with social and demographic variables.
   Method: A national random sample of children aged 4-17years was recruited in 2013-2014. The response rate to the survey was 55% with 6310 parents and carers of eligible households participating. In addition, of the 2967 young people aged 11-17years in these households, 89% (2653) of the 12- to 17-year-olds completed a self-report questionnaire that included questions about suicidal behaviour.
   Results: In any 12-month period, about 2.4% or 41,400 young people would have made a suicide attempt. About 7.5% of 12- to 17-year-olds report having suicidal ideation, 5.2% making a plan and less than 1% (0.6%) receiving medical treatment for an attempt. The presence of a mental disorder shows the largest significant association with lifetime and 12-month suicidal behaviour, along with age, gender, sole parent family status and poor family functioning. Of young people with a major depressive disorder, 19.7% reported making a suicide attempt within the previous 12months. There are also significant elevations in the proportions of young people reporting suicidal behaviour who have anxiety and conduct disorders.
   Conclusion: Mental disorders should be a leading intervention point for suicide prevention both in the primary health sector and in the mental health sector specifically. The associations examined here also suggest that efforts to assist sole parent and/or dysfunctional families would be worthy areas in which to target these efforts.

LA English
DT Article
DE Depression stigma; Mental health; Wellbeing; Suicide; Construction;
   Randomised controlled trial
ID HELP-SEEKING; HEALTH; UNEMPLOYMENT; SUICIDE; AUSTRALIA; LITERACY;
   BEHAVIOR; IMPACT; SCALE
AB Background: Males employed in the construction industry have high rates of suicide. Although reasons underpinning this risk are multifaceted, poor help-seeking and stigma are represent major contributors. Males in the construction industry are also exposed to other risk factors for mental ill health and suicide, including unemployment. Sigma-reducing interventions that are accessible and attractive to recently unemployed males in the construction industry could therefore improve help-seeking, and address depression and suicidal behaviour in this population.
   Methods/Design: Contact&Connect will use a parallel individual randomized design to evaluate the effectiveness of a multimedia-based intervention aimed at reducing stigma. The intervention consists of a package of 12 brief contact interventions (BCIs) delivered over a six month period. BCIs will direct participants to informational programs and microsites. Content will address three major themes: debunking depression myths and stereotypes, normalisation, and empowerment. Target enrolment is 630 (315 in each arm), each to be followed for 12 months. Eligible participants will be males, between 30 and 64 years, unemployed at the time of recruitment, registered with Incolink (a social welfare trustee company for unemployed members of the construction industry), and own a smart phone with enabled internet connectivity.
   Discussion: At present, there are no programs that have been shown to be effective in reducing stigma in the blue-collar male population. Contact&Connect promises to provide a tailored, efficient, and scalable approach to reducing stigma, depressive symptoms and suicidality among unemployed males.

TI Deaths as a result of hanging
SO BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH-INDIA
LA English
DT Article
DE Autopsy; Capital punishment; Suicide
ID SUICIDE; PRISONERS; AUSTRALIA; IRELAND; TRENDS
AB Background: Death by hanging occurs as a result of the tightening of a cord around the neck with the effect of body weight. Although generally seen, it is not always necessary for hanging to be in a completely perpendicular position with the feet off the ground. With the exception of judicial cases, most hangings are suicides and in some cases may be the result of accident or murder.
   Material and method: In this study an evaluation was made of the autopsies of 48 cases of death by hanging in the province of Tokat, Turkey between 2009 and 2013. Through a retrospective evaluation of autopsy data, the cases were examined in respect of age, gender, location, type of hanging, instrument of hanging, fractures of the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage and level of alcohol and other substances in the blood. In the evaluation of the data, the SPSS 11.0 software was used.
   Results: The cases were 35 (73%) males and 13 (27%) females with a mean age of 34.56 years; males, mean 35.37 years and females, mean 32.38 years. Typical hanging was determined in 42 (87.5%) cases. Fracture of the hyoid bone was seen in 14 (29.2%) cases and fracture of the thyroid cartilage in 13 (27%) cases. With the exception of 2 cases, ecchymosis was found in the fracture region of all the other cases. Ethanol was determined in the blood of 8 (16.6%) cases and other substances in the blood of 2 (6.2%) cases.
   Conclusions: In every case of hanging, the autopsy and toxicology and histopathology examinations made following autopsy are extremely important in respect of differential diagnosis and determining whether or not it is a case of suicide or whether the hanging occurred after death.

TI Research priorities in mental health
SO AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE Mental health priorities; research funding; health services
AB Objective: Over the last decade, Australia has seen an increase in investment in mental health services, primarily through the funding of headspace and Better Access to Mental Health Outcomes programs. Concurrently there has been a policy focus on prevention and early intervention, suicide reduction and 'hard-to-target' groups such as Indigenous groups. It is not clear, however, whether research funding targeting health services or prevention or promotion has been prioritized, or whether funding priorities in general have shifted over the last decade.
   Methods: A total of 1008 Australian-authored research publications and 126 competitive research grants in 2008 were coded in terms of their target of research, research goal setting and target group. These characteristics were compared with the research priorities of 570 stakeholders, burden of disease estimates and similar data collected 10 years earlier.
   Results: The proportion of research funding for affective disorders, dementia and psychosis has increased, but not for anxiety disorders or suicide. Funding for childhood disorders has decreased. Funding for prevention and promotion is low and decreasing. With respect to research publications, substance abuse was associated with the most publications, followed by affective disorders, anxiety disorders and psychosis. When publications and funding are compared to stakeholder priorities and the burden of disease, the areas of suicide and self-harm, personality disorders, anxiety disorders, childhood conditions and dementia are all insufficiently funded.
   Conclusion: Despite mental health policy reforms through the last decade, there has been little change in the focus of research funding or publication output. There is modest evidence for a shift in support towards affective disorders as a major focus for research. However, the remaining gaps were very similar to those identified 10 years earlier showing that suicide, personality disorders and anxiety disorders are under-researched.

DT Article
ID OCCUPATIONAL ELECTROCUTIONS; ELECTRICAL INJURIES; EMPHASIS; DEATH
AB A retrospective study was undertaken of all cases of death in adults (> 16 years) due to electrocution which were autopsied at Forensic Science SA, Adelaide, Australia, over a 30-year period from 1973 to 2002. A total of 96 cases were identified with 87 males (91%) (mean age= 41.6 years; range 17 to 86 years) and nine females (9%) (mean age = 49.2 years; range 20 to 76 years). Deaths were due to accidents in 66 cases (69%; MY = 63:3), suicides in 28 cases (29%; M:F = 24:4) and homicides in two cases (2%). Both homicide victims were females, with females accounting for only 5% of the accidents and 14% of suicides. The number of accidental deaths increased until the early 1990s and then declined, whereas suicidal electrocutions were only found in the last 20 years of the study.
   Most deaths (N = 80; 83%) were due to low voltage circuits (< 1000 volts), with deaths due to high voltages occurring in 15 cases (16%). One death was due to lightning (1%). While suicides were evenly distributed throughout the year, most accidental deaths occurred in late spring and summer (N = 42; 64%) with the lowest number of accidental deaths occurring in winter and early spring. This report demonstrates a significantly higher rate of electrocution deaths among males, with a summer predominance of accidental deaths, most likely due to increased outdoor activities in better weather. The reduction in cases over the last decade of the study may be a reflection of the success of workplace and domestic safety campaigns. Female electrocution suicides and electrocution homicides were rare events.

SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
ID DISORDERS
AB Mental health literacy is the knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders that aid in their recognition, management, or prevention; it is also a determinant of help seeking. As such, it is presumed to be important in community suicide prevention programs. In Australia there have been a number of government, professional, and charitable organizations as well as pharmaceutical company suicide prevention initiatives which have been designed to enhance public and professional knowledge about mental disorders, particularly depression. This naturalistic study conducted between 1998 and 2004 in a random and representative population sample examined the changes in mental health literacy and treatment seeking of those with major depression, both with and without suicidal ideation, and those who were neither depressed nor suicidal. Results indicated that there was marked improvement in mental health literacy for all three groups, although there was less change for those most in need of intervention (i.e., those with major depression and suicidal ideation). Furthermore, there were fewer changes in appropriate treatment seeking in those with major depression and suicidal ideation. These findings are consistent with literature reporting limited problem solving and decision making in those who are suicidal, and indicate that there are limits to broad-based community education programs. More focused suicide prevention initiatives are required, specifically for those who are depressed and suicidal.

AB We examined factors associated with increased mortality in a cohort of 85,203 adults with a history of imprisonment in New South Wales, Australia, between 1988 and 2002. Information on death was collected through linkage to the Australian National Death Index. The influence of demographic and criminological factors on the standardised mortality ratio (SMR) for all-cause mortality, and deaths due to drug overdose and suicide was examined using negative binomial regression models. The number of deaths identified was 5,137 (4,714 men, 423 women, 303 in custody). The overall SMR was 3.7 (3.6-3.8) in men and 7.8 (7.1-8.5) in women. SMRs raised for deaths due to drug overdose (men: 12.8, women: 50.3) and suicide (men: 4.8, women: 12.2). The high SMR was associated with hospitalisation for mental illness, multiple imprisonments, and early stage of follow-up independently of causes of death. Being released from prison increased the SMRs for all-cause and drug-related mortality, but not suicide. For women, significant trends for decreasing risk with increasing age were noted. Minority groups, in particular men, had a lower risk of death than white people. In men a sex or drug offence was associated with a lower risk and a property or violence offence was related to higher mortality. Our results reinforce how disadvantaged prisoners are, measured by mortality as the most fundamental scale of human wellbeing. Certain demographic and imprisonment characteristics are indicators of high mortality among this population. The underlying causes of some of these characteristics such as mental illness or multiple imprisonments are potentially treatable and preventable. Prison health services need to develop interventions targeting high-risk groups to avoid this situation.

AB Objective: To determine the need and feasibility of developing a national suicide prevention (SP) curriculum for undergraduate medical students.
   Design: Exploratory study using semi-structured phone interviews and surveys. Data was obtained from ten (out of 15) Australian Medical Schools (AMS), 373 medical students from one Queensland medical school, and 24 Australian General Practitioners, between April and June, 2006.
   Results: Convergent views of AMS, medical students, and GPs revealed a high need and support for SP curricula, especially on skills-based education. Students who previously received SP education rated themselves significantly higher on skills-based SP abilities than those who had not. Over one-third of GPs had not received SP training from their universities (37.5%), yet 66% had experienced a case of suicide among their patients, and a third recorded on average a case of suicide every two years. The majority of students and GPs rated themselves as least competent on skills-based SP capabilities, yet rated these capabilities very high in importance for the medical profession. Whilst 80% of AMS provides some form of SP education, the quantity and quality of this is divergent. All AMS indicated support for a more uniformed SP curriculum, identified priority SP topics and delivery mechanisms, and 80% agreed to participate in a future piloting of a SP curriculum.
   Conclusions: SP curriculum may positively impact on student's perceived competency. Skills-based SP curricula were highly recommended to improve 'hands-on' assessment, intervention and management capabilities. Further consultation is required with all AMS to specify structure and resource needs for a national SP curriculum.

AB Aim: To determine the relationship between borderline personality disorder (BPD), antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and harm among current heroin users. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Sydney, Australia. Participants: 615 current heroin users. Findings: Forty-six percent met criteria for BPD, 71% for ASPD, and 38% met criteria for both diagnoses. ASPD was related to attempted suicide, lifetime overdose, polydrug use, depression and overall psychological distress. BPD was also related to each of these risk domains, and to needle risk and recent suicide as well. When analysed separately, both BPD and ASPD thus appeared to predict harm. For the purposes of further analysis, the relationships between BPD, ASPD and harm, the sample was divided into four independent diagnostic groups: no diagnosis (ND, 21%), ASPD only (ASPD, 33%), BPD only (BPD, 7%), ASPD plus BPD (DUAL, 38%). The division of the sample into four distinct diagnostic groups produced substantially different results. There were strong relationships between BPD and attempted suicide, needle sharing and psychopathology. In none of these domains did the ASPD group significantly differ from the ND group. Also, the levels of harm among the DUAL group were identical to BPD, suggesting no additive risk from ASPD. Thus, while initial analyses suggested an increased risk for ASPD patients for suicide and psychopathology, these relationships disappeared after BPD was taken into account. The only domain in which there appeared to be an additive risk for ASPD and BPD, was heroin overdose. Conclusions: The extensive comorbidity between BPD and ASPD means that, unless BPD is controlled for, artefactual relationships may emerge between ASPD and harm. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Abusers were more likely to be male, aged between 25 and 35 years and abusing opioids. Death was the eventual outcome in 24% of cases. Only 19% of abusers made a long-term recovery within the specialty. Initial signs of abuse were most commonly abnormal conduct (63% of the cases) and observed abuse (37%). More than one precipitating cause was identified in 51% of cases, the most frequently reported were mental health and family problems. The pattern of substances abused was similar to that reported in the previous Australasian survey ten years ago. However, in keeping with an international trend, there appears to be an increased use of anaesthetic agents.

DE Sociology; requested death; media; discourse analysis; aesthetics;
   embodiment
AB This paper develops discourse analysis of Australian press representations of dying during the operation of the Northern Territory of Australia's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 (McInerney 2006). Operating in tandem, the discourses of aesthetics and embodiment constructed contemporary dying as an intolerable corporeal state. The body in disarray is attractive to media imperatives of drama and crisis, and dominated press reports during the analysed period. Such images functioned as absolute justification for a medically-induced requested death. Modern equating of physical integrity and personal dignity supports such responses to dying. The requested death interventions of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide were depicted as halting the physical deteriorations associated with terminal illness and thereby redeeming the dying person, by providing them with the opportunity to reclaim the social status lost via their progressive corporeal decline.

SO AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH

DT Article
ID ASSESSING COST-EFFECTIVENESS; PREVENTION; INTERVENTIONS; DISORDERS;
   SUICIDE; BURDEN; POLICY
AB In Australia, there is a clear relationship (r=-0.56) between the ratio of health expenditure to burden and the ratio of mortality to disability across illness groups. Those illnesses with high mortality relative to disability (e.g. cancer and cardiovascular) are associated with lower health expenditure, relative to the burden they impose. Conversely, illnesses with low mortality but high disability (e.g. musculoskeletal disorders) demonstrate higher expenditure. The notable exception is mental health, which has low mortality, high disability and very low health expenditure. Indeed, the relationship between the mortality/disability and health expenditure/burden ratios is stronger (r=0.72) when mental health is excluded. As this disparity cannot be explained by a lack of cost-effective treatments for mental disorders, we propose a process of affirmative action for mental health. Urgent investments in cost-effective modes of care are required and these should prioritise increased access among those subpopulations disadvantaged by other social, economic or geographic factors.

ID MOOD
AB In 1894 at St. Vincent's Hospital Melbourne, George Adlington Syme removed a meningioma from a patient with symptomatic focal epilepsy. The operation stands as the first surgery based on seizure localization in Australia. It is also the country's first documented successful resection of an intracranial meningioma. It followed William Macewen's landmark cerebral localization case on the boy John McKinley by 18 years and Victor Horsley's first epilepsy case on Hughlings Jackson's patient James B. by a mere 8 years. Syme's patient, Constable John G., survived the operation by some 23 years, dying from a gunshot wound to the head in 1917. Newly discovered inquest papers reveal that the coroner's judgment that the death was accidental completely fails to address the more credible scenario of suicide. The story makes for a fascinating epilogue to an important landmark in Australia's neurosurgical history.

DE mental health; suicide; youth
AB Aim:
   The Mission Australia annual National Survey of Young Australians aims to generate insights into what young people think on a range of issues, including what they value, what issues are of concern to them, and where they go for advice and support.
   Methods:
   A two-page opt-in questionnaire was distributed to a very broad range of organisations across Australia, and was available in both an online and paper-based format. Responses to the survey were anonymous. Respondents were asked to rank items from the lists provided, and results are reported on the basis of items ranked one, two or three by respondents. Responses were disaggregated by age, gender, cultural background and living arrangements.
   Results:
   Close to 48 000 young people participated in the 2009 survey, and the data confirms the importance of relationships to young people, as well as the diversity of concerns they may have, including drugs, suicide, mental health and body image. While concerns tended to vary with age and to some extent gender, what is valued by young people tends to be consistent across age and genders, namely family and friends.
   Conclusions:
   Implications for policy making and service delivery are drawn with a focus on the issues of relationships, drugs and mental health. In particular, the need for early intervention, evidence-based drug education programs, and initiatives that support those closest to young people, to assist them when they have concerns, are highlighted.

AB ObjectivesTo describe the nature and extent of external-cause deaths of residents of nursing homes in Victoria, Australia.
   DesignA retrospective cohort study of all decedents using routinely collected data contained within the National Coronial Information System.
   SettingAccredited nursing homes in Victoria.
   ParticipantsNursing home residents who had died from external causes and whose deaths were reported to the Coroners Court between July 1, 2000, and December 31, 2012.
   MeasurementsBasic descriptive analysis was conducted to measure frequencies and proportion of exposures within each outcome group, and rates were calculated using population data.
   ResultsOne thousand two hundred ninety-six external cause deaths of nursing home residents were identified. Deaths were due to falls (n=1,155, 89.1%), choking (n=89, 6.9%), suicide (n=17, 1.3%), complications of clinical care (n=8, 0.6%) and resident-on-resident assault (n=7, 0.5%). Deaths occurred more frequently in women (n=814, 62.8%), in keeping with the sex distribution in nursing homes, and residents aged 85 and older (n=923, 71.2%). The number of inquests held to investigate a death as a matter of public interest was small (n=24, 1.9%).
   ConclusionA significant proportion of nursing home resident deaths are from external causes and are potentially preventable. A shift in community attitudes is required toward an understanding that premature death of a resident from injury is not a natural part of life.

AB Problem: Adhoc culturally questionable perinatal mental-health screening among Aboriginal women in the Kimberley. Background: Mental-health issues, substance abuse and suicide attempts are high among young Aboriginal women in Australia. There is no evidence that the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is effective or culturally safe. Screening practices are complicated by limited understanding of the complex cultural interface between Western and Aboriginal beliefs and notions about health and mental-health. Question: What is the current context of perinatal mental-health screening practices among Aboriginal women in the Kimberley and what might be considered a culturally safe approach? Methods: A review of the literature and exploration of current screening practices preceded community participatory action research (CPAR) of perinatal mental-health screening. Results: More than 100 Kimberley women and 72 health practitioners contributed to this joint strategic body of work. Recommendations for practice include one single culturally appropriate Kimberley version of the EPDS.

TI Impact of coronial investigations on manner and cause of death
   determinations in Australia, 2000-2007
SO MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective: To evaluate the changes in the understanding of the manner and cause of death occurring during the course of coronial investigations.
   Design: Retrospective analysis of deaths reported to coroners in Australia between 1 July 2000 and 31 December 2007, using the National Coroners Information System.
   Main outcome measures: (i) Manner of death (natural, external, unknown); (ii) intent classification (eg, unintentional injury, suicide, assault) among deaths with external causes; and, (iii) changes in the manner of death and intent classification between the presumption made at case notification and the coroner's final determination.
   Results: The coronial investigation changed the presumption about manner of death or intent classification in 5.2% (6222/120452) of cases in which a presumption was made. Among deaths with a change in attribution from natural causes to external causes, unintentional falls (442/1891) and pharmaceutical poisoning (427/1891) each accounted for 23%. Among deaths with attribution changing from external causes to natural causes, the leading medical causes of death were cardiovascular compromise (551/842; 65%) and infection (124/842; 15%). Of deaths understood correctly at notification to be due to external causes, but the wrong external cause, 34% (206/600) were ultimately judged to be unintentional injuries, and 22% (133/600) were judged to be suicides.
   Conclusions: Coronial investigations transform basic understanding of cause of death in only a small minority of cases. However, the benefits to families and society of accurate cause-of-death determinations in these difficult cases may be considerable. MJA 2010; 192: 444-447

AB Although firearm homicide remains a topic of interest within criminological and policy discourse, existing research does not generally undertake longitudinal comparisons between countries. However, cross-country comparisons provide insight into whether "local" trends (e. g., declines in firearm homicide in one particular country) differ from broader, international trends. This in turn can improve knowledge about the role of factors such as policing practices and socioeconomic variables in the incidence of lethal violence using firearms. The current study compares long-term firearm homicide trends in three countries with similar social histories but different legislative regimes: Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. Using negative binomial regression, the study found that the most pronounced decline in firearm homicide over the past two decades occurred in New Zealand. Connections between social disadvantage, policing policy, and violence are discussed.

AB Filicide is the killing of a child by a parent or parent equivalent. Between 2000-01 and 2011-12, there were 238 incidents of filicide in Australia involving the death of 284 children. This paper examines the characteristics of custodial parents, non-custodial parents and step-parents charged with the murder or manslaughter of their children.
   Offender circumstances and characteristics differed according to the offender's gender and custodial relationship with the victim. As filicide is difficult to predict, intervention strategies should focus on families with multiple risk factors and address the needs of parents as well as those of children at risk.

AB An 11 year old boy developed acute agitation and suicidal ideation after commencing atomoxetine shortly after it was approved for use in Australia. The clinical features were similar to reactions described in response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The case highlights the importance of close monitoring when starting newly registered medications. An increased risk of suicidal thinking was subsequently identified for this drug leading to a Food and Drug Administration alert and a boxed warning in September 2005, however there are still no other published case reports of acute suicidality.

AB Introduction:
   Alcohol is the most commonly used drug within Australia. Recently, there have been indications that there is a greater incidence of high-risk drinking within rural populations as compared with their urban counterparts. High-risk drinking is associated with numerous conditions, such as diabetes, heart attack and cancer, as well as acute harms such as assault, suicide and road accidents. The objective of this article is to review the current research and relevant data pertaining to alcohol use and alcohol-related harms within rural Australia.
   Methods:
   This paper is a systematic review of 16 databases, including PubMed, PsycINFO and Google Scholar.
   Results:
   Overall, 18 studies describing alcohol consumption or alcohol-related harms were found. Approximately half of these studies were large-scale national population surveys, which were therefore limited in their representativeness of specific regional and rural towns. Most studies examining alcohol consumption used self-report data collection, meaning that interpretation of results needs to be tentative. There is a consistent pattern of higher rates of alcohol consumption and consequent harm within regional and rural Australia than in urban areas.
   Conclusions:
   There is emerging research examining alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harms within regional and rural Australia. All studies show that these populations experience disproportionate harm because of alcohol consumption. The causes and mechanism for this have not been investigated, and a program of research is required to understand how and why rural populations experience disproportionate levels of alcohol-related harm and ultimately, what interventions will be most effective in reducing alcohol-related harms.

AB Climate change is exacerbating climate variability, evident in more frequent and severe weather-related disasters, such as droughts, fires, and floods. Most of what is known about the possible effects of climate change on rural mental health relates to prolonged drought. But though drought is known to be a disproportionate and general stressor, evidence is mixed and inconclusive. Over time, like drought other weather-related disasters may erode the social and economic bases on which farming communities depend. Rural vulnerability to mental health problems is greatly increased by socioeconomic disadvantage. Related factors may compound this, such as reduced access to health services as communities decline and a "stoical" culture that inhibits help-seeking. Australia has the world's most variable climate and is a major global agricultural producer. Yet despite Australia's (and, especially, rural communities') dependence on farmers' well-being and success, there is very little and inconclusive quantitative evidence about farmers' mental health. The aim of this review is to consider, with a view to informing other countries, how climate change and related factors may affect farmers' mental health in Australia. That information is a prerequisite to identifying, selecting, and evaluating adaptive strategies, to lessen the risks of adverse mental health outcomes. The authors identify the need for a systematic epidemiology of the mental health of farmers facing increasing climate change related weather adversity.

AB In many parts of the world, young adult women have higher levels of common mental disorders than men. The exacerbation of domestic violence (DV) by migration is a salient social determinant of poor mental health. Ecological models describe factors contributing to DV as operating at individual, family, cultural, and societal levels. We explored the interplay among these factors in an Indian community living in Melbourne, Australia, in a qualitative participatory action research study using a modified Forum Theater approach. We here present findings on connections between migration, societal factors, and social/family/cultural factors in DV. The study captured the voices of women living in the community as they describe how DV contributes to their emotional difficulties. Improved understanding of the sociocultural dynamics of DV and the associated social distress in this migrant Indian community can be used to guide the development of culturally sensitive prevention and response programs to assist migrant women from the Indian subcontinent who present with psychopathology and suicidal behaviors associated with DV.

Patients treated between 2001 and 2010 were linked with hospital, emergency (ED), outpatient mental health, and mortality records. Rates of health events were compared between the three groups using survival analysis and generalized estimating equations. Rates of suicide and ISH in patients treated with naltrexone were comparable to patients treated with methadone or buprenorphine. Rates of mental health and psychiatric hospital admissions, ED attendances, and outpatient mental health events were significantly lower in patients treated with methadone compared with naltrexone. Buprenorphine patients had higher rates of psychiatric admission, but lower rates of ED and outpatient mental health events compared with naltrexone patients. Naltrexone was associated with high rates of mental health events, however further controlled research is required.

AB This article introduces the role economics can play in deciding whether programs designed to prevent mental disorders, which carry large disease and economic burdens, are a worthwhile use of limited healthcare resources. Fortunately, preventive interventions for mental disorders exist; however, which interventions should be financed is a common issue facing decision makers, and economic evaluation can provide answers. Unfortunately, existing economic evaluations of preventive interventions have limited applicability to local healthcare contexts. An approach to priority setting largely based on economic techniques-Assessing Cost-Effectiveness (ACE)-has been developed and used in Australia to answer questions regarding the economic credentials of competing interventions. Eleven preventive interventions for mental disorders and suicide, mostly psychological in nature, have been evaluated using this approach, with many meeting the criteria of good value for money. Interventions targeting the prevention of suicide, adult and childhood depression, childhood anxiety, and early psychosis have particular merit.

AB Interest in focus group discussions has grown recently, and so has the recognition of them as a valuable method for qualitative data collection. Despite increasing popularity, they are not an easy option, and moderators must find appropriate ways to approach participants to achieve good-quality data. A path to reach this aim is the inclusion in the focus group agenda of some "exercises" (or activity-oriented questions) that are enjoyable and productive supplements to questions. Exercises provide a different way of gathering information and are beneficial, for instance, for more reflective participants. They can help focus the group's attention on the core study topic and also make subsequent comparative analysis more straightforward. They can also be helpful with young people and to discuss sensitive topics. The author describes and provides suggestions for use and examples of several exercises, illustrating their application in a research project investigating the cultural meaning of youth suicide in university students in Italy, India, and Australia.

AB Objective: To explore the relationship between Indigenous social disadvantage and serious mental illness.
   Conclusions: Rapidly changing patterns of mental disorders in Indigenous populations indicate the importance of social determinants. Canadian research on Native American suicide has demonstrated a clear link between social control factors and one mental health issue - completed suicide - a finding with major social policy implications. This work has not been replicable in Australia, reflecting the particular political and social circumstances of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations. Recent research motivated by clinicians' observations of an increase in psychotic disorders in the Indigenous populations of Cape York and the Torres Strait has demonstrated that the prevalence is high and that there are within-population differences. Given similar exposure to social disadvantage, these findings raise the possibility of utilising Indigenous psychosis prevalence as a metric to inform a more nuanced understanding of the predictors of wider vulnerability and resilience at a setting level, and as a policy and service development lever.

ID MORTALITY
AB This study attempts to measure premature mortality, in addition to overall death rates, in order to provide more information that can be used to develop and monitor health programmes that are aimed at reducing premature (often preventable) mortality in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Premature years of potential life lost (PYPLL) and valued years of potential life lost methods are applied for mortality data in NSW from 1990 to 2002. Variations in these measures for 2001 are studied further in terms of age, sex, urban/rural residence, and socio-economic status. PYPLL rates for all leading causes of death have declined. It is shown that the average male to female ratio of PYPLLs is highest for accidents, injury and poisoning (3.4:1) followed by mental disorders (2.7:1) and cardiovascular diseases (2.6:1). Although fewer women than men die of cardiovascular diseases, there is a greater proportionate importance of cerebrovascular mortality among women. In order to further reduce premature deaths, programs are required to improve the health of people living in lower socio-economic status areas, especially in rural NSW. Targeted regional or community level programs are required to reduce avoidable deaths due to accidents, injury and poisoning occasioned by motor vehicle accidents, poisoning and suicide among young adults.

AB Aims To compare the incidence, timing and risk factors for substance-related death between Indigenous and non-Indigenous ex-prisoners in Queensland, Australia. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting All adult prisons in the state of Queensland, Australia, linked to deaths registered in Australia. Participants/cases We obtained records for all adults released from prison in Queensland, Australia from 1 January 1994 to 31 December 2007. Among this cohort of 42015 individuals we observed 82315 releases from prison and 2158 deaths in the community by the end of 2007, of which 661 were substance-related deaths. Measurements Incarceration data were obtained from Queensland Corrective Services and linked probabilistically with deaths recorded in the Australian National Death Index. Findings In the first year after release, Indigenous ex-prisoners were more likely to die from alcohol-related causes [hazard ratio (HR)=1.9, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.1-3.1)] but less likely to die of drug-related causes (HR=0.34, 95%CI=0.21-0.53) than were non-Indigenous ex-prisoners. Among non-Indigenous prisoners only, the risk of substance-related death was significantly higher in the first 4 weeks [relative risk (RR)=5.1, 95% CI=3.7-6.9] when compared with the risk after 1 year post-release. Most evaluated risk factors for substance-related death were similar for Indigenous and non-Indigenous ex-prisoners; however, the hazard of death increased with age more for Indigenous ex-prisoners (HR=1.7 per decade of age, 95% CI=1.4-2.1) than for non-Indigenous ex-prisoners (HR=1.3, 95% CI=1.2-1.4). Conclusions In Australia, patterns of substance-related death in ex-prisoners differ markedly according to Indigenous status. Efforts to prevent substance-related deaths in ex-prisoners should consider heterogeneity in the target population and tailor responses accordingly.

AB BackgroundHow the mainstream news media report violence against women is significant if levels of violence are to be reduced and ultimately eliminated. Media reporting is an important indicator through which to measure progress towards shifting social and cultural norms that reinforce or challenge the place of violence against women in our society. The current study, therefore, aimed to establish a baseline picture of the extent and nature of reporting of violence against women by the mainstream Australian news media.MethodsDescriptive and content analysis of media reports on violence against women that were collected over four months in three states of Australia. Reports were from newspapers, broadcast (television and radio) and online news sites.ResultsCoverage of violence against women in the mainstream news media was extensive. Explicitly situating violent experiences for women within a broader social context was infrequent. Few news reports included information for women on where to seek help. Additionally, news reports rarely elevated the voices of survivors, advocates and other experts, with a disproportionate emphasis on law enforcement, political and criminal justice perspectives.ConclusionsDespite readiness among journalists and readers to engage in news about violence against women, reporting that promotes public understanding of the issue is not always the norm.

AB Introduction. Trauma, including suicide, accidental injury, motor traffic accidents, and homicides, accounts for 73% of all maternal deaths (early and late) in NSW annually. Late maternal deaths are underreported and are not as well documented or acknowledged as early deaths. Methods. Linked population datasets from births, hospital admissions, and death registrations were analysed for the period from 1 July 2000 to 31 December 2007. Results. There were 552 901 births and a total of 129 maternal deaths. Of these deaths, 37 were early deaths (early MMR of 6.7/100 000) and 92 occurred late (late MMR of 16.6/100 000). Sixty-seven percent of deceased women had a mental health diagnosis and/or a mental health issue related to substance abuse noted. A notable peak in deaths appeared to occur from 9 to 12 months following birth with the odds ratio of a woman dying of nonmedical causes within 9-12 months of birth being 3.8 (95% CI 1.55-9.01) when compared to dying within the first 3 months following birth. Conclusion. Perinatal services are often constructed to provide short-term support. Long-term identification and support of women at particular risk of maternal death due to suicide and trauma in the first year following birth may help lower the incidence of late maternal deaths.

AB Effects of nine social life indicators on age-adjusted and age-specific annual suicide mortality of male and female Japanese population in the years 1953-96 were investigated by multiple regression analysis on time series data. Unemployment rate was significantly related to the age-adjusted mortality in both males and females. Also, female labour force participation was positively related to the male mortality; persons and 65 and above was inversely related to the male mortality.

AB BackgroundWhile a downward trend in unintentional drowning deaths in Australia has been observed, little is known about intentional drowning mortality. Limited information on intentional drowning death impedes the planning, implementation, and evaluation of prevention strategies. This study aims to describe rates of intentional fatal drowning in Australia and compare these to other categories of drowning.MethodsData were sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) over a 9-year period (2006-2014). Rates and trends of intentional drowning were compared with unintentional, water-transport related and undetermined intent drowning. Rates of intentional drowning deaths across gender, age groups, states/territories, remoteness of residence and First Peoples of Australia were calculated. Relative risk (RR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) was calculated, and chi-square tests of independence were performed (p<0.05).ResultsThe crude mortality rate for intentional drowning deaths in Australia over the study period was 0.23/100000, lower than unintentional drowning (0.89/100000). Males were 1.6 (CI: 1.4-2.0) times more likely than females to intentionally drown, however females made up a significantly larger proportion of intentional drowning deaths (38.2%) compared to unintentional deaths (22.4%) ((2)=47.3; df=1; p<0.05). A significant linear association between age group and intentional drowning was observed ((2)=131.3; p<0.05), with individuals aged 75years and over 32.6 times more likely to intentionally drown. Non-Indigenous peoples were 4.1 times more likely to intentionally drown in comparison to First Peoples of Australia. Residents of Inner Regional, Outer Regional, and Major Cities were 4.2 times (CI: 0.6-30.0), 4.1 times (CI: 0.6-29.9), and 4.0 times (CI: 0.6-28.6) more likely to intentionally drown, respectively, compared with residents of Very Remote areas.ConclusionsThis study adds to the limited evidence currently available about intentional drowning rates and trends in Australia. Being male, of older age groups, non-Indigenous, residing in Inner and Outer Regional areas, and Major Cities were risk factors for intentional drowning deaths. Improving data collection systems and furthering understanding of the risk factors of intentional drowning, as well as the development, implementation, and evaluation of prevention programmes, are required to reduce the risk of intentional drowning death in Australia.

AB Background: This study estimates the frequency of different end-of-life decisions (ELDs) in medical practice in the UK, compares these with other countries and assesses doctors' views on the adequacy of current UK law. Method: Postal survey of 857 UK medical practitioners using a questionnaire used in other countries. Findings: The proportion of UK deaths involving an ELD were: 1) voluntary euthanasia 0.16% (0-0.36), 2) physician-assisted suicide 0.00%, 3) ending of life without an explicit request from patient 0.33% (0-0.76), 4) alleviation of symptoms with possibly life shortening effect 32.8% (28.1-37.6), 5) non-treatment decisions 30.3% (26.0-34.6). ELDs 1 and 2 were significantly less frequent than in the Netherlands and Australia; ELD 2 was also less frequent than Switzerland. ELD 3 was less frequent than in Belgium and Australia. Comparison of UK and New Zealand general practitioners showed lower rates of ELDs 4 and 5 in the UK. ELD 5 was more common than in most other European countries. A few doctors attending deaths felt UK law had inhibited or interfered with their preferred management of patients (4.6% (3.1-6.1%) of doctors) or that a new law would have facilitated better management (2.6% (1.4-3.8%) of doctors). Interpretation: The lower relative rate of ELDs involving doctor-assisted dying in the UK, and the relatively high rate of non-treatment decisions, suggests a culture of medical, decision making informed by a palliative care philosophy.

AB Objective: To compare the nature and prevalence of mental health problems, prevalence of suicidal ideation and behaviour, and health-related quality of life of 13-17-year-olds on remand with that of 13-17-year-olds in the general community.
   Method: Self reported questionnaires completed by 13-17-year-olds who were remanded in South Australia in 2008/9 (N = 159), 13-17-year-olds who participated in the Child and Adolescent Component of the National Survey of Mental Health and Well-being in Australia (N = 1283), and 13-17-year-olds who participated in the Western Australian Aboriginal Child Health Survey (N = 1100). Mental health problems were identified using the Youth Self-Report and the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the Child Health Questionnaire.
   Results: A total of 50.0% (95% CI, 42.3-58.3) of adolescents on remand versus 18.9% of adolescents in the community scored above the recommended cut-off score on the Youth Self-Report. Among Indigenous adolescents, 55.8% (95% CI, 41.3-69.5) on remand versus 32.1% in the community scored above the recommended cut-off score on the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. Among those on remand, 19.1% (95% CI, 13.2-26.2) reported making a suicide attempt during the previous 12 months compared to 4.3% in the community. Health-related quality of life was significantly worse among adolescents on remand than adolescents in the community. These differences remained after adjusting for differences in the demographic characteristics of the two groups of adolescents.
   Conclusions: Compared with adolescents in the community, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous adolescents on remand experience a wide range of problems, including poorer mental and physical health, a higher prevalence of suicidal ideation and behaviour, greater family adversity, and poorer school attendance. This broad range of problems needs to be effectively addressed to enable adolescents on remand to become active and productive members of their communities.

TI End-of-life decisions in medical practice in Flanders, Belgium: a
   nationwide survey
SO LANCET
LA English
DT Article
ID PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; MAIL SURVEYS; EUTHANASIA; NETHERLANDS
AB Background Our study is a repeat of the Dutch death-certificate study on end-of-life decisions (ELDs). The main objective was to estimate the frequency of euthanasia (the administration of lethal drugs with the explicit intention of shortening the patient's life at the patient's explicit request), physician-assisted suicide (PAS), and other ELDs in medical practice in Flanders, Belgium.
   Methods A 20% random sample of 3999 deaths was selected from all deaths recorded between Jan 1 and April 30, 1998. The physicians who signed the corresponding death certificates received one questionnaire by post per death.
   Findings The physicians' response rate was 1355 (52%). 1925 deaths were described. The results were corrected for non-response bias, and extrapolated to estimated annual rates after seasonal adjustment for death causes, and we estimate that 705 (1.3%, 95% CI 1.0-1.6) deaths resulted from euthanasia or PAS. In 1796 (3.2%, 2.7-3.8) cases, lethal drugs were given without the explicit request of the patient. Alleviation of pain and symptoms with opioids in doses with a potential life-shortening effect preceded death in 10 416 (18.5%, 17.3-19.7) cases and non-treatment decisions in 9218 (16.4%, 15.3-17.5) cases, of which 3261 (5.8%, 5.1-6.5) with the explicit intention of ending the patient's life.
   Interpretation ELDs are prominent in medical practice in Flanders. The frequency of deaths preceded by an ELD is similar to that in the Netherlands, but lower than that in Australia. However, in Flanders the rate of administration of lethal drugs to patients without their explicit request is similar to Australia, and significantly higher than that in the Netherlands.

AB The common co-occurrence of substance misuse and other psychiatric disorders and their intricate relationships have led to major community-based epidemiological studies in the US which showed high rates of current and lifetime comorbidity. Moreover, studies of clinical populations conducted in North America, Europe and Australia, showed even higher rates of comorbidity. The aetology of this comorbidity has also been investigated and important models have emerged with findings that inform its assessment and treatment. Future epidemiological studies should focus on the study of concurrent conditions rather than lifetime ones using research diagnostic instruments with high reliability providing information on a number of key outcomes.

   cultures, embodied expression and the social bases of belonging
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Bauman; gender cultures; kinship; loneliness; phenomenology; public
   realm
AB Recent quantitative investigations consistently single out considerable gender variations in the experience of loneliness in Australia, and in particular how men are especially prone to protracted and serious episodes of loneliness. In 2017 the Director of Lifeline implicated loneliness as a significant factor in suicide among Australian men - currently three times the rate of suicide among women. Compared to women men also struggle to talk about loneliness or seek help from a range of informal and professional sources. We know very little about men's experience of loneliness or why they are so susceptible to it currently and research is urgently needed in order to design specific interventions for them. To date, psychology has dominated the theoretical research on loneliness but in this article we argue that sociology has a key role to play in broadening out the theoretical terrain of this understanding so as to create culturally informed interventions. Most researchers agree that loneliness occurs when belongingess needs remain unmet, yet it is also acknowledged that such needs are culturally specific and changing. We need to understand how loneliness and gender cultures configure for men; how they are located in different ethnic, class and age cohort cultures as well as the changing social/economic/spatial/public/institutional bases for belonging across Australia. Theoretical enquiry must encompass the broader social structural narratives (Bauman, Giddens and Sennett) and link these to the changing nature of belonging in everyday life - across the public sphere, the domestic sphere, work, in kinship systems, housing and settlement patterns, associational life, in embodied relationships and online.

TI Using participatory action research to prevent suicide in Aboriginal and
   Torres Strait Islander communities
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PRIMARY HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB The National Empowerment Project is an innovative Aboriginal-led community empowerment project that has worked with eight Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities across Australia over the period 2012-13. The aim of the Project was to develop, deliver and evaluate a program to: (1) promote positive social and emotional well-being to increase resilience and reduce the high reported rates of psychological distress and suicide among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; and (2) empower communities to take action to address the social determinants that contribute to psychological distress, suicide and self-harm. Using a participatory action research approach, the communities were supported to identify the risk factors challenging individuals, families and communities, as well as strategies to strengthen protective factors against these challenges. Data gathered during Stage 1 were used to develop a 12-month program to promote social and emotional well-being and build resilience within each community. A common framework, based on the social and emotional well-being concept, was used to support each community to target community-identified protective factors and strategies to strengthen individual, family and community social and emotional well-being. Strengthening the role of culture is critical to this approach and marks an important difference between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non-Indigenous mental health promotion and prevention activities, including suicide prevention. It has significant implications for policy makers and service providers and is showing positive impact through the translation of research into practice, for example through the development of a locally run empowerment program that aims to address the social determinants of health and their ongoing negative impact on individuals, families and communities. It also provides a framework in which to develop and strengthen culture, connectedness and foster self-determination, through better-informed policy based on community-level holistic responses and solutions as opposed to an exclusive focus on single-issue deficit approaches.

TI The intention to hasten death: a survey of attitudes and practices of

AB Objective: To determine attitudes among surgeons in Australia to assisted death, and the proportion of surgeons who have intentionally hastened death with or without an explicit request.
   Design: Anonymous, cross-sectional, mail-out survey between August and November 1999
   Participants. 683 out of 992 eligible general surgeons (68.9% response rate).
   Main outcome measures: Proportion of respondents answering affirmatively to questions about administering excessive doses of medication with an intention to hasten death.
   Results: 247 respondents (36.2%; 95% Cl, 32.6%-39.9%) reported that, for the purpose of relieving a patient's suffering, they have given drugs in doses that they perceived to be greater than those required to relieve symptoms with the intention of hastening death. More than half of these (139 respondents; 20.4% of all respondents; 95% Cl, 17.4%-23.6%) reported that they had never received an unambiguous request for a lethal dose of medication. Of all respondents, only 36 (5.3%; 95% Cl, 2.9%-6.1%) reported that they had given a bolus lethal injection, or had provided the means to commit suicide, in response to an unambiguous request.
   Conclusions. More than a third of surgeons surveyed reported giving drugs with an intention to hasten death, often in the absence of an explicit request. However, in many instances, this may involve the use of an infusion of analgesics or sedatives, and such actions may be difficult to distinguish from accepted palliative care, except on the basis of the doctor's self-reported intention. Legal and moral distinctions based solely on a doctor's intention are problematic.

AB It is increasingly necessary to quantify the impacts of climate change on populations, and to quantify the effectiveness of mitigation and adaptation strategies. Despite growing interest in the health effects of climate change, the relationship between mental health and climate change has received little attention in research or policy. Here, we outline current thinking about climate change and mental health, and discuss crucial limitations in modern epidemiology for examining this issue. A systems approach, complemented by a new style of research thinking and leadership, can help align the needs of this emerging field with existing and research policy agendas.

AB Purpose: To evaluate the impact of parent education groups on youth suicide risk factors. The potential for informal transmission of intervention impacts within school communities was assessed.
   Methods: Parent education groups were offered to volunteers from 14 high schools that were closely matched to 14 comparison schools. The professionally led groups aimed to empower parents to assist one another to improve communication skills and relationships with adolescents. Australian 8th-grade students (aged 14 years) responded to classroom surveys repeated at baseline and after 3 months. Logistic regression was used to test for intervention impacts on adolescent substance use, deliquency, self-harm behavior, and depression. There were no differences between the intervention (n = 305) and comparison (n = 272) samples at baseline on the measures of depression, health behavior, or family relationships.
   Results: Students in the intervention schools demonstrated increased maternal care (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.9), reductions in conflict with parents (AOR .5), reduced substance use (AOR .5 to .6), and less delinquency (AOR .2). Parent education group participants were more likely to be sole parents and their children reported higher rates of substance use at baseline. Intervention impacts revealed a dose-response with the largest impacts associated with directly participating parents, but significant impacts were also evident for others in the intervention schools. Where best friend dyads were identified, the best friend's positive family relationships reduced subsequent substance use among respondents. This and other social contagion processes were posited to explain the transfer of positive impacts beyond the minority of directly participating families.
   Conclusions: A whole-school parent education intervention demonstrated promising impacts on a range of risk behaviors and protective factors relevant to youth self-harm and suicide. (C) Society for Adolescent Medicine, 2002.

AB Objective Eating disorders are known to have high comorbidity, and the current report outlines the impact of an online eating disorder risk reduction program on brief, self-report measures of depressive symptoms, alcohol and other drug use, and suicidality. Method An online pragmatic, randomized-controlled trial was conducted with N = 316 young-women (M age = 20.80 years) across Australia and New Zealand. Media Smart-Targeted (MS-T) was a 9-module program released weekly while control participants received positive body image tips. Prevention effects (asymptomatic at baseline) and treatment effects (symptomatic at baseline) were investigated. Results MS-T participants were 94% and 91% less likely than controls to develop Moderate or higher depressive symptoms at 6-month (MS-T = 3.3%; controls = 35.4%) and 12-month follow-up (MS-T = 3.4%; controls = 29.4%), respectively. MS-T participants did not commence using recreational drugs at any assessment point, compared to 18.2% of controls at a least one assessment point. Regarding treatment effects, MS-T participants were 84% more likely to no longer be using recreational drugs at 12-month follow-up (MS-T = 60%; controls = 21.1%). Mutitvariate logistic regressions revealed group, depressive symptoms and alcohol use to be significant predictors of elevated suicide risk, where being an MS-T participant, without depressive symptoms and not drinking alcohol, significantly lowered likelihood of developing elevated suicide risk. Disordered eating at post-program mediated the relationship between group and depressive symptoms across post-program to 12-mnoth follow-up. Discussion MS-T shows promise as a program with important mental health benefits in addition to previous reports of lowered eating disorder diagnosis, risk and impairment.

ID TRAUMA
AB Indigenous Australian women are among the most disadvantaged women in the world. Over two centuries of colonization have had a damaging impact on perceptions of their gender roles and status as well as many other consequential oppressions. These experiences have affected the social and emotional wellbeing of Indigenous women of all ages, resulting in socio-economic ghettoization, higher suicide rates, psychological distress, illness, and poverty. Generations of women have experienced the forced removal of their children, resulting in complex forms of historical trauma. Despite this, Indigenous women have also maintained strong leadership roles and have kept families and communities intact. In the last few decades, the Australian Indigenous mental health movement has emerged within the context of a broader self-determination movement, restoring and strengthening women's traditional therapeutic practices. This article offers an overview of the social and emotional wellbeing of Indigenous women within neocolonial Australia and explores women's relationship to traditional therapeutic practices. Future directions and key issues for the capacity building of Indigenous women's healing are explored.

AB Australia has a vibrant rural farming community and has supplied agricultural products of world-class standards to both local and international markets. A range of factors including drought, globalisation of markets and farming, and population movements have posed profound challenges to farming communities in Australia. While not unique to rural farming communities, in this context, related issues such as isolation, depression, and suicide are further straining the fabric of such communities. To engage with these issues, this paper proposes an analytic and conceptual framework to uncover the transformations and possible mutation in social capital in farming communities. Existing research shows that social capital is a critical feature of healthy and sustainable communities, providing a means through which people connect with each other, and build both individual and cooperative relationships. The conceptual framework proposed in this paper extends such work by considering, first, the emerging importance of virtual social capital in the upkeep of rural communities by substituting for traditional in-person social capital, and, second, how social capital may change over time.

AB Men are over-reported in the statistics for premature death in Australia for all major causes of ill health and accident. While general health is poor, male suicide is also a significant public health issue. Notwithstanding these concerns research shows that men are reluctant to engage in information seeking to enhance their health and wellbeing. This paper reports on aspects of a small pilot study that investigated the information behaviour of a group of Australian men who had faced a significant stressful life event. The paper provides background to some of the theoretical concerns evident within the scholarship of human information behaviour as it relates to the world of the everyday, particularly for hard-to-reach groups. It also discusses the strengths and weaknesses of current information delivery and support to Australian men across the lifespan. As a result of the findings from the study, the potential opportunities for Australian library and information professionals to have a broader presence in the development and delivery of everyday life information products are discussed.

AB In the context of an European collaborative research project (EURELD), a study on attitudes towards medical end-of-life decisions was conducted among physicians in Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. Australia also joined the consortium. A written questionnaire with structured questions was sent to practising physicians from specialties frequently involved in the care of dying patients. 10,139 questionnaires were studied. Response rate was equal to or larger than 50% in all countries except Italy (39%). Apart from general agreement with respect to the alleviation of pain and symptoms with possible life-shortening effect, there was large variation in support-between and within countries-for medical decision that may result in the hastening of death. A principal component factor analysis found that 58% of the variance of the responses is explained by four factors. 'Country' explained the largest part of the variation of the standardized factor scores. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Falls are the 18th major cause of death in Australia. The intention of this study was to provide a comprehensive understanding of fatal falls in an Australian context through documenting the circumstances of fall-related deaths and investigating the characteristics surrounding those falls. A retrospective review of fatal falls in the state of Victoria from 2005 to 2014 was undertaken using the National Coronial Information System online database. Details recorded for each fatal fall case comprised the circumstances of the fall (year and month of fall, fall type, and manner and cause of death) and characteristics of the deceased (sex, age, body mass index, pre-existing conditions and psychoactive drug use). There were 2743 fatal falls, encompassing falls from a bed, chair, height (>3m), horse, ladder, low height (3m), motor vehicle, stair(s), standing, toilet, wheelchair and unspecified. The majority of falls were accidental (95.5%), indirectly contributed to the fatality (66.4%), were female (53.2%), elderly (61+years) (92.3%) and of a healthy weight (33.3%). Many had pre-existing conditions (86.8%) and several (19%) had psychoactive drug use. Findings are anticipated to contribute to prevention policy improvements and assist medico-legal death investigations.

DT Article
DE health; inequality; mortality; homicide; suicide
ID INCOME INEQUALITY; POPULATION HEALTH; ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; DETERMINANT;
   TRENDS
AB We investigate whether changes in economic inequality affect mortality in rich countries. To answer this question we use a new source of data on income inequality: tax data on the share of pretax income going to the richest 10% of the population in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US between 1903 and 2003. Although this measure is not a good proxy for inequality within the bottom half of the income distribution, it is a good proxy for changes in the top half of the distribution and for the Gini coefficient. In the absence of country and year fixed effects, the income share of the top decile is negatively related to life expectancy and positively related to infant mortality. However, in our preferred fixed-effects specification these relationships are weak, statistically insignificant, and likely to change their sign. Nor do our data suggest that changes in the income share of the richest 10% affect homicide or suicide rates. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A major issue in the care of terminally ill patients is communication and information provision. This paper reports the extent to which physicians in Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland discuss topics relevant to end of life care with terminally ill patients and their relatives (without first informing the patient), and possible associations between physician-specific characteristics and such discussions. Response rates to the postal survey ranged from 39% to 68% (n = 10139). Physicians in most of the countries except Italy in principle, always' discuss issues related to terminal illness with their patients but not with patients' relatives without first informing the patient, unless the relatives ask. Cross-national differences remained strong after controlling for physician characteristics. The majority of physicians appeared to support the principle of patient-centred care to terminally ill patients, consistent with palliative care philosophy and with the law and/or professional guidelines in most of the countries studied.

AB Previous studies have linked poor mental human health with environmental degradation, but none have assessed additional diseases that may co-exist with these mental disorders. In previous work, depression was found to be associated with a major form of environmental degradation; dryland salinity. However, little is known about diseases co-morbid with depression in this environmental setting. In rural Australia, dryland salinity is a major form of environmental degradation contributing widely to deterioration and non-viability of farmland. Using georeferenced health record data, Bayesian spatial methods were used to determine the relationship between dryland salinity and a range of human health outcomes. Initial modelling found an increased relative risk for asthma, suicide and ischaemic heart disease in relation to dryland salinity (adjusted for Indigenous and socio-economic status). However, in this follow-up study, a further evaluation of the role of co-morbidities in this population revealed that: (i) the presence of depression was consistently linked to residence in areas with high salinity and (ii) the association of asthma, suicide and heart disease with salinity was most likely attributable to the co-morbidity of the conditions with depression. Given the predicted increase in dryland salinity and the elevated relative risk of depression in impacted areas, the relative risk of the co-morbid conditions can be expected to increase in rural areas in the future, further adding to the burden of disease associated with environmental degradation.

AB The authors assessed the risks of drug-related death, suicide, and homicide after release from New York City jails in 155,272 people who were incarcerated anytime from 2001 through 2005 and examined whether the mortality rate was associated with homelessness. Using jail records matched with death and single-adult homeless registries in New York City, they calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and relative risks. After adjustment for age, sex, race, and neighborhood, the risks of drug-related death and homicide in formerly incarcerated persons were 2 times higher than those of New York City residents who had not been incarcerated in New York City jails during the study period. These relative risks were greatly elevated during the first 2 weeks after release (for drug-related causes, SMR = 8.0, 95% confidence interval (CI): 5.2, 11.8; for homicide, SMR = 5.1, 95% CI: 3.2, 7.8). Formerly incarcerated people with histories of homelessness had higher rates of drug-related death (RR = 3.4, 95% CI: 2.1, 5.5) and suicide (RR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.2, 3.4) than did persons without such histories. For individuals who died of drug-related causes, longer jail stays were associated with a shorter time until death after release. These results suggest that jail- and community-based interventions are needed to reduce the excess mortality risk among formerly incarcerated people.

AB Access to Allied Psychological Services is a primary mental health programme targeting hard-to-reach populations throughout Australia. This research aims to identify patterns of referrals to the programme in the Western Sydney Primary Health Network region from 2012 to 2015. The referral rates were analysed by using spatial autocorrelation indexes and spatial regression. The study area was described through the identification of the most disadvantaged areas and through consideration of three socio-economic indicators: percentage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, low educational attainment and low weekly incomes. A large hot spot (identifying high referral rates) was located across the duration of the study in the south-western urban area that partially covered a disadvantaged area. The main cold spot (identifying low referral rates) was located in the south-eastern urban area, covering another disadvantaged area, however critically this association disappeared over time. Our modelling showed that the referral rates had a direct association with the percentage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with low incomes, and an indirect association with low educational attainment. The results and technique are useful in monitoring and addressing inequality in health planning and policy.

AB Background
   Acute alcohol consumption is a major risk factor for suicide, therefore investigating factors associated with alcohol-related self-harm warrant attention.
   Aims
   To investigate the influence of prescribed psyChotropic medications on the odds of co-ingesting alcohol preceding or during intentional efforts to self-poison.
   Method
   A cross-sectional analysis of consecutive hospital presentations following intentional self-poisoning was conducted. A total of 7270 patients (4363 women) aged 18-96 were included.
   Results
   The odds of alcohol co-ingestion were increased in those not prescribed any medication (odds ratio (OR) = 1.27, 99% CI 1.10-1.46, P<0.001) and in impulsive self-poisonings (OR= 1.39, 99% CI 1.11-1.74, P<0.001). Odds were decreased in those prescribed anticonvulsants (OR=0.69, 99% CI 0.51-0.93), antipsychotics (OR=0.55, 99% CI 0.45-0.66) and antidepressants (OR=0.87, 99% CI 0.77-0.99).
   Conclusions
   Findings indicate that being medicated for a psychiatric illness may reduce the likelihood of alcohol consumption during times of acute distress, hence perhaps may reduce the risk of intentional self-poisoning.

AB Background: People who inject drugs (PWID) are at disproportionately high risk of suicidal behaviors, as are individuals who report same-sex attraction or experience. However, there is little evidence of compounded risk of suicide for individuals who report same-sex sexual intercourse (SSI) and are PWID. Objectives: To explore the associations of lifetime intentional overdose amongst a cohort of PWID, with particular attention to those reporting SSI. Methods: The sample included 529 participants, from an ongoing cohort of 757 PWID. An ever SSI variable was created for participants who reported sexual intercourse with a same-sex partner at any longitudinal interview. We explored the adjusted associations between SSI and lifetime intentional overdose using logistic regression. Results: Ninety-one (17%) participants reported ever experiencing an intentional overdose. Forty-one (8%) participants reported SSI at any interview. Three hundred and sixty (68%) participants reported diagnosis of a mental health condition. Diagnosis of a mental health condition (AOR = 2.02, 95% CIs: 1.14, 3.59) and SSI (AOR = 2.58, 95% CIs: 1.22, 5.48) significantly increased the odds of lifetime intentional overdose. Conclusions/Importance: We found a heightened risk of intentional overdose amongst PWID reporting SSI, after controlling for diagnosis of a mental health condition. Services need to be aware of this heightened risk and target interventions appropriately.

AB Background Research has identified that members of the veterinary profession are at high risk of occupational stress, burnout, poor psychological wellbeing and an elevated rate of suicide. Although scholarly interest in veterinarians has increased in recent years, relatively few studies have specifically examined the emotional work in veterinary interactions and what effect dealing with companion animal owners' grief has on the wellbeing of veterinarians. The purpose of this study was to determine if dealing with bereaved clients affected the psychological wellbeing of veterinarians. The concept of compassion fatigue was explored, including whether veterinarians believed that their training had equipped them for communicating with grieving clients. Methods Veterinary surgeons registered in South Australia in 2015 were invited to complete an online survey, with 105 participants responding. Results Many participants, particularly female and younger veterinarians, were experiencing mild to severe psychological distress and nearly half of the sample was experiencing high to very high levels of compassion fatigue. No participants reported seeking psychological or other professional mental health support and the majority had not referred a grieving client to a psychologist or other mental health professional. A significant proportion of veterinarians felt their own mental health was affected by dealing with clients grieving the loss of a companion animal. Discussion The findings are discussed in terms of increasing the wellbeing of veterinarians through improved curriculum training and workplace health promotion, particularly considering the high suicide rate reported for the profession.

AB Background: Young men are consistently less likely to seek help for mental health problems than their female peers. This is particularly concerning given the high rates of suicide among male adolescents. The school system has been identified as an ideal setting for the implementation of prevention and early intervention programs for young people. The current trial aims to determine the effectiveness of the Silence is Deadly program in increasing positive help-seeking intentions for mental health problems and suicide among male secondary school students.
   Methods: This study is a two-arm, cluster-randomised, controlled trial that will compare the Silence is Deadly program to a wait-list control condition. Eight Australian high schools will be recruited to the trial, with male students in grades 11 and 12 (16 to 18 years of age) targeted for participation. The program is an innovative male-tailored suicide prevention intervention, comprising a presentation that emphasises role-modelling and legitimises help-seeking for personal and emotional problems, and a brief video that features celebrity athletes who counter existing male norms around help-seeking and encourage communication about personal and emotional issues. The program also includes a discussion of how to help a friend in distress and ends with a question and answer session. The primary outcome measure for the current study is help-seeking intentions. Secondary outcomes include help-seeking behaviour, help-seeking attitudes, help-seeking stigma, mental health symptoms, and suicidal ideation. Data will be collected pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at 3-month follow-up. Primary analyses will compare changes in help-seeking intentions for the intervention condition relative to the wait-list control condition using mixed-effects repeatedmeasures analyses that account for clustering within schools.
   Discussion: If proven to be effective, this targeted help-seeking intervention for adolescent males, which is currently only delivered in one jurisdiction, could be more widely delivered in Australian high schools. The Silence is Deadly program has the potential to significantly contribute to the mental health of young men in Australia by improving help-seeking for suicidality and mental health problems, allowing this population to better access treatment and support sooner.

TI Non-communicable disease and injury-related mortality on rural and urban
   place of residence - A comparison between Canada and Australia
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SANTE PUBLIQUE
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH; US; WOMEN
AB Background: Few published studies looking at cross-national comparisons of rural-urban health status are available. As a first step towards addressing the lack of information on how rural populations in Canada compare with rural populations elsewhere in the world, this paper examines and contrasts Canadian mortality risks of selected diseases in rural and urban areas with those of Australia.
   Methods: Age-standardized mortality ratios for selected causes of deaths were calculated at the national level and broken down into place of residence categories using country-specific definitions of rurality (Metropolitan Influence Zones in Canada and the Australian Standard Geographical Classification [ASGC] Remoteness in Australia).
   Results: Patterns of rural-urban mortality risk were mostly similar in both countries. However, depending on the causes of death examined, important differences were found Mortality from motor vehicle accidents, suicide and a few cancer sites showed similar urban-rural gradients in both Canada and Australia. Notable differences were found for diabetes, all cancers combined, as well as lung and colorectal cancer. Rural Australians were at higher risk of dying from these diseases than their urban counterparts, whereas rural Canadians were at lower risk than urban Canadians.
   Discussion: Overall, the patterns that have emerged from this comparison of Canadian and Australian mortality risks suggest that health status disparities between rural and urban populations are not limited to a specific country or region of the world. However, there are also important differences between the two countries, as the geographic mortality patterns varied according to sex and according to disease category. This analysis is an initial step in promoting discussion of rural health in an international context.

AB Gender-based fatal violence (femicide) is a preventable cause of premature death. The Counting Dead Women Australia (CDWA) campaign is a femicide census counting violent deaths of women in Australia from 2014. We conducted a cross-sectional in-depth review of CDWA cases Jan-Dec 2014 to establish evidence of antecedent factors and describe femicide in Australia. Victim (n=81) and perpetrator (n=83) data were extracted from the CDWA register, law databases and coronial reports. Mixed methods triangulation of socio-demographic and incident characteristics. Women ranged in age from 20 to 82years of age (44 +/- 15.4). There were 83 perpetrators, of which 13 were unknown (not yet apprehended). Known perpetrators (n=70) ranged in age from 16 to 72years of age (40 +/- 12.7) and 89% were male (62/70). The location of the crime was most frequently the victim's home (49/70). In cases where the relationship between the victim and perpetrator was known (n=59), over half of femicides were committed by intimate-partners (33/59). Intimate-partner perpetrators were more likely to have a history of violence and commit murder-suicide than other perpetrators. Femicide is overwhelmingly perpetrated by males, with women most vulnerable in their own home and with their intimate partners. Furthermore, intimate-partner femicide is associated with modifiable risk factors, including previous violence and mental health issues, which represents opportunities for early intervention within healthcare settings as practitioners are well-placed to identify risk and provide support. In line with recommendations for multi-sectoral approach, future research should target identification of risk and protective factors, and improved coordination of data collection.

ID SYMPTOMS; SMOKING
AB Healthy risk-taking is a normal part of adolescence.
   Young people who participate in multiple risk-taking increase the chance of damaging their health.
   There appears to be a growing range and prevalence of health-risk behaviours among young women, notably in their use of alcohol and marijuana.
   Research suggests that such health-risk behaviours may be related to psychological factors such as stress and depression.
   General practitioners have a central role in identifying and preventing health-risk behaviours and associated mental health problems in young people.
   Comprehensive assessment includes a series of screening questions about home, education (or employment), activities, drugs, sexuality and suicide for young people, known as the HEADSS technique.

AB Despite considerable rhetoric, comprehensive primary health, care remains largely a matter of a paper exercise. The theory promotes borizontal and vertical integration and the active participation of people in planning. Experience in Australia and elsewhere indicates that what is in place in health, services is often primary medical care: the management of the needs of presenting individuals. The arguments for upstream interventions remain valid, bolstered by research on the social determinants of health. Two examples are given of primary health care that attempt to work upstream, before clinical interventions become necessary and illustrate the need for both horizontal and vertical integration. Consequences for policy and training are drawn.

   CHRONIC PAIN; BEHAVIOR; HEALTH; MODEL
AB Objective: Although traumatic injuries affect millions of patients each year and increase risk for psychiatric disorder, no evidence currently exists regarding associated suicidal risk. This study reports a longitudinal investigation of suicidal risk in the 2 years after traumatic injury.
   Methods: A prospective design cohort study was conducted in 4 major trauma hospitals across Australia. A total of 1,129 traumatically injured patients were assessed during hospital admission between April 2004 and February 2006 and were followed up at 3 months (88%), 12 months (77%), and 24 months (72%). Lifetime psychiatric disorder was assessed in hospital using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, version 5.5, which was also used to assess the prevalence of suicidality, psychiatric disorder, and exposure to adverse life events at 3, 12, and 24 months after traumatic injury.
   Results: Approximately 6% of patients reported moderate/high suicidal risk at each assessment. At each assessment, half of suicidal patients reported no suicidal risk at the previous assessment. Suicidality at 24 months was predicted by current pain levels (odds ratio [OR] = 1.16; 95% CI, 1.09-1.23), recent life events (OR = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.17-1.44), and current psychiatric disorder (OR = 17.07; 95% CI, 7.03-41.42), whereas only 36.6% of suicidal patients had consulted a mental health professional in the previous month, and 66.2% had consulted a primary care physician.
   Conclusions: Suicidal risk affects a significant proportion of patients who experience a traumatic injury, and the risk for suicide fluctuates markedly in the initial years following the injury. Primary care physicians need to be trained to assess for suicidal risk in the initial years after a traumatic injury. (C) Copyright 2016 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB The protection of confidentiality in psychological practice is vital. However, confidentiality is not absolute and psychologists are permitted to breach confidentiality under particular circumstances. Ethical challenges surrounding confidentiality are complex with adolescent clients, as assessments often consider the risk that adolescents pose to themselves in addition to the risk posed to others. The current study documented situations in which Australian psychologists would breach adolescents' confidentiality to disclose information about risk behaviour to parents, with a focus on situations where adolescents posed a risk to themselves as opposed to other people putting adolescents at risk. A total of 264 Australian psychologists were surveyed online. They were each presented with 68 variations of a vignette about a 15-year-old boy who was engaged in risk behaviour and were asked whether they would breach confidentiality in each case. The vignettes covered six behavioural domains (smoking, sexual behaviour, drinking, drug use, suicide, stealing) and varied in behaviour intensity, frequency and duration. Consensus was reached about breaching confidentiality in 16% of cases (related to sexual behaviour, drug use, and suicide). Consensus was reached about not breaching confidentiality in 41% of cases (relating to smoking, sexual behaviour, drug use, suicide, and stealing). In the remaining 43% of cases, significant disagreement occurred (relating to all six behavioural domains). The findings suggest a high degree of variation in opinion about confidentiality with adolescents, emphasising the importance of transparent communication and informed consent. The findings also raise questions about how important consistency of psychological practice is across Australia.

AB Introduction. Drug overdose (OD) is a frequent incident among opiate addicts. Survivors of ODs are at risk for additional and eventually fatal ODs. ODs may be classified as accidental (aOD) or deliberate (dOD). Investigations into the connection between OD and suicide attempts have led to insconsistent results. Purpose. (1) to determine how many non-fatal ODs were dODs and how many were aODs; (2) to determine how many cases of dODs were motivated by explicit or by ambivalent suicidal intentions; (3) to determine how many cases of aODs had causes that might respond to preventative measures; (4) to compare the addiction histories of dODs and aODs; (5) to compare the drugs causing the ODs; and (6) to compare the severity of the ODs in both groups. Methods. Prospective study utilizing a standardized questionnaire to evaluate opiate-addicted patients admitted to our treatment unit for OD. All cases underwent standardized drug testing to identify drug use patterns. Results. Seventy-four cases of OD underwent standardized interviews after awakening. Forty-three percent of the cases were dOD. Cases of dOD had significantly more OA in substitution programs, more previous ODs, and more often consumed methadone and cocaine. Among dODs, 22.5% had suicidal intention and 9.6% were ambivalent about committing suicide; background motivations were most often conflicts with spouses. Fifty-seven percent of the cases were aOD. Cases of aODs had significantly more potential lethal intoxications and had heroin detected more frequently. aODs happened with unexpected pure heroin (46%), in combination with alcohol (36%), as relapse after abstinence (40%) or after institutionalized treatment (19%). This group should be accessible for targeted education.

TI Physicians' attitudes towards euthanasia in Kuwait
SO MEDICAL PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE
LA English

DE mercy killing; euthanasia; physician-assisted suicide; Kuwait
ID ASSISTED SUICIDE; LIFE; END
AB Objectives: The attitudes of physicians in Kuwait towards euthanasia were examined. An additional objective was to examine whether physician characteristics such as nationality, qualifications, years of experience and/or religion affect their attitude toward euthanasia. A comparison was also made between the experience of physicians who generally treat terminally ill patients and those who generally treat non-terminally ill patients in terms of attitudes toward hastening death to alleviate suffering. Methods: A descriptive study using a self-administered questionnaire was conducted among 228 physicians working in 5 selected government hospitals. The response was 92%. Results: Nearly 92% of all the respondents did not support the provision of means for terminally ill patients to commit suicide while 8% did. A majority favored providing pain killers and comfort even if this hastens the patient's death. About 20% of the physicians felt that the Ministry of Health should allow euthanasia under certain restricted conditions. About 47% of Hindu, 23% of Christian and 17% of Muslim physicians agreed to the legalization of euthanasia. Approximately 27% of physicians who were frequently exposed and 10% of those who were rarely exposed to terminally ill patients reported that they had been asked to hasten death. Physicians in Kuwait have not dealt with euthanasia as much as physicians in other countries such as Australia and are much less favorable towards it. Conclusion: The findings of this survey indicate that a minority of physicians in Kuwait believe that euthanasia should be legalized under certain conditions. Thus, there is a need for the medical community and the Ministry of Health to recognize and deal with this controversial topic. Copyright (C) 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Objective: A cross-sectional study of gender specific relationships between self-reported child sexual abuse and suicidality in a community sample of adolescents.
   Method: Students aged 14 years on average (N = 2,485) from 27 schools in South Australia completed a questionnaire including items on sexual abuse and suicidality, and measures of depression (Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), hopelessness (Beck Hopelessness Scale), and family functioning (McMaster Family Assessment Device General Functioning Subscale). Data analysis included logistic regression.
   Results: In boys, self-report sexual abuse is strongly and independently associated with suicidal thoughts, plans, threats, deliberate self-injury, and suicide attempts, after controlling for current levels of depression, hopelessness, and family dysfunction. In girls, the relationship between sexual abuse and suicidality is mediated fully by depression, hopelessness, and family dysfunction. Girls who report current high distress about sexual abuse, however, have a threefold increased risk of suicidal thoughts and plans, compared to non-abused girls. Boys who report current high distress about sexual abuse have 10-fold increased risk for suicidal plans and threats, and 15-fold increased risk for suicide attempts, compared to non-abused boys. Fifty-five percent (n = 15) of sexually abused boys attempted suicide versus 29% (n = 17) girls.
   Conclusions: A history of sexual abuse should alert clinicians, professionals and caters in contact with adolescents, to greatly increased risks of suicidal behavior and attempts in boys, even in the absence of depression and hopelessness. Distress following sexual abuse, along with depression and hopelessness indicate increased risk of suicidal behavior in girls, as well as boys. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE requested death movement; euthanasia; death and dying; media; Australia
ID MEDIA DISCOURSE; SOCIAL-MOVEMENT; COVERAGE; CANCER; RISK
AB This paper focuses on a critical development in the life of the requested death movement [McInerney, F. (2000). "Requested Death": A new social movement. Social Science & Medicine, 50(1), 137-54.], that being the passage of the Northern Territory of Australia's Rights of the Terminally Ill (ROTI) Act 1995. This legislation, for the first time anywhere in the world, allowed for lawful euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, thereby fulfilling key requirements of the movement. Taking a constructionist perspective, I analyzed discursive representations of dying, death and medicine in selected Australian print media during this time period (1995-1997). The media's predilection for reporting dramatic and unusual death coincided with the movement's construction of contemporary dying as horrific, intractable, and intolerable. Across all analyzed publications and genres, an heroic discourse was found to be a dominant influence, couched within a dramatic framing that served to reinforce many of the claims of the requested death movement. The framing of requested death activists as heroes, and of requested death itself as a redeeming and transforming act for those seeking it, were preeminent in press portrayals. The dominance of this heroic discourse suggests that such media and movement frames worked in tandem to both resonate with and reinforce popular Australian notions of terminal illness and dying in the late 20th century.

AB Issue addressed Men dominate the suicide statistics and are less likely than women to seek help for emotional problems, and this has been linked to aspects of stoic masculinity. Promoting help-seeking and challenging stoic thinking may help to address this problem, but it is unclear what works in engaging men in these topics. Methods We developed a multimedia intervention called Man Up - including a documentary and digital campaign. We tested promotional materials and the website by interviewing 17 men from different ages and backgrounds about their perceptions, and asked them whether the materials generated interest in the topics of the documentary. Results Participants preferred visual materials that were relatable to them and included active and direct language. This helped them to understand and identify with the messages being imparted. Participants had mixed views on talking about masculinity and the use of the term "man up," with some expressing interest and others being deterred by it. Sharing content about mental health and suicide was seen by some as a risk to personal reputation and their relationships with others. Conclusions Our findings informed the design of targeted materials for the national Man Up campaign and website which were then used in a multilevel national health promotion intervention in Australia. So what? Our study provided valuable insights beyond Man Up for those seeking to design and deliver health promotion interventions targeting Australian men and engage in sensitive and stigmatised male health issues. Using active and empowering language was especially important when addressing men which contrasts with many promotional materials currently available.

DT Article
DE suicidal ideation; harmful behavior; nursing home
ID RATING-SCALE; DEPRESSION; DEMENTIA
AB OBJECTIVES: To validate the Harmful Behaviors Scale (HBS) as a measure of direct and indirect self-destructive behaviors in nursing home residents and to determine the prevalence of self-destructive behaviors and their relationship to other variables.
   DESIGN: A cross-sectional study.
   SETTING: Eleven nursing homes in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, Australia.
   PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred ten nursing home residents aged 65 and older.
   MEASUREMENTS: Instruments used were the HBS, Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD), Functional Assessment Staging Scale (FAST), Even Briefer Assessment Scale for: Depression (EBAS-Dep), and the suicide item from the structured Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Data on diagnoses of dementia, depression, or psychotic disorder; prescription of psychotropic medication; and demographics were obtained from nursing home records.
   RESULTS: On the HBS, indirect harmful behaviors occurred at least weekly in 61% of subjects, and direct harmful behaviors occurred in 14% of subjects. The HBS total score was significantly positively correlated with the BEHAVE-AD score (Pearson's r = 0.679, P <.001) but not with the EBAS-Dep "wish for death" item and total score: HBS scores were significantly higher in residents scoring greater than zero on the Hamilton suicide item (F = 1:380; df = 3,325, P = .249). Stepwise multiple linear regression indicated that younger age, chart diagnosis of dementia, greater incapacity as measured by FAST, and a higher Hamilton suicide item score predicted a higher HBS total score.
   CONCLUSIONS: Self-destructive behaviors are common in nursing home residents and are mostly related to dementia. There was little evidence of a relationship between depression and self-destructive behaviors.

TI A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Demoralization and Depression

SO PSYCHOSOMATICS
LA English
DT Article
ID VALIDATION; DIAGNOSIS; DISTRESS; WISH
AB Background: Demoralization is a psychological response that is frequently observed in patients with cancer or advanced diseases. Depression and demoralization syndrome in patients with cancer are closely related to suicidal behavior.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore the factors affecting demoralization of patients with cancer from a depression perspective, to assist with distinguishing patient emotions and provide appropriate intervention as early as possible, thereby enabling patients to receive proper care.
   Methods: A systematic review and metaanalysis was employed in this study. The databases included Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane, PubMedl MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Centre for European Policy Studies, and reference lists of articles. Experts in this field also were contacted. Based on inclusion criteria, 2 investigators selected the research and reviewed each study's quality according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Five correlational studies with 32 subjects were identified.
   Results: The countries of studies included Australia, Germany, Taiwan, and the United States. There was a statistically significant difference in depression between patients with cancer in the high-demoralization group and those of the low-demoralization group (odds ratio = 9.65, 95% CI: 6.99-13.33, Z = 15.002, p < 0.0001). Four studies regarded demoralization and depression as distinguishable.
   Conclusions: The demoralization of patients with cancer was highly correlated with depression. Therefore, the suicide risk of demoralized patients without depression must also be assessed to prevent patients with high suicide risk from being neglected. If medical staff can perceive patient's demoralization issues earlier, they can more effectively prevent patients' depression from occurring, which benefits suicide prevention.

AB Background: Research in suicide prevention using psychosocial interventions is rapidly advancing. However, randomised controlled trials are published across a range of medical, psychological and sociology journals, and it can be difficult to locate a full set of research studies. In this paper, we present a database of randomised controlled outcome studies on psychosocial interventions targeting suicidal behaviour. The database is updated annually and can be accessed by contacting the corresponding author.
   Description: A comprehensive literature search of the major bibliographical databases (PsycINFO; PubMed; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) was conducted for articles published between 1800 to July 30 2013, and examined reference lists of previous relevant reviews and included papers to locate additional references. Studies were included if they featured a randomised controlled design in which the effects of a psychosocial intervention were compared to a control condition (no intervention, attention placebo, wait-list, treatment-as-usual [TAU]), another psychosocial intervention or a pharmacological intervention. In total, 12,250 abstracts were identified. Of these, 131 studies met eligibility criteria and were included. Each paper was then coded into categories of participant characteristics (age, gender, formal diagnosis, primary reason for recruitment); details of the intervention (recruitment setting, content, intervention setting, administering individual, delivery type, delivery format, delivery frequency, delivery length); and study characteristics (control and experimental conditions, primary outcome/s, secondary outcome/s, follow-up period). One paper has been published from the database using studies collected and coded prior to 2012.
   Conclusion: The database and listing of 131 studies is available for use by suicide prevention researchers. It provides a strong starting point for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of treatments and interventions. It will be updated yearly by researchers funded through the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Centre for Research Excellence for Suicide Prevention (CRESP), located at the Black Dog Institute, Australia. This database adds to the evidence base of best-practice psychosocial interventions for suicidal behaviour and prevention.

AB The need to advance mental health through greater levels of social and economic inclusion represents a pressing policy issue. Within Australia, this policy focus has been progressed at a national level. This exploratory study aims to critically investigate The Fifth National Mental health and Suicide Prevention Plan in terms of its potential to help reduce mental stigma and discrimination within Australian workplaces. Qualitative content analysis was applied to the national policy document as well as to 12 academic texts retrieved from a Google Scholar search and meeting inclusion criteria. Stage one of the content analysis process revealed themes of representation, education, research, and activism, while stage two added those of language, legal, and media. This study posits that workplace anti-mental stigma and sanism measures as identified within the Plan are limited in the sense that they represent only a subset of those currently available. This research also supports the prospect of these measures operating in a collaborative manner. Finally, it is proposed that potential exists throughout Australian workplaces to implement stigma and sanism reduction measures that specifically target the health and peer workforce.

AB To explore whether the 'hikikomori' syndrome (social withdrawal) described in Japan exists in other countries, and if so, how patients with the syndrome are diagnosed and treated.
   Two hikikomori case vignettes were sent to psychiatrists in Australia, Bangladesh, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the USA. Participants rated the syndrome's prevalence in their country, etiology, diagnosis, suicide risk, and treatment.
   Out of 247 responses to the questionnaire (123 from Japan and 124 from other countries), 239 were enrolled in the analysis. Respondents' felt the hikikomori syndrome is seen in all countries examined and especially in urban areas. Biopsychosocial, cultural, and environmental factors were all listed as probable causes of hikikomori, and differences among countries were not significant. Japanese psychiatrists suggested treatment in outpatient wards and some did not think that psychiatric treatment is necessary. Psychiatrists in other countries opted for more active treatment such as hospitalization.
   Patients with the hikikomori syndrome are perceived as occurring across a variety of cultures by psychiatrists in multiple countries. Our results provide a rational basis for study of the existence and epidemiology of hikikomori in clinical or community populations in international settings.

AB Objectives. This study examined whether US-born people and immigrants 25 years or older differ in their risks of all-cause and cause-specific mortality and whether these differentials, if they exist, vary according to age, sex, and race/ethnicity.
   Methods. Using data from the National Longitudinal Mortality Study ( 1979-1989), we derived mortality risks of immigrants relative to those of US-born people by using a Cox regression model after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, marital status, urban/rural residence, education, occupation, and family income.
   Results. Immigrant men and women had, respectively, an 18% and 13% lower risk of overall mortality than their US-born counterparts. Reduced mortality risks were especially pronounced for younger and for Black and Hispanic immigrants. Immigrants showed significantly lower risks of mortality from cardiovascular diseases, lung and prostate cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, cirrhosis, pneumonia and influenza, unintentional injuries, and suicide but higher risks of mortality from stomach and brain cancer and infectious diseases.
   Conclusions. Mortality patterns for immigrants and for US-born people vary considerably, with immigrants experiencing lower mortality from several major causes of death. Future research needs to examine the role of sociocultural and behavioral factors in explaining the mortality advantage of immigrants.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study is to develop a procedure for assessing unintentional overdose (OD) in opiate abusers that differentiates it from intentional OD, and provides reliable information about the incident.
   Methods: A sample of 121 patients in a methadone maintenance program at an urban university hospital completed a baseline assessment. A total of 70 participants completed an identical assessment at least 14 days later. The ability of an OD item to differentiate unintentional OD from intentional OD was tested, as was the test-retest reliability of questions assessing symptoms and treatment of OD.
   Results: The procedure is reliable and differentiated unintentional OD from intentional OD. Questions assessing symptoms of OD were endorsed in almost every unintentional OD incident, although reliability was affected by loss of consciousness. The reliability of questions assessing emergency treatment and Narcan administration was outstanding.
   Conclusions: Our procedure for assessing OD differentiates unintentional OD from intentional OD. The use of follow-up questions assessing acute treatment for OD is recommended. Items concerning symptoms of OD are not needed to confirm the presence of an OD, but may be used to clarify whether an event was an OD. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE Psychiatric crisis; Provoked shooting; Police

AB Helping people in acute psychiatric crisis has become an increasingly common part of modem community policing. In certain extreme cases, police may be faced with a suicidal individual who intends to intentionally provoke police to shoot them. While fatalities are fortunately rare, anecdotal reports from frontline police suggest that these kinds of encounters are occurring on a regular basis. This paper explores 2350 psychiatric crisis incidents over an eight-month period in Victoria, Australia, and assesses the frequency and nature of potential police-provoked shootings resolved through non-fatal means. Contextual factors relating to the person's behaviour and police responses, and the person's psychiatric and criminal histories were considered to elucidate characteristics common to these incidents. Results suggest that police are potentially encountering a person who is suicidal and trying to provoke police to shoot them more than twice a week. These individuals share a number of common characteristics with those who have been fatally shot in similar circumstances and are quite different from those who attempt self-inflicted suicide. Results are discussed in relation to the impact of previous criminal contact from both the suspect and police perspectives. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved,

AB Farmers have particular wellbeing-related vulnerabilities that conventional health interventions struggle to address. We consider the potential of natural resource management (NRM) programs, which reach large numbers of farmers, as non-conventional place-focused wellbeing interventions. Although designed to address environmental degradation, NRM can influence the wellbeing of farmers. We used qualitative meta-synthesis to reanalyse studies examining social dimensions of NRM in Australia and generate a theoretical framework identifying potential pathways between NRM and wellbeing, intended to inform subsequent empirical work. Our results suggest NRM programs influence several important determinants of farmer wellbeing, in particular social capital, self-efficacy, social identity, material wellbeing, and health itself. The pathways by which NRM influences these determinants are mediated by distal factors such as changes in land conditions, farmer skills and knowledge and resources accessible to farmers. These, in turn, are moderated by the design and delivery of NRM programs, suggesting potential to enhance the health benefits of NRM through specific attention to program design.

AB Background. People with mental illness suffer excess mortality due to physical illnesses.
   Aims. To investigate the association between mental illness and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) hospital admissions, revascularisation procedures and deaths.
   Method. A population-based record-linkage study of 210 129 users of mental health services in Western Australia during 1980-1998. IHD mortality rates, hospital admission rates and rates of revascularisation procedures were compared with those of the general population.
   Results. IHD (not suicide) was the major cause of excess mortality in psychiatric patients. In contrast to the rate in the general population, the IHS mortality rate in psychiatric patients did. not diminish over time. There was little. difference in hospital admission rates for IHD between psychiatric patients and the general community, but much lower rates of revascularisation procedures with psychiatric patients, particularly in people with psychoses.
   Conclusions. People with mental illness do not receive an equitable level of intervention for IHD. More attention to their general medical care is needed.

AB Objective Incarcerated adults are at high risk of self-harm and suicide and remain so after release into the community. The aims of this study were to estimate the number of ambulance attendances due to self-harm in adults following release from prison, and to identify factors predictive of such attendances.
   Methods Baseline surveys with 1309 adults within 6 weeks of expected release from prison between 2008 and 2010 were linked prospectively with state-wide correctional, ambulance, emergency department, hospital and death records in Queensland, Australia. Associations between baseline demographic, criminal justice and mental health-related factors, and subsequent ambulance attendances resulting from self-harm, were investigated using negative binomial regression.
   Results During 4691 person-years of follow-up (median 3.86 years per participant), there were 2892 ambulance attendances in the community, of which 120 (3.9%) were due to self-harm. In multivariable analyses, being Indigenous [incidence rate ratio (IRR): 2.10 (95% CI 1.14-3.86)], having previously been hospitalised for psychiatric treatment [IRR: 2.65 (95% CI 1.44-4.87)], being identified by prison staff as being at risk of self-harm whilst incarcerated [IRR: 2.12 (95% CI 1.11-4.06)] and having a prior ambulance attendance due to self-harm [IRR: 3.16 (95% CI 1.31-7.61)] were associated with self-harm attendances.
   Conclusions Ambulance attendances resulting from self-harm following release from prison are common and represent an opportunity for tertiary intervention for self-harm. The high prevalence of such attendances, in conjunction with the strong association with prior psychiatric problems, reinforces the importance of providing appropriate ambulance staff training in the assessment and management of self-harm, and mental health problems more broadly, in this vulnerable population.

AB Introduction and AimsYoung offenders are at increased risk of preventable death after release from custody, but risk factors for death in this population are poorly understood. Despite their poor health profiles, no studies have examined mortality outcomes in young people who have served community-based orders. The aims of this study were to describe the causes and identify risk factors for death in a cohort of young offenders in Victoria, Australia.
   Design and MethodsWe interviewed young people serving a custodial (n=273) or community-based order (n=242) in Victoria, Australia in 2002-2003. Measures included demographics and family history, offence history, experience of victimisation, mental illness, self-harm and substance use. Deaths up to 31 December 2011 were identified through a probabilistic linkage with the National Death Index.
   ResultsThe all-cause crude mortality rate was 4.2 (95% confidence interval 2.7-6.8) per 1000 person years and was not significantly different for those who had served custodial and community-based orders. Most deaths were due to drug overdose, traffic accidents or suicide. Adjusting for age, sex and order type, risk factors for death from the baseline interview included weekly use of opioids, sleeping pills or painkillers, polydrug use and injecting drug use.
   Discussion and ConclusionsYoung people who have served community-based and custodial orders are at an increased risk of preventable death. Those engaging in risky substance use, particularly injecting drug use and use of multiple central nervous system depressants, are at greatest risk. There is an urgent need to develop and rigorously evaluate preventive interventions. [Kinner SA, Degenhardt L, Coffey C, Hearps S, Spittal M, Sawyer SM, Patton GC.

DE workers' compensation schemes; no-fault principle; serious and wilful

AB The no-fault principle is one of the pillars of workers' compensation schemes operating in the States, Territories and the Commonwealth in Australia. This article examines the strength of this principle having regard to provisions common to all jurisdictions which disentitle workers where there is evidence of serious and wilful misconduct or self-inflicted injury. It examines the legislative framework of these provisions in detail noting some differences in approach and effect. The article also traces the origins of these provisions and how they have been applied since enacted. We conclude that the no-fault principle remains robust and intact in Australian workers' compensation schemes.

AB Objectives To characterise trends in self-poisoning and psychotropic medicine use in young Australians.
   Design Population-based retrospective cohort study.
   Setting Calls taken by the New South Wales and Victorian Poisons Information Centres (2006-2016, accounting for 70% of Australian poisoning calls); medicine dispensings in the 10% sample of Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme data (July 2012 to June 2016).
   Participants People aged 5-19 years.
   Main outcome measures Yearly trends in intentional poisoning exposure calls, substances taken in intentional poisonings, a prevalence of psychotropic use (dispensing of antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and medicines for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)).
   Results There were 33 501 intentional poisonings in people aged 5-19 years, with an increase of 8.39% per year (95% CI 6.08% to 10.74%, p<0.0001), with a 98% increase overall, 2006-2016. This effect was driven by increased poisonings in those born after 1997, suggesting a birth cohort effect. Females outnumbered males 3:1. Substances most commonly taken in self-poisonings were paracetamol, ibuprofen, fluoxetine, ethanol, quetiapine, paracetamol/opioid combinations, sertraline and escitalopram. Psychotropic dispensing also increased, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) increasing 40% and 35% July 2012 to June 2016 in those aged 5-14 and 15-19, respectively. Fluoxetine was the most dispensed SSRI. Antipsychotics increased by 13% and 10%, while ADHD medication dispensing increased by 16% and 10%, in those aged 5-14 and 15-19, respectively. Conversely, dispensing of benzodiazepines to these age groups decreased by 4% and 5%, respectively.
   Conclusions Our results signal a generation that is increasingly engaging in self-harm and is increasingly prescribed psychotropic medications. These findings indicate growing mental distress in this cohort. Since people who self-harm are at increased risk of suicide later in life, these results may foretell future increases in suicide rates in Australia.

AB Aims and objectivesTo identify the percentage of young people presenting to a primary healthcare service targeting homeless youth, in Melbourne, Australia, who, based on youth-specific Home, Education, Activities, Drug and alcohol use, Sexuality and Suicide (HEADSS) psychosocial assessment tool, were screened for the sexually transmitted infection Chlamydia and tested positive.
   BackgroundHomeless young people are at high risk of poor health outcomes including sexual health. Chlamydia prevalence is highest in 16-24years. Youth psychosocial assessment tools such as the HEADSS can engage young people and provide comprehensive health assessment that identifies health risks.
   DesignA retrospective audit.
   MethodsOne hundred consecutive client files of youth who presented to a primary healthcare service for the first time were selected. Client data were collected at the health services' inner city drop-in clinic and clinical refuge outreach (CRO). HEADSS assessments were made on new presentations to identify those at risk of Chlamydia. These young people were then offered screening for Chlamydia using a first-pass urine sample.
   ResultsOne hundred HEADSS assessments were audited, of which 15 were incomplete. Of the 85 completed HEADSS assessments, 43 were tested and 11 had Chlamydia-positive results.
   ConclusionComprehensive youth assessment tools, such as the HEADSS, can provide a valuable resource in identifying sexual health risks such as Chlamydia. In turn, skilled nursing staff can provide opportunistic screening. Early identification and treatment for Chlamydia can reduce the spread and sequela of this highly infectious STI.
   Relevance to clinical practiceYouth health nurses can enhance their nursing practice in working with young people at risk of homelessness and improve their health outcomes by employing youth-specific assessments.

AB The 1996-1997 National Firearms Agreement (NFA) in Australia introduced strict gun laws, primarily as a reaction to the mass shooting in Port Arthur, Tasmania, in 1996, where 35 people were killed. Despite the fact that several researchers using the same data have examined the impact of the NFA on firearm deaths, a consensus does not appear to have been reached. In this paper, we reanalyze the same data on firearm deaths used in previous research, using tests for unknown structural breaks as a means to identifying impacts of the NFA. The results of these tests suggest that the NFA did not have any large effects on reducing firearm homicide or suicide rates. (JEL C22, K19).

AB Background: The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists is co-ordinating the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in psychiatry, funded under the National Mental Health Strategy (Australia) and the New Zealand Health Funding Authority.
   Method: For these guidelines, the CPG Team for Deliberate Self-harm reviewed the treatment outcome literature (including meta-analyses) and consulted with practitioners and patients.
   Treatment recommendations: (i) Organization of general hospital services to provide: emergency department admission; a safe environment; integrated medical and psychiatric management; risk assessment; identification of psychiatric morbidity, and adequate follow-up. (ii) Detection and treatment of any psychiatric disorder. (iii) Dialectical behaviour therapy, psychoanalytically orientated partial hospitalization or home-based interpersonal therapy (for certain patients) to reduce repetition of deliberate self-harm (DSH).
   Conclusion: Deliberate self-harm is common and is costly in terms of both individual distress and service provision. General hospitals are often the first point of clinical contact, but may not be appropriately organized to care for these patients. Evidence for the effectiveness of psychological treatments is based on single RCTs without replication. The three recommended psychological treatments are not widely available in Australia and New Zealand, and the interventions that are, such as cognitive behaviour therapy, problem solving and 'green cards' (an agreement guaranteeing access to services), do not reduce repetition of DSH. The effect of follow-up in psychiatric hospitals or in the community is poorly understood. We need to develop and evaluate interventions that will reduce repetition of both fatal and non-fatal deliberate self-harm and improve the person's functioning and quality of life.

AB Background: Euthanasia requests have increased as the number of debilitated patients rises in both developed and developing countries such as India due to medical, psychosocial-emotional, socioenvironmental, and existential issues amid fears of potential misuse. World's position: Albania, Colombia, the Netherlands, and Switzerland permit euthanasia conditionally. Australia's legalization of euthanasia has been withdrawn. The United States permits withdrawal of life support. Mexico and Norway permit active euthanasia. India's position: Following the Aruna Shanbaug case the Supreme Court granted legal sanction to passive, but not active, euthanasia that is valid till the Parliament legislates on euthanasia. Handling euthanasia requests: Acknowledging the complexity of the problem; individualizing the palliative approach; and accepting the There is no alternative' or There is no answer' (TINA) factor.

AB Objective To examine differences in use of mental health services between residents of rural, regional, and metropolitan areas of Australia in a population-based sample of adults who meet clinical criteria for a mental disorder. Method Participants in this study were drawn from the Assessing Mental Health survey, which included 2,374 participants who met criteria for one or more mental disorders or reported suicidal ideation in the past month. Rates of self-reported use of specific services for mental health problems (doctor/general practitioner, social worker, hospital, psychologist, psychiatrist, or counsellor) were compared between areas of residence, with subsequent logistic regression analyses used to account for potential confounds for variations in service use. Results There were no differences in overall rates of use of professional services for mental health problems. There were also no significant differences in help seeking from specific sources, with the exception of psychologists. People in rural areas were 26% less likely to report having sought help from a psychologist in the past year than those in metropolitan areas (18% vs. 24%). This discrepancy was not accounted for by stigma, but attenuated after adjustment for severity of psychological distress and demographic factors. Conclusion Little evidence of differences in help seeking in rural Australia compared to urban centres was observed, with the important exception of psychological service use. Further research is needed to characterise disparities in quality and accessibility of care.

AB Objective: To examine the magnitude, 10-year temporal trends and treatment cost of intentional injury hospitalisations of children aged 16 years in Australia. Method: A retrospective examination of linked hospitalisation and mortality data for children aged 16 years during 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2012 with self-harm or assault injuries. Negative binomial regression examined temporal trends. Results: There were 18,223 self-harm and 13,877 assault hospitalisations, with a treatment cost of $64 million and $60.6 million, respectively. The self-harm hospitalisation rate was 59.8 per 100,000 population (95%CI 58.96-60.71) with no annual decrease. The assault hospitalisation rate was 29.9 per 100,000 population (95%CI 29.39-30.39) with a 4.2% annual decrease (95%CI -6.14- -2.31, p<0.0001). Poisoning was the most common method of self-harm. Other maltreatment syndromes were common for children 5 years of age. Assault by bodily force was common for children aged 6-16 years. Conclusions: Health professionals can play a key role in identifying and preventing the recurrence of intentional injury. Psychosocial care and access to support services are essential for self-harmers. Parental education interventions to reduce assaults of children and training in conflict de-escalation to reduce child peer-assaults are recommended. Implications for public health: Australia needs a whole-of-government and community approach to prevent intentional injury.

TI Replaying and Rediscovering <i>The Octoroon</i>
SO THEATRE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB For over 150 years, productions and adaptations of Irish playwright Dion Boucicault's explosive 1859 melodrama The Octoroon have reflected differing and sometimes contentious meanings and messages about race and enslavement in a range of geographic locations and historical moments. Originally staged in New York City in 1859, The Octoroon graphically portrayed the suicide of its white-appearing, mixed-race heroine who had been auctioned into slavery. But in London, in 1861 Boucicault famously rewrote the ending, allowing the heroine to survive and be united with her white lover. Although theatre historians have known about Boucicault's original adaption for over 150 years, no extant playscript for that original "British" version has heretofore been discovered. Now, however, the authors' recent archival discoveries reveal portions of that long-missing script. In addition, they have found that The Octoroon appeared on the colonial stages of Australia a full ten months before Boucicault changed the ending for London audiences. This essay's exploration of the performance history of The Octoroon in Australia further illustrates the potential shifting meanings of racial categories and representations of enslavement in nations whose colonial histories were built on differing constructions of racist oppression, genocide, and slavery. Moreover, annotations in promptbooks from multiple nineteenth-century productions reveal the ways in which stagings of The Octoroon have served as unique fluid, rather than stable, vehicles for depicting the transatlantic and colonial cultural attitudes that surrounded, and tensions that emerged from, antebellum representations of racialization, racial hybridity, interracial desire, and enslavement on both sides of the Atlantic and across British colonies in Australia.

TI Coverage of work related fatalities in Australia by compensation and

SO OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID SOUTH-AFRICA; INJURIES
AB Aims: To determine the levels of coverage of work related traumatic deaths by official occupational health and safety (OHS) and compensation agencies in Australia, to allow better understanding and interpretation of officially available statistics.
   Methods: The analysis was part of a much larger study of all work related fatalities that occurred in Australia during the four year period 1989 to 1992 inclusive and which was based on information from coroners' files. For the current study, State, Territory, and Commonwealth OHS and compensation agencies were asked to supply unit record information for all deaths identified by the jurisdictions as being due to non-suicide traumatic causes and which were identified by them as being work related, using whatever definitions the agencies were using at the relevant time. This information was matched to cases identified during the main study.
   Results: The percentage of working deaths not covered by any agency was 34%. Only 35% of working deaths were covered by an OHS agency, while 57% were covered by a compensation agency. The OHS agencies had minimal coverage of work related deaths that occurred on the road (to workers (8%) or commuters (3%)), whereas the compensation system covered these deaths better than those of workers in incidents that occurred in a workplace (65% versus 53%). There was virtually no coverage of bystanders (less than 8%) by either type of agency. There was marked variation in the level of coverage depending on the industry, occupation, and employment status of the workers, and the type of injury event involved in the incident.
   Conclusions: When using data from official sources, the significant limitations in coverage identified in this paper need to be taken into account. Future surveillance, arising from a computerised National Coroners Information System, should result in improved coverage of work related traumatic deaths in Australia.

AB Background
   People released from prison are at increased risk of death. However, no country has established a system for routine monitoring of mortality in this population. The aims of this study were to (a) evaluate a system for routine monitoring of deaths after release from prison in Australia and (b) estimate the number of deaths annually within 28 and 365 days of prison release from 2000 to 2013.
   Methods
   Persons released from prison and deaths were identified in records held by Centrelink, Australia's national provider of unemployment benefits. Estimates generated in this manner were compared with those from a study that probabilistically linked correctional records with the National Death Index (NDI), for each calendar year 2000 to 2007. Using Centrelink data, national estimates of mortality within 28 and 365 days of release were produced for each calendar year 2000 to 2013.
   Findings
   Compared with estimates based on linkage with the NDI, the estimated crude mortality rate based on Centrelink records was on average 52% lower for deaths within 28 days of release and 24% lower for deaths within 365 days of release. Nationally, over the period 2000 to 2013, we identified an average of 32 deaths per year within 28 days of release and 188 deaths per year within 365 days of release. The crude mortality rate for deaths within both 28 and 365 days of release increased over this time.
   Conclusions
   Using routinely collected unemployment benefits data we detected the majority of deaths in people recently released from prison in Australia. These data may be sufficient for routine monitoring purposes and it may be possible to adopt a similar approach in other countries. Routine surveillance of mortality in ex-prisoners serves to highlight their extreme vulnerability and provides a basis for evaluating policy reforms designed to reduce preventable deaths.

DT Article
ID CORONERS; SUICIDE; RELATIVES
AB Background Recent government inquiries in several countries have identified the length of time it takes coroners to investigate deaths due to injury and other unnatural causes as a major problem. Delays undermine the integrity of vital statistics and adversely affect the deceased's family and others with interests in coroners' findings. Little is publicly known about the extent, nature and causes of these delays.
   Methods We used Kaplan-Meier estimates and multivariable regression analysis to decompose the timelines of nearly all inquest cases (n=5096) closed in coroners' courts in Australia between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2013.
   Results The cases had a median closure period of 19.0 months (95% CI 18.4 to 19.6). Overall, 70% of cases were open at 1 year, 40% at 2 years and 22% at 3 years, but there was substantial variation by jurisdiction. Adjusted analyses showed a difference of 22 months in the average closure time between the fastest and slowest jurisdictions. Cases involving deaths due to assault (+12.2 months, 95% CI 7.8 to 17.0) and complications of medical care (+9.0 months, 95% CI 5.5 to 12.3) had significantly longer closure periods than other types of death. Cases that produced public health recommendations also had relatively long closure periods (+8.9 months, 95% CI 7.6 to 10.3).
   Conclusions Nearly a quarter of inquests in Australia run for more than 3 years. The size of this caseload tail varies dramatically by jurisdiction and case characteristics. Interventions to reduce timelines should be tried and carefully evaluated.

AB The prospect of a terrorist attack against Australian interests is currently being debated across our society. The explosive blast attack is most favoured by terrorists. Blast injuries create unique patterns of multisystem injury with contaminated wounds and extensive devitalized tissue. Australian civilian surgeons are increasingly likely to be involved in the management of these injuries, either in response to a terrorist incident in Australia or as part of delayed management of Australian nationals injured overseas. An appreciation of the unique complexities of blast injuries is equally important to both military and civilian surgeons. This paper covers the mechanisms and pathophysiology of blast injuries and discusses issues of surgical management as they would apply to an Australian civilian setting.

AB Deaths in police custody often attract a huge amount of public interest and are frequently associated with controversy related to causation. While systematic investigations of deaths in police custody are currently available for countries in Europe, North America and Australia, the different inclusion and exclusion criteria and the lack of a uniform definition limits their comparability.
   Rates of death vary by age and gender with some similarities across different countries and continents. The male dominance is essentially due to the fact that around the world women are much less frequently taken into police custody than men.
   Similarly, in the U.S., the most common cause of custody death was natural illness and disease progression such as heart disease and cancer; along with high rates of suicide deaths. In most European countries there is a considerable dominance of non-natural deaths. The causes of death are dominated by alcohol, drugs and medications, but suicide, injury and trauma are also common.
   Deaths in custody require careful investigation to determine causality as well as culpability when appropriate. While many deaths may not be preventable, some are. Further systematic research of this issue, including detailed analyses and investigations of such cases, is necessary to develop general and specific preventative measures to reduce the risk of death in the custody population.

AB A study was undertaken of 629 cases autopsied at Forensic Science SA, Adelaide, Australia over a 10-year period from 1994 to 2004 where significant decomposition had been documented. The age range of victims was 10 months to 92 years (mean 51.5 +/- 18.1 years). There were 498 males (79%) and 131 females (21%) (M:F = 3.8:1). Deaths in 289 of the 629 cases (46%) were due to natural causes, with 179 suicides (28%), 83 accidents (13%), and 36 homicides (6%). The cause of death was ascertained in 89% of cases and the manner of death in 93% of cases. In 35 cases (6%) both the cause and manner could not be determined. Numbers of suicides were higher in younger age groups while deaths from organic illnesses predominated in later life. The number of cases in summer was significantly greater than in winter. Despite technical difficulties in handling decomposed bodies, and artifactual alteration of tissue structure and microscopic features, the autopsy was still a useful diagnostic exercise. While it is likely that more information may be gleaned from fresh bodies in perfectly preserved states, decomposed bodies may reveal significant anatomical and pathological features that enable both the cause and manner of death to be established.

DE Hanging injury; Functional outcome; Neck injury
ID NECK; MELBOURNE; AUSTRALIA
AB Purpose: Suicide becomes a serious problem in today's society and hanging is a common method of suicide. We want to find the factors which can predict the final functional outcomes of these cases.
   Methods: All patients who presented to Accident and Emergency Department (ED) of the National Cheng Kung University Hospital from 1st January 2005 to 31th December 2013 with a hanging injury were included in this study. All cases were divided into good outcome group and bad outcome group according to Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Data was analyzed by Mann-Whitney test and chi-square test.
   Results: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) < 3, pupil dilation and no pupillary light reflex both at the scene and ED were the factors to indicate poor functional outcome. Out-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), acidosis (pH < 7.2) and the need for intubation once arriving at ED were also related to poor functional outcome. OHCA cases all had poor functional outcome.
   Conclusion: GCS, pupil size, pupillary light reflex, OHCA and acidosis are useful as prognostic factors. GCS = 3 lead to a very poor outcome. However, the functional outcome seems good in patients with GCS>3. There parameters can help to predict the outcome before treatment.

AB Farmers are exposed to a unique range of vocational stressors, and while mental health morbidity is similar to their non-rural counterparts, suicide rates in the farming community are higher. We examined the contribution of coal seam gas (CSG) extraction to the global stress burden and mental health of 378 Australian farmers (mean age = 53.08 years; SD = 10.28). Exploratory factor analysis revealed that CSG items added two unique dimensions to the Edinburgh Farming Stress Inventory (EFSI): Off-Farm CSG Concerns (concerns about possible impacts of CSG extraction on human health, communities, and the environment) and On-Farm CSG Concerns (potential CSG impacts on farm profitability, disruption of farm operations, and privacy). Subscales based on the new factors correlated significantly with farmers' self-reported levels of depression, anxiety and stress reactivity, as assessed by the DASS-21. Latent profile analysis categorized farmers into four distinct segments based on their overall stress profiles: Non Stressed (39%), Finance-Stressed (31%), CSG-Stressed (15%) and Globally-Stressed (15%). Farmers in the CSG-Stressed and Globally-Stressed profiles exhibited clinically significant levels of psychological morbidity. This information can be used to inform strategies for improving mental health outcomes in the agrigas-fields of Australia. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This article analyses drug-related deaths in the German Federal States of Bavaria (Munich, Nuremberg and Augsburg counties) during 1999 and Baden-Wurttemberg (Stuttgart and Mannheim counties) during 1999 and in the first half of 2000. The persons who had been in contact with drug care services were studied for psychosocial stress preceding drug-related deaths. Epidemiological data from different sources (police, relatives, counselling centres, detoxification clinics, therapy and substitution treatment) were collated to estimate factors of psychosocial stress preceding drug deaths. The results in both Laender indicate high prevalence rates of a history of at least one non-fatal overdose (approx. 50%) or a suicide attempt (approx. 35%). More than 40% of the deceased had been suffering from at least one additional mental disorder, in most cases from depression. At least one critical life event (in most cases, a relapse) ora period of abstinence (i.e., due to imprisonment, therapy or detoxification) during the past three months before death was reported for more than half of the addicts. The results were discussed in the light of data on opiate users and the general population. Improved specialist training of therapeutic and medical workers as well as of any other co-operating professionals is considered a necessary prerequisite for an early detection of risk factors.

ID EXCESS MORTALITY; MENTAL-ILLNESS; CASE REGISTER; LINKAGE
AB Background: The aim was to examine mortality in psychiatric patients in Western Australia (WA), over a time period of considerable change in the delivery of mental health services. Methods: A population-based record linkage analysis was undertaken to quantify mortality among people with mental illness in WA. Mortality rates were calculated in users of mental health services and compared with rates in the whole population of WA. Trends in mortality were also examined using relative survival analysis, and proportional hazards regression. Results: The overall mortality rate ratio was 2.57 in males (95% CI: 2.51-2.64), and 2.18 in females (2.12-2.24). The highest cause-specific mortality rate ratio was for deaths due to suicide [RR: 7.37 in males (95% CI: 6.74-8.05) and 8.38 in females (959/0 CI: 7.11-9.89)], with mortality rate ratios being significantly greater than 1 for all other major causes of death. A relative survival analysis found that the excess mortality risk was concentrated in the first few years after first contact with mental health services. Proportional hazards regression analysis found a slight elevation of mortality rates over time. Conclusions: Mortality among psychiatric patients remains high and appears to be increasing. Highest excess mortality rate is associated with suicide, but mortality rates are significantly elevated for all major causes of death.

AB Mental disorder and trauma experiences are highly prevalent among individuals in custody; however, the impact of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on functioning is rarely considered. Indigenous Australians are incarcerated at 13 times the rate of nonindigenous Australians and report high levels of trauma exposure and psychological distress. In analysis of the largest systematic study of mental disorder among indigenous Australians in custody (N = 396), we found that the 12-month prevalence of PTSD was high in both men (12.1%) and women (32.3%). Having PTSD was also associated with high rates of co-occurring mental disorders (anxiety 31.2%, depression 32.8%, psychosis 24.6%, and substance use, 75.4%), lifetime suicidal ideation (50.1%), and suicide attempts (34.4%). Individuals with PTSD, compared to those without, were more likely to experience other mental disorders, OR = 2.42, 95% CI [1.12, 5.80], p = .022; lifetime suicide thoughts, OR = 2.43, 95% CI [1.34, 4.39], p = .001, and attempts, OR = 2.56, 95% CI [1.33, 4.83], p = .002; and high rates of intoxication at the time of arrest. Despite this, most (58.9%) had not accessed any form of mental health care prior to incarceration. These findings highlight the need to identify and manage PTSD in community and custodial populations.

AB Objectives: Few people who use stimulants seek clinical treatment. This study sought to describe a cohort of stimulant users who attended a stimulant-specific treatment service, Access Point, in Melbourne, Australia between 2008 and 2014.
   Methods: A retrospective audit of the records of adults (n = 175) who sought treatment for stimulant use at a stimulant-specific outpatient treatment service was conducted.
   Results: Service users had a median age of 32 (range = 19-54). Most stimulant users were in part- or full-time employment (53.6%) and had stable accommodation (85%). There was a high rate of mental health comorbidity, with over half (52%) reporting a previous history of mental health problems, while one-third (33%) reported previous suicide attempts. There was a high rate (48%) of previous methamphetamine-associated psychosis, which was significantly correlated with frequency of use (x(2) = 13.698, p = 0.008).
   Conclusions: This study supports the potential of a targeted and specialised treatment service as a means of early intervention for stimulant users. The high prevalence of methamphetamine-associated psychosis history in this group suggests that frequent use of stimulants increases the risk of psychosis, even among high-functioning individuals.

AB Although important challenges remain, advances in psychological theory and practice have made significant contributions to preventing and reducing adolescent health problems in Australia and in other nations. This article reviews current approaches and advances within the field of health psychology, and their contribution to the prevention of high priority adolescent health problems and to adolescent health promotion. Advances in adolescent health in Australia are indicated by reductions in mortality, tobacco use, road trauma, early-age alcohol use, illicit drug use, suicide, homicide, and HIV transmission. Within a strategic interdisciplinary public health model, psychologists have contributed to these advances through research identifying the psychological and behavioural processes that influence adolescent health risks, trialling and evaluating behavioural intervention strategies to reduce risk processes, and communicating evidence to advocate the dissemination of effective approaches. Current challenges in adolescent health include high rates of obesity and overweight related to increasing physical inactivity and overconsumption of high-calorie and processed foods, high rates of substance use problems, and rising rates of youth violence and socioeconomic inequalities. Among potential solutions, this article describes the prevention science and positive youth development approaches to enhancing population rates of health and well-being in the adolescent population.

AB The media creates and sustains knowledge about socially relevant issues such as crime, mental illness, and policing. Past research suggests that while the media portrayal of the police is undoubtedly complex, their portrayal of people experiencing mental illness remains mainly negative. The depiction of their encounters in the mass media is of considerable interest because of the influential role the media has on public opinion and debate; however, there is a lack of current research in this area. This study aimed to examine media items in the major newspapers across Australia between January 2006 and December 2007 (n = 77) to investigate their portrayal of this interface. The dominant themes encountered in the initial analysis depicted people experiencing mental illness as dangerous and a threat to the public, where the mental health system has failed to manage them adequately. Further analyses found that people experiencing mental illness were stigmatised in a third of the media items reviewed and were represented significantly more negatively in these encounters than the police. Implications of these findings and some suggestions regarding possible strategies that could improve socially responsible media reporting and public discourse on mental illness are proposed.

AB Background: There is an urgent need to establish effective strategies for suicide prevention. Stigma against depression may be a potential anti-protective factor for suicide. Thus, we investigated baseline levels of awareness and attitudes toward depression and its treatment among the general population by our original 18-item questionnaire, which we aimed to validate in the present study. Next, we conducted two types of educational interventions and examined the results to clarify the difference in the quality of these lectures.
   Methods: Subjects were 834 citizens (245 males and 589 females) who received an anti-stigma-targeted (n = 467) or non-targeted lecture (n = 367). An 18-item questionnaire assessing levels of awareness and attitudes toward depression and its treatments was administered to each participant before and after the lecture. A chi-square test was used to investigate categorical variables for background data on the participants. Factor analysis of baseline scores was conducted on the 18 questionnaire items. Student's t-test was used for analysis of the gender effect. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for comparison among the 5 age groups and comparison of the effect of the two lectures. Multiple regression analysis was applied to examine the determinants of improved attitudes after intervention.
   Results: Public attitudes toward depression consisted of 4 distinct elements, which were disease-model attitudes, help-seeking behavior, negative affect toward depression, and non-medication solutions. Older participants had poorer disease-model attitudes and more negative affect toward depression, whereas younger participants showed poorer help-seeking behavior (p < 0.05). The anti-stigma-targeted lecture was superior to the non-targeted lecture in improving disease-model attitudes and non-medication solutions (p < 0.05). Multiple regression analyses revealed that each subscale score at post-lecture was strongly dependent on its own baseline subscale score (p < 0.01), and that baseline disease-model attitudes also affected post-lecture scores on negative affect toward depression and non-medication solutions (p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: The educational intervention appears useful for acquiring accurate attitudes toward depression in a medical model. However, other strategies should be considered to enhance help-seeking behavior, especially in younger people.

TI The concept of 'intent' within Australian coronial data: factors
   affecting the National Coronial Information System's classification of
   mortality attributable to intentional self-harm
SO HEALTH INFORMATION MANAGEMENT JOURNAL

   Clinical Coding; Health Information Management; Cause of Death;
   Coroners; Public Health Surveillance
ID SUICIDE; DEATH
AB Within Australia all unexpected deaths are investigated by the Coroners Court; specifically, the coroner investigates the identity of the deceased and the cause and circumstances of death. This 'unexpected death' category inevitably includes cases of self-harm and suicide. Concerns regarding the accurate reporting of national suicide statistics resulted in a review of the coding process undertaken by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), which produces the national statistics, and a formal Commonwealth Government Senate Inquiry in 2009. This article reflects data and opinions collected prior to the Senate Inquiry or the adjustment of the ABS coding processes, and explores the role of the Coroner in determining the intent of the deceased person and the role the National Coronial Information System (NCIS) 1 database plays in the provision of this information. At the Case Notification and Case Closure stages of the coronial process, administrative coders abstract from the coronial file the 'intent' of the deceased and enter the data into relevant administrative systems (which upload to the NCIS). The relevant intent code in the NCIS is 'Intentional Self-Harm', which incorporates deliberate actions of self-harm and suicide. A mixed-method study was employed to investigate anecdotal reports of a problematic coronial coding process surrounding this category of cases. A sample of Australian coroners (n=16), and of the national population of NCIS coders (n=36), were surveyed using separate instruments, and an unobtrusive case review of sampled NCIS cases (n=127) reflecting nine key mechanisms-of-death, was undertaken. Each Australian state and territory has its own Coroners Act, none of which provides legislative direction regarding the determination of intent by the coroner. Neither the coroner-respondents nor the coders favoured a standard proforma to record 'intent'. In order to inform their classificatory decision-making regarding the deceased's 'intent', the coders need to abstract extensively from the entire case file, scrutinising documentary materials from different investigators. They rely primarily on the police report at Case Notification and the coroner's finding at Case Completion. Coders do not generally perceive the classification of 'intent' to be problematic; however, despite NCIS-provided coder (technical) support materials, there exist inconsistent coder work practices and, sometimes, absent documentary evidence reflecting lack of information for ascertainment and interpretation by the coroner, investigators, and forensic experts on the 'intent' of the deceased. The gap between what a coroner is legally required to document regarding 'intent' and what society needs to know for statistical and preventive purposes, seems problematic to bridge.

AB Background: Overdose (OD) is a common cause of death in opioid users. Also, many current opioid users report a history of non-fatal OD. The present study aimed to identify factors associated with a history of non-fatal OD.
   Methods: A sample of 7085 Swedish criminal justice clients with alcohol or drug misuse was assessed, using the Addiction Severity Index. Subjects reporting use of opioids during the 30 days prior to incarceration were included (n = 1113). Relevant variables of misuse pattern, heredity, psychiatric symptoms and previous criminal charges were analysed in a logistic regression model.
   Results: A history of non-fatal OD was reported by 55% (n =604). The estimated contribution to the variance in OD history was 25% for variables describing misuse pattern, compared to 10% for psychiatric symptoms, 8% for heredity, and 8% for previous criminal charges. The final model included the following variables: history of injection drug use (OR 3.28), history of heroin use (OR 2.87), history of suicide attempt (OR 1.92), history of tranquilliser use (OR 1.91), being born in Sweden or other Nordic countries (OR 1.74), difficulty in controlling violent behaviour (OR 1.68). and paternal alcohol problems (OR 1.57).
   Conclusions: Suicide attempts and difficulty in controlling violent behaviour were associated with history of non-fatal OD, independent of variables of misuse pattern. This may indicate a possible association with impulse control disturbances, and may have clinical applications. Country of birth and heredity of alcohol problems also had some influence. As expected, severity of misuse most strongly contributed to history of non-fatal OD. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To examine the demographic, prescription, ingestion, and psychiatric diagnostic factors that distinguished elderly from nonelderly patients treated for deliberate self-poisoning (DSP). Method: A prospective case series study of 2,667 patients presenting to a regional referral center for poisoning (Newcastle Mater Hospital, NSW, Australia), January 1991 to July 1998. The sample was stratified into two groups, 65 years or greater (n = 110) and 64 years or less (n = 2,557) at the time of index admission. The groups were compared using a forward stepwise logistic regression model. Uncontrolled comparisons were analyzed by chi-square statistic with Bonferroni-adjusted p values and controlled comparisons by odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: The elderly group represented 4.1% of the total. The logistic regression analysis found the elderly DSP group was more likely to have a longer length of stay (OR 5.90, CI 3.87-9.00), to have been prescribed "other" drugs (neither benzodiazepines, mood treatment drugs, nor paracetamol) before admission (OR 5.32, CI 3.34-8.48), to have been prescribed benzodiazepines (OR 3.15, CI 2.03-4.89), and to be diagnosed with major depression (OR 2.17, CI 1.41-3.36) than the younger group. The elderly group was less likely to have ingested paracetamol (OR 0.28, CI 0.14-0.54) or "other" drugs (neither benzodiazepines; nor mood treatment drugs) in the DSP episode (OR 0.33, CI 0.20-0.54). Discussion: Elderly DSP patients differ in several important respects from younger patients. They have higher morbidity as a result of the DSP. Major depression plays a more important role. The strong relationship between benzodiazepine prescription and DSP in the elderly raises questions and possible prevention strategies.

AB Background: Repetition of hospital-treated deliberate self-harm is common. Several recent studies have used emergency department data to develop clinical tools to assess risk of self-harm or suicide. Longitudinal, linked inpatient data is an alternative source of information.
   Methods: We identified all individuals admitted to hospital for deliberate self-harm in two Australian states (similar to 350 hospitals). The outcome of interest was a repeated episode of self-harm (non-Fatal or fatal) within 6 months. Logistic regression was used to identify a set of predictors of repetition. A risk calculator (RESH: Repeated Episodes of Self-Harm) was derived directly from model coefficients.
   Results: There were 84.659 episodes of self-harm during the study period. Four variables - number of prior episodes, time between episodes, prior psychiatric diagnoses and recent psychiatric hospital stay - strongly predicted repetition. The RESH score showed good discrimination (AUC=0.75) and had high specificity. Patients with scores of0-3 had 14% risk of repeat episodes, whereas patients with scores of 20-25 had over 80% risk. We identified five thresholds where the RESH score could be used for prioritising interventions.
   Limitations: The trade-off of a highly specific test is that the instalment has poor sensitivity. As a consequence, the RESH score cannot be used reliably for "ruling out" those who score below the thresholds.
   Conclusions: The RESH score could be useful for prioritising patients to interventions to reduce readmission for deliberate self harm The five thresholds, representing the continuum from low to high risk, enable a stepped care model of overlapping or sequential interventions to be deployed to patients at risk of self harm, (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB Background This scoping review maps population-based surveys and mental health literacy (MHL) interventions undertaken in China during 1997-2018 in order to identify research gaps. Method Following Arksey and O'Malley's framework for a scoping review, five English databases (Medline, PsycINFO, Cochrane library, Web of Science and CINAHL) and two Chinese ones (CNKI and WanFang) were systematically searched, identifying both reports of surveys and evaluation of interventions from Jan 1997 to Oct 2018. Results MHL research has developed rapidly in China in terms of numbers of studies and geographic coverage over the past two decades. There were 350 peer-reviewed publications included in this review, covering diverse settings and participants. Of these publications, 313 (89.4%) were published in Chinese-language journals and 37 in English-language journals; 303 (86.6%) reported on survey findings and 47 reported on the evaluation of MHL interventions. MHL research in China has mainly focused on the assessment of mental health-related knowledge and beliefs. Much less attention has been given to developing and evaluating relevant interventions. MHL related to general mental health and suicide were most commonly studied, with less focus on specific disorders, although some studies covered depression, psychosis and anxiety disorders. The majority of MHL tools utilized in the studies reported in this review were developed in China (n = 97, 80.2% ) and almost half of these studies (57.8%) did not provide enough details concerning psychometrics. Conclusions More interventions targeting the general public and aiming to improve MHL and promote behaviour change, are needed in China. These should be evaluated with high-quality study designs, such as randomised controlled trials. Proper validation of tools used for measuring MHL should also be addressed in future studies.

AB Objective:
   To examine rural and urban differences in depression-related mental health literacy, experience of depression and help-seeking.
   Design:
   Cross-sectional population-based survey stratified by rural and urban area.
   Setting:
   A random and representative sample of South Australian rural and urban young men aged between 15 and 30 years.
   Outcome measures:
   Mental health literacy as determined by recognition and exposure to classical symptoms of depression; perceived helpfulness of various interventions and treatment-seeking behaviour.
   Results:
   Recognition of depression increased significantly in rural and urban young men between 1998 and 2008. More rural young men than urban men identified symptoms of depression in 1998 (odds ratio (OR): 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-2.40, P < 0.05), but that was not evident in 2008 (OR: 1.32, 95% CI, 0.80-2.25, P = 0.30). Both groups were more likely to have a close friend experience symptoms of depression and to use antidepressant medications in 2008 compared with 1998. Rural young men experienced a significant increase in recognition of personal depressive symptoms (OR: 3.73, 95% CI, 1.72-8.40) and levels of confidence in psychiatrists and psychologists (OR: 2.40, 95% CI, 1.34-4.31) in 2008 compared with 1998. Both rural and urban young men were significantly less likely to rate dealing with problems on their own as helpful in 2008 as in 1998.
   Conclusions:
   There has been an increase in both rural and urban young male mental health literacy between 1998 and 2008, especially in rural young men. Whether this will translate into a reduction of depression and associated suicide, with a reversal of the rural/urban suicide differential, remains to be seen.

AB PurposeTo estimate the incidence trend and outcome of paracetamol poisoning, in relation to increased availability of paracetamol from non-pharmacy outlets in 2009.
   MethodPatients' serum paracetamol results over 14years (2000-2013) from 20 (out of 21) regions in Sweden were linked to national registers of hospital care, cause of death, and prescriptions. Paracetamol poisonings were defined by serum paracetamol levels, hospital diagnoses, or cause of death. The change in incidence of poisonings following increased availability of paracetamol was analysed by using segmental regression of time series.
   ResultsOf the 12068 paracetamol poisonings, 85% were classified as intentional self-harm. Following increased availability from non-pharmacy outlets, there was a 40.5% increase in the incidence of paracetamol poisoning, from 11.5/100000 in 2009 to 16.2/100000 in 2013. Regression analyses indicated a change in the trend (p<0.0001) but not an immediate jump in the incidence (p=0.5991) following the increased availability. Adjusting for trends in hospital episodes for self-harm, suicides, and the sales volume of paracetamol did not influence the result. All-cause mortality at 30days (3.2%) did not change over time.
   ConclusionsThe incidence of paracetamol poisoning in Sweden has increased since 2009, contrasting the decreased incidence in the period of 2007-2009. The change in trend was temporally associated with the introduction of availability of paracetamol from non-pharmacy outlets but did not appear to be related to sales volume of paracetamol or general trends in self-harm or suicides.

AB Objective: To determine whether the prevalence of depression, its associated quality of life, treatment and mental health literacy about depression varied according to accessibility to health services.
   Design: Face-to-face interviews with a random and representative sample of the South Australian population (aged >= 15 years) were conducted between March and June 2004, with the respondents stratified using the Accessibility and Remoteness Index of Australia into categories of 'highly accessible', 'accessible', and 'moderately accessible and remote'.
   Results: From 4700 households selected, 3015 participants wwere interviewed (65.9% response rate). The prevalence of major depression and other depressions was not significantly different between each of the categories, although there was a trend for those from moderately accessible and remote areas to be less depressed overall. A significantly lower proportion of respondents from moderately accessible and remote locations reported that they had family or close friends who had suffered from symptoms consistent with depression, or that they had ever had treatment for those symptoms. However, there was no significant difference between the groups in those who bad ever bad or who were currently taking antidepressant medication. For those who were depressed, a significantly higher proportion from the accessible, and moderately accessible and remote regions had seen a community or district health service, social worker or other counsellor as compared with those from the highly accessible area.
   Conclusions: These findings indicate that depression is no more prevalent in less accessible regions of South Australia, and that when it is present, its treatment, in terms of antidepressants, which can be considered as a proxy marker for the overall management of depression, is similar to treatment in more accessible areas.

ID LIFE DECISION-MAKING; ASSISTED-SUICIDE; DEATH; EUTHANASIA; INTENTIONS;
   SEDATIVES; TALK; RULE
AB Care and decision-making at the end of life that promotes comfort and dignity is widely endorsed by public policy and the law. In ethical analysis of palliative care interventions that are argued potentially to hasten death, these may be deemed to be ethically permissible by the application of the doctrine of double effect, if the doctor's intention is to relieve pain and not cause death. In part because of the significance of ethics in the development of law in the medical sphere, this doctrine is also likely to be recognized as part of Australia's common law, although hitherto there have been no cases concerning palliative care brought before a court in Australia to test this. Three Australian States have, nonetheless, created legislative defences that are different from the common law with the intent of clarifying the law, promoting palliative care, and distinguishing it from euthanasia. However, these defences have the potential to provide less protection for doctors administering palliative care. In addition to requiring a doctor to have an appropriate intent, the defences insist on adherence to particular medical practice standards and perhaps require patient consent. Doctors providing end-of-life care in these States need to be aware of these legislative changes. Acting in accordance with the common law doctrine of double effect may not provide legal protection. Similar changes are likely to occur in other States and Territories as there is a trend towards enacting legislative defences that deal with the provision of palliative care.

AB Objective: The epidemiology of patients admitted to the intensive care unit after a drug overdose (OD) is poorly defined. We aimed to study the incidence, characteristics and outcomes of patients admitted to the ICU because of OD in Australia and New Zealand.
   Design, setting and patients: Retrospective study of data from the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database, including all patients admitted to an ICU with OD from 2005 to 2013.
   Results: Overall, of 883 618 patients treated in the ICU during the study period, 18 050 (2.04%) were admitted because of OD. Over nearly a decade, the proportion of ICU admissions secondary to OD increased significantly from 1.3% in 2005 to 2.4% in 2013 (P < 0.0001). The annual incidence of OD related admissions increased from 63 per million people in 2005 to 166 per million in 2013 (P < 0.0001). The largest increase was noted among Indigenous Australians, from 31 per million in 2005 to 436 per million in 2013, with a peak incidence in 2012 of 553 per million (P = 0.0006). Most patients were female (56.4%) and the mean age was 40.2 years (SD, 15.4 years). Overall, ICU and hospital mortality rates were low, at 1.3% and 1.7%, respectively, and did not change over time. Non-survivors were significantly older than survivors and had higher rates of organ failure, intubation and cardiac arrest at presentation, more chronic comorbidities and higher illness severity scores.
   Conclusions: Drug OD accounts for an increasing proportion of ICU admissions in Australia and New Zealand. Its population incidence is increasing overall, particularly in Indigenous Australians.

AB Within developed nations, there is increasing public debate about and apparent endorsement of the appropriateness of euthanasia as an autonomous choice to die in the face of intolerable suffering. Surveys report socio-demographic differences in rates of acceptance of euthanasia, but there is little in-depth analysis of how euthanasia is understood and positioned within the social and moral lives of individuals, particularly those who might be considered Suitable candidates-for example, terminally-ill cancer patients. During discussions with 28 such patients in Australia regarding medical decisions at the end of life, euthanasia was raised by 13 patients, with the others specifically asked about it. Twenty-four patients spoke positively of euthanasia, 19 of these voicing some concerns. None identified euthanasia as a currently favoured option. Four were completely against it. Endorsement for euthanasia was in the context of a hypothetical future or for a hypothetical other person, or temporally associated with acute pain. Arguments supporting euthanasia framed the issue as a matter of freedom of choice, as preserving dignity in death, and as Curbing intolerable pain and suffering, both of the patient and of those around them. A common analogy featured was that of euthanising a dog. These arguments were typically presented as self-evident justification for euthanasia, construed as an appropriate choice to die, with opposers positioned as morally inferior or ignorant. The difficulties of ensuring 'choice' and the moral connotations of 'choosing to die,' however, worked to problematise the appropriateness of euthanising specific individuals. We recommend further empirical investigation of the moral and social meanings associated with euthanasia. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This chapter offers narratives of the authors' own experience and ruminations on the power of arts-based engagement to promote healing. Our intention is to respond to colonization, historical trauma and the ongoing suffering present in neo-colonial societies. We assert that both the "colonized" and the "colonizers" are in need of healing and social change. One way that healing can be effected, or at least initiated, is through the arts. We tell our own stories in support of this argument. Our offering is one of embodied and emplaced personal experience and personal connections with each other and with others across time and space. We link our stories with a growing international literature on intergenerational trauma and healing and community based arts projects we have been involved with in the United States, Aotearoa, and Australia.

   PREVALENCE; MUTILATION; STUDENTS; RATES
AB Objective: To understand self-injury and its correlates in the Australian population.
   Design, participants and setting: Cross-sectional survey, using computer-assisted telephone interview, of a representative sample of 12006 Australians from randomly selected households.
   Main outcome measures: Data on demographics, self-injury, psychiatric morbidity, substance use, suicidality, disclosure and help-seeking.
   Results: In the 4 weeks before the survey, 1.1% of the sample self-injured. For females, self-injury peaked in 15-24-year-olds; for males, it peaked in 10-19-year-olds. The youngest self-injurers were nine boys and three girls in the 10-14-year age group, and the oldest were one female and one male in the 75-84-year age group. Mean age of onset was 17 years, but the oldest age of onset was 44 years for males and 60 years for females. No statistically significant differences existed between those who did and did not self-injure on sex, socioeconomic status or Indigenous status. Most common self-injury method was cutting; most common motivation was to manage emotions. Frequency of self-injury during the 4-week period ranged from 1 to 50 instances (mean, 7). Self-injurers were significantly more psychologically distressed, and also more likely to use substances. Adults who self-injured were more likely to have received a psychiatric diagnosis. Self-injurers were more likely to have experienced recent suicidal ideation (OR, 11.56; 95% Cl, 8.14-16.41), and have ever attempted suicide (OR, 8.51; 95% Cl, 5.70-12.69). Most respondents told someone about their self-injury but fewer than half sought help.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of self-injury in Australia in the 4 weeks before the survey was substantial and self-injury may begin at older ages than previously reported. Self-injurers are more likely to have mental health problems and are at higher risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviour than non-self-injurers, and many self-injurers do not seek help.

ID BEREAVEMENT; SUICIDE
AB Sudden, violent and otherwise unexplained deaths are investigated in most western jurisdictions through a Coronial or medico-legal process. A crucial element of such an investigation is the legislative requirement to remove the body for autopsy and other medical interventions, processes which can disrupt traditional religious and cultural grieving practices. While recent legislative changes in an increasing number of jurisdictions allow families to raise objections based on religious and cultural grounds, such concerns can be over-ruled, often exacerbating the trauma and grief of families. Based on funded research which interviews a range of Coronial staff in one Australian jurisdiction, this paper explores the disjuncture between medico-legal discourses, which position the body as corpse, and the rise of more 'therapeutic' discourses which recognise the family's wishes to reposition the body as beloved and lamented.

ID CARDIOMYOPATHY; MYOCARDITIS; AUSTRALIA
AB Clozapine is one of the atypical anti-psychotic drugs used in the treatment of resistant schizophrenia. Although cardiac side-effects are rare, it has been reported that there maybe development of myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, postural orthostatic hypotension and prolonged QT duration. Complete atrioventricular (AV) block is characterized by the inability to transmit all of the atrial signal to the ventricles. Causes may be congenital, idiopathic or acquired which are associated with surgery, infection, or muscle disease. AV block is extremely serious and permanent pacemaker insertion is usually necessary for all patients. Complete AV block may develop due to clozapine intoxication through increase in vagal tonus, sinoatrial node (SN) and the inhibition of atrioventricular node signalling. The case presented here is of a 15-year old female patient who developed AV total cardiac block associated with the taking of clozapine in a suicide attempt.

AB Injury prevention in Indigenous communities in Australia is a continuing national challenge, with Indigenous fatality rates due to injury three times higher than the general population. Suicide and transport are the leading causes of injury mortality, and assault, transport and falls the primary causes of injury morbidity. Addressing the complex range of injury problems in disadvantaged Indigenous communities requires considerable work in building or enhancing existing capacity of communities to address local safety issues. Poor data, lack of funding and absence of targeted programs are some of the issues that impede injury prevention activities. Traditional approaches to injury prevention can be used to highlight key areas of need, however adaptations are needed in keeping with Indigenous peoples' holistic approach to health, linked to land and linked to community in order to address the complex spiritual, emotional and social determinants of Indigenous injury.

   GENERAL-POPULATION; SURVEILLANCE; DEPRESSION; DISORDERS; ANXIETY;
   TRACKING; QUERIES
AB Background: Population mental health surveillance is an important challenge limited by resource constraints, long time lags in data collection, and stigma. One promising approach to bridge similar gaps elsewhere has been the use of passively generated digital data.
   Purpose: This article assesses the viability of aggregate Internet search queries for real-time monitoring of several mental health problems, specifically in regard to seasonal patterns of seeking out mental health information.
   Methods: All Google mental health queries were monitored in the U.S. and Australia from 2006 to 2010. Additionally, queries were subdivided among those including the terms ADHD (attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder); anxiety; bipolar; depression; anorexia or bulimia (eating disorders); OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder); schizophrenia; and suicide. A wavelet phase analysis was used to isolate seasonal components in the trends, and based on this model, the mean search volume in winter was compared with that in summer, as performed in 2012.
   Results: All mental health queries followed seasonal patterns with winter peaks and summer troughs amounting to a 14% (95% CI=11%, 16%) difference in volume for the U.S. and 11% (95% CI=7%, 15%) for Australia. These patterns also were evident for all specific subcategories of illness or problem. For instance, seasonal differences ranged from 7% (95% CI=5%, 10%) for anxiety (followed by OCD, bipolar, depression, suicide, ADHD, schizophrenia) to 37% (95% CI=31%, 44%) for eating disorder queries in the U.S. Several nonclinical motivators for query seasonality (such as media trends or academic interest) were explored and rejected.
   Conclusions: Information seeking on Google across all major mental illnesses and/or problems followed seasonal patterns similar to those found for seasonal affective disorder. These are the first data published on patterns of seasonality in information seeking encompassing all the major mental illnesses, notable also because they likely would have gone undetected using traditional surveillance.

AB The association between conventional religiosity and suicide inhibition has been well explored and documented since the pioneering work of Durkheim. Commentators like Heelas and Woodhead point to ways in which conventional religiosity is giving way in England and Wales to a range of alternative spiritualities, including renewed interest in paranormal phenomena. Taking a sample of 3095 13- to 15-year-old adolescents, the present study examines the association between suicidal ideation and both conventional religiosity and paranormal beliefs, after controlling for individual differences in sex, age and personality (extraversion, neuroticism and psychoticism). The data demonstrate that, while conventional religiosity is slightly associated with lower levels of suicidal ideation, paranormal beliefs are strongly associated with higher levels of suicidal ideation.

AB Despite the widespread use of closed-circuit television (CCTV) in prison, few studies have explored its effect on prisoner misbehavior. Research was conducted to explore two research questions: (a) Does CCTV have a greater preventative effect on nonviolent than on violent prisoner misbehavior? and (b) Does CCTV have a greater preventative effect on planned than on unplanned violent behavior? Data were obtained on the 1,116 incidents involving aberrant prisoner behavior that occurred at four prisons in Queensland, Australia, during a 6-year period. Findings indicate that violent and unplanned misbehavior was relatively more likely to occur in view of CCTV coverage than was nonviolent and planned misbehavior. The implications for the prevention of aberrant inmate behavior and for researchers' understanding of the impact of CCTV on violence are discussed.

AB Older people are at risk for developing psychiatric disorders and require highly skilled and knowledgeable nurse practitioners to provide early recognition and intervention of psychiatric problems. This study sought to identify the aged care mental health knowledge of registered nurses (RNs) employed in long-term aged care and test the validity and reliability of a North American tool for use in an Australian context. The Mary Starke Harper Ageing Knowledge Exam (MSHAKE) was sent to RNs (n = 350) in 70 long-term care facilities (LTCF) in Queensland, Australia, and 107 surveys were returned (30.5% response). Participants were found to be unprepared for the reality of caring for the mental health needs of an older population and to have knowledge deficits related to suicide, prevalence of mental illness, mental health and ethnicity, and a number of issues regarding dementia.

AB The Australian government deregulated the wheat export market in 2008, ending 60 years of statutory wheat marketing by the Australian Wheat Board (AWB). In this article, I explore the discursive shifts which contributed to this change. I adopt a genealogical approach to this research, by collecting and analysing policy documents produced between 1983 and 2012, to understand how truthssuch as efficiency, competition and the good farmer'were constructed and reproduced to facilitate wheat export market deregulation in Australia. Through analysing the case of wheat export market deregulation, and the process by which this shift was made possible, this article contributes more broadly to research examining the neoliberalisation of Australian rural industries, and the discursive construction of norms, values and identities to facilitate these changes.

AB Indigenous Australians have higher levels of mental illness, self-harm, suicide and substance abuse than non-Indigenous Australians, as well as more frequent contact with the criminal justice system. These indices point to the need for strong leadership to support Close the Gap programmes that have now been implemented across Australia. This article considers leadership as a journey of learning for Australian Indigenous leaders. Through the use of story, it is suggested that a situational leadership approach, incorporating the principles of mindfulness, provides the most appropriate framework for Indigenous leaders who work with Indigenous communities. Flexible approaches are needed to meet the needs of diverse Indigenous populations, and address the complex challenges involved, including lateral violence. Such flexibility will enable Indigenous leaders and communities to work together to achieve improvements in the health outcomes, not only for Indigenous Australians, but also for Indigenous populations worldwide.

AB The objective was to examine agreement between routine clinician diagnoses of DSM-IV Anxiety, Depressive, Substance-Use disorders with diagnoses generated by CIDI-Auto Version 2.1, administered by trained interviewers. Subjects were 329 deliberate self poisoning patients at a tertiary referral center in Australia. Tests of agreement were: percentage agreement, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and Cohen's kappa coefficients, for 1 month and 12 month CIDI diagnoses. Agreement was poor (kappa 0.40) for Anxiety, Depressive and Substance-Use disorders. Since diagnosis largely determines subsequent treatment, these findings did not support the use of the less expensive CIDI-Auto procedure to replace clinical diagnosis by experienced clinicians for this group of patients exhibiting suicidal behavior.

AB Postpartum depression has been described as a thief that steals motherhood. It can result in tragedy and sometimes in headline-gripping maternal suicide or infanticide. Because one of the highest priorities for nursing is to continually advance the knowledge the underlies nursing practice, it is essential that we understand what nurse researchers have done to advance the knowledge base of postpartum depression. This integrative review is a two-part series for MCN that summarizes 141 postpartum depression studies conducted by nurse researchers from around the globe, including United States, Australia, Canada, China (Hong Kong, Taiwan), Finland, Iceland Sweden, Turkey, and Malaysia. Specific areas of postpartum depression to which nurse researchers have devoted their primary attention include epidemiology, risk factors, transcultural perspectives, instrument development, screening, interventions and mother-infant interactions.

ID SUICIDE
AB Objective: To examine the depiction of mental health issues in contemporary Australian adolescent literature. This material might influence teenagers' understanding of mental illness and their willingness to seek help, and may provide insights into societal attitudes towards adolescents and the psychiatric problems encountered in this age group.
   Design: Systematic examination of a sample of 94 books, the "Notable Texts" in the "Older Child" category of the Children's Book Council of Australia Awards for the years 1996, 1997 and 1998.
   Main outcome measures: Number of works referring to psychiatry; characters who experienced trauma, loss, psychiatric symptoms, qualified for a psychiatric diagnosis, exhibited suicidal behaviour or sought help; and the nature of treatments given.
   Results: There was reference to psychiatry in over two-thirds of the works. In these books the image of psychiatry was generally negative or mixed. Most adolescent characters suffered major losses. Two-fifths of characters met criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis. The outcome for characters who satisfied criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis was more negative than those without. Of the 10 characters in the sample who committed suicide, eight had a psychiatric disorder.
   Conclusions: Psychiatric themes are a major component of the Australian teenage novel. Young people in contemporary Australian teenage literature are beset with trauma, loss and psychiatric disorders. Even when help is obtained, the outcome is seldom positive. This nihilistic view may increase hopelessness and pose a barrier for teenagers seeking help.

ID MENTAL-ILLNESS; VIOLENCE; SUICIDE; ASSOCIATION; DISORDERS; SHOOTINGS;
   AUSTRALIA
AB The 20th anniversary of the National Firearms Agreement (NFA) offers lessons for mental health and public health. Along with similar international legislation, the NFA exemplifies how firearms regulation can prevent firearm mortality and injuries.
   The gun lobby claims that mental illness underpins gun violence and should be a key site for intervention.
   A modest but significant link exists between mental disorders and community violence. However, the vast majority of mentally ill individuals are not violent. Despite media portrayals of their dangerousness, they are more likely to be victims of violence and of suicide.
   Most violent individuals do not have mental illness, and most mass murderers do not have identifiable severe mental illness. Many have maladaptive personality configurations. Gun availability and gun ownership, not severe mental illness, determines most gun homicides.
   Following recent gun massacres in the United States, there have been calls for better resourcing of mental health services to help identify and respond to those at risk and to regulate firearms access.
   Screening mentally ill populations for violence risk is misguided. However, clinicians can play a key role in working with legal authorities to monitor and assist regulation of firearm access, especially among high risk populations.
   Clinician involvement must be complemented by wider gun control measures. The gun lobby's turning the firearms availability debate into a question about whether people with mental illness histories should access such weapons is a calculated appeal to prejudice.

AB The mental health impact of drought is poorly quantified and no previous research has demonstrated a relationship between distress and explicit environmentally based measures of drought. With continuing climate change, it is important to understand what drought is and how it may affect the mental health. We quantified drought in terms of duration and intensity of relative dryness and identified drought characteristics associated with poor mental health to evaluate any vulnerability in rural and urban communities. Our methods involved analysis of 100-year longitudinal records of monthly rainfall linked to one wave (2007-2008) of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey. Cluster analysis was used to characterise different patterns of dryness and linear regression analysis was used to examine associations with participant distress, as well as the moderating role of rural locality. The results showed that, during a seven-year period of major and widespread drought, one pattern of relative dryness (extreme cumulative number of months in drought culminating in a recent period of dryness lasting a year or more) was associated with increased distress for rural but not urban dwellers. The increase in distress was estimated to be 6.22%, based on 95% confidence intervals. Thus, we show that it is possible to quantitatively identify an association between patterns of drought and distress. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: To assess the effectiveness of mental health first aid (MHFA) training in drought-affected rural and remote Australia, as part of a strategy to improve capacity among farming communities to provide early intervention for mental health problems.
   Methods: Data were obtained from 99 participants recruited across 12 New South Wales towns, before and after delivery of MHFA seminars emphasising the role of front-line workers from agricultural-related services. Surveys assessed knowledge of, confidence in dealing with, and attitude towards people experiencing mental illness, along with the impact of training on response to mental health problems among target population of farmers and farming families.
   Results: Rural support workers and community volunteers attended MHFA seminars because of perceived mental health needs in the workplace. A majority of responses reflect a concern with giving appropriate advice and support well outside narrow job definitions. Participants' ability to identify high prevalence disorders and endorse evidence-based interventions for both high and low prevalence disorders increased following MHFA training, as did their confidence in their ability to provide appropriate help. Conclusions: MHFA training can form an effective part of a strategy to improve systems of care and pathways to early intervention in rural communities by using local networks to provide mental health support.

AB This is a study exploring perceptions of men's experience of depression in rural and remote areas of Australia. The purpose of this investigation was to generate new' information that can inform models of diagnosis and primary care for the treatment of depression in men in rural and remote areas. Men and women were recruited from two North Queensland sites to participate in semistructured interviews in both an individual and focus group format and completing a series of questionnaires. A combination of grounded theory and content analysis was adopted to analyse the qualitative data, and develop theory around men's experience of depression in rural and remote areas. The findings of this study suggest that men's experience of depression within a rural context is defined by a process of internal compound' whereupon emotional distress can represent itself in avoidant and dulling behaviours along with self-reliant attempts to fix' the situation. From this study a language has been provided to give explanation to the experience of depression in men in rural and remote areas. The findings of this study have implications for, and provide opportunity for reform in, how we approach the recognition, diagnosis and treatment of depression for men in rural and remote areas.

   study of the impact of drought on a rural Australian community

AB Many rural Australian communities continue to endure a prolonged drought. The mental health effects of short-term natural disaster are well known; those of a long-term and chronic natural disaster such as drought are less well understood. However, in addition to immediate distress there are likely to be feelings of loss, grief and hopelessness, all of which are implicated in an increased risk of subsequent psychiatric morbidity. Furthermore, rural Australia is at a relative disadvantage for early and effective mental health intervention due to a lack of resources, compared with urban Australia. This qualitative research investigates the experience of drought in two farming communities in the state of New South Wales. Farmers, farm and non-farm businesspeople, and health workers took part in focus group discussions of the effects of drought on themselves, their families and their community. In addition to current distress related to financial and workload problems, people reported experiencing significant distress from the emotional impact of environmental degradation, from loss of hope for the future of their community, and from feelings of being misunderstood by the wider Australian community. The stressors affecting farming communities during times of drought are likely to be associated with increased risk of mental health problems.

SO RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH

   minority; sexuality; suicide; youth
ID HETEROSEXUAL YOUTH; URBAN DIFFERENCES; MINORITY; RISK
AB Introduction: To address the lack of Australian data examining mental health in same-sex attracted rural adolescents compared with their rural heterosexual peers, this study examined experiences of stressors, symptoms of depression and suicidality, and perceptions of barriers to seeking mental health support, comparing same-sex attracted adolescents with heterosexual adolescents living in rural Australia.
   Methods: Respondents were recruited through high schools in rural South Australia and completed a questionnaire that included demographic questions, the Kutcher Adolescent Depression Scale (KADS-6) and measures of stressors and perceptions of barriers to seeking mental health support. Participants were 531 adolescents (55% female, 43% male), aged 13 to 18, 31 of whom identified as same-sex attracted.
   Results: Same-sex attracted adolescents reported significantly more depression symptoms (mean=6.1, standard deviation (SD)=3.9) compared to other adolescents (mean=2.9, SD=3.2, U=2867, p<0.001, r=0.16). More adolescents who were same-sex attracted screened positive for depression (54.8% vs 15.9%) and there was a significant difference in responses to the item assessing suicidality between same-sex attracted and other adolescents (mean=1.1, SD=1.1; mean=0.3, SD=0.7, X-2 (1, N=531)=27.10, p<0.001, phi=0.24). Same-sex attracted adolescents reported more experiences of stressors relating to relationships, bullying and physical assault than heterosexual adolescents but, contrary to expectations, did not report perceiving more barriers to seeking mental health support (total barriers: same-sex attracted adolescents mean=2.5 (1.8), other adolescents mean=2.5 (1.9), t(527)=0.06, p=0.95, d=0.00).
   Conclusions: Adolescents who identified as being same-sex attracted are at much greater risk of depression and suicidality than other adolescents in rural South Australia. The finding that same-sex attracted adolescents experienced a higher number of relationship stressors, bullying and assault underscores the need for more focus on addressing these issues for this group of vulnerable adolescents. While same-sex attracted adolescents did not perceive more barriers to seeking mental health support, greater understanding of same-sex attracted adolescents' access to appropriate services in rural areas is needed to be able to improve mental health functioning in this population. In addition, addressing the wider issues (eg stigma) contributing to the greater number of stressors, including victimisation, faced by same-sex attracted adolescents should be a priority.

ID SUICIDAL INTENT; INJURY
AB Objective: To (1) estimate the lifetime and 12-month prevalence of self-harm without suicide intent in young people aged 12-17 years, (2) describe the co-morbidity of these behaviours with mental illness and (3) describe their co-variation with key social and demographic variables.
   Method: A nationally representative random sample of households with children aged 4-17 years recruited in 2013-2014. The survey response rate was 55% with 6310 parents and carers of eligible households participating. In addition, 2967 (89%) of young people aged 11-17 completed a self-report questionnaire with 2653 of the 12- to 17-year-olds completing questions about self-harm behaviour.
   Results: In any 12-month period, about 8% of all 12- to 17-year-olds (an estimated 137,000 12- to 17-year-olds) report engaging in self-harming behaviour without suicide intent. This prevalence increases with age to 11.6% in 16- to 17-year-olds. Eighteen percent (18.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI]=[14.5, 23.0]) of all 12- to 17-year-old young people with any mental health disorder measured by parent or carer report said that they had engaged in self-harm in the past 12 months. Among young people who were measured by self-report and met criteria for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders' major depressive disorder almost half (46.6%; 95% CI=[40.0, 53.1]) also reported that they had engaged in self-harm in the past 12 months. Suicide risk among those who self-harm is significantly elevated relative to the general population.
   Conclusion: The demonstrated higher risks in these young people for continued harm or possible death support the need for ongoing initiatives to reduce self-harm through mental health promotion, improved mental health literacy and continuing mental health reform to ensure services are accessible to, and meet the needs of families and young persons.

TI Reducing psychological distress and obesity in Australian farmers by
   promoting physical activity
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID METABOLIC SYNDROME; ADIPOSE-TISSUE; DEPRESSION; ANXIETY; STRESS;
   CORTISOL; SUICIDE; SCALES; FOOD; QUESTIONNAIRE
AB Background: Studies have confirmed that the rate of mental illness is no higher in rural Australians than that of urban Australians. However, the rate of poor mental health outcomes, and in particular suicide, is significantly raised in rural populations. This is thought to be due to lack of early diagnosis, health service access, the distance-decay effect, poor physical health determinants and access to firearms. Research conducted by the National Centre for Farmer Health between 2004 and 2009 reveals that there is a correlation between obesity and psychological distress among the farming community where suicide rates are recognised as high. Chronic stress overstimulates the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that is associated with abdominal obesity. Increasing physical activity may block negative thoughts, increase social contact, positively influence brain chemistry and improve both physical and mental health. This paper describes the design of the Farming Fit study that aims to identify the effect of physical activity on psychological distress, obesity and health behaviours such as diet patterns and smoking in farm men and women.
   Methods/Design: For this quasi experimental (convenience sample) control intervention study, overweight (Body Mass Index >= 25 kg/m(2)) farm men and women will be recruited from Sustainable Farm Families (TM) (SFF) programs held across Victoria, Australia. Baseline demographic data, health data, depression anxiety stress scale (DASS) scores, dietary information, physical activity data, anthropometric data, blood pressure and biochemical analysis of plasma an salivary cortisol levels will be collected. The intervention group will receive an exercise program and regular phone coaching in order to increase their physical activity. Analysis will evaluate the impact of the intervention by longitudinal data (baseline and post intervention) comparison of intervention and control groups.
   Discussion: This study is designed to examine the effect of physical activity on psychological health and other co-morbidities such as obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, hypertension and dyslipidaemia within a high-risk cohort. The outcomes of this research will be relevant to further research and service delivery programs, in particular those tailored to rural communities.

AB Introduction: International depression screening guidelines in heart failure (HF) are partly based on depression treatment efficacy from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Our aim was to test the external validity of depression RCT criteria in a sample of real-world HF patients.
   Methods: HF patients admitted to 3 hospitals in South Australia were referred to a HF psychologist if not already receiving current psychiatric management by psychologist or psychiatrist elsewhere. Screening and referral protocol consisted of the following; (a). Patient Health Questionnaire >= 10; (b). Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire >= 7); (c). positive response to 1 item panic attack screener; (d). evidence of suicidality. Patients were evaluated against the most common RCT exclusion criteria personality disorder, high suicide risk, cognitive impairment, psychosis, alcohol or substance abuse or dependency, bi-polar depression.
   Results: Total 81 HF patients were referred from 404 HF admissions, and 73 were assessed (age 60.6 +/- 13.4, 47.9% female). Nearly half (47%) met at least 1 RCT exclusion criterion, most commonly personality disorder (28.5%), alcohol/substance abuse (17.8%) and high suicide risk (11.0%). RCT ineligibility criteria was more frequent among patients with major depression (76.5% vs. 46.2%, p<.01) and dysthymia (26.5% vs. 7.7%, p = .03) but not significantly associated with anxiety disorders. RCT ineligible patients reported greater severity of depression (M = 16.6 +/- 5.0 vs. M=12.9 +/- 7.2, p = .02) and were higher consumers of HF psychotherapy services (M = 11.5 +/- 4.7 vs. M=8.5 +/- 4.8, p = .01).
   Conclusion: In this real-world sample comparable in size to recent RCT intervention arms, patients with depression disorders presented with complex psychiatric needs including comorbid personality disorders, alcohol/substance use and suicide risk. These findings suggest external validity of depression screening and RCTs could serve as a basis for level A guideline recommendations in cardiovascular diseases.

AB Concerns that treatment for heroin dependence using naltrexone may increase suicide rates during treatment and fatal overdoses posttreatment have been expressed. There is also disquiet about mortality during induction onto methadone. We assessed mortality during specific periods following treatment with naltrexone implants or methadone. Data were assembled using the Western Australian Data Linkage System. The methadone cohort comprised all those who started methadone in Western Australia during 2001-2002: The naltrexone cohort comprised all Western Australian heroin-dependent persons who received their first implant in 2001-2002. There were 15 (2.7%) deaths in the methadone cohort (n = 553) and 6 (1.8%) deaths in the naltrexone cohort (n = 341). Mortality rates for the "initial 14-day period," "stable treatment," and "overall" were 94.47, 0.0, and 5.83 deaths/1,000 person-years for the methadone group. In the naltrexone group, the rates "during first treatment (0-6 months)," "post first treatment," and overall were 0.0, 4.21, and 3.76 deaths/1,000 person-years. The age-standardized mortality rate ratio for naltrexone compared to methadone was 0.645 (95% confidence interval = 0.123-1.17). Increased mortality during induction onto methadone was confirmed. Evidence relating naltrexone to either increased suicide or overdose was not found. Overall mortality rates for naltrexone implant were similar to those for methadone. but increased mortality during methadone induction was avoided. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Literature has shown that dissemination of guidelines alone is insufficient to ensure that guideline recommendations are incorporated into every day clinical practice.
   Methods: We aimed to investigate the gaps between guideline recommendations and clinical practice in the management of young people with depression by undertaking an audit of medical files in a catchment area public mental health service for 15 to 25 year olds in Melbourne, Australia.
   Results: The results showed that the assessment and recording of depression severity to ensure appropriate treatment planning was not systematic nor consistent; that the majority of young people (74.5%) were prescribed an antidepressant before an adequate trial of psychotherapy was undertaken and that less than 50% were monitored for depression symptom improvement and antidepressant treatment emergent suicide related behaviours (35% and 30% respectively). Encouragingly 92% of first line prescriptions for those aged 18 years or under who were previously antidepressant-naive was for fluoxetine as recommended.
   Conclusions: This research has highlighted the need for targeted strategies to ensure effective implementation. These strategies might include practice system tools that allow for systematic monitoring of depression symptoms and adverse side effects, particularly suicide related behaviours. Additionally, youth specific psychotherapy that incorporates the most effective components for this age group, delivered in a youth friendly way would likely aid effective implementation of guideline recommendations for engagement in an adequate trial of psychotherapy before medication is initiated.

DT Article

ID GENERAL-PRACTITIONERS; MAJOR DEPRESSION; ELDERLY PATIENTS; LATE-LIFE;
   RECOGNITION; GUIDELINE; ANXIETY
AB Objective: To determine the characteristics of depressed older patients whose mental health status is detected by their general practitioner (GP).
   Method: Cross-sectional analytical design of 218 patients scoring above the cut-off (>= 16) of the Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D), from a sample of 916 consecutive patients aged 60 years or over attending one of 54 randomly selected GPs in Western Australia. Prior to their medical consultation, patients completed a self-report questionnaire, which included questions about depressive symptomatology (CES-D). Following the consultation, general practitioners recorded the patient's presenting complaint(s), medication information, and mental health details on a patient summary sheet.
   Results: Among these 218 patients, 39.9% (87/218) were correctly classified as depressed by their GP. Detection of depressive symptomatology was associated with patients who acknowledged taking sleeping tablets (OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.3-5.4), had CES-D scores indicative of major depression (>= 22) (OR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.4-5.6) and were thought to be at risk for suicide (OR = 35.1, 95% CI = 4.5-274.2).
   Conclusions: While GPs are most apt to detect depression among older patients with prominent mental health symptoms, many patients in this age group silently experience significant depressive symptomatology and miss the opportunity for effective treatment. The routine use of screening tools in primary care is recommended to enhance the detection rate of depression in older adults.

AB Schizophrenia is a devastating mental disorder, associated with mortality rates up to three times higher than those in the general population. This post-mortem study sought to investigate the causes of death in a consecutive series of schizophrenia cases, with a specific focus on cardiovascular disease and sudden death. A 10-year review of autopsies in schizophrenia related-cases performed at the Department of Forensic Medicine in Sydney, Australia was undertaken. Premorbid clinical and demographic information was recorded, as well as the key pathological findings and final cause of death. From 2003 to 2012, there were 19,478 postmortem examinations performed of which 683 (3.5%) were deaths in people with a history of schizophrenia. In these cases, the mean age at death was 51 years (range 18-93 years), with 43% in the 41-60 year age group. Males comprised 67% of cases. Overall, 62% of cases had a BMI >= 25 kg/m(2), indicating overweight or obese individuals. The three primary causes of death were "cardiovascular" (23%), "suicide" (20%), and "drug toxicity" (17%). In 11% of cases (n = 72), no definitive cause of death was found, the so-called "unexplained" cases. In conclusion, patients with schizophrenia have premature mortality. The major contributing factors include cardiovascular diseases, suicide and drug toxicity. The "unexplained" and frequently sudden deaths may suggest underlying cardiac arrhythmias as a cause of death in a subgroup of schizophrenia patients. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB The high prevalence of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among people with heroin dependence and its impact on short term outcomes has been well established. The impact of PTSD on long-term recovery is, however, unknown. This paper examines the impact of current and lifetime PTSD on long-term recovery from heroin dependence among participants who took part in the 11-year follow-up of the Australian Treatment Outcome Study (ATOS), a prospective naturalistic longitudinal study of 615 people with heroin dependence recruited from Sydney, Australia, in 2001-2002. Seventy-one percent of the cohort (n = 431) were re-interviewed 11 years post study entry. Outcomes examined included heroin and other drug use, dependence, general physical and mental health, depression, PTSD, employment, and the incidence of trauma exposure, overdose, imprisonment, and attempted suicide over the 11-year follow-up. Despite having a poorer profile at baseline, individuals with current PTSD or a history of PTSD at baseline demonstrated similar levels of improvement to those without a history of PTSD in all outcome domains across the 11-year follow-up, PTSD was associated with consistently higher levels of major depression, and attempted suicide, subsequent trauma exposure, and poorer occupational functioning across the 11-year follow-up. These findings highlight the importance of interventions aimed at occupational rehabilitation, reducing the likelihood of retraumatisation, and addressing PTSD and associated comorbidities among people with heroin dependence.

AB BackgroundMedical student wellbeing-a consensus statement from Australia and New Zealand outlines recommendations for optimising medical student wellbeing within medical schools in our region. Worldwide, medical schools have responsibilities to respond to concerns about student psychological, social and physical wellbeing, but guidance for medical schools is limited. To address this gap, this statement clarifies key concepts and issues related to wellbeing and provides recommendations for educational program design to promote both learning and student wellbeing. The recommendations focus on student selection; learning, teaching and assessment; learning environment; and staff development. Examples of educational initiatives from the evidence-base are provided, emphasising proactive and preventive approaches to student wellbeing.Main recommendationsThe consensus statement provides specific recommendations for medical schools to consider at all stages of program design and implementation. These are:Design curricula that promote peer support and progressive levels of challenge to students.Employ strategies to promote positive outcomes from stress and to help others in need.Design assessment tasks to foster wellbeing as well as learning.Provide mental health promotion and suicide prevention initiatives.Provide physical health promotion initiatives.Ensure safe and health-promoting cultures for learning in on-campus and clinical settings.Train staff on student wellbeing and how to manage wellbeing concerns.ConclusionA broad integrated approach to improving student wellbeing within medical school programs is recommended. Medical schools should work cooperatively with student and trainee groups, and partner with clinical services and other training bodies to foster safe practices and cultures. Initiatives should aim to assist students to develop adaptive responses to stressful situations so that graduates are prepared for the realities of the workplace. Multi-institutional, longitudinal collaborative research in Australia and New Zealand is needed to close critical gaps in the evidence needed by medical schools in our region.

AB Background Research documents substantial adolescent health disparities by sexual orientation, but studies are confined to a small number of countries-chiefly the USA. We provide first-time evidence of associations between sexual orientation and adolescent health/well-being in a new country-Australia. We also add to knowledge by examining health/well-being outcomes not previously analysed in national samples, considering adolescents reporting no sexual attractions, and rank-ordering sexual-orientation health disparities by magnitude. Methods Data from an Australian national probability sample of 14/15 years old (Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, n=3318) and regression models adjusted for confounding and for multiple comparisons were used to examine the associations between sexual attraction and 30 outcomes spanning multiple domains of health/well-being-including socio-emotional functioning, health-related quality of life, depressive symptoms, health-related behaviours, social support, self-harm, suicidality, victimisation, self-concept, school belonging and global health/well-being assessments. Results Lesbian, gay, bisexual and questioning adolescents displayed significantly worse health/well-being than their heterosexual peers in all outcomes (p<0.05). The magnitude of the disparities ranged between 0.13 and 0.75 SD, and was largest in the domains of self-harm, suicidality, peer problems and emotional problems. There were fewer differences between the heterosexual and no-attraction groups. Worse outcomes were observed among both-sex-attracted adolescents compared with same-sex-attracted adolescents, and sexual-minority girls compared with sexual-minority boys. Conclusions Consistent with the minority stress model and recent international scholarship, sexual-minority status is an important risk factor for poor adolescent health/well-being across domains in Australia. Interventions aimed at addressing sexual-orientation health disparities within Australian adolescent populations are urgently required.

AB Interpersonal violence and mental illness are significant public health issues. This study aimed to determine gender differences in risk factors for recurrent mental health contacts after a hospitalization for interpersonal violence in Western Australia between 1997 and 2008. This population-based retrospective cohort study used linked hospital morbidity data and mental health records to identify individuals who were hospitalized due to interpersonal violence and had recurrent mental health contacts following hospitalization. A total of 1,969 individuals had a first-ever mental health contact after their index hospitalization for violence. The most common reasons for a mental health contact after interpersonal violence hospitalization were anxiety and/or depression (n = 396, 20.1%), neurotic disorders (n=338, 11.8%), schizophrenia (n=232, 11.8%), and psychoactive substance use (n = 206, 10.5%). Different risk factors for recurrent contact with mental health services emerged for males and females. For males, factors significantly associated with increased risk of recurrent mental health contacts included advancing age and not being married. However, for females, type of violence, Indigenous status, age, and living in rural or remote areas affected the risk of recurrent mental health contacts, whereas marital status did not. These findings have implications for the targeting of mental health prevention programs tailored specifically for males and females affected by violence.

AB Purpose of Review This reviews the history of gun buybacks and the literature to determine their impact and efficacy, as well as highlighting salient critiques. Finally, we discuss potential avenues that would enhance our understanding of buybacks and methods to address gun violence. Recent Findings Gun buybacks have become more prominent since their inception in the 1970s and often come in response to a tragic local event. The largest scale buyback was in the mid-1990s in Australia, which collected over 650,000 guns. Buybacks are a cost-effective method of reducing the number of weapons in the general public. Gun buybacks are a cost-effective means to reduce the number of unwanted firearms in the general public and also provide a means for education regarding injury prevention. Buybacks in conjunction with other methods have been shown to be successful in reducing the number of firearms that could lead to injury and death.

AB Rural and remote communities often have complex and diverse mental health needs and inadequate mental health services and infrastructure. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) provide an array of potentially innovative and cost-effective means for connecting rural and remote communities to specialist mental health practitioners, services, and supports, irrespective of physical location. However, despite this potential, a review of Australian and international literature reveals that ICT has not attained widespread uptake into social work practice or implementation in rural communities. This article reviews the social work literature on ICT, draws on research on tele-psychology and tele-education, and provides suggestions on how to enhance engagement with ICT by social workers to implement and provide mental health services and supports tailored to community values, needs, and preferences that are commensurate with the values of the social work profession.

AB Between 1973 and 1995, a total of 76 patients were treated with bilateral stereotactic, orbitomedial lesions for resistant severe depression at the Neuropsychiatric Institute, Sydney, Australia. On follow up after a mean 14.4 years, 24 (31.6%) subjects were confirmed dead, with six having committed suicide. Of the 52 patients still alive (mean age 62.9 years), 23 were interviewed in detail, and lesions verified in 18 with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) On a 6-point global outcome rating scale, rated by consensus between two independent psychiatrists, five (22.7%) were judged to be completely recovered and another 11 (50%) showed significant improvement. The improvement was noted within days or weeks of the surgery. Adverse effects were epilepsy (2 subjects), marked personality change (1), weight gain (2) and mild personality change (5). Any reported cognitive impairment was mild. No definite predictors of improvement were identified.

AB Objectives: To quantify the population attributable risk of key modifiable risk factors associated with breast cancer incidence in Queensland, Australia.
   Study design: Population attributable fractions (PAFs) for high body mass index (BMI), use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), alcohol consumption and inadequate physical activity were calculated, using prevalence data from a representative survey of women attending mammographic screening at BreastScreen Queensland in 2008 and relative risk estimates sourced from published literature. Attributable cancers were calculated using 'underlying' breast cancer incidence data for 2008 based on Poisson regression models, adjusting for the inflation of incidence due to the effects of mammographic screening.
   Main outcome measures: Attributable burden of breast cancer due to high body mass index (BMI), use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), alcohol consumption and inadequate physical activity.
   Results: In Queensland women aged 45-69 years, an estimated 12.1% (95% CI: 11.6-12.5%) of invasive breast cancers were attributable to high BMI in post-menopausal women who have never used HRT; 2.8% (95% CI: 2.7-2.9%) to alcohol consumption; 7.6% (95% CI: 7.4-7.9%) to inadequate physical activity in post-menopausal women and 6.2% (95% CI: 5.5-7.0%) to current use of HRT after stratification by BMI and type of HRT used. Combined, just over one quarter (26.0%; 95% CI: 25.4-26.6%) of all invasive breast cancers in Queensland women aged 45-69 years in 2008 were attributable to these modifiable risk factors.
   Conclusions: There is benefit in targeting prevention strategies to modify lifestyle behaviours around BMI, physical activity, HRT use and alcohol consumption, as a reduction in these risk factors could decrease invasive breast cancer incidence in the Queensland population.

AB The PANDA Perinatal Anxiety & Depression Australia National Helpline provides support for people affected by perinatal mental health issues. To describe the characteristics of women contacting the Helpline, specifically callers' health, past history and assessed risk factors. Analysis of routinely collected de-identified data of women making initial calls between July 2010 and October 2013. Five thousand eight hundred eighteen women made an initial call to the Helpline. Most were between 25 and 40 years old (79%) and married/partnered (94%); 52% were having or had their first child; and 23% were pregnant. Over half had no prior mental health diagnosis at the time of their initial call, and 40% were assessed as 'high needs'-experiencing significant bio-psychosocial symptoms, complex situations and/or inadequate care and support. There was a 70% increase in calls to PANDA over the data collection period. Concerns recorded by PANDA staff from the initial risk assessment included inadequate treatment for a mental health condition (31%), women not feeling connected to their baby (31%), low functioning (26%) and general thoughts of suicide (18%). The Helpline experienced a significant increase in demand during the study period, and a substantial proportion of callers had complex mental health needs. PANDA plays a major role in providing support to a large number of women experiencing perinatal mental health problems.

AB This paper reports on a prospective study exploring risk factors specifically related to the onset of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) during adolescence. We examined cumulative incidence and predictors of onset of NSSI over 1 year among 1,973 school-based adolescents (13-19 years old; M = 14.9, SD = 0.96) from five states in Australia. Data showed cumulative incidence of 3.8 % (95 % CI [3.0-4.7 %]) over 1 year. Multiple socio-demographic and psychosocial factors were assessed using sequential logistic regression models. Onset of NSSI was associated with being female (OR = 3.47, 95 % CI [1.48-8.18]), being born outside of Australia (OR = 3.05, 95 % CI [1.10-8.47]), not identifying as religious or spiritual (OR = 1.80, 95 % CI [1.04-3.10]), increased psychological distress (OR = 1.12, 95 % CI [1.08-1.16]), poor social support from family (OR = 0.89, 95 % CI [0.83-0.95]), poor self-esteem (OR = 0.90, 95 % CI [0.83-0.98]), and poor problem-solving coping (OR = 0.90, 95 % CI [0.82-0.99]). These findings may assist to better identify young people more likely to start self-injuring and also highlight issues to provide a focus for prevention initiatives.

AB Mental health literacy is the knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders that aid their recognition, management, or prevention and is considered to be an important determinant of help-seeking. This has relevance in suicide prevention, as depression, the clinical condition most frequently associated with suicidality, has been the target of community and professional education programs designed to enhance mental health literacy. In this study, whether such programs have influenced help-seeking attitudes and behavior in those who are depressed and suicidal was considered. The results indicate that despite intensive community education programs over the last two decades, there has been little change in those who are depressed and suicidal in terms of their attitudes toward treatment seeking and, more importantly, their treatment-seeking behavior. These results draw into question the value of current community education programs for those most vulnerable to suicidal behavior.

ID PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; AUSTRALIA; RIGHTS; TALK
AB This study investigated issues raised in qualitative data from our previous studies of health professionals and community members, which suggested that being opposed to euthanasia legislation did not necessarily equate to being anti-euthanasia per se. A postal survey of 1002 medical practitioners, 1000 nurses and 1200 community members was undertaken. In addition to a direct question on changing the law to allow active voluntary euthanasia (AVE), four statements assessed attitudes to euthanasia with or without a change in legislation. Responses were received from 405 doctors (43%), 429 nurses (45%) and 405 community members (38%). Compared with previous studies there was a slight increase in support for a change in the law from medical practitioners, a slight decrease in support from community members and almost no change among nurses. Different interpretations of the results of the four attitude questions are possible, depending on the perspective of the interpreter.

ID GLOBAL BURDEN
AB Issue addressed Since 1986, injury prevention and control has been classified as a National Health Priority. However, no reviews into the injury prevention workforce have been conducted in Australia since 2011 and to date; none has focused specifically on the injury prevention and safety promotion sector in Western Australia (WA). This research sought to review the scope of the injury prevention and safety promotion workforce in WA to gain a greater understanding of sector characteristics, work and needs. Methods An online, cross-sectional survey was conducted between mid-January and mid-March 2018. Participants were required to be: (a) based in WA or have a program running within WA; and (b) working in injury prevention and safety promotion relating to programs, policy or legislation development, implementation and/or evaluation within intentional (eg interpersonal violence, suicide and self-harm) or unintentional injuries (eg transport, poisoning, falls, drowning, burns) or farm, child and community, occupational health and safety, sport and recreation and trauma. Results The research found that participants were predominantly female (82%), aged 40 years or older (66.1%) and were employed full time (55.6%). The majority of participants worked in falls prevention (38.5%), alcohol and other drugs (38.0%), injury in general (31.8%) and community safety (30.7%). Conclusions Findings demonstrate significant heterogeneity with a core workforce supported by a range of non-core and indirect actors. Identifying characteristics and needs of the workforce supports coordinated capacity building to implement effective injury prevention and safety promotion initiatives. With this being the first review of the workforce in WA, this article highlights the need to more regularly audit the sector to determine its breadth and composition. So what? In the light of the recent announcement by the Commonwealth for a new national Injury Prevention Strategy, this study provides timely insights into the injury prevention and safety promotion sector in WA.

TI Mortality in young offenders: retrospective cohort study
SO BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID MENTAL-HEALTH; ADOLESCENTS; CUSTODY; ABUSE
AB Objectives To estimate overall and cause specific standardised mortality ratios in young offenders.
   Design Comparison of mortality data in cohort of young offenders.
   Settings State of Victoria, Australia.
   Subjects Cohort of young offenders aged 10-20 years with a first custodial sentence from 1 January 1988 to 31 December 1999.
   Main outcome measures Deaths ascertained by matching with the national death index, a database containing records of all deaths in Australia since 1980. Death rates in the reference Victorian population used to calculate standardised mortality ratios.
   Results The offender cohort comprised 2621 men and 228 women with 11 333 person years of observation. The median age of first detention was 17.9 years for men and 18.4 years for women. Median follow up was 3.3 years for men and 1.4 years for women. Overall standardised mortality ratio adjusted for age (expressed as a ratio) was 9.4 (95% confidence interval 7.4 to 11.9) for men and 41.3 (20.2 to 84.7) for women. Cause specific standardised mortality ratios for men were 25.7 (17.9 to 36.9) for drug related causes, 9.2 (5.8 to 15) for suicide, and 5.7 (3.6 to 9.2) for non-intentional injury. A quarter of drug related deaths in men aged 15-19 years were in offenders.
   Conclusions Social policies for young offenders should address both the prevalent drug and mental health problems as well the high levels of social disadvantage.

TI Changing epidemiology of intentional antidepressant drug overdose in
   Victoria, Australia
SO AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE antidepressant; emergency department; epidemiology; overdose
ID SUICIDE; ASSOCIATION; MORTALITY
AB Aim: To determine the epidemiology of intentional antidepressant drug overdose (OD), over an extended time period, in Victoria, Australia.
   Methods: Retrospective epidemiological study of all cases reported to the Victorian Emergency Minimum Dataset (VEMD) January 1998 to December 2007 and calls to the Victorian Poisons Information Centre (VPIC) June 2005 to September 2008
   Results: 5467 VEMD cases were analysed 3169 (57.9%) cases involved selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and 1149 (21%) involved tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) Sertraline (1252, 22.9% cases) was the most common drug. During 2001, the peak year of OD, there were 8.8 OD/100 000 population in the SSRI group and 3 8 OD/100 000 population in the TCA group. Trends over the study period showed increasing SSRI and 'other' newer antidepressant prescription rates and decreases for TCA and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) However, the risks of OD in all drug classes were similar and OD/100 000 prescriptions trended downwards for all drug classes over time 1833 VPIC calls were analysed. Calls relating to SSRIs were the most common yet SSRI OD was associated with significantly fewer symptoms (p < 0.001) and fewer patients with Poisoning Severity Score classifications of moderate or severe (p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: Antidepressant OD patterns are changing. Antidepressant OD incidence is following prescribing trends. The risk of OD is similar for all drug classes. Absolute numbers of OD and OD/100 000 prescriptions are decreasing for all drug classes

AB This study examines gender differences in the characteristics of young people (N = 1000) attending alcohol and other drug (AOD) services in the state of Victoria, Australia. Females demonstrate levels of substance use that are at least as high, and perhaps more harmful than that of males. Our data add to a growing base of evidence that young women attending youth AOD services experience additional psychosocial problems at higher rates than their male counterparts. This evidence is now fairly consistent in regard to mental health problems, self-injury, suicide attempts, and homelessness. Findings from this study further suggest that the gender imbalance may extend to child protection involvement, family conflict and disconnection, access to social support, and exposure to neglect and abuse.

AB Purpose of review
   This article reviews evidence about the impact of immigration detention and other restrictive immigration policies on the mental health of children, young people and the adults who care for them. We review the implications of this for clinicians attempting to assess or work with incarcerated child and adult refugees and asylum seekers.
   Recent findings
   There are increasing numbers of adults and children seeking asylum across the globe and many nations use incarceration and other harsh and interceptive immigration practices. There is mounting evidence of the psychological harm associated with detention of already vulnerable adults and children. Australia is used as a case study.
   Summary
   Clinicians are required to consider the intersection of mental health assessment and treatment with human rights violations, and the impact of restrictive immigration policies, not only on asylum seekers and refugees but also on clinicians, clinical practice and professional ethics.

AB The rapid uptake of technology offers potentially innovative approaches to promoting mental health amongst young people, addressing a significant public health challenge. The advent of Web 2.0 has seen a shift from text heavy content to the development of communities that foster connectivity. This area of research, its potential to engage young people at risk of isolation, and the mental health benefits it may have, has received little attention. This chapter considers evidence regarding technology's role in mental health promotion, particularly for marginalised young people. Results are presented from an Australian study, "Bridging the Digital Divide," which investigated technology access and utilisation by young people experiencing marginalisation. Finally, Australian policy regarding the digital divide and Internet safety is reviewed. The authors conclude that policy responses should move beyond just access and safety and explore innovative ways of ensuring safe and supportive online communities accessible for all young people.

AB The murder of family members is one of the most difficult crimes to understand. This study uses Shye's action systems framework combined with multivariate data analysis to test the hypothesis that different forms of familicide will reflect the four states an action system can take, namely: Integrative, Expressive, Conservative and Adaptive. A multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) was performed on 54 crime scene variables describing 104 cases of intra-familial homicide. The analysis revealed four distinct modes of functioning, which provided tentative support for Shye's action system. Each of the four modes had distinct associations with perpetrator characteristics. The Expressive and Integrative modes were associated with Cluster B personality traits, and criminal and substance use histories. The Adaptive mode was associated with trauma histories, mood disorders, and personality disorder traits. The Conservative theme was associated with trauma histories and psychotic disorders. Implications of findings for risk assessment and intervention are discussed.

AB To explore the psychological impact of a problematic industrial climate for citrus growers, their help-seeking behaviour and perspectives on ways to encourage better use of rural mental health services.
   Thematic analysis of in-depth interviews.
   The Riverland of South Australia.
   Sixteen citrus growers (12 male, 4 female) from eight Riverland towns.
   Citrus growers' perceived factors relating to psychological stress, coping behaviours, impact of stress on well-being, help-seeking behaviours, barriers to help-seeking and ways to encourage better use of rural mental health services.
   Work-related stresses grouped under broad themes, including 'Uncontrollable events', 'Financial hardship' and 'Pressure', had negative effects on participants' well-being. Furthermore, it was found that significant difficulties arise because many of the stresses which growers endure are not controllable, and that the alleviation of strain with the help of mental health professionals is uncommon because of barriers preventing help-seeking. Five broad themes of barriers to help-seeking were extracted from the data: 'Self-reliance', 'Social image', 'Lack of knowledge', 'Negative perceptions of health professionals' efficacy' and 'Restrictive lifestyle factors'. A specialised model of occupational health for citrus growers was proposed.
   These results highlight the practical need to address the identified issues in delivery and promotion of health services when facilitating help-seeking within this group. The findings also add to our knowledge of occupational health psychology broadly.

AB Patients with schizophrenia die on average 25 years earlier than the general population, and this gap appears to be increasing.
   Most of the excess mortality is due to premature cardiovascular deaths rather than suicide.
   Many psychotropic agents are orexigenic and can increase weight and promote dyslipidaemia.
   Traditional cardiac risk factors are undertreated among patients with schizophrenia, and they are less likely to receive cardiac revascularisation than those without a mental illness.
   Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic medication effective for treatment of refractory schizophrenia, but is associated with the risk of myocarditis and cardiomyopathy.
   Established protocols in Australia screen for myocarditis for patients who are initiating clozapine therapy and for long term monitoring for cardiomyopathy with echocardiography.
   Coordinated care between tertiary providers, general practitioners and primary health care professionals should monitor the physical health of people with psychosis or schizophrenia at least annually and treatment should be offered accordingly.

AB 'Sense of place' has become a central concept in the analysis of the cultural, personal and mental health risks posed by a changing climate. However, such place-related understandings of mental health and wellbeing remain largely limited to Indigenous health contexts. In this article we argue the relevance of sense of place in understanding the mental health impacts of climate change on family farmers who retain close living and working relationships to the land. We conducted a community-based qualitative case study located in the Western Australian Wheatbelt - a region that has experienced some of the most significant climate change in Australia. A three-part interview series was conducted with 22 family farmers between February 2013 and April 2014, and 15 interviews with various agricultural and mental health key informants. The research findings reveal that recently observed patterns of climate change have exacerbated farmers' worries about the weather, undermined notions of self-identity, and contributed to cumulative and chronic forms of place-based distress, culminating in heightened perceived risk of depression and suicide. The research findings highlight the tightly coupled ecosystem health-human health relationships that exist for family farmers living in regions affected by climate change, as well as the significance of farmers' place-based attachments and identities for their mental health and wellbeing.

AB Objective: This paper aims to quantify the population-level associations between child injury deaths and adult (aged 15 + years) per capita alcohol consumption (PCC) and between child injury deaths and the impact of major alcohol and safety policy changes in Australia.
   Methods: All child deaths due to external causes during 1910-2013, and child deaths due specifically to road crashes, assaults, suicide and other external causes, were obtained from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. Child (0-14 year) mortality rates were analysed in relation to PCC using an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model.
   Results: A positive association between PCC and overall child external mortality was identified. The estimated coefficient was 0.326 (p =.002), indicating that a 10% decrease in PCC was associated with a 3.3% reduction in child injury mortality. A positive association was identified for road traffic and other child injury mortality, but not assault injuries. The introduction of compulsory seatbelt legislation in combination with random breath testing was associated with a reduction in overall injury and road traffic child mortality. Decreasing the legal drinking age was associated with an increase in the rate of other external-cause child mortality.
   Conclusion: Reducing PCC in Australia is likely to result in a small but significant reduction in the injury mortality rate of children aged 0-14 years.

TI The effect of recalling paracetamol on hospital admissions for poisoning
   in Western Australia
SO MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
LA English
DT Article
ID PREVENTION; SUICIDE; UK
AB Objectives: To assess the effect of two recalls of paracetamol products on rates of intentional and unintentional overdoses of paracetamol in all age groups, as well as any effect on poisoning by other agents.
   Design: A before-and-after epidemiological study using data from the Western Australian Health Services Research Linked Database, which records all admissions to public and private hospitals throughout the State.
   Main outcome measures: Hospital admissions in Western Australia for poisonings with all agents, including paracetamol and other over-the-counter analgesics.
   Results: There were 11 752 admissions for poisoning from 1996 to 2001. Paracetamol was the primary poisoning agent in 2266 (19.3%) admissions, aspirin in 120 (1%) and ibuprofen in 277 (2%). There was a significant decrease in the admission rate for paracetamol poisoning when sales were restricted in 2000 (rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68-0.99) compared with the same period in other years. There was no increase in poisoning with other agents at this time. However, admissions for paracetamol overdose also showed a large random variation that tended to obscure any effect.
   Conclusions: Our study highlights the need to control for random as well as seasonal fluctuations in admission rates, and for restrictions on paracetamol sales to last for several months across all retail outlets. Limiting access to paracetamol may reduce paracetamol poisonings without a coincident increase in the use of other agents.

DE advance care planning; advance directive; dementia; withholding
   treatment
AB Objective The objective of this paper is to explore the ethical and legal validity of advance directives that request the voluntary stopping of eating and drinking against a backdrop of late-stage dementia. Method Doctrinal research and analysis of primary and secondary materials including Australian legislation, Australian case law and journal articles was undertaken. Results There is legal uncertainty in Australia around whether an advance directive to voluntarily stop eating and drinking will be followed should the adult become incompetent. Conclusion Voluntary stopping of eating and drinking should be viewed in law as a form of "treatment" that competent adults can nominate in advance directives, thereby providing dementia patients with the opportunity to choose in advance, if they wish, to end their life legally, with dignity and comfort, and in a manner that does not implicate others in criminal behaviour such as assisted suicide, acceleration of death or euthanasia.

AB All cases of fatal oxycodone toxicity presenting to the New South Wales Department of Forensic Medicine over the period January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2008, were retrieved. A total of 70 cases were identified. The mean age was 48.9 years, 58.6% were men, 21.4% were suicides, and in 30% oxycodone had not been prescribed to the decedent. Injecting drug users constituted 27.1% of cases, and oxycodone tablets were injected immediately prior to death by 21.4%. The mean blood oxycodone concentration was 0.40 mg/L (range 0.06-53.00 mg/L). In all cases, psychoactive substances other than oxycodone were also detected, most frequently hypnosedatives (68.6%), other opioids (54.3%), antidepressants (41.4%), and alcohol (32.9%). Preexisting systemic disease was common: cardiovascular (64.2%), pulmonary (49.3%), hepatic (66.7%), and renal (43.9%).

AB This article aims to increase accuracy in estimating the postmortem submersion interval (PMSI) for bodies recovered from rivers in the United Kingdom. Data were collected from closed case files, crime scene reports, and autopsy files concerning bodies recovered over a 15-year period from the River Clyde, Scotland, and the River Mersey and canals in northwest England. One hundred and eighty-seven cases met the study criteria and were scored by quantifying the overall amount of decomposition observed in each case. Statistical analysis showed that the duration of a body's submergence in water and the temperatures to which it was exposed, as measured in accumulated degree days (ADD), had a significant effect on the decay process. Further analysis indicated that there were no significant differences in decomposition between the waterways. By combining the data from all study samples, it was possible to produce a single linear regression model for predicting ADD from observed decomposition.

SO MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA

ID SUICIDE BOMBING ATTACKS; MANAGEMENT; BLAST; INJURY
AB Australian hospitals need to be prepared to deal with mass casualties from terrorist strikes, including bomb blasts and chemical, biological and radiation injury.
   Injuries from bomb explosions are more severe than those commonly seen in Australian hospitals.
   In disasters involving mass casualties in urban areas, many of the injured make their own way to hospital, often arriving before the more seriously injured casualties. Major hospitals in Australia should plan for large numbers of undifferentiated and potentially contaminated casualties arriving with minimal warning.
   It is critical that experienced and trained senior medical officers perform the triage of casualties in emergency departments, with frequent reassessment to detect missed injuries (especially pulmonary blast injury).
   Hospitals require well developed standard operating procedures for mass casualty events, reinforced by regular drills.
   Preparing for a major event includes training staff in major incident management, setting up an operational/control unit, nominating key personnel, ensuring there is an efficient intra-hospital communication system, and enhancing links with other emergency services and hospitals.

The audit found that since March 2003, when the High Security Inpatient Service opened, there was a very small number of critical incidents related to over 46,000 leave episodes. Of the 17 patients who went absent without permission over the 12-year study period, only 2 patients re-offended and 1 patient deliberately self-harmed during a leave episode. One patient assaulted his escort nurse during a leave and four patients attempted unsuccessfully to flee their escort nurses during escorted off-ground leave. No patient committed a serious violent offence and no patient committed suicide during an absence from leave. Only 4 of the 17 patients who went absent during leave between 2003 and 2015 remain as inpatients in the High Security Inpatient Service.

AB Life-extending changes in medical technology and an ageing population pose practical and ethical Problems relating to end-of-life decision making. Health professionals need to understand the fears and concerns Of their patients, their preferred place to die, and to respect patient autonomy.. Such wishes may be expressed verbally by a competent patient or through an advance directive (living will) or proxy by an incompetent patient. There is an urgent need for increased and improved training of health professionals in pain management and palliative care, and for the development of practical, ethical policies and guidelines with respect to withdrawing/withholding life-sustaining treatment. In addition, physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia, two of the important moral issues of the 90s, will continue to require open community debate as we move into the new millennium. Australia,in company with most other countries, has many challenges ahead in relation to end-of-life decision making.

ID ALZHEIMER-DISEASE; FRAILTY; LOST
AB Wandering behavior in dementia may result in significant injury or death. Search of files at Forensic Science South Australia over a 20-year period (1998-2018) identified nine individuals with dementia who were found deceased having been reported as missing from home/residential facilities (M:F, 6:3; age range, 54-92 years; average, 77.7 years; median, 80 years). The established clinical diagnoses were of dementia in seven cases and Alzheimer disease in two. Deaths were unnatural in six cases: hypo/hyperthermia three, drowning two, train impact one; natural in two cases due to ischemic (N=1) and valvular heart disease (N=1); and undetermined in one case due to marked decomposition. There were five fatalities in winter. Exposure and drowning were significant causes of death. The increasing aging population means cases of lethal wandering dementia will be more often encountered among forensic cases in future. Issues around duty of care and suicide should be considered in evaluating cases.

AB Older Australians living in rural areas have long faced significant challenges in maintaining health. Their circumstances are shaped by the occupations, lifestyles, environments and remoteness which characterise the diversity of rural communities. Many rural regions face threats to future sustainability and greater proportions of the aged reside in these areas.
   The emerging changes in Australia's climate over the past decade may be considered indicative of future trends, and herald amplification of these familiar challenges for rural communities. Such climate changes are likely to exacerbate existing health risks and compromise community infrastructure in some instances.
   This paper discusses climate change-related health risks facing older people in rural areas, with an emphasis on the impact of heat, drought and drying on rural and remote regions. Adaptive health sector responses are identified to promote mitigation of this substantial emerging need as individuals and their communities experience the projected impact of climate change.

TI Payback: The Custom of Assault and Rape of Sistergirls and Brotherboys;
   Australia's Trans and Sex/Gender Diverse First Peoples
SO VIOLENCE AND GENDER
LA English
DT Article
DE sistergirls; brotherboys; Indigenous; Aboriginal; Australia;
   transgender; sex; gender diverse
AB To date, little research has been conducted into the lives of trans Indigenous Australians, also known as sistergirls and brotherboys. The author recently completed a 3-year research project into the lives of trans people living in Australia's remotely located Northern Territory as well as sistergirls and brotherboys. This research is groundbreaking because it analyses, for the first time, the issues impacting these populations. This article draws out the most pressing difficulties sistergirls and brotherboys experience, that is, transphobia within traditional Aboriginal communities. It has become a push factor for many sistergirls and brotherboys to leave their communities, yet, migrating to large residential areas leads to further discrimination. There may be racism within predominantly white trans communities and difficulties with language because, for example, English, for many Indigenous Australians, is their third or fourth language. Furthermore, sistergirls and brotherboys may experience a loss of identity because community and country are essential aspects of Indigenous Australian's sense of self, well-being, and spirituality. Transphobia in traditional Aboriginal communities manifests in the so-called custom of payback, through which retribution for social transgressions is brought on community members. To illustrate this custom, this article focuses on Crystal, one of the author's interviewees. Crystal is a sistergirl from the remote Tiwi Islands on the north coast of Australia and, for decades, her family and community enacted payback because she is a sistergirl. This payback took the form of verbal harassment, physical assault, and rape not only against Crystal herself but also immediate members of her family, and, as a result, several committed suicide. She rejects the notion that payback should be a protected custom; rather she demands that it is her human rights and the human rights of all sistergirls and brotherboys that need protecting. Crystal refuses to be silenced and she advocates on behalf of sistergirls and brotherboys. In 2012, Crystal was elected to the local Tiwi Island council and, in doing so, became the first sistergirl and trans woman to be elected to an Australian government office. Crystal is known as Aunty because she helps the younger generation, but because she has won the respect of her community, she is now also known as Elder.

AB The MJA-Lancet Countdown on health and climate change was established in 2017 and produced its first Australian national assessment in 2018. It examined 41 indicators across five broad domains: climate change impacts, exposures and vulnerability; adaptation, planning and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement. It found that, overall, Australia is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change on health, and that policy inaction in this regard threatens Australian lives. In this report we present the 2019 update. We track progress on health and climate change in Australia across the same five broad domains and many of the same indicators as in 2018. A number of new indicators are introduced this year, including one focused on wildfire exposure, and another on engagement in health and climate change in the corporate sector. Several of the previously reported indicators are not included this year, either due to their discontinuation by the parent project, the Lancet Countdown, or because insufficient new data were available for us to meaningfully provide an update to the indicator. In a year marked by an Australian federal election in which climate change featured prominently, we find mixed progress on health and climate change in this country. There has been progress in renewable energy generation, including substantial employment increases in this sector. There has also been some progress at state and local government level. However, there continues to be no engagement on health and climate change in the Australian federal Parliament, and Australia performs poorly across many of the indicators in comparison to other developed countries; for example, it is one of the world's largest net exporters of coal and its electricity generation from low carbon sources is low. We also find significantly increasing exposure of Australians to heatwaves and, in most states and territories, continuing elevated suicide rates at higher temperatures. We conclude that Australia remains at significant risk of declines in health due to climate change, and that substantial and sustained national action is urgently required in order to prevent this.

TI Preparing non-government organization workers to conduct health checks
   for people with serious mental illness in regional Australia

LA English

DE health checks; physical comorbidity; serious mental illness
ID IMPROVEMENT PROFILE; PREVALENCE; SUICIDE; REMOTE; RISK
AB Accessible summary
   What is known on the subject?
   People diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder have a life expectancy 10-15years less than the general population. In rural and remote Australia, there is a shortage of health care professionals to provide physical health care for people living with a serious mental illness (SMI). A large proportion of the care for people living with a SMI is provided by non-government organizations (NGOs), often employing workers without formal qualifications. There has been minimal research regarding the experiences of NGO workers who have been trained to complete health checks to help people living with SMI to access primary care services.
   What this paper adds to existing knowledge?
   This is the first study to examine the experiences of preparing NGO workers to use the health improvement profile (HIP) to support the physical health of people with SMI. It builds on previous studies that examined the use of the HIP by trained/qualified staff.
   What are the implications for practice?
   This study highlights that NGO employees may have an important role in helping people with a SMI to address their physical health. Engaging lay workers to use the HIP increases their awareness of the importance of providing good physical health care for people with SMI. The use of a tool, such as the HIP, prepares NGO workers to support the physical health needs and enables them to describe meaningful improvements in the health of people with a SMI.
   Abstract Background The life expectancy of people living with a serious mental illness (SMI) is up to 10-15years less than the general population. They experience difficulties in accessing timely and appropriate physical health care. People with SMI living in regional Australia experience additional barriers to accessing services. This is in part due to the difficulties associated with recruiting and retaining health professionals in regional Australia.
   Aim To explore the regional non-government organization (NGO) workforce views of using a physical health care check list - the health improvement profile (HIP) - with people with a SMI.
   Gain insights into the workers' experiences of using the HIP. Understand which aspects of the HIP workers perceived as being most and least helpful. Learn how the HIP and the training program could be modified to better support its application in regional Australia.
   Method A focus group using a semi-structured interview was conducted with seven NGO employees who had been trained to use the HIP and subsequently used the HIP in their everyday work with patients. A mental health nurse (MHN) and a Psychology graduate working for the University of South Australia Department of Rural Health conducted the focus group.
   Results Using thematic analysis, the focus group discussion generated four main themes: taking control; accessing services; guiding my conversation; and working with others. The overall meta-theme was that lay workers can work effectively to address physical health problems in SMI patients.
   Conclusion Our observations highlight the important role lay workers in regional Australia have in helping people with SMI to address their physical health needs. They have an opportunity to extend their role in parts of the world where it is difficult to recruit MHNs.

AB Background: High prevalences of depression and suicidality have been found among gay men. This paper assesses the possible impact of Blues-out, a depression awareness campaign based on the European Alliance Against Depression targeting the gay/lesbian community in Geneva, Switzerland.
   Methods: In 2007 and 2011, pre- and post-intervention surveys were conducted among two distinct samples of gay men in Geneva, recruited by probability-based time-space sampling. Effect sizes and net percent changes are reported for mental health literacy and mental health outcomes in 2007 and 2011 as well as among men aware and unaware of Blues-out in 2011.
   Results: 43% of the respondents correctly recognized depression in 2011 with no change vis-a-vis 2007. Despite small effect sizes, significant net decreases (from -18% to -28%) were seen in lifetime suicide plans, 12-month suicidal ideation, lifetime depression, and 4-week psychological distress between 2007 and 2011. These decreases were not accompanied by changes in any of the numerous items on attitudes/knowledge, found only when comparing men aware and unaware of Blues-out in 2011. More men aware of Blues-out found specialists and psychological therapies helpful than their counterparts and correctly identified depression and gay men's greater risk for depression.
   Limitations: Community-level assessment with no control.
   Conclusions: Although improvement in depression recognition and decrease in suicide attempts could not be replicated unequivocally in this adapted intervention among gay men, there are indications that this evidence-based depression awareness campaign may have lessened suicidality and mental morbidity and improved mental health literacy and help-seeking.

AB Objective: To replicate a study, which found group therapy superior to routine care in preventing the recurrence of self-harming behavior in adolescents who had deliberately harmed themselves on at least two occasions. Method: Single blind study with parallel randomized groups undertaken in three sites in Australia. The primary outcome measure was repetition of self-harm, assessed on average after 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcome measures included suicidal ideation, psychiatric disorder, and service use. Results: Seventy-two adolescents aged 12 to 16 years (91% female subjects) were randomized to group therapy or routine care. Primary outcome data were available for 68 of the 72 randomized participants. More adolescents randomized to group therapy than those randomized to routine care had self-harmed by 6 months (30/34 versus 23/34, chi(2) = 4.19, p = .04), and there was a statistically nonsignificant trend for this pattern to be repeated in the interval of 6 to 12 months (30/34 versus 24/34, chi(2) = 3.24, p = .07). There were few differences between the treatment groups on secondary outcome measures, other than a trend for greater improvement over time on global symptom ratings among the experimental group compared with the control group. Conclusions: Our findings contradict those of the original study. Some differences in participant characteristics between the studies, along with less experience at the Australian sites in delivering the intervention, may have accounted for the different outcome. The benefit of group therapy for deliberate self-harm is unproven outside the environment in which it was originally developed. J. Am. Acad. Child Addlesc. Psychiatry, 2009;48(6):662-670.

AB Objective: Presentation to hospital after self-harm is an opportunity to treat underlying mental health problems. We aimed to describe the pattern of mental health contacts following hospital admission focusing on those with and without recent contact with community mental health services (connected and unconnected patients).
   Methods: We undertook a data linkage study of all individuals admitted as a general or psychiatric inpatient to hospital after self-harm in New South Wales, Australia, between 2005 and 2011. We identified the proportion of admissions where the patient received subsequent in-person community mental health care within 30days of discharge and the factors associated with receipt of that care.
   Results: A total of 42,353 individuals were admitted to hospital for self-harm. In 41% of admissions, the patient had contact with a community mental health service after discharge. Patients connected with community mental health services had 5.33 (95% confidence interval=[5.09, 5.59]) times higher odds of follow-up care than unconnected patients. Other factors, such as increasing age and treatment as a psychiatric inpatient, were associated with lower odds of follow-up community care.
   Conclusion: Our study suggests that full advantage is not being taken of the opportunity to provide comprehensive mental health care for people who self-harm once they have been discharged from the inpatient setting. This is particularly the case for those who have not previously received community mental health care. There appears to be scope for system-level improvement in the way in which those who are treated for self-harm are followed up in the community.

AB Objectives: Suicide among older adults is a major public health issue worldwide. Although studies have identified psychological, physical, and social contributors to suicidal thoughts in older adults, few have explored the specific interactions between these factors. This article used a novel statistical approach to explore predictors of suicidal ideation in a community-based sample of older adults. Design: Prospective cohort study. Participants and Setting: Participants aged 55-85 years were randomly selected from the Hunter Region, a large regional center in New South Wales, Australia. Measurements: Baseline psychological, physical, and social factors, including psychological distress, physical functioning, and social support, were used to predict suicidal ideation at the 5-year follow-up. Classification and regression tree modeling was used to determine specific risk profiles for participants depending on their individual well-being in each of these key areas. Results: Psychological distress was the strongest predictor, with 25% of people with high distress reporting suicidal ideation. Within high psychological distress, lower physical functioning significantly increased the likelihood of suicidal ideation, with high distress and low functioning being associated with ideation in 50% of cases. A substantial subgroup reported suicidal ideation in the absence of psychological distress; dissatisfaction with social support was the most important predictor among this group. The performance of the model was high (area under the curve: 0.81). Conclusions: Decision tree modeling enabled individualized "risk" profiles for suicidal ideation to be determined. Although psychological factors are important for predicting suicidal ideation, both physical and social factors significantly improved the predictive ability of the model. Assessing these factors may enhance identification of older people at risk of suicidal ideation.

AB Aim: To determine the rate of current major depressive disorder (MDD) among entrants to treatment for heroin dependence in three treatment modalities and a non-treatment comparison group; and to ascertain factors associated with depression. Design: Cross sectional structured interview. Setting: Sydney, Australia. Participants: 615 current heroin users: 201 entering methadone/buprenorphine maintenance (NIT), 201 entering detoxification (DTX), 133 entering drug free residential rehabilitation (RR) and 80 not in treatment (NT). Findings: Current major depressive episode was reported by 25%. The rates of major depressive disorder ranged from 26% in the treatment groups (23% NIT, 25% DTX, 31% RR) to 16% of those not in treatment. Females were more likely to have current major depressive episode (31% versus 21% OR 1.70, 95% Cl 1.16-2.48). Factors associated with depression in the treatment groups were post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attempted suicide in the last 12 months and severe physical disability. Among the non-treatment group those with depression were also more likely to have PTSD. Women entering treatment were three times more likely to meet criteria for current major depression than women not in treatment. Among men however, the rates were not significantly different. Conclusion: Depression is a significant concern among entrants to treatment for heroin dependence. An essential component of treatment should be a consideration of depression, with the provision of appropriate treatment were required. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction and Aims. To examine the overall mortality and causes of deaths of a large cohort of users of illicit drugs in Stockholm over 37 years. Design and Methods. People with substance abuse were identified through records collected by different institutions in Stockholm in 1967. Subjects were followed in registers recording mortality and cause of death and in-patient care stays until 2003. Results. More than half (n = 860) of the 1705 identified substance abusers died at an average age of 47 years, 25-30 years younger than the general population. The standardised rate ratio (SRR) for mortality was 3.3 among men and 3.5 among women. Incidence of mortality per 1000 person-years was also increased, but somewhat lower for women. The difference between these two measures is mainly explained by a lower mortality among women in general. In-patient care stays with both alcohol and drug-related diagnoses were associated with higher risk of dying among women than men: SRR = 14.5 and SRR = 4.0, respectively. Accidents and suicide were the most common cause of death among the youngest subjects (15-24 years) and cardiovascular diseases and tumours among the oldest (>= 55 years). Discussion and Conclusions. Accidents and suicide, especially at a young age, are two common causes of death that might be prevented by increased awareness in medical personnel, along with better treatment and supportive measures.

AB Background We have examined secular trends in age- and sex-specific prescribing of antidepressants to determine whether these mirror changes in other population measures of mental health.
   Method An analysis was carried out of age- and sex-specific rates of antidepressant prescribing by a representative sample or panel of UK general practitioners (GPs) in the period 1975-1998.
   Results The number of antidepressant prescriptions issued increased more than twofold in the period 1975-1998 and, in 1998, a total of 23.4 million antidepressant prescriptions were issued by GPs in the United Kingdom. Rates of antidepressant prescribing increased markedly in all age and sex groups with as much as a threefold increase in the older age groups. With the exception of 12-19-year-olds, these increases have been more marked in males, although absolute levels of prescribing are still at least two times higher in females.
   Conclusions Antidepressant prescribing has increased in all age and sex groups. This indicates either that there have been changes in the presentation, recognition and management of depression in general practice or that the prevalence of depression has increased, or a combination of these two phenomena. The higher prescribing rate in females is in keeping with evidence from psychiatric morbidity surveys suggesting that women experience higher levels of psychiatric morbidity than men. Decreases in the ratio of female to male prescribing, however, support other data indicating that, relative to females, the mental health of young males has declined in recent years. Changes in patterns of help seeking may also contribute to the observed trends.

AB Injuries are a public health problem affecting traveling populations such as tourists visiting National Parks. This study investigates the distribution of visitor fatalities in US National Park Service (NPS) units and identifies the predeath activities and contributing factors associated with them.
   A retrospective study was conducted of visitor fatalities from all NPS units during 2003 and 2004.
   There were 356 reported fatalities during 2003 and 2004. Fatalities were most common during the summer months and on weekends. Males accounted for 75% of the reported fatalities, and visitors aged 20 to 29 and 50 to 59 years accounted for 51% of all deaths. Only 99 of 388 (26%) NPS units reported at least 1 fatality, and only 10 units reported 10 or more fatalities. However, these 10 units were responsible for 36% of all fatalities. Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Blue Ridge Parkway, Grand Canyon National Park, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and Yosemite National Park reported the highest number of fatalities. Domestic visitors accounted for 73% of the fatalities, and European visitors accounted for 13%. Transportation and water-based activities recorded the highest number of fatalities. Motor vehicle crashes accounted for 20% of fatalities and was followed by suicide (17%), swimming (11%), hiking (10%), plane crashes (9%), climbing (6%), and boating (5%) incidents.
   Fatalities in NPS units are not widespread and are related to more common events such as motor vehicle crashes, suicide, swimming, and hiking rather than exotic causes such as bears or other wildlife. It is recommended that preventive techniques first be developed in the 10 NPS units responsible for 36% of the total NPS-wide fatalities.

AB Background: There has been a great deal of clinical concern regarding alprazolam abuse. This paper reported on alprazolam positive cases of sudden or unnatural deaths presenting to the New South Wales Department of Forensic Medicine (DOFM), 1/1/1997-31/12/2012.
   Methods: Case series.
   Results: 412 cases were identified. There was a large increase in the annual number of cases, from 3 in 1997 to 86 in 2012. By 2012, 4.5% of all DOFM case presentations involved alprazolam. The mean age was 41.3 years and 66.5% were male. Circumstances of death were: accidental drug toxicity (57.0%), deliberate drug toxicity (10.4%), suicide by means other than drug overdose (12.6%), disease (10.0%), accident (5.1%), homicide (2.4%). The major factor driving the increase in cases was accidental drug toxicity involving alprazolam, rising from 0 in 1997 to 58 in 2012. A history of drug/alcohol problems was noted in 80.4%, and 56.6% were injecting drug users. The median alprazolam concentration was 0.08 mg/L (range 0.005-2.10 mg/L), with 37.4% of cases having concentrations of >= 0.1 mg/L. In 94.9% of cases, drugs other than alprazolam and its metabolites were present, including all accidental overdoses. The most commonly detected drugs were opioids (64.6%), others were benzodiazepines (44.4%) and alcohol (34.5%). A third (31.8%) of cases were HCV positive.
   Conclusions: Cases involving alprazolam increased markedly, driven mostly by toxicity deaths amongst people with known drug and alcohol problems. Caution in prescribing alprazolam would appear appropriate, particularly to those with known drug dependence. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Aims To characterize sudden or unnatural deaths with very high-range blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) presenting to the Department of Forensic Medicine (DOFM) in Sydney between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2011.
   Design Case series.
   Setting Sydney, Australia.
   Cases A total of 263 cases of sudden or unnatural death with a BAC of 0.300g/100ml.
   Measurements Case characteristics, circumstances of death, quantitative toxicology, major autopsy findings and serology.
   Findings The mean age of decedents was 46.7years and 74.5% were male. Pre-existing alcohol problems were noted in 78.7%. Deaths were due to alcohol toxicity/chronic alcoholism (35.0%), combined alcohol/other drug toxicity (14.8%), accidents (18.6%), natural disease (13.3%), suicide (11.0%), homicide (6.8%) and one case was undetermined. Alcohol was a direct, or contributory, cause of death in 84.4% of cases. The overwhelming majority (81.4%) occurred in a home environment, and deaths did not vary by day or month. The mean BAC was 0.371g/100ml (range 0.300-0.820g/100ml), being highest in alcohol toxicity/chronic alcoholism cases (0.410g/100ml). The most frequently detected substances, other than alcohol, were benzodiazepines (31.9%) and opioids (12.9%). Alcohol-related disease was diagnosed in 62.9% of cases. Alcohol-related pathology was prevalent across all categories of death: severe steatosis (35.3%), cirrhosis (22.5%), chronic pancreatitis (15.3%), cardiomyopathy (9.4%) and cerebellar atrophy (9.0%).
   Conclusions Unnatural deaths with very high-range alcohol concentrations extend well beyond direct toxicity, and alcohol is causal in most cases. Those at greatest risk are middle-aged males, with long histories of alcohol problems.

AB Background. There is considerable debate regarding the clinical issues surrounding the wish to hasten death (WTHD) in the terminally ill. The clinical factors contributing to the WTHD need further investigation among the terminally ill in order to enhance understanding of the clinical assessment and treatment needs that underlie this problem. A more detailed understanding may assist with the development of appropriate therapeutic interventions.
   Method. A sample of terminally ill cancer patients (N=256) recruited from an in-patient hospice unit, home palliative care service and a general hospital palliative care consulting service from Brisbane Australia between 1998-2001 completed a questionnaire assessing psychological (depression and anxiety), social (family relationship, social support, level of burden on others) and the impact of physical symptoms. The association between these factors and the WTHD was investigated.
   Results. A high WTHD was reported by 14% of patients. A discriminant function analysis revealed that the following variables were associated with a high WTHD (P<0.001): higher levels of depressive symptoms, being admitted to an in-patient hospice setting, a greater perception of being a burden on others, lower family cohesion, lower levels of social support, higher levels of anxiety and greater impact of physical symptoms.
   Conclusions. Psychological and social factors are related to a WTHD among terminally ill cancer patients. Greater attention needs to be paid to the assessment of psychological and social issues in order to provide appropriate therapeutic interventions for terminally ill patients.

AB This article is a continuation of the series of scientific publications devoted to the study of the causes and risk factors of suicidal behavior among the indigenous peoples of Siberia - the Altaians, Buryats, Tuvinians, Yakuts, Evens, Evenks. The death rate from suicides among the indigenous peoples of Siberia is many times higher than the average for the Russian Federation (RF), which requires a careful analysis of this social phenomenon and an explanation of its causes. Aim of the study is to assess the standard of living of representatives of the indigenous populations of Siberia - Altaians, Buryats, Tuvinians, Yakuts, Evens, Evenks - according to the basic socio-economic indicators of the regions. To study the role of socio-economic factors in the formation of aggressive and autoaggressive behavior. Materials of the study. Statistical materials of the Federal State Statistics Service (FSSS), statistical data on the socio-economic situation of the subjects of the Russian Federation. Object and methods of research. Dynamic analysis of socio-economic indicators (unemployment rate, population with cash incomes below the subsistence level, average per capita incomes, consumer spending of the population) in four national regions of the Russian Federation - the Republic of Altai, the Republic of Tyva, the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) and the Trans-Baikal Territory - for the period from 2005 to 2016. Results. The standard of living of the population dwelling in the national subjects of the Russian Federation is much lower than the national average. The unemployment rate is 10.8-12.0% (for the Russian Federation - 5.5%); the share of the population with cash incomes below the subsistence level reaches 42.1% (in the Russian Federation it is 13.4%); per capita incomes of the population are more than twice as lower. Representatives of indigenous populations make up the poorest part of the population of national subjects: the unemployment rate among them reaches 36.6%, and the share of families living below the poverty line is 78.3%. According to the FSGS, in the national subjects of the Russian Federation, high mortality rates from unnatural causes are recorded, exceeding the all-Russian values by 2.5 times, and the level of suicide exceeds the Russian average by 2-2.5 times. The crime rate is high: the number of recorded crimes - robberies, thefts, murders, rapes - exceeds the all-Russian index from 3 to 9 times. The close correlation between low living standards and high mortality rates from homicides and suicides has been identified. The most informative indicator of aggressive and autoaggressive behavior is the average per capita income of the population, which inversely correlates with the death rate from murders (p<0.05) and suicides (p<0.05) both in national subjects and in the Russian Federation in general. Conclusions. A lot of social problems that are present among the populations of the indigenous peoples of Siberia - unemployment, poverty, social lack of demand, lack of further prospects - are a consequence of a violation of adaptation that covers the entire population. The clinical symptoms of population adaptation disorder are manifested by destructive tendencies both at the emotional level - in the form of social anger and behavior abnormalities - in various forms of aggressive and autoaggressive behavior.

AB AimMethodsSelf-harm and suicidal behaviour is most prevalent during adolescence, but little is known about the risk profile of adolescents admitted to hospital for suicidal behaviour. Young people who self-harm are at an increased risk of mortality compared to those who do not self-harm; adolescents admitted to hospital for suicidal behaviour are particularly at risk. The aim of this study was to generate a risk profile of adolescents admitted to hospital with suicidal behaviour.
   We conducted a 12-month retrospective audit of adolescent admissions to the mental health inpatient unit at a tertiary children's hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Routinely collected data were used to generate a risk profile.
   ResultsConclusionsWe found that 212 of 271 (78.2%) admissions were due to suicidal behaviour. Of these, 107 (51%) adolescents were diagnosed with one or more mental disorders at discharge, most commonly major depressive disorder. Beyond known distal determinants of health risk, the proximal risk profile of these adolescents included factors relating to gender, substance use, prior mental health diagnoses and prior admission to hospital. Poor sleep was also a risk factor, with 159 (75%) reporting a recent history of sleeping problems.
   The very high proportion of admissions to the mental health inpatient unit due to suicidal behaviour reinforces the importance of finding effective methods of identification of the risk processes underpinning suicidal behaviours to reduce the unnecessary waste of young lives by suicide.

AB It has been suggested that the weather may promote some types of death; this study sought to determine if types of death in the region around Adelaide, South Australia, occur in non-random clusters and in relationship to the weather. A Poisson model was used to determine if the occurrence of types of death were random. An exploratory analysis was performed for each death type to see if there was a relationship to weather variables using data supplied by the Bureau of Meteorology. Cases examined at Forensic Science South Australia from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2009 were reviewed. It was ascertained that cardiovascular deaths were distributed non-randomly; there was statistical evidence to suggest that deaths from ischemic heart disease, pulmonary embolus and drug toxicity had non-random occurrence. Maximum temperatures and increases in temperatures correlated with deaths from natural causes, cardiovascular disease, ischemic heart disease and pulmonary thromboembolus; lower hours of sunlight were statistically significant for deaths due to pulmonary thromboembolus. The distribution pattern of deaths resulting from motor vehicle collision did not fit the Poisson (random) model with variation through the week also being present. Non-random clusters of deaths do occur and weather events, such as increase in temperature, are associated with some types of death. However, analysis indicates that the weather is not responsible for all clustering. With regards to motor vehicle collision deaths temporal variation may be related to social factors, such as holiday periods. Further investigation may assist with health resource planning.

AB Introduction: Synthetic cannabinoids are an emerging clinical and public health concern. The current study aimed to determine: (1) The characteristics and circumstances of death of all recorded cases of synthetic cannabinoid-related sudden or unnatural death in Australia, (2) The toxicology of cases and (3) Their major organ pathology. Methods: Retrospective study of all cases in Australia in which synthetic cannabinoid use was a mechanism contributory to death (n = 55) retrieved from the National Coronial Information System (2000-2017). Information was collected on cause of death, demographics, drug use history, circumstances of death, toxicology and major organ pathology. Results: The mean age was 37.2 years and 91.1% were male. Causes of death comprised of accidental toxicity (38.2%), accidental toxicity/cardiovascular disease (9.1%), natural disease (20.0%), suicide (10.9%) and traumatic accident (10.9%). The most common clinical presentation proximal to death was sudden collapse (25.5%). Cardiovascular disease was prominent: severe atherosclerosis (20.0%), myocardial replacement fibrosis (18.0%), cardiomegaly (12.0%). The most frequent synthetic cannabinoids were the indazolecarboxemides (61.8%), most commonly AB-CHMINACA (38.2%). The most frequent other substances were alcohol (34.5%) and Delta(9)-THC (23.6%). Conclusions: AB-CHMINACA was the most commonly seen synthetic cannabinoid. There was a high representation of relatively older decedents and of older males in particular. While acute toxicity was the most common cause of death, cardiovascular disease was prominent.

AB AimsTo examine changes in causes of death in a cohort treated for opioid dependence, across time and age; quantify years of potential life lost (YPLL); and identify avoidable causes of death.
   DesignPeople in New South Wales (NSW) who registered for opioid substitution therapy (OST), 1985-2005, were linked to a register of all deaths in Australia.
   SettingNSW, Australia.
   MeasurementsCrude mortality rates (CMRs), age-sex-standardized mortality rates (ASSRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) across time, sex and age. Years of potential life lost (YPLL) were calculated with reference to Australian life tables and by calculating years lost before the age of 65 years.
   FindingsThere were 43789 people in the cohort, with 412216 person-years of follow-up. The proportion of the cohort aged 40+ years increased from 1% in 1985 to 39% in 2005. Accidental opioid overdoses, suicides, transport accidents and violent deaths declined with age; deaths from cardiovascular disease, liver disease and cancer increased. Among men, 89% of deaths were potentially avoidable; among women, 86% of deaths were avoidable. There were an estimated 160555 YPLL in the cohort, an average of 44 YPLL per decedent and an average of 29 YPLL before age 65 years.
   ConclusionsAmong a cohort of opioid-dependent people in New South Wales, 1985-2005, almost nine in 10 deaths in the cohort were avoidable. There is huge scope to improve mortality among opioid-dependent people.

TI Frequent callers to telephone helplines: new evidence and a new service
   model
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Telephone; Helpline; Crisis; Frequent callers
ID SUICIDE-PREVENTION-CENTER; CRISIS HOTLINE OUTCOMES; MENTAL-HEALTH;
   INTERVENTION; THERAPY; CENTERS
AB Background: This paper describes a program of work designed to inform a service model to address a challenge for telephone helplines, namely frequent callers.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review and four empirical studies that drew on different data sources-(a) routinely collected calls data from Lifeline, Australia's largest telephone helpline; (b) data from surveys/interviews with Lifeline frequent callers; (c) data from the Diagnosis, Management and Outcomes of Depression in Primary Care (diamond) study; and (d) data from Australia's National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing.
   Results: Frequent callers represent 3 % of callers but make 60 % of calls. They are isolated and have few social supports but are not "time wasters"; they have major mental and physical health problems and are often in crisis. They make use of other services for their mental health problems. The circumstances under which they use telephone helplines vary, but current service models reinforce their calling behaviour.
   Conclusions: The findings point to a service model that might better serve the needs of both frequent callers and other callers. The model involves offering frequent callers an integrated, tailored service in which they are allocated a dedicated and specially trained telephone crisis supporter (TCS), and given set calling times. It also involves promoting better linkages between telephone helplines and other services that provide mental health care, particularly general practitioners (GPs) and other primary care providers. The next step is to refine and test the model.

TI Maternal deaths in New South Wales, Australia: A data linkage project
SO AUSTRALIAN & NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNAECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE deaths; linkage; maternal; mortality; NSW; surveillance
ID PREGNANCY-RELATED MORTALITY; UNITED-STATES; FINLAND; WOMEN
AB Background: The magnitude of maternal mortality is underestimated as deaths occurring beyond the traditional 42-day time period after the pregnancy ending ('late death') have not been reported routinely in Australia.
   Aims: The aims of this study were to undertake a data linkage study to improve the ascertainment of maternal deaths and to determine the number of deaths occurring 43-365 days after the pregnancy ended ('late maternal death').
   Methods: Data from the New South Wales Midwives Data Collection were linked with the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare National Death Index. Australian identified pregnancy-related deaths were then coded as direct, indirect and incidental to the pregnancy.
   Results: During the period 1994-2001, 173 maternal deaths were identified. Of these, 97 were classified as occurring up to 42 days of the pregnancy ending, 15 (15.5%) of which were previously unknown to the maternal mortality committee. In addition, 76 deaths were classified as occurring between 43 and 365 days after the pregnancy ended. The majority (70 of 76) of these late deaths were only identified through the linkage study. Most (73 of 76) of these deaths were classified as indirect maternal deaths with the most common causes of deaths suicide (n = 23), cardiac disorders (n = 16) or accident/violence (n = 16).
   Conclusions: The ascertainment of maternal and late maternal mortality was enhanced through data linkage of birth and mortality data. Data linkage is a viable method for monitoring late maternal deaths.

TI Health status differentials across rural and remote Australia
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF RURAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE chronic disease; indigenous health; public health; rural health in
   general; trauma
AB This paper describes mortality and disease patterns across five broad remoteness categories of Australia, with reference to the context in which those outcomes develop and are treated.
   Health and its outcomes become worse as remoteness increases. Some of this phenomenon reflects proportionally greater numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in remote areas coupled with their poorer overall health outcomes; however, mortality for non-indigenous people is clearly higher outside compared with inside major cities. Migration of people seeking services likely reduces the size of interregional health disparity.
   Poorer health outcomes stem from worse risk factor profiles and average lower levels of income and of education, poorer physical and financial access to services, higher occupational and environmental risk, as well as factors unique to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. Little is known about the health benefits of living outside major cities.
   Diseases of the circulatory system and injuries account, respectively, for 40% and 18% of the excess mortality outside major cities.
   Death rates are declining over time in all (particularly remote) areas, but rates of death due to certain lung diseases in rural women are not, and rates of suicide have increased in remote areas.
   Ostensibly, prevalence of mental ill-health appears roughly similar in all remoteness areas. Dental health is poorer and disability is more prevalent outside major cities, as are a range of infectious diseases.
   Although pertinent, the effects on rural health of climate change and resource degradation generally have not been addressed in this paper.

TI Physicians' experiences with end-of-life decision-making: Survey in 6
   European countries and Australia
SO BMC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID INTENSIVE-CARE UNITS; EUTHANASIA; ATTITUDES; DEATH
AB Background: In this study we investigated (a) to what extent physicians have experience with performing a range of end-of-life decisions (ELDs), (b) if they have no experience with performing an ELD, would they be willing to do so under certain conditions and (c) which background characteristics are associated with having experience with/or being willing to make such ELDs.
   Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was sent to 16,486 physicians from specialities in which death is common: Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland.
   Results: The response rate differed between countries (39-68%). The experience of foregoing life-sustaining treatment ranged between 37% and 86%: intensifying the alleviation of pain or other symptoms while taking into account possible hastening of death between 57% and 95%, and experience with deep sedation until death between 12% and 46%. Receiving a request for hastening death differed between 34% and 71%, and intentionally hastening death on the explicit request of a patient between 1% and 56%.
   Conclusion: There are differences between countries in experiences with ELDs, in willingness to perform ELDs and in receiving requests for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. Foregoing treatment and intensifying alleviation of pain and symptoms are practiced and accepted by most physicians in all countries. Physicians with training in palliative care are more inclined to perform ELDs, as are those who attend to higher numbers of terminal patients. Thus, this seems not to be only a matter of opportunity, but also a matter of attitude.

AB Aim. People released from prison are at higher risk of mortality from potentially preventable causes than their peers in the general population. Because most studies of this phenomenon are reliant on registry data, there is little health and behavioural information available on those at risk, hampering the development of targeted, evidence-based preventive responses. Our aim was to identify modifiable risk and protective factors for external cause and cause-specific mortality after release from prison. Methods. We undertook a nested case-control study using data from a larger retrospective cohort study of mortality after release from prison in Queensland, Australia between 1994 and 2007. Cases were 286 individuals who had died from external causes (drug overdose, suicide, transport accidents, or violence) matched with 286 controls on sex, Indigenous status, and release date. We extracted data from detention, case-management, and prison medical records. Results. Factors associated with increased risk of external cause mortality included use of heroin and other opioids in the community [odds ratio (OR) = 2.20, 95% CI 1.41-3.43, p < 0.001], a prescription for antidepressants during the current prison sentence (OR = 1.94, 95% CI 1.02-3.67, p = 0.042), a history of problematic alcohol use in the community (OR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.05-2.26, p = 0.028), and having ever served two or more custodial sentences (OR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.01-2.25, p = 0.045). Being married (OR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.29-0.70, p < 0.001) was protective. Fewer predictors were associated with cause-specific mortality. Conclusions. We identified several behavioural, psychosocial, and clinical markers associated with mortality from preventable causes in people released from prison. Emerging evidence points to interventions that could be targeted at those at increased risk of external cause mortality. These include treatment and harm reduction programmes (for substance use), improving transitional support programmes and continuity of care (for mental health), diversion and drug reform (for repeat incarceration) and nurturing stable relationships during incarceration. The period of imprisonment and shortly after release provides a unique opportunity to improve the long-term health of ex-prisoners and overcome the disadvantage associated with imprisonment.

AB The controversial topic of voluntary assisted dying (VAD) is receiving significant attention at state government levels and in the community. Acknowledging potential legalisation of VAD, the Medical Oncology Group of Australia (MOGA) undertook a survey of members to inform the development of a position statement on the subject. All MOGA members were invited to complete an anonymous online survey. The survey comprised 12 closed-response categorical questions. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the survey data. Majority views expressed in the survey would form the basis of a MOGA position statement on VAD. A total of 362 members completed the questionnaire, representing 55% of the membership; 47% of respondents disagreed with VAD; 36% agreed with VAD and the remaining members (17%) were 'neutral'. A clear majority position was not established. Only 14% agreed that physicians involved in VAD should be required personally to administer the lethal medication; 94% supported conscientious objection of physicians to the VAD process; 95% agreed that a palliative care physician consultation should be required and 86% agreed with the need for the involvement of specialist psychiatry medical services before a patient can be deemed as suitable for VAD. The MOGA membership expressed a range of views on the topic of VAD. A clear majority-held view to support a MOGA position that either supports or opposes VAD was not established. The position statement that flows from the survey encourages informed debate on this topic and brings into focus important considerations.

AB Objective: This paper aims to explain the meaning and implications for practice of the High Court of Australia's finding in the negligence case, Hunter and New England Local Health District v McKenna [2014] HCA 44.
   Method: The facts of the case and the law of negligence are reviewed before reporting the Court's decision.
   Results: The High Court found that the obligation upon doctors to provide the least restrictive option for care that was imposed by the, then applicable, Mental Health Act 1990 (NSW) was inconsistent with an obligation that might otherwise be imposed by a common law duty to have regard to the interests of those with whom a psychiatric patient may come into contact if not detained.
   Conclusions: The Court's finding underlines the importance of clinicians documenting their clinical reasoning around why their negotiated management plan was the option least restrictive of the patient's freedom and most protective of his or her human rights.

AB Mental health social workers have a central role in providing support to people with mental health problems and in the use of coercion aimed at dealing with risk. Mental health services have traditionally focused on monitoring symptoms and ascertaining the risks people may present to themselves or others. This well-intentioned but negative focus on deficits has contributed to stigma, discrimination, and exclusion experienced by service users. Emerging understandings of risk also suggest that our inability to accurately predict the future makes risk a problematic foundation for compulsory intervention. Therefore it is argued that alternative approaches are needed to make issues of power and inequality transparent. This article focuses on two areas of practice: the use of recovery-based approaches, which promote supported decision-making and inclusion; and the assessment of a person's ability to make decisions, their mental capacity, as a less discriminatory gateway criterion than risk for compulsory intervention.

AB A qualitative study explored beliefs about active voluntary euthanasia (AVE) in a sample (N = 18) of medical practitioners and nurses from Australia, where AVE is not currently legal. Four behaviors relating to AVE emerged during the interviews: requesting euthanasia for oneself, legalizing AVE, administering AVE to patients if it were legalized, and discussing AVE with patients if they request it. Using thematic analysis, interviews were analyzed for beliefs related to advantages and disadvantages of performing these AVE behaviors. Medical practitioners and nurses identified a number of similar benefits for performing the AVE-related behaviors, both for themselves personally and as health professionals. Benefits also included a consideration of the positive impact for patients, their families, and the health care system. Disadvantages across behaviors focused on the potential conflict between those parties involved in the decision making process, as well as conflict between one's own personal and professional values.

SO INTERNATIONAL DIALOGUES ABOUT VISUAL CULTURE, EDUCATION AND ART
LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
DE Cultural brokerage; Community; Sustainability; Arts
AB Many rural and remote communities in Australia could be considered 'unsustainable' because of the loss of human, financial and consequent social capital and degradation of the natural resource base that provides both the setting for them and, in many cases, the economic foundation. The problems they face, such as lack of services, unemployment, maintaining professional workers in the region and youth suicide have been extensively explored, yet studies of the role of the arts and associated organizations as brokers of culture through pedagogical activities are few. This paper describes stage one of a project that proposes arts activities as a means of stimulating community development through the interface between cultural brokerage, cultural pedagogy and the sustainable outcomes that might emerge from their application in rural and remote areas of Queensland. The project is investigating ways in which performing and visual arts activities might contribute to sustainable communities. The interdisciplinary research approach was developed in a partnership between Flying Arts, The Queensland Murray Darling Committee and the University of Southern Queensland.

AB We examined the relationship between frequent use of telephone helplines and health service use over time in a cohort of 789 general practice attendees with depressive symptoms. Telephone helpline use (no use, non-frequent use, frequent use) was measured at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months and analysed using ordered logistic regression. Sixteen participants (2 %) reported frequent use of telephone helplines. Reporting frequent use was associated with visiting multiple general practitioners, using emergency services and visiting mental health specialists in the previous 3 months. Despite this pattern of service use, there was evidence that these services were not meeting the needs of frequent users of telephone helplines, as they were also more likely to report dissatisfaction with their access to health services compared to non-frequent and non-users of telephone helplines. Our findings suggest that a model of care which addresses the complex needs of frequent users of telephone helplines is needed.

AB Objective: Some groups of young people experience elevated rates of mental disorders and low rates of uptake of mental health services. Because an association between staff competence and uptake of services has been demonstrated a key objective or this paper is to identify relevant staff learning needs.
   Method: A learning needs analysis was undertaken of adolescent mental health workers employed in the health and education sectors in NSW, Australia, to explore their learning needs regarding Aboriginal, same-sex attracted and culturally and linguistically diverse young people.
   Results: Significant differences were found between learning needs in relation to location but no significant differences were found in relation to agency or experience. Participants ranked their learning needs as high and their knowledge and skills in working with depression and related disorders in these young people as low.
   Conclusion: This article highlights issues that may be of interest to clinicians and their managers regarding training, policy and service delivery.

AB Iron oxide-copper-gold mineralized breccia systems (e.g., Ernest Henry) have been studied in detail in the Cloncurry district, however, barren systems are more common but to date have lacked extensive research. This research has studied fluid inclusions in the barren Suicide Ridge breccia pipe in order to identify differences from mineralized systems. Two dominant types of fluid inclusions are observed: (1) pure CO(2)-rich primary to pseudosecondary fluid inclusions that occur exclusively in granite breccia clasts and (2) abundant secondary sodic-calcic brine inclusions that occur in all samples. The brine inclusions are paragenetically linked to albitic alteration and therefore represent the fluid that caused the albitization. These inclusions have lower homogenization temperatures (110 to 360 degrees C) and salinity (22 to 45 wt% NaCl-CaCl(2) equiv.) than the high temperature, ultrasaline multisolid fluid inclusions that are abundant in IOCG deposits. The absence of these fluids in the barren systems suggests they were a critical for the formation of IOCG deposits.

AB This study analyzes accidental fatalities caused by electricity-at work and during leisure time-to evaluate risk factors, the role of alcohol, and to identify possible preventive strategies. In Sweden, data on fatalities by electrocution from 1975 through 2000 were collected from the National Cause-of-Death Register. Additional cases were found in the archives of The Swedish National Electrical Safety Board. Suicides and deaths by lightning were excluded. Two hundred and eighty-five deaths were found, including occupational (n=132), leisure time (n=151), and unknown (n=2). Most deaths were caused by aerial power lines, and the most common place for an electrical injury was a railway area or residential property. Postmortem blood from 20% (n=47) of the tested cases was found positive for alcohol, and these persons were killed mainly during leisure time. During the study period, the overall incidence of electricity-related fatalities has decreased, in spite of increased use of electricity. This indicates that safety improvements have been successful.

AB Background
   The Australian Government's Fifth National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Plan recommends a stepped care model of mental healthcare that focuses on matching the intensity of care to the severity of illness. General practitioners (GPs) need to learn more about low-intensity online interventions to better meet the needs of patients of lower severity.
   Objective
   This article provides GPs with information about low-intensity, evidence-based online resources developed in Australia and available for integration into the care of patients with mild-to-moderate mental health conditions. This article has an emphasis on new developments since 2015.
   Discussion
   The internet provides an opportunity to deliver effective mental health treatment to people who would otherwise not seek, or be able to reach, skilled help for their mental health conditions. High-quality, evidence-based cognitive behavioural therapy treatment programs are available to all Australians, at no or low cost. These options can be integrated into a stepped care model of mental healthcare, and provide GPs with an opportunity to help patients access treatment that suits their needs.

   OUTCOMES; SUICIDE; IMPROVE; IMPACT; TIME
AB There is clear evidence that coordinated systems of medical and psychological care ("collaborative care") are superior to single-provider-based treatment regimens.
   Although other general practice-based mental health schemes promoted collaborative care, the new Medicare Benefits Schedule payments revert largely to individual-provider service systems and fee-for-service rebates. Such systems have previously resulted in high out-of-pocket. expenses, poor geographical and socioeconomic distribution of specialist services, and proliferation of individual-providerbased treatments rather than collaborative care.
   The new arrangements for broad access to psychological therapies should provide the financial basis for major structural reform. Unless this reform is closely monitored for equity of access, degree of out-of-pocket expenses, extent of development of evidence-based collaborative care structured, and impact on young people in the early phases of mental illness, we may waste this opportunity.
   The responsibility for achieving the best outcome does not lie only with governments. To date, the professions have not placed enough emphasis on systematically adopting evidence-based forms of collaborative care.

AB Phenomenological and cultural understandings of recovery from the perspective of individuals who engage in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) are rare. The primary study objective was to understand similarities across three samples in (a) how young people define recovery from NSSI and (b) what they consider helpful approaches taken by parents and professionals to assist their recovery. Using a cross-national sample of young people (n = 98) from Australia (n = 48), Belgium (n = 25) and the United States (n = 25), we assessed their perspectives on NSSI. Consistent across all samples, young people defined recovery as no longer having the urge to self-injure when distressed, often displayed ambivalence about recovery, and reported it was helpful when parents and professionals were calm and understanding. Acceptance of recovery as a process involving relapses may need to be emphasized in NSSI treatment, to ease the pressure young people often place on themselves to stop the behavior outright.

AB Background: In Australian end-of-life care, practicing euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide is illegal. Despite this, death hastening practices are common across medical settings. Practices can be clandestine or overt but in many instances physicians are forced to seek protection behind ambiguous medico-legal imperatives such as the Principle of Double Effect. Moreover, the way they conceptualise and experience such practices is inconsistent. To complement the available statistical data, the purpose of this study was to understand the reasoning behind how and why physicians in Australia will hasten death. Method: A qualitative investigation was focused on palliative and critical/acute settings. A thematic analysis was conducted on semi-structured in-depth interviews with 13 specialist physicians. Attention was given to eliciting meanings and experiences in Australian end-of-life care. Results: Highlighting the importance of a multidimensional approach, physicians negotiated multiple influences when death was regarded as hastened. The way they understood and experienced end-of-life care practices were affected by politico-religious and cultural influences, medico-legal imperatives, and personal values and beliefs. Interpersonal and intrapsychic aspects further emphasised the emotional and psychological investment physicians have with patients and others. In most cases death occurred as a result of treating suffering, and sometimes to fulfil the wishes of patients and others who requested death. Experience was especially subject to the efficacy with which physicians negotiated complex but context-specific situations, and was reflective of how they considered a good death. Although many were compelled to draw on the Principle of Double Effect, every physician reported its inadequacy as a medico-legal guideline. Conclusions: The Principle of Double Effect, as a simplistic and generalised guideline, was identified as a convenient mechanism to protect physicians who inadvertently or intentionally hastened death. But its narrow focus on the physician's intent illuminated how easily it may be manipulated, thus impairing transparency and a physician's capacity for honesty. It is suggested the concept of "force majeure" be examined for its applicability in Australian medical end-of-life law where, consistent with a multidimensional and complex world, a physician's motivations can also be understood in terms of the emotional and psychological pressures they face in situations that hasten death.

AB Virtual Reality (VR) techniques are increasingly being used for education about and in the treatment of certain types of mental illness. Research indicates that VR is delivering on its promised potential to provide enhanced training and treatment outcomes through incorporation of this high-end technology. Schizophrenia is a mental disorder affecting 1-2% of the population, and it is estimated 12-16% of hospital beds in Australia are occupied by patients with psychosis. Tragically, there is also an increased risk of suicide associated with this diagnosis. A,significant research project being undertaken across the University of Queensland faculties of Health Sciences and EPSA (Engineering, Physical Sciences and Architecture) has constructed a number of virtual environments that reproduce the phenomena experienced by patients who have psychosis. Symptoms of psychosis include delusions, hallucinations and thought disorder. The VR environment will allow behavioral, exposure therapies to be conducted with exactly controlled exposure stimuli and an expected reduction in risk of harm. This paper reports on the current work of the project, previous stages of software development and the final goal to introduce VR to medical consulting rooms.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to estimate the frequency and nature of self-reported and drug-related emergencies. Methods: 47 patients of a ward for opiate detoxification were interviewed about their experiences with drug-related emergencies. Typical categories had to be found like overdoses, seizures, accidents and suicide attempts respectively. Results: 68% had own experience with drug-related emergency. A majority suffered opiate overdose with different extensions as unconsciousness or breath-depression. Alcohol and polydrug use was associated with overdose. Drug-related accidents were only reported by men. Half the number of drug-related emergencies were treated in hospital. Most emergencies occurred alone either in a home environment or outside. Conclusion: Harm reduction interventions like observed user rooms should be established. Furthermore other strategies to reduce the number of emergencies as sharing naloxon or resuscitation programs in wards for detoxification could also be an effective method to prevent near fatal or fatal overdoses in dependent subjects.

AB Aims Hepatitis C (HCV) infection is highly prevalent among injection drug users (IDUs) and likely to cause significant mortality over time, but little research attention has focused upon the magnitude of this risk, particularly among ageing users. This study examined trends over time in mortality attributed to liver disease, and in particular contrasting this with other more commonly studied causes of death [acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), suicide and overdose] among an ageing cohort of heroin-dependent people in Australia. Design Data linkage study of methadone treatment entrants with the National Deaths Index. Setting A cohort entering methadone treatment for heroin dependence in New South Wales, Australia, 1980-85. Participants A total of 2489 people entering methadone treatment for heroin dependence and 54 847 person-years (PY) of follow-up. Measurements Linkage of data on all methadone entrants between 1980 and 1985 with data from the Australian National Deaths Index, linked using probabilistic record linkage software. Findings There were 8.2 deaths per 1000 PY [95% confidence interval (CI) 7.5-9.0], with standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) of 4.6 (95% CI 4.2-5.0). Almost one in five (17%) of deaths were from underlying liver-related causes, most commonly viral hepatitis. The overall mortality rate for any liver cause was 1.4 deaths per 1000 PY (95% CI 1.1-1.7), 17 times higher than to the general population (95% CI 13.4-21.3), with relative elevations more marked for females (SMR 27.9; 95% CI 17.7-41.9) than males (SMR 14.5; 95% CI 10.8-19.0). Liver mortality increased over time, becoming the most common cause of death by the end of follow-up. Conclusions Liver disease has become the most common cause of mortality among ageing opioid-dependent people in an ageing Australian cohort. There is an imperative to reduce the long-term risks of HCV and other risks to the liver, including alcohol consumption, which are typically not the major clinical focus for this group.

AB In Australia, the PANDAPerinatal Anxiety & Depression Australia National Helpline (the Helpline) offers support to callers impacted by emotional health challenges in the perinatal period. Callers receive counselling from professional staff and peer support from volunteers. An understanding of factors that contribute to callers' experiences of emotional distress, as well as potential barriers and facilitators to help-seeking, can be used to inform future service design and delivery. A caller intake form is completed by Helpline staff when an individual contacts the service for the first time, or re-engages after a period of non-contact. We analysed all intake forms of individuals calling about their own emotional wellbeing from the middle month of each season in 2014: January, April, July, and October. Content analysis was undertaken, focusing on caller profile, patterns of help-seeking, and reasons for caller engagement. Of the 365 calls, the majority were from women (n=358, 98%) who were pregnant (n=59, 16%) or had a child 12months of age (n=241, 75%). Many were seeking support regarding depression (n=186, 51%) or anxiety (n=162, 44%), with a number seeking help for both (n=71, 20%). Almost a third were identified as being at risk', including a number who were experiencing thoughts of suicide or self-harm. Complex interrelating factors contributed to callers' emotional distress, including: stressful life events; pregnancy, birthing and parenting experiences; social isolation; and histories of mental health difficulties. Significant numbers of parents experience emotional health challenges in the perinatal period, but many do not receive adequate treatment. Complex factors contribute to callers' distress, highlighting the need for health professionals to undertake thorough psychosocial assessments during the perinatal period so those that need additional support are identified, and appropriate care provided. Telephone Helplines like PANDAs assist overcoming barriers to care and provide specialised perinatal mental health support to families.

AB Objectives To assess the numbers of paracetamol overdose-related hospital admissions and deaths in Australia since 2007-08, and the overdose size of intentional paracetamol overdoses since 2004. Design, setting Retrospective analysis of data on paracetamol-related exposures, hospital admissions, and deaths from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD; 2007-08 to 2016-17), the New South Wales Poisons Information Centre (NSWPIC; 2004-2017), and the National Coronial Information System (NCIS; 2007-08 to 2016-17). Participants People who took overdoses of paracetamol in single ingredient preparations. Main outcome measures Annual numbers of reported paracetamol-related poisonings, hospital admissions, and deaths; number of tablets taken in overdoses. Results The NHMD included 95 668 admissions with paracetamol poisoning diagnoses (2007-08 to 2016-17); the annual number of cases increased by 44.3% during the study period (3.8% per year; 95% CI, 3.2-4.6%). Toxic liver disease was documented for 1816 of these patients; the annual number increased by 108% during the study period (7.7% per year; 95% CI, 6.0-9.5%). The NSWPIC database included 22 997 reports of intentional overdose with paracetamol (2004-2017); the annual number increased by 77.0% during the study period (3.3% per year; 95% CI, 2.5-4.2%). The median number of tablets taken increased from 15 (IQR, 10-24) in 2004 to 20 (IQR, 10-35) in 2017. Modified release paracetamol ingestion report numbers increased 38% between 2004 and 2017 (95% CI, 30-47%). 126 in-hospital deaths were recorded in the NHMD, and 205 deaths (in-hospital and out of hospital) in the NCIS, with no temporal trends. Conclusions The frequency of paracetamol overdose-related hospital admissions has increased in Australia since 2004, and the rise is associated with greater numbers of liver injury diagnoses. Overdose size and the proportion of overdoses involving modified release paracetamol have each also increased.

AB A recent rise in cannabis use in Indigenous communities in northern Australia may have compounded existing patterns of other substance use. This paper describes these patterns in Arnhem Land in the 'Top End' of the Northern Territory (NT). Economic impacts of the cannabis trade are also described. In a descriptive cross-sectional study, random samples included 336 people ( 169 males, 167 females) aged 13 - 36 years. Consensus classification of lifetime and current use of cannabis, alcohol, tobacco, kava, inhalants ( petrol) and other drugs was derived based on health workers' proxy assessments. A sample (n = 180, aged 13 - 36) was recruited opportunistically for interview. Lifetime cannabis users among those interviewed ( n = 131, 81 males, 50 females) described their current cannabis use, usual quantities purchased and consumed, frequency and duration of cannabis use and other substance use. In the random samples, 69% ( 63 - 75%) of males and 26% ( 20 - 31%) of females were lifetime cannabis users ( OR = 7.4, 4.5 - 12.1, p<0.001). The proportion of males currently using cannabis was 67% ( 60 - 73%) while the proportion of females currently using cannabis was 22% ( 16 - 27%) ( OR = 7.9, 4.8 - 13.1, p<0.001). Current cannabis users were more likely than non-users to be also using alcohol ( OR = 10.4, 4.7 - 23.3, p<0.001), tobacco ( OR = 19.0, 7.9 - 45.8, p<0.001) and to have sniffed petrol ( OR = 9.1, 4.6 - 18.0, p<0.001) but were less likely to be using kava ( OR = 0.4, 0.2 - 0.9, p<0.001). Among those interviewed, higher tobacco consumption in current users and greater alcohol use in lifetime users was associated with increased cannabis use. Action is required to reduce cannabis use, especially in combination with other substances.

AB Purpose The aim of this study was to determine whether people who have been hospitalised as the result of non-fatal self-harm form meaningful groups based on mechanism of injury, and demographic and mental health-related factors. Methods A retrospective analysis of 18,103 hospital admissions for self-harm in Victoria, Australia over the 3-year period 2014/2015-2016/2017 recorded on the Victorian Admitted Episodes Dataset (VAED). The VAED records all hospital admissions in public and private hospitals in Victoria. The primary analysis used a two-step method of cluster analysis. Initial analysis determined two distinct groups, one composed of individuals who had a recorded mental illness diagnosis and one composed of individuals with no recorded mental illness diagnosis. Subsequent cluster analysis identified four subgroups within each of the initial two groups. Results Within the diagnosed mental illness subgroups, each subgroup was characterised by a particular mental disorder or a combination of disorders. Within the no diagnosis of mental illness groups, the youngest group was also the most homogenous (all females who self-poisoned), the oldest group had a high proportion of rural/regional residents, the group with the highest proportion of males also had the highest proportion of people who used cutting as the method of self-harm, and the group with the highest proportion of metropolitan residents also had the highest proportion of people who were married. Conclusions Preventative interventions need to take into account that those who are admitted to hospital for self-harm are a heterogeneous group.

TI Treatment-seeking differences for mental health problems in male- and

   WORK; AUSTRALIA; COUNTRIES
AB Background. There is a well-established gender divide among people who do and do not seek professional help from mental health professionals. Females are typically more likely to report, and seek help for, mental health problems. The current paper sought to examine the role of employment context on help-seeking for mental health issues. We hypothesised that men and women in male-dominated occupations would be less likely to seek help than those in non-male-dominated occupations.
   Methods. Data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey were used. Help-seeking, measured in 2013, was defined as whether a person reported attending a mental health professional in the 12 months prior to the survey. The exposure, male- and non-male-dominated occupations (measured in 2012), was defined using census data based on self-reported occupation. Analyses were stratified by gender and controlled for relevant confounders (measured in 2012), including mental health and prior help-seeking. We conducted multivariate logistic and propensity score analyses to improve exchangeability of those exposed and unexposed.
   Results. For males, being in a male-dominated occupation was independently associated with reduced likelihood of help-seeking (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.46-0.95) in the adjusted model, although this result fell just out of significance in the propensity score analysis. There was no independent effect of being in a male-/non-male-dominated occupation for help-seeking among women.
   Conclusions. Results suggest that male-dominated occupations may negatively influence help-seeking among males. There is a need for more research to understand this relationship and for workplace-based prevention initiatives.

AB Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and other same-sex attracted young people have been shown to be at a higher risk of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, suicidality, and substance abuse, compared to their heterosexual peers. Homophobic prejudice and stigma are often thought to underlie these disparities. In this study, the relationship between such experiences of social derogation and mental health and substance use in same-sex attracted young people was examined using Meyer's minority stress theory. An online survey recruited 254 young women and 318 young men who identified as same-sex attracted, were aged 18-25 years, and lived in Sydney, Australia. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that internalized homophobia, perceived stigma, and experienced homophobic physical abuse were associated with higher levels of psychological distress and self-reported suicidal thoughts in the previous month. Furthermore, perceived stigma and homophobic physical abuse were associated with reporting a lifetime suicide attempt. The association between minority stress and substance use was inconsistent. While, as expected, higher levels of perceived stigma were associated with club drug dependence, there was an inverse association between internalized homophobia and club drug use, and between perceived stigma and hazardous alcohol use. The findings of this study provide support for the minority stress theory proposition that chronic social stress due to sexual orientation is associated with poorer mental health. The high rates of mental health and substance use problems in the current study suggest that same-sex attracted young people should continue to be a priority population for mental health and substance use intervention and prevention.

AB In the 1990s, the police service in Victoria, Australia, faced a crisis of community confidence due to a spate of civilian deaths from police shootings. In that decade, twice as many civilians died at the hands of the police in Victoria than in every other Australian state combined. Most of those killed were mentally ill and affected by drugs and alcohol, and were rarely a serious threat except to themselves. The problem was also almost entirely an urban phenomenon. Shootings in rural communities, where mentally ill people were more likely to be personally known to local police, were (and remain) almost unknown. The large number of fatalities was recognised as a serious threat to public confidence, and Victoria Police introduced a ground-breaking training programme, Operation Beacon. Operating procedures and weapons training were fundamentally changed, to focus on de-escalation of conflict and avoiding or minimising police use of force. In the short term, Operation Beacon was successful. Shooting incidents were dramatically reduced. However, during the first decade of the new century, the number of civilians being killed again increased. This article examines Operation Beacon, both as a successful model for reducing civilian deaths at the hand of police and as a cautionary tale for police reform. We argue that the lessons of Operation Beacon have been gradually forgotten and that old habits and attitudes resurfaced. Fatal shootings of mentally ill civilians can be prevented, but if success is to be other than temporary, the Beacon philosophy must be continually reemphasised by police management.

AB Objectives: Compulsory community treatment has been shown to reduce preventable deaths from physical disorders these causes being up to 10 times more common than suicide in psychiatric patients. We investigated whether this was mediated by better access to specialized medical procedures.
   Method: All patients on compulsory community treatment for over 11 years were compared with matched control subjects using linked administrative health data from Western Australia (state population of about 2.24 million). Outcomes were access to revascularization and other specialized procedures at 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow-up. Logistic regression was used to adjust for demographics, prior health service use, diagnosis, and length of psychiatric history.
   Results: There were 2757 patients and 2687 control subjects (total n = 5444). Sixty-five per cent were males (n = 3522), and the average age was 36 years (SD 13.2). Most had schizophrenia or other noneffective psychoses (74%), followed by affective disorders (26%). At 2-year follow-up, 2% (n = 53) of patients and 2.6% (n = 69) of control subjects had undergone a specialized intervention. Compulsory community treatment did not result in greater access to specialized procedures at all 3 time points even after adjusting for potential confounders.
   Conclusions: Greater access to specialized procedures does not explain the reduced mortality from preventable physical illness that had been reported in patients on community treatment orders. There must be other explanations for this finding, such as mental health staff facilitating access to chronic disease management in primary care. This warrants further research.

AB The individual and contextual factors influencing current mental health and well-being within rural communities are poorly understood.
   A stratified random sample of adults was drawn from non-metropolitan regions of NSW, Australia. One-quarter (27.7%) of the 2,639 respondents were from remote/very remote regions. An aggregate measure of current well-being was derived from levels of distress and related impairment (Kessler-10 LM), self-reported overall physical and mental health, functioning, satisfaction with relationships, and satisfaction with life. Multivariate methods investigated the contributions to current well-being of demographic/dispositional factors, recent events and social support, individual exposure to rural adversity, and district/neighbourhood level characteristics.
   Respondents from very remote regions tended to be younger and have lower education. Univariate associations were detected between well being and exposure to rural adversity (greater drought-related worry, lower perceived service and support availability, greater number of years living in the current district). Multivariate analysis (n = 2,462) accounted for 41% of the variance in well-being scores. The major contributing variables were dispositional factors (trait neuroticism, marital status), recent adverse events and indices of social support. However, no additional effects were detected for district-level variables (drought severity, regional socioeconomic categorisation, population change). Similar associations were detected using the K-10 alone as the outcome measure.
   The chief determinants of current well being were those reflecting individual level attributes and perceptions, rather than district-level rural characteristics. This has implications for strategies to promote well being within rural communities through enhancing community connectedness and combating social isolation in the face of major adversities such as drought.

AB ObjectivesStudies conducted among older people have shown that frailty is a common condition associated with an array of adverse outcomes. The aims of this study were to identify the prevalence and associations of frailty in older people residing in several aged care facilities located in Queensland, Australia.MethodsThe database used for this study was drawn from the Aged Care Funding Instrument (ACFI) database of an Australian aged care provider, and contained data from ten aged care facilities in Queensland, Australia. A modification of an eFI originally developed by Clegg and colleagues and based on Rockwood's Frailty Index (FI) of cumulative deficits was used to identify frailty.ResultsIn total, 592 participants aged 75 years and over were included in the study (66.6% female). Median (IQR) age was 88.0 (9.0) years. Frailty prevalence among the sample was 43.6%, with 46.3% pre-frail and 10.1% not frail. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis incorporating three different models, frailty was significantly associated with three ACFI domains (Nutrition, Depression and Complex Health Care), along with facility size, consistently across two models. In the third model, frailty was also significantly associated with arthritis, diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis and vision problems, along with male gender.ConclusionThere is a need to develop frailty identification and management programs as part of standard care pathways for older adults residing in aged care facilities. Aged care facilities should consider regular frailty screening in residential aged care residents, along with interventions addressing specific issues such as dysphagia and depression.

AB Research on the relationship between humans and animals has identified some links between companion animals and physiological, psychological, and social benefits for the human. Adopting Robert Weiss's (1974) Theory of Social Provisions as a framework, this qualitative study explores the role of the human-animal relationship amongst 30 people living with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in Australia. Despite the transition of HIV from a terminal to chronic condition in many developed nations, there can still be personal and social challenges accompanying an HIV-diagnosis. Thematic analysis of the 30 interviews identified themes of Attachment, Opportunity for Nurturance, Reassurance of Worth, Reliable Alliance, Obtaining of Guidance/Emotional Support, and Social Integration. Extracts coded to these themes indicated that many participants believed their companion animal motivated them to remain socially and physically active; provided an outlet for love and attachment; remained non-judgmental irrespective of the human's physical or social status; and was capable of providing both day-to-day comfort through their reliable presence, and episode-specific supportive responses during periods of heightened stress. It was proposed that for people living with a chronic and/or stigmatized condition like HIV, these aspects of the human-animal relationship may play an important part in their overall wellbeing. In conclusion, this study contributes to a greater understanding of the lived experience of HIV and provides a conceptually sound mechanism for validating the love and support that some HIV-positive people perceive in their relationship with a companion animal. This knowledge draws attention to the need to normalize, validate, and support the human-animal relationship throughout the animal's life, and death.

AB Background: New psychoactive stimulants and hallucinogens comprise a range of "designer drugs" that have risen to prominence in the 21' century. The study aimed to: 1. Determine the characteristics, and circumstances of death, of all recorded cases of new psychoactive stimulant and hallucinogen-related death in Australia; 2. Determine the toxicology of such deaths; and 3. Determine the major organ pathology of cases.
   Methods: All cases in which new psychoactive stimulants were a mechanism contributory to death were retrieved from the National Coronial Information System (2000-2017). Information was collected on cause of death, demographics, drug use history, circumstances of death, toxicology and major organ pathology.
   Results: 82 cases were identified. The mean age was 30.7yrs and 86.6% were male. Circumstances of death were: accidental drug toxicity (59.8%), traumatic accident (15.9%), suicide (12.2%) and natural disease (2.4%). The most common clinical presentation observed proximal to death was delirium (26.8%). Delirium was mostly frequently observed after phenethylamine consumption (72.2%). The most common cardiovascular diagnosis at autopsy was replacement fibrosis, indicative of previous ischemia (10.5%). New psychoactive stimulants and hallucinogens detected in toxicology were: cathinones (75.7%), phenethylamines (22.0%) and piperazines (6.1%). Other substances were present in 83.5% of cases, most commonly established controlled psychostimulants (58.2%).
   Conclusions: Acute toxicity was the most common cause of death, but more than a third of deaths were due to trauma. Cathinones were the most commonly detected of the new psychoactive stimulants and hallucinogens. Delirium was the most frequently reported clinical sign proximal to death and was strongly associated with the phenethylamines.

ID MURRAY-DARLING BASIN; MENTAL-HEALTH; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FARMERS; DROUGHT;
   SUICIDE; STRESS; IMPACT
AB Water institutional and property right reform in the food bowl of Australia, the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), has generated both benefits and costs for irrigators. Water allocation uncertainty along with the increased risk of recurring drought has been gradually placed back on irrigators to manage, and in the last decade there has been considerable reallocation of water from consumptive to environmental use in the MDB, which has caused much angst within rural communities. In the face of such change this study provides, for the first time, a large-scale profile (n = 1000) of irrigators' mental health in the MDB. Our point estimates suggest some irrigation industries in 2015-16 recorded some of the highest levels of psychological distress nationally; higher than dryland farmers or the Australian population. Financial difficulties were most associated with this distress, but it was intertwined and underpinned by the ongoing threat of water scarcity, which irrigators often incorrectly associate with the implementation of the Basin Plan. Psychological distress varied by industry and location: horticulturists reported the highest levels of distress, followed by broadacre, dairy and livestock. Future national water policy must consider the real impacts of water recovery, and recognize that so-called 'socially neutral' water recovery policies can actually cause significant community harm where they hamper farm exit and adaptation to a hotter future. We recommend that future water policy must focus on i) encouraging fanner adaptation (hence supporting water entitlement buy-back and eliminating on-farm irrigation infrastructure subsidies); and ii) removing farm exit barriers.

AB Background: The frequencies with which physicians make different medical end-of-life decisions (ELDs) may differ between countries, but comparison between countries has been difficult owing to the use of dissimilar research methods.
   Methods: A written questionnaire was sent to a random sample of physicians from 9 specialties in 6 European countries and Australia to investigate possible differences in the frequencies of physicians' willingness to perform ELDs and to identify predicting factors. Response rates ranged from 39% to 68% (N= 10 139). Using hypothetical cases, physicians were asked whether they would ( probably) make each of 4 ELDs.
   Results: In all the countries, 75% to 99% of physicians would withhold chemotherapy or intensify symptom treatment at the request of a patient with terminal cancer. In most cases, more than half of all physicians would also be willing to deeply sedate such a patient until death. However, there was generally less willingness to administer drugs with the explicit intention of hastening death at the request of the patient. The most important predictor of ELDs was a request from a patient with decisional capacity (odds ratio, 2.1-140.0). Shorter patient life expectancy and uncontrollable pain were weaker predictors but were more stable across countries and across the various ELDs (odds ratios, 1.1-2.4 and 0.9-2.4, respectively).
   Conclusion: Cultural and legal factors seem to influence the frequencies of different ELDs and the strength of their determinants across countries, but they do not change the essence of decision making.

AB While research indicates that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adolescents may be at increased risk of some sexually transmitted infections, there is limited information about factors that may place these young people at more risk of adverse sexual health than their non-Indigenous counterparts. Current research has tended to focus on surveillance-type data, but there is an increasing need to understand social determinants of sexual health risk. This systematic review assessed the evidence of social determinants impacting on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adolescents' sexual health in Australia. Published, English-language literature was searched across key databases from 2003 to 2015. Fourteen studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. Findings suggest that social determinants such as access to healthcare, poverty, substance use, educational disadvantage, sociocultural context, gender inequalities, status and identity, and social disadvantage impacted on Indigenous adolescents' sexual behaviours and sexual health risk. Evidence from the literature included in the review suggests that peer education may be an acceptable and appropriate approach for addressing such issues. There remains a need for programmes and services to be community-developed and community-led, thus ensuring cultural appropriateness and relevance. However, there is also a significant need for such programmes to be effectively and rigorously evaluated with data that goes beyond surveillance, and seeks to unpack how sexual norms are experienced by Indigenous adolescents, particularly outside of remote Australia - and how these experiences act as either risk or protective factors to good sexual health and positive social and emotional well-being.

ID CAUSE-SPECIFIC MORTALITY; HEALTH OUTCOMES; RECORD LINKAGE; OFFENDERS;
   COHORT
AB Background: In the community, all-cause mortality rates among those younger than 25 years are considerably lower than those of older adults and are largely attributable to risk-taking behaviours. However, given the unique health profiles of prisoners, this pattern may not be replicated among those leaving prison. We compared rates and patterns of mortality among young and older ex-prisoners in Queensland, Australia. Methods: We linked the identities of 42,015 persons (n=14,920 aged <25 years) released from adult prisons in Queensland, Australia with the Australian National Death Index. Observations were censored at death or 365 days from release. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to explore associations between mortality and demographic and criminographic characteristics. We used indirect standardisation to compare rates of all-cause mortality for both age groups with those for the general population. We calculated proportion of deaths across specific causes for each age group and relative risks for each cause for young versus older ex-prisoners. Results: Being young was protective against death from all causes (AHR=0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.8); however, the elevation in risk of all-cause death relative to the general population was greater for those aged less than 25 years (SMR=6.5, 95% CI 5.3-8.1) than for older ex-prisoners (SMR=4.0, 95% CI 3.5-4.5). Almost all deaths in young ex-prisoners and the majority of those in older ex-prisoners were caused by injury or poisoning. Conclusions: Young people are at markedly increased risk of death after release from prison and the majority of deaths are preventable.

AB Objective: Despite growing awareness of adverse mental health consequences, the scarce existing evidence on the link of disaster exposure and suicidality has remained inconclusive, and the differential suicidality risk associated with distinct levels of natural and man-made disaster exposure is unknown. We therefore investigated the lifetime prevalence and risk of suicidal behavior associated with natural and man-made disaster exposure in Australia. Method: We utilized data from a nationally representative mental health survey (n=8,841). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses examined the lifetime risk of suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts associated with varied types and levels of disaster exposure. We focused explicitly on natural and man-made disasters while controlling for other types of trauma exposure, including established risk factors for suicidality. Results: Multivariate analyses indicated that those exposed to multiple natural (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.04, 4.71], p<.05) or man-made disasters (AOR 3.4, 95% CI = [1.20, 9.58] p<.05) were at significantly greater risk of making suicide attempts, whereas single natural or man-made disaster exposure was not associated with an increased risk of suicidal behavior. Conclusions: Our study findings establish the differential suicidality risk associated with natural and man-made disaster exposure in Australia and highlight the critical role of repeat disaster exposure across distinct disaster types. Suicidal behavior may warrant increasing attention in psychosocial recovery schemes, particularly in the context of disaster-prone areas and for population groups at elevated risk of repeat disaster exposure.

   PHYSICIANS; HEALTH; SUICIDE
AB Background: Medicine and particularly palliative care are considered to be stressful professions, with risks of psychological morbidity and burnout. There is little published work quantitatively documenting their prevalence among medical practitioners practising in palliative care.
   Methods: Three questionnaires, including the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the Maslach Burnout Inventory, were sent to palliative care practitioners in Western Australia.
   Results: Forty-one of 43 (95%) practitioners completed the questionnaires. The mean score on the GHQ-12 was 1.9 (range 0-8), with 11 (27%) scoring 4 or more. On the Maslach Burnout Inventory, mean scores on the emotional exhaustion (EE, mean 17.5, range 1-47) and depersonalization subscales (DP, 4.5, 0-24) fell within the low range, with scores for personal accomplishment (39, 32-46) falling within the average range. Ten respondents (24%) scored high on either the EE subscale or the DP subscale, meeting criteria for burnout. GHQ-12 scores were associated with hours of work per week in palliative care (P = 0.004). The EE (P = 0.024) and DP (P = 0.006) components of burnout were associated with years of work in palliative care. Specialist practitioners were more likely to score in the high category for GHQ-12 (odds ratio = 4.8, P = 0.036) and EE (odds ratio = 8.33, P = 0.031). GHQ (P = 0.038) and DP (P = 0.006) scores were higher in those working in tertiary institutions, with tertiary practitioners more likely to be in the high EE category (odds ratio = 7.5, P = 0.034).
   Conclusion: Levels of psychiatric morbidity and burnout in palliative medicine are not higher than in other specialties.

AB Cyberbullying: a worldwide trend of misusing technology to harass others.
   Technology has led to a new form of bullying in the 21(st) century called cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is using the Internet or a cell phone to harass a victim with pictures and text. There have been reports in the media of youth being harassed by e-mail, postings on websites, instant messages, and mobile text messages worldwide.
   This paper summarizes findings about the prevalence and effects of cyberbullying from studies conducted in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Results of the studies were compared to media reports of cyberbullying and traditional bullying research. Strategies to stop and prevent cyberbullying were discussed.
   The percentage of respondents experiencing incidents of cyberbullying in the studies ranged from 10% to 42%. The mobile phone was the predominant method of cyberbullying in Australia and the United Kingdom, whereas the Internet was the favoured method in the United States and Canada.
   Some victims of cyberbullying have been driven to suicide while others remain unaffected by it. The most common feelings of victims were anger, sadness, frustration, and fear. Independent studies in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada documented that parents and children do not discuss cyberbullying.
   It is recommended that schools establish and post acceptable use policies for the Internet. Parents need to be educated about cyberbullying so that they can impose consequences if their child is harassing another child. Real time computerized reporting systems such Text Someone can be used to augment reporting of incidents. Showing students how mobile phone calls and e-mail messages can be traced may deter cyberbullying.

TI Pregabalin misuse-related ambulance attendances in Victoria, 2012-2017:
   characteristics of patients and attendances
SO MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
LA English
DT Article
ID GABAPENTIN; ABUSE; OVERDOSE; DATABASE; PAIN
AB Objective: To compare changes in pregabalin prescribing and misuse-related ambulance attendances; to characterise the patients attended by paramedics for pregabalin misuse-related harms; to assess the association of pregabalin misuse with use of other sedatives and with suicidal ideation and self-harm; to compare the characteristics of pregabalin misuse-related harms in people who misuse pregabalin according to whether or not they also used other sedatives.
   Design, setting, participants: Retrospective analysis of data on ambulance attendances in Victoria, January 2012 - December 2017, for which pregabalin misuse-related harms were a contributing factor.
   Main outcome measures: Rates of pregabalin misuse-related ambulance attendances, pregabalin prescription rates (each 6-monthly); patient characteristics, including age, sex, history of drug misuse or psychiatric problems, concurrent use of other sedatives, and current suicidal ideation and self-harm.
   Results: There were 1201 pregabalin misuse-related attendances during the study period; the rate increased from 0.28 cases per 100 000 population in the first half of 2012 to 3.32 cases per 100 000 in the second half of 2017. The attendance rate was strongly correlated with prescription rates in Australia (r = 0.90; P = 0.001). 593 attendances (49%) were for people with a history that may have contraindicated prescribing pregabalin. Pregabalin was frequently misused with other sedatives (812 attendances, 68%), particularly benzodiazepines (440, 37%); 472 attendances (39%) were associated with suicide attempts. People who misused pregabalin with other sedatives more frequently presented with moderate to severe impairments of consciousness, but the frequency of suicide attempts was similar whether other sedatives were concurrently used or not.
   Conclusions: Rates of pregabalin misuse-related ambulance attendances in Victoria have increased markedly over the past 6 years. Caution is required when prescribing pregabalin for people taking other sedatives. Limiting the dispensing of this drug may reduce the risks associated with its misuse.

TI Coronial autopsy in a rural setting
SO JOURNAL OF FORENSIC AND LEGAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Coronial autopsy; Rural Australia
AB Objectives: To determine the precise nature of the non-homicide coronial autopsy.
   Design and setting: Retrospective analysis of coronial autopsies between 2005 and 2011 in a rural setting on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales.
   Results: A total of 1446 autopsies were performed during the 7 year study period. There were 1428 (98.75%) coronial and 18 (1.25%) hospital autopsies. Death in the coronial cases was attributed to natural causes in 829 (58%) of the cases, accidental causes in 321 (22.5%) of the cases, suicide in 244 (17%) of the cases and no apparent cause (indeterminate) in 34 (2.5%) of the cases. Acute myocardial ischaemia constituted 66.7% of the natural causes. Road traffic and other motorised vehicle-related accidents were responsible for 60.7% of deaths in the accidental group. The 2 main types of death in the suicide group were hanging (36.5%) and drug overdose (31.5%). In 34 deaths, the cause remained unclear, however, because of lack of suspicious circumstances and negative histology and toxicology, they were presumed to be due to natural causes.
   Conclusions: The hospital autopsy has almost completely disappeared. On the other hand, coronial autopsies are on the rise. General Practitioners appear reluctant to issue death certificates in certain situations where there are no suspicious circumstances and the Coroners feel obliged to ask for autopsies. Currently, there is a severe shortage of pathologist and the additional coronial works adds to the burden on those pathologists who engage in such work. The coronial system needs to think about the role of the autopsy in these circumstances. Furthermore, additional resources from the various stakeholders are required for the increasing educational role of the coronial autopsy in undergraduate and postgraduate teaching.

AB Objectives Patients with advanced disease sometimes express a wish to hasten death (WTHD). In 2012, we published a systematic review and meta-ethnography of qualitative studies examining the experience and meaning of this phenomenon. Since then, new studies eligible for inclusion have been reported, including in Europe, a region not previously featured, and specifically in countries with different legal frameworks for euthanasia and assisted suicide. The aim of the present study was to update our previous review by including new research and to conduct a new analysis of available data on this topic.
   Setting Eligible studies originated from Australia, Canada, China, Germany, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Thailand and USA.
   Participants Studies of patients with life-threatening conditions that had expressed the WTHD.
   Design The search strategy combined subject terms with free-text searching of PubMed MEDLINE, Web of Science, CINAHL and PsycInfo. The qualitative synthesis followed the methodology described by Noblit and Hare, using the 'adding to and revising the original' model for updating a meta-ethnography, proposed by France et al. Quality assessment was done using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist.
   Results 14 studies involving 255 participants with life-threatening illnesses were identified. Five themes emerged from the analysis: suffering (overarching theme), reasons for and meanings and functions of the WTHD and the experience of a timeline towards dying and death. In the context of advanced disease, the WTHD emerges as a reaction to physical, psychological, social and existential suffering, all of which impacts on the patient's sense of self, of dignity and meaning in life.
   Conclusions The WTHD can hold different meanings for each individual-serving functions other than to communicate a genuine wish to die. Understanding the reasons for, and meanings and functions of, the WTHD is crucial for drawing up and implementing care plans to meet the needs of individual patients.

AB BackgroundHospital-treated deliberate self-harm (DSH) is common, costly and has high repetition rates. Since brief contact interventions (BCIs) may reduce the risk of DSH repetition, we aim to evaluate whether a SMS (Short Message Service) text message Intervention plus Treatment As Usual (TAU) compared to TAU alone will reduce hospital DSH re-presentation rates in Western Sydney public hospitals in Australia.Methods/designOur study is a 24-month randomized controlled trial (RCT). Adult patients who present with DSH to hospital emergency, psychiatric, and mental health triage and assessment departments will be randomly assigned to an Intervention condition plus TAU receiving nine SMS text messages at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12-months post-discharge. Each message will contain telephone numbers for two mental health crises support tele-services. Primary outcomes will be the difference in the number of DSH re-presentations, and the time to first re-presentation, within 12-months of discharge.DiscussionThis study protocol describes the design and implementation of an RCT using SMS text messages, which aim to reduce hospital re-presentation rates for DSH. Positive study findings would support the translation of an SMS-aftercare protocol into mental health services at minimal expense.Trial registration and ethics approvalThis trial has been registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (Trial registration: ACTRN12617000607370. Registered 28 April 2017) and has been approved by two Local Health Districts (LHDs). Western Sydney LHD Human Research Ethics Committee approved the study for Westmead Hospital and Blacktown Hospital (Protocol: HREC/16/WMEAD/336). Nepean Blue Mountains LHD Research Governance Office approved the study for Nepean Hospital (SSA/16/Nepean/170).

TI Training general practitioners to recognise and respond to psychological
   distress and suicidal ideation in young people
SO MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
LA English
DT Article
ID PRIMARY-CARE; DEPRESSION; HOPELESSNESS; PREVENTION; ANXIETY
AB Objective: To determine the effectiveness of a training program for general practitioners in recognising and responding to psychological distress and suicidal ideation in young people.
   Design and setting: The study, conducted in general practice surgeries in Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia in 1996 and 1997, used a pre-/post-test design to audit consecutive young patients presenting in the six weeks before and the six weeks after the GPs' participation in the training program.
   Participants: Consisted of 23 GPs who attended a youth suicide prevention workshop and 423 patients aged 15-24 years who presented to the GPs' surgeries (203 pre-workshop and 220 post-workshop).
   Intervention: GPs attended a one-day training workshop designed to enhance their ability to recognise, assess and manage young patients at risk of suicide.
   Main outcome measures: Scores on three patient self-report inventories (General Health Questionnaire-12 [GHQ-12], Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale [CES-D] and Depressive Symptom Inventory - Suicidality Subscale [DSI-SSI]); a BP-completed form for each patient summarising presenting complaint(s), psychological assessment and proposed management plan.
   Results: After training, GPs demonstrated increased recognition rates of psychologically distressed patients scoring above the cut-offs of the GHQ-12 (48% increase; odds ratio [OR], 1.748; 95% Cl, 0.904-03.381) and CES-D (39.5% increase; OR, 2.067; 95% Cl, 1.031-4.143); enquiry about suicidal ideation increased by 32.5% (OR, 1.483; 95% Cl, 0.929-2.366); and identification of suicidal patients (determined by DSI-SS score) Increased by 130% (OR, 3.949; 95% Cl, 1.577-9.888). Training did not lead to any significant change in GPs' patient management strategies.
   Conclusions: A one-day training course can significantly enhance GP detection rates of psychological distress and suicidal ideation in young patients, but higher recognition rates do not necessarily lead to changes in patient management.

AB The issue of whether it is right to be concerned about the accuracy with which mass media report social scientific research is explored through a detailed case study of media reporting of two surveys of UK doctors' end-of-life decision-making. Data include press releases, emails and field notes taken during periods of media interest supplemented by a collection of print and broadcast media reports. The case study contributes to existing knowledge about the ways in which mass media establish, exaggerate and otherwise distort the meaning of statistical findings. journalists ignored findings that did not fit into existing media interest in the 'assisted dying' story and were subject to pressure from interest groups concerned to promote their own interpretations and viewpoints. Rogue statistics mutated as they were set loose from their original research report context and were 'laundered' as they passed from one media report to another. Yet media accounts of the research, fuelling an already heated public debate about ethical issues in end-of-life care, arguably acted as a conduit for introducing new considerations into this debate, such as the role played by sedation at the end of life, the extent to which euthanasia is practiced outside the law, and the extent of medical opposition to the legalisation of assisted dying. The expectation that accuracy and comprehensiveness should be the sole criteria for judging journalists' reports is, finally, considered to be unrealistic and it is argued that social scientists need to understand and adapted to the conditions under which mass media reporting operates if they are to succeed in introducing the findings of social research into public debates.

AB Objectives To describe deaths in prison among opioid-dependent people, and examine associations between receipt of opioid substitution therapy (OST) and risk of death in prison.
   Design Retrospective cohort study.
   Setting Adult prisons in New South Wales (NSW), Australia.
   Participants 16715 opioid-dependent people who were received to prison between 2000 and 2012.
   Interventions Opioid substitution therapy.
   Primary outcome measures Natural and unnatural (suicide, drug-induced, violent and other injury) deaths in prison.
   Results Cohort members were in prison for 30998 person-years (PY), during which time there were 51 deaths. The all-cause crude mortality rate (CMR) in prison was 1.6/1000 PY (95% CI 1.2 to 2.2/1000 PY), and the unnatural death CMR was 1.1/1000 PY (95% CI 0.8 to 1.6/1000 PY). Compared to time out of OST, the hazard of all-cause death was 74% lower while in OST (adjusted HR (AHR): 0.26; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.50), and the hazard of unnatural death was 87% lower while in OST (AHR: 0.13; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.35). The all-cause and unnatural death CMRs during the first 4weeks of incarceration were 6.6/1000 PY (95% CI 3.8 to 10.6/1000 PY) and 5.5/1000 PY (95% CI 2.9 to 9.4/1000 PY), respectively. Compared to periods not in OST, the hazard of all-cause death during the first 4weeks of incarceration was 94% lower while in OST (AHR: 0.06; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.48), and the hazard of unnatural death was 93% lower while in OST (AHR: 0.07; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.53).
   Conclusions Mortality of opioid-dependent prisoners was significantly lower while in receipt of OST.

AB Objective: Epidemiological evidence suggests that work stress is associated with suicidal ideation (SI). However, only few studies in this area have drawn on well-established theoretical work stress models (i.e., the job-demand-control [JDC] model, the effort-reward-imbalance [ERI] model, and the model of organizational injustice [OM. Utilization of such models allows though for theory-based assessments and workplace interventions. Since evidence on those models' relationship with suicide-related outcomes is currently inconclusive (with regard to JDC), markedly sparse (OJ) or lacking (ERI), we aimed to provide additional or initial evidence.
   Methods: We drew on original data from six cross-sectional studies, which were conducted in four countries (i.e., South Korea, China, Australia, and Germany). Work stress was measured by established questionnaires and was categorized into tertiles. In each study, SI was assessed by either one or two items taken from validated scales. Associations of work stress with SI were estimated for each study and were pooled across studies using multivariate random-effects logistic modeling.
   Results: In the pooled analyses (n = 12,422) all three work stress models were significantly associated with SI with odds ratios fluctuating around 2. For instance, the pooled odds ratios for highest versus lowest work stress exposure in terms of job strain, OJ, and ERI equalled 1.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.52, 2.41), 1.98 (95% CI = 1.48, 2.65), and 2.77 (95% CI = 1.57, 4.88), respectively. Patterns of associations were largely consistent across the individual studies.
   Conclusion: Our study provides robust evidence of a positive association between work stress and SI. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB There is evidence to suggest that both psychological characteristics and stressful life events are contributory factors in deliberate self-harm among young people. These links, and the possibility of a dose-response relationship between self-harm and both psychological health and life events, were investigated in the context of a seven-country school-based study. Over 30,000, mainly 15 and 16 year olds, completed anonymous questionnaires at secondary schools in Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway and Australia. Pupils were asked to report on thoughts and episodes of self-harm, complete scales on depression and anxiety symptoms, impulsivity and self-esteem and indicate stressful events in their lives. Level and frequency of self-harm was judged according to whether they had thought about harming themselves or reported single or multiple self-harm episodes. Multinomial logistic regression assessed the extent to which psychological characteristics and stressful life events distinguished between adolescents with different self-harm histories. Increased severity of self-harm history was associated with greater depression, anxiety and impulsivity and lower self-esteem and an increased prevalence of all ten life event categories. Female gender, higher impulsivity and experiencing the suicide or self-harm of others, physical or sexual abuse and worries about sexual orientation independently differentiated single-episode self-harmers from adolescents with self-harm thoughts only. Female gender, higher depression, lower self-esteem, experiencing the suicide or self-harm of others, and trouble with the police independently distinguished multiple- from single-episode self-harmers. The findings reinforce the importance of psychological characteristics and stressful life events in adolescent self-harm but nonetheless suggest that some factors are more likely than others to be implicated.

AB Background: Social and emotional well-being is an important component of overall health. In the Indigenous Australian context, risk indicators of poor social and emotional well-being include social determinants such as poor education, employment, income and housing as well as substance use, racial discrimination and cultural knowledge. This study sought to investigate associations between oral health-related factors and social and emotional well-being in a birth cohort of young Aboriginal adults residing in the northern region of Australia's Northern Territory.
   Methods: Data were collected on five validated domains of social and emotional well-being: anxiety, resilience, depression, suicide and overall mental health. Independent variables included socio-demographics, dental health behaviour, dental disease experience, oral health-related quality of life, substance use, racial discrimination and cultural knowledge.
   Results: After adjusting for other covariates, poor oral health-related items were associated with each of the social and emotional well-being domains. Specifically, anxiety was associated with being female, having one or more decayed teeth and racial discrimination. Resilience was associated with being male, having a job, owning a toothbrush, having one or more filled teeth and knowing a lot about Indigenous culture; while being female, having experienced dental pain in the past year, use of alcohol, use of marijuana and racial discrimination were associated with depression. Suicide was associated with being female, having experience of untreated dental decay and racial discrimination; while being female, having experience of dental disease in one or more teeth, being dissatisfied about dental appearance and racial discrimination were associated with poor mental health.
   Conclusion: The results suggest there may be value in including oral health-related initiatives when exploring the role of physical conditions on Indigenous social and emotional well-being.

AB Aims To determine the effects of borderline personality disorder (BPD) on 12-month treatment retention and outcomes for the treatment of heroin dependence.
   Design Longitudinal cohort study.
   Setting Sydney, Australia.
   Participants A cohort of 495 heroin users enrolled in the Australian Treatment Outcome Study.
   Findings Criteria for BPD were met by 45% of the cohort. At baseline there were no differences in heroin use, but the BPD group had higher levels of polydrug use, crime, needle risk-taking, more injection-related health problems, higher levels of overdose, poorer psychological health and more extensive suicide histories. At 12 months there was no group difference in the cumulative number of treatment days received, but the BPD group had enrolled in more different treatment episodes. Within both groups reductions had occurred in drug use and drug-related problems, with no differences in heroin use, polydrug use or global physical health at 12 months. After taking into account the effects of treatment on outcome, however, BPD was associated independently with a higher level of needle sharing [odds ratio (OR) 3.21], more injection-related health problems (OR 1.90), a higher likelihood of heroin overdose (OR 1.92), poorer global psychological health (OR 2.43), higher levels of current major depression (OR 3.19) and a higher likelihood of attempted suicide (OR 3.89). While BPD participants showed similar reductions in heroin and other drug use to other patients at 12 months, they continued to exhibit higher levels of risk and harm across a range of outcomes.
   Conclusions Screening would appear to be warranted to identify a group who may overtly respond to treatment in terms of drug use per se, but remain at substantially greater risk.

AB OBJECTIVES: To determine whether childhood physical and sexual abuse are associated with poor mental and physical health outcomes in older age.
   DESIGN: Cross-sectional, postal questionnaire survey.
   SETTING: Medical clinics of 383 general practitioners (GPs) in Australia.
   PARTICIPANTS: More than 21,000 older adults (aged >= 60) currently under the care of GPs participating in the Depression and Early Prevention of Suicide in General Practice (DEPS-GP) Study. Participants were divided into two groups according to whether they acknowledged experiencing childhood physical or sexual abuse.
   MEASUREMENTS: Main outcome measures targeted participants' current physical health (Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short Form Survey, Version 2 and Common Medical Morbidities Inventory) and mental health (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale).
   RESULTS: One thousand four hundred fifty-eight (6.7%) and 1,429 participants (6.5%) reported childhood physical and sexual abuse, respectively. Multivariate models of the associations with childhood abuse indicated that participants who had experienced either childhood sexual or physical abuse had a greater risk of poor physical (odds ratio (OR)=1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.21-1.50) and mental (OR=1.89, 95% CI=1.63-2.19) health, after adjustments. Older adults who reported both childhood sexual and physical abuse also had a higher risk of poor physical (OR=1.60, 95% CI=1.33-1.92) and mental (OR=2.40, 95% CI=1.97-2.94) health.
   CONCLUSION: The effects of childhood abuse appear to last a lifetime. Further research is required to improve understanding of the pathways that lead to such deleterious outcomes and ways to minimize its late-life effects.

AB Background
   Bipolar disorder has been associated with cognitive decline, but confirmatory evidence from a community-derived sample of older people is lacking.
   Aims
   To investigate the 13-year risk of dementia and death in older adults with bipolar disorder.
   Method
   Cohort study of 37 768 men aged 65-85 years. Dementia (primary) and death (secondary), as recorded by electronic record linkage, were the outcomes of interest.
   Results
   Bipolar disorder was associated with increased adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of dementia (HR=2.30, 95% CI 1.80-2.94). The risk of dementia was greatest among those with <5 years of history of bipolar disorder or who had had illness onset after 70 Steers of age. Bipolar disorder was also associated with increased mortality (HR=1.51, 95% CI 1.28-1.77). Competing risk regression showed that bipolar disorder was associated with increased hazard of death by suicide, accidents, pneumonia or influenza, and diseases of the liver and digestive system.
   Conclusions
   Bipolar disorder in later life is associated with increased risk of dementia and premature death.

DE virtual reality; schizophrenia; hallucination; exposure therapy
ID THERAPY
AB Schizophrenia is a mental disorder affecting 1-2% of the population and it is estimated 12-16% of hospital beds in Australia are occupied by patients with psychosis. The suicide rate for patients with this diagnosis is higher than that of the general population. Any technique which enhances training and treatment of this disorder will have a significant societal and economic impact. A significant research project using Virtual Reality (VR), in which both visual and auditory hallucinations are simulated, is currently being undertaken at the University of Queensland. The virtual environments created by the new software are expected to enhance the experiential learning outcomes of medical students by enabling them to experience the inner world of a patient with psychosis. In addition the Virtual Environment has the potential to provide a technologically advanced therapeutic setting where behavioral, exposure therapies can be conducted with exactly controlled exposure stimuli with an expected reduction in risk of harm. This paper reports on the current work of the project, previous stages of software development and future educational and clinical applications of the Virtual Environments. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Investigating death: the emotional and cultural challenges for police
SO POLICING & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE emotion; culture; death; coroner
AB The over-representation of vulnerable populations within the criminal justice system, and the role of police in perpetuating this, has long been a topic of discussion in criminology. What is less discussed is the way in which non-criminal investigations by police, in areas like a death investigation, may similarly disadvantage and discriminate against vulnerable populations. In Australia, as elsewhere, it is police who are responsible for investigating both suspicious and violent deaths like homicide as well as non-suspicious, violent deaths like accidents and suicides. Police are also the agents tasked with investigating deaths, which are neither violent nor suspicious but occur outside hospitals and other care facilities. This paper, part of a larger funded Australian research project focusing on the ways in which cultural and religious differences are dealt with during the death investigation process, reports on how police describe - or are described by others - during their role in a non-suspicious death investigation, and the challenges that such investigations raise for police and policing. The employment of police liaison officers is discussed as one response to the difficulty of policing cultural and religious difference with variable results.

AB Interventions that promote mental health at community and country levels complement early intervention and treatment in clinical care. Once mental health is seen as a legitimate part of public health, or health promotion, the public health approach becomes a useful framework to develop partnerships and interventions. VicHealth is an independent statutory authority, funded by the state government of Victoria, Australia to work in health promotion. It has begun a long-term investment in mental health promotion. The framework for action begins with gathering local evidence about mental health and its modifiable determinants such as connection to community, school, work and home, the environments in these places, and forms of discrimination and violence. Evidence is also gathered about the prevalence of mental disorders, risk behaviours, suicide, and the relationships to key socio-economic variables and economic participation. Key informants from several health and non health sectors assist in deciding the determinants on which to focus. Strategies that support each other and emphasise inter-sectoral partnerships can then be developed, including legislative reform, project development, community and organisational capacity building, communications, and research and evaluation. This work has recently been extended to a Pacific nation through invited consultation with the World Health Organization.

AB The mental health of gay and bisexual men in mixed-orientation marriages is poorly understood. In this article, the authors explore the development of anxiety and depression among gay and bisexual men in heterosexual marriages. Sixteen men, living in the Australian states of New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, and Tasmania were interviewed throughout 2016 and 2017. An analysis of interviews identified four main themes, namely, compulsory heterosexuality, existential distress, compartmentalization, and integration and resolution. Participants reported experiencing anxiety and depression, which were exacerbated by the stigmatization of same-sex attraction and by an overwhelming distress from feelings of shame and guilt regarding their marital infidelity. Findings indicate that gay and bisexual men in mixed-orientation marriages develop anxiety and depression in response to the exigencies of compulsory heterosexuality and the compartmentalizing of same-sex attraction and identity during heterosexual marriage. Coming-out as same-sex attracted resolved men's distress by facilitating an integrative self-structure.

TI A comparison of barriers to accessing services for mental and physical

AB Introduction: The prevalence of chronic disease, mortality and suicide rates is higher in rural Australia than in urban centres. Understanding rural Australians' barriers to accessing health services requires urgent attention. The purpose of this study was to compare barriers to help-seeking for physical and mental health issues among rural South Australian adults.
   Methods: A total of 409 people from three rural and remote regions in South Australia completed a computer-assisted telephone interview. They were presented a physical or mental health scenario and rated the extent to which barriers would prevent them from seeking help for that condition. Responses ranged from 1 (strongly disagree') to 5 (strongly agree') and were averaged to form domain scores (higher scores representing stronger barriers to seeking support), in addition to being examined at the item level.
   Results: Men reported higher barriers for the mental compared with physical health scenario across four domains ('need for control and self-reliance', 'minimising the problem, resignation and normalisation', 'privacy' and 'emotional control'). Women reported higher barriers for the mental compared to physical health scenario in two domains (need for control and self-reliance' and 'privacy). Both men and women endorsed many items in the mental health context (eg 'I don't like feeling controlled by other people', 'I wouldn't want to overreact to a problem that wasn't serious', 'Problems like this are part of life; they're just something you have to deal with', 'I'd prefer just to put up with it rather than dwell on my problems', 'Privacy is important to me, and I don't want other people to know about my problems' and 'I don't like to get emotional about things') but in the physical health context, barriers were endorsed only by men (eg 'I wouldn't want to overreact to a problem that wasn't serious','I'd prefer just to put up with it rather than dwell on my problems', 'Problems like this are part of life; they're just something you have to deal with', 'I like to make my own decisions and not be too influenced by others').
   Conclusions: Both rural men and rural women report more barriers to help seeking for mental health issues than physical health issues across a range of domains. There is a need to educate the current and future rural health and mental health workforce about these barriers and to encourage them to test evidence-based strategies to address them, in particular to facilitate more widespread mental health help-seeking in rural Australia.

AB Absconding is a significant problem with potential for harm to patients or the general public. The consequences of absconding include physical harm, prolonged treatment time, and substantial economic costs. The aim of this systematic literature review is to synthesize quality literature about absconding from psychiatric facilities, identify gaps in knowledge, and make recommendations for practice. An electronic search yielded 39 journal articles that met the review criteria. Findings demonstrate that a single definition of absconding remains elusive, making the prevalence of absconding difficult to establish. Absconding events are multifactorial, with environmental, psychosocial, and organic aspects. Negative consequences exist including violence, aggression, and self-neglect and harm to self and others. Papers are clustered around the following themes: harm and risk, absconder profiles, absconding rates, and perceptions of nurses and patients. Nursing interventions designed to decrease absconding have been implemented with success, but only in a few studies and in Australia, none have been reported in the literature to date. Further research is required to identify appropriate nursing-based interventions that may prove useful in reducing the risk of absconding.

AB The field of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is dominated by research conducted with Caucasian-majority samples in Western countries such as United States, Canada, Australia and European countries. This article critically reviewed the empirical research on NSSI in non-Western countries and among ethnic/racial minority individuals who live in the West to give voice to and understand the patterns of NSSI among individuals who do not fall within the dominant Caucasian majority. The study found both similarities and differences between Western and non-Western data in terms of characteristics and functions of NSSI. Differences in gender patterns in regards to prevalence of NSSI and methods used as well as presence of a more relational functionality of NSSI rather than emotion regulation functionality were two points of divergence in the findings of these studies. In addition, the findings seem to indicate that the role of ethnicity/race is mediated by important factors such as socioeconomic status (SES) and gender. Existing gaps in the literature and suggestions for further research are discussed.

AB This study compared the experience of gambling related harms between gamblers and spouses, whilst taking into account gender and problem gambling severity. Participants (N = 5036, 2603 females) from Australia and New Zealand completed a retrospective survey that probed the prevalence of specific harms from gambling within six harm domains (financial, work/study, health, emotional/psychological, relationship, and social deviance). Overall there was a similar count of total harms reported across all domains experienced by spouses (vs gamblers), however the types and patterns of harms reported were markedly different. Spouses reported the highest number of harms within the emotional/psychological and relationship domains, whereas gamblers experienced a higher number of harms in all other domains. Spouses were five to six times more likely to report increased conflict in their relationship due to gambling, greater relationship tension, and ending a relationship. In comparison, gamblers reported more severe health-related harms, such as suicide attempts and increased alcohol consumption. The findings highlight the unique ways in which gamblers and their spouses each respond to the presence of gambling problems.

AB This international comparative study addresses differences between adolescents who engage in deliberate self-harm (DSH) and who receive help following the DSH episode versus those who do not. A standardised self-report questionnaire was completed by Pupils aged 14-17 in Australia, Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, The Netherlands, and Norway (n=30532). An act of DSH in the year prior to the study was reported by 1660 participants. Nearly half (48.4%) had not received any help following DSH, 32.8% had received help from their social network only and 18.8% from health services. Except for Hungary, cross-national comparisons revealed remarkably similar findings. Adolescents who had been in contact with health services following DSH reported more often a wish to die, lethal methods, alcohol/drug problems and DSH in the family compared to those who had not. However, those who received no help or help from their social network only were also heavily burdened. (C) 2008 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

AB The cross-sectional study was administrated between April and September 2006. Participants are doctors, nurses, and midwives. Between these dates we met only 750 health staff (doctor, nurse, and midwife). Six hundred thirty-two of them responded to our questionnaire, 122 of them were in Manisa city, and 5 10 of them in Erciyes. We sought to identify variables that contribute to euthanasia attitude, including demographics, in order to demonstrate Turkish doctors', nurses', and midwives' attitudes toward euthanasia and to compare their attitudes in this regard. The data was collected by a two-part questionnaire. The first part included questions about the health personnel; the second part comprised the euthanasia (Medical Staff's Attitude toward Euthanasia) scale. The scale was developed by the researcher to measure the attitude of healthy staff euthanasia. The SPSS was used to analyze the data. Student t-test, ANOVA, Mann Whitney U, and Kruskal Wallis were used to evaluate the data. The p value 0.05 (95% confidence interval) was accepted as significant. In our study, professional groups are compared with all the factors but there is a significant difference only between social cost and professional groups.

AB Objective: This study determined whether self-reported Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), identified in a community sample and occurring up to 60 years previously, is associated with current psychiatric symptoms, suicidality, and psychologic well-being.
   Study Design and Setting: Three age cohorts (20-24, 40-44, 60-64) were randomly sampled from the cities of Canberra and Queanbeyan, Australia, yielding a total of 7,485 participants. The samples were administered scales measuring anxiety, depression, suicidality, positive and negative affect, personality traits, and physical health status.
   Results: Of the total sample, 5.7% reported history of TBI involving loss of consciousness for at least 15 min, occurring an average of 22 years previously. History of TBI was associated with increased symptoms of depression, anxiety, negative affect, and suicidal ideation.
   Conclusion: History of TBI is a risk factor for psychiatric morbidity. The effect is greatest in young adults, and occurs up to several decades subsequent to the occurrence of TBI. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID REFLEXIVITY
AB Purpose - This paper aims to demonstrate advantages of using the photo elicitation technique from sociology, ethnography and visual anthropology to management history through reference to a study of job loss within the State Electricity Commission of Victoria in the Latrobe Valley, Australia, as it was undergoing transition and privatization in the early 1990s.
   Design/methodology/approach - This is a methodology paper exploring photo elicitation and the theoretical perspectives of life course and identity work when applied in management history.
   Findings - The use of photo elicitation encouraged interview participants to share their perspectives about the common experience of job loss in an Australian regional area which gave rise to some common themes about occupational identity and the challenges of being unemployed.
   Social implications - After job loss, some common experiences have been found, namely, depression; drug and alcohol addiction; domestic violence and family break down; and even suicide.
   Originality/value - Use of photo elicitation provided the methodology and framework to undertake original research in management history in an Australian region still experiencing denidustrialization of brown coal mining and power generation.

ID EDUCATION; LANGUAGES; PEDAGOGY
AB Racial trauma describes the emotional trauma and associated psychiatric reactions, such as distress and compromised well-being, which arise from perceived incidences of racism. It is an emerging psychological paradigm that is intimately linked to state-based policy measures such as child removal. Racial trauma is also deeply institutionalised in Australia's education system as a consequence of the focus on dominant (white Standard Australian English speaking) culture, language, literacy and numeracy standards. Despite receiving little recognition in mental health work or the education sector, the effects of such trauma are profound and can account for the high rates of suicide and social dysfunction that we see in remote Indigenous communities as well as the low academic achievement and English language acquisition rates in Aboriginal students. This paper presents a literature review related to publications that scrutinise the relationship between racism in policy and schools and racial trauma, drawing on some research findings by one of the authors. It suggests alternative Indigenous pedagogies that can both mitigate and remove racial trauma from the school environment and lead to successful academic outcomes and well-being for Aboriginal students.

AB Objective: Suicide rates in rural Australia are higher than in urban areas. No existing research has explored the long-term patterns and predictors of change in suicidal ideation within rural areas. This report uses longitudinal data and multiple time points to determine predictors of the trajectory of suicidal ideation in rural Australia.
   Method: Participants in the Australian Rural Mental Health Study (ARMHS) completed self-report surveys at baseline, 12 and 36 months, reporting their psychological and social well-being, and suicidal ideation. Generalised linear mixed models explored these factors as correlates and predictors of suicidal ideation across 3 years using multiple data points.
   Results: A total of 2135 participants completed at least one wave of ARMHS, and hence were included in the current analysis. Overall, 8.1% reported suicidal ideation during at least one study wave, 76% of whom reported suicidal ideation intermittently rather than consistently across waves. Across the three time points, suicidal ideation was significantly associated with higher psychological distress (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.37), neuroticism (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.27), and availability of support (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.92), with a non-significant association with unemployment (OR 1.73, 95% CI 0.93 to 3.24) even after controlling for the effects of perceived financial hardship. Future suicidal ideation was significantly predicted by distress (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.23) and neuroticism (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.32), with a non-significant association with unemployment (OR 2.11, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.27). Predictive effects for marital status, social networks, sense of community and availability of support did not remain significant in the full multivariate analysis.
   Conclusions: Fluctuations in suicidal ideation are common, and may be associated with changes in psychological and social well-being. Public health strategies, focusing on encouraging help-seeking among those with higher psychological distress, lower social support, and unstable or absent employment opportunities, may be a useful long-term initiative to reduce the prevalence of suicidal ideation in the general rural community.

   SUICIDE; BELIEFS; CARE
AB Background: Although there have been many population studies of mental health literacy, little is known about the mental health literacy of people who reside in rural areas. This study sought to determine the impact of remoteness on public knowledge of depression and schizophrenia.
   Methods: The mental health literacy of residents of major cities, inner regional, and outer-remote (including outer regional, remote, and very remote) regions were compared using data from a 2003-04 Australian national survey of the mental health literacy of 3998 adults. Measures included the perceived helpfulness of a range of professionals, non-professionals and interventions, and the causes, prognosis, and outcomes after treatment for four case vignettes describing depression, depression with suicidal ideation, early schizophrenia and chronic schizophrenia. Participant awareness of Australia's national depression initiative and depression in the media, their symptoms of depression and exposure to the conditions depicted in the vignettes were also compared.
   Results: Mental health literacy was similar across remoteness categories. However, inner regional residents showed superior identification of the disorders depicted in the suicidal ideation and chronic schizophrenia vignettes. They were also more likely to report having heard of Australia's national depression health promotion campaign. Conversely, they were less likely than major city residents to rate the evidence-based treatment of psychotherapy helpful for depression. Both inner regional and outer-remote residents were less likely to rate psychologists as helpful for depression alone. The rural groups were more likely to rate the non-evidence based interventions of drinking and painkillers as helpful for a depression vignette. In addition, outer-remote residents were more likely to identify the evidence based treatment of antipsychotics as harmful for early schizophrenia and less likely to endorse psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and general practitioners as helpful for the condition.
   Conclusion: Mental health awareness campaigns in rural and remote regions may be most appropriately focused on communicating which interventions are effective for depression and schizophrenia and which mental health and other professionals are trained in the best-practice delivery and management of these. There is also a need to communicate to rural residents that alcohol and pain relievers are not an effective solution for depression.

AB Introduction Clinical training in the undergraduate medical course places multiple stressors on trainees, which have been held to lead to heightened distress, depression, suicide, substance misuse/abuse and poor mental health outcomes. To date, evidence for morbidity in trainees is largely derived from cross-sectional survey-based research. This limits the accuracy of estimates and the extent to which predispositional vulnerabilities (biological and/or psychological), contextual triggers and longer-term consequences can be validly identified. Longitudinal clinical assessments embedded within a biopsychosocial framework are needed before effective preventative and treatment strategies can be put in place.
   Methods and analysis This study is an observational longitudinal cohort study of 330 students enrolled in the undergraduate medicine course at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) Sydney, Australia. Students will be recruited in their fourth year of study and undergo annual assessments for 4 consecutive years as they progress through increasingly demanding clinical training, including internship. Assessments will include clinical interviews for psychiatric morbidity, and self-report questionnaires to obtain health, psychosocial, performance and functioning information. Objective measures of cognitive performance, sleep/activity patterns as well as autonomic and immune function (via peripheral blood samples) will be obtained. These data will be used to determine the prevalence, incidence and severity of mental disorder, elucidate contextual and biological triggers and mechanisms underpinning psychopathology and examine the impact of psychopathology on performance and professional functioning.
   Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval has been granted by the UNSW human research ethics committee (reference HC16340). The findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, and distributed to key stakeholders within the medical education sector. The outcomes will also inform targeted preventative and treatment strategies to enhance stress resilience in trainee doctors.

AB Crisis helplines are designed to provide short-term support to people in an immediate crisis. However, there is a group of users who call crisis helplines frequently over an extended period of time. The reasons for their ongoing use remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in the reasons for calling between frequent and other users of crisis helplines. This was achieved by examining the findings from a brief survey completed by callers to Lifeline Australia at the end of their call between February and July 2015. In the survey, callers reported on their socio-demographics, reasons for their current call and number of calls made in the past month. Survey respondents were categorised as frequent, episodic and one-off users, and analyses were conducted using ordered logistic regression. Three hundred and fifteen callers completed the survey, which represented 57% of eligible callers. Twenty-two per cent reported calling 20 times or more in the past month (frequent users), 51% reported calling between 2 and 19 times (episodic users) and 25% reported calling once (one-off users). Two per cent were unable to recall the number of calls they made in the past month. Frequent users reported similar reasons for calling as other users but they were more likely to call regularly to talk about their feelings [OR = 6.0; 95% CI: 3.7-9.8]. This pattern of service use is at odds with the current model of care offered by crisis helplines which is designed to provide one-off support. There is a need to investigate further the factors that drive frequent users to call crisis helplines regularly.

AB Introduction In Australia there is an overwhelming need to provide effective treatment to patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) in mental health crisis. We adapted Improving Access to Psychological Therapies service model (IAPT) from the National Health Service (NHS) method for the large scale delivery of psychological therapies throughout the United Kingdom to an Australian ED setting. This telephone-based low intensity therapy was provided to people presenting in crisis to the EDs with combinations of anxiety, depression, substance use, and suicidal thinking.
   Methods This uncontrolled study utilised session-by-session, before-and-after measures of anxiety and depression via Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7).
   Results Of 347 eligible post-crisis ED referred patients, 291 (83.9%) engaged with the IAPT team. Most patients (65%) had attended the ED previously on an average of 3.9 (SD=6.0) occasions. Two hundred and forty one patients received an average of 4.1 (SD=2.3) contacts of low-intensity psychological therapies including 1.2 (SD=1.7) community outreach visits between 20th Oct 2011 and 31st Dec 2012. Treated patients reported clinically significant improvements in anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. Uncontrolled effect sizes were moderate for anxiety (0.6) and depression (0.6).
   Discussion The Australian ED IAPT program demonstrated that the UK IAPT program could be adapted for emergency mental health patients and be associated with similar clinical benefits as the original program.
   Funding The Flinders Medical Centre IAPT program received Emergency Department project funding from the Australian Commonwealth Government through the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) and the South Australian Government initiative, Every Patient Every Service (EPES).

TI A randomised controlled trial of a mindfulness intervention for men with

ID SCALE; VALIDATION
AB Background: Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in developed countries, and in Australia approximately one-fifth of men with prostate cancer have advanced disease. By comparison to men with localised prostate cancer, men with advanced disease report higher levels of psychological distress; poorer quality of life; and have an increased risk of suicide. To date no psychological intervention research specifically targeting men with advanced prostate cancer has been reported. In this paper we present the protocol of a current randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of a professionally-led mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) group intervention to improve psychological well-being in men with advanced prostate cancer.
   Methods/design: Ninety-five men per condition (190 men in total) will be recruited through clinicians in the Australian and New Zealand Urogenital and Prostate Cancer Trials Group and in major treatment centres in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. Patients are randomised to: (1) tele-based MBCT intervention or (2) patient education. A series of previously validated and reliable self-report measures will be administered to men at four time points: baseline/recruitment, and at 3, 6, and 9 months after recruitment and intervention commencement. Engagement with the principles of mindfulness and adherence to practice will be included as potential mediators of intervention effect. Primary outcomes are anxiety, depression and cancer-specific distress. Secondary outcomes are health-related quality of life (QoL) and benefit finding. Disease variables (e.g. cancer grade, stage) will be assessed through medical records.
   Discussion: This study will address a critical but as yet unanswered research question: to identify an effective way to reduce psychological distress; and improve the quality of life for men with advanced prostate cancer.

TI Mediating affect in John Pilger's <i>Utopia</i>: 'the good life' as a
   structure of whiteness
SO CULTURAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE Space; place; media; affect; whiteness
ID INTERVENTION
AB This article proposes that whiteness should be thought of as an affective structure, theorizing whiteness in terms of optimism, possessive subjectivity and multiculturalism. The article shows how the optimism of 'the good life' [Berlant, L., 2011. Cruel optimism. Durham, NC: Duke University Press] is linked structurally to whiteness in the construction of the Australian nation-state. In this context, Utopia [2013. Film. Directed by John Pilger. Australia: Antidote Films] specifically identifies whiteness as an affective structure. The article develops by unpacking this claim. First, I consider how the affective structure of the Australian nationstate is encountered through the mutual mediation of 'media' and 'place'. I focus on the example of the film's journey to Rottnest Island - formerly an island prison, now the destination of holiday makers - to highlight how the optimism of arrival links whiteness to the present. Second, I develop an analysis of the affective surfaces of whiteness by analyzing the film's encounter with 'White Man faciality' [Deleuze, G. and Guattari, F., 1987. A thousand plateaus: capitalism and schizophrenia. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press] and Indigenous 'slow death' [Berlant, L., 2011. Cruel optimism. Durham, NC: Duke University Press]. Through producing a series of faces, Utopia portrays whiteness as a deflective surface that propagates the 'onto-pathology' of white Australia [Nicolacopoulos, T. and Vassilacopoulos, G., 2014. Indigenous sovereignty and the being of the occupier: manifesto for a white Australian philosophy of origins. Melbourne: Re. press]. Utopia also portrays whiteness as an absorptive surface in which Aboriginal self-possession - including, in the form of life - disappears. The film emphasizes the loss of Aboriginal life through illness and suicide linked to incarceration, overcrowding and state-induced impoverishment. The article concludes by locating media (including Utopia) within the tension between absorption and deflection as a tension between the different spatial actions of the affective relations that mediate whiteness.

TI Frequent callers to crisis helplines: Who are they and why do they call?
SO AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY

DT Article
DE Crisis helplines; frequent callers; self-harm; suicide
ID INTERVENTION STYLES; SUICIDAL CALLERS; AUSTRALIA; OUTCOMES
AB Objective: Frequent callers present a challenge for crisis helplines, which strive to achieve optimal outcomes for all callers within finite resources. This study aimed to describe frequent callers to Lifeline (the largest crisis helpline in Australia) and compare them with non-frequent callers, with a view to furthering knowledge about models of service delivery that might meet the needs of frequent callers.
   Method: Lifeline provided an anonymous dataset on calls made between December 2011 and May 2013. We assumed calls from the same (encrypted) phone number were made by the same person, and aggregated call level data up to the person level. Individuals who made 0.667 calls per day in any period from 1 week to the full 549 days for which we had data (i.e. 4.7 calls in 7 days, 20 calls in 30 days, 40 calls in 60 days, etc.) were regarded as frequent callers.
   Results: Our analysis dataset included 411,725 calls made by 98,174 individuals, 2594 (2.6%) of whom met our definition of frequent callers. We identified a number of predictors of being a frequent caller, including being male or transgender, and never having been married. The odds increased with age until 55-64 years, and then declined. Suicidality, self-harm, mental health issues, crime, child protection and domestic violence issues all predicted being a frequent caller.
   Conclusions: Collectively, frequent callers have a significant impact on crisis lines, and solutions need to be found for responding to them that are in everybody's best interests (i.e. the frequent callers themselves, other callers, telephone crisis supporters who staff crisis lines, and those who manage crisis lines). In striking this balance, the complex and multiple needs of frequent callers must be taken into account.

AB Introduction Hanging is an infrequent but devastating cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). We determine the characteristics and outcomes of hanging-associated OHCA in Melbourne Australia.
   Methods A 10-year retrospective case review of all adult hangings (aged >= 16 years) associated with OHCA, was conducted using data from the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry.
   Results Between 2000 and 2009, the emergency medical service (EMS) attended 33 178 adult OHCAs of which 1321 (4%) had hanging as the aetiology. The median age (IQR) of hanging-associated OHCA cases was 39 (29-51) years and 1162 were men (88%). The first recorded rhythm by EMS was asystole seen in 1276 (75.5%) patients, pulseless electrical activity (PEA) in 38 (13.4%) cases and ventricular fibrillation in 7 cases (0.5%). EMS attempted resuscitation in 208 (15.7%) patients of whom 61 (29.3%) achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and were transported, and 7 (3.3%) survived to hospital discharge. Hanging-associated OHCAs were younger (median (IQR) 38 (29-51) years versus 74 (61-82) years, p<0.001), less likely to have a shockable rhythm (0.5% vs 17.2%, p<0.001), receive bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (14.1% vs 25.5%, p<0.001) or an attempted resuscitation by EMS (15.7% vs 36.1%, p<0.001) compared with OHCA cases with an aetiology of 'presumed cardiac' arrest. Multivariable logistic regression identified factors associated with EMS decision to attempt resuscitation; the adjusted OR (95% CI) for 'presence of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation' was 15.8 (10.70-23.30) and for 'witnessed arrest' was 5.26 (1.17-3.30).
   Conclusion Attempted resuscitation was not always futile with a survival of 3.3%. A preventive focus is needed.

ID SUICIDAL-BEHAVIOR; HARM; COHORT; PREVENTION; MANAGEMENT; MORTALITY
AB Medication overdose is a common method of non-fatal self-harm. Previous studies have established which mental health disorders are commonly associated with the behaviour (affective, substance use, anxiety and personality disorders) and which medications are most frequently implicated (benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antipsychotics and non-opioid analgesics). However, few studies have explored patient experiences of medication overdose. We address this gap by examining patient stories of a recent medication overdose event, including severity of depression, intended outcomes and patient experiences of emergency medical care, in part to determine the unmet needs of this group of patients. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 31 patients attending an urban Emergency Department (ED) in Melbourne, Australia, following a medication overdose regarding their mental health history, state of mind at the time of the overdose, circumstances of the overdose, and experiences of emergency medical care. Participants were heterogeneous regarding the severity of depressive symptomatology at the time of overdose. Participant ratings of how accidental or deliberate the overdose was and how strongly they intended to die were also diverse. Stories relating to the overdose usually covered the themes of precipitating events, negative feeling states, and intended outcomes (ambivalent or contradictory). Few problems were identified in relation to the care received in relation to the current overdose. However, histories of extensive mental health problems were commonly reported, along with unsuccessful treatment for these. While mental health problems are common among patients attending the ED following a medication overdose, there is considerable diversity in current levels of distress and intended outcomes, indicating a thorough suicide risk assessment is always warranted. Presentation to the ED for medication overdose should also trigger a mental health treatment review.

AB Purpose Health systems must move from recognition to action if we are to address premature mortality in people with mental illness. Population data registers are an essential tool for planning and monitoring improvement efforts. The Mental Health Living Longer (MHLL) programme establishes a population-wide data linkage to support research translation and service reform in New South Wales (NSW), Australia.
   Participants A total of 8.6 million people who have had contact with NSW public and private health services between July 2001 and June 2018 are currently included in the study. Data include more than 120 million linked records from NSW data collections covering public and private hospital care, emergency departments, ambulance, community mental health services, cancer notifications and care, and death registrations. Linkage is occurring with population-wide breast and cervical cancer screening programmes. Data will be updated 6 monthly.
   Findings to date The cohort includes 970 145 people who have received mental healthcare: 79% have received community mental healthcare, 35% a general hospital admission with a primary mental health diagnosis and 25% have received specialist mental health inpatient care. The most frequent pattern of care is receipt of community mental healthcare only (50%). The median age of the mental health cohort is 34 years, and three-quarters are younger than 53 years. Eleven per cent of the mental health cohort had died during the observation period. Their median age at death was 69 years, which was younger than the median age at death for people accessing other health services.
   Future plans The MHLL programme will examine (i) all-cause mortality, (ii) suicide, (iii) cancer mortality and (iv) medical mortality. Within each theme, the programme will quantify the problem in mental health service users compared with the NSW population, describe the people most affected, describe the care received, identify predictors of premature mortality, and identify variation and opportunities for change.

AB Purpose: There have been few longitudinal studies of deliberate self-harm (DSH) in adolescents. This cross-national longitudinal study outlines risk and protective factors for DSH incidence and persistence.
   Methods: Seventh and ninth grade students (average ages 13 and 15 years) were recruited as state-representative cohorts, surveyed, and then followed up 12 months later (N = 3,876), using the same methods in Washington State and Victoria, Australia. The retention rate was 99% in both states at follow-up. A range of risk and protective factors for DSH were examined using multivariate analyses.
   Results: The prevalence of DSH in the past year was 1.53% in Grade 7 and .91% in Grade 9 for males and 4.12% and 1.34% for Grade 7 and Grade 9 females, respectively, with similar rates across states. In multivariate analyses, incident DSH was lower in Washington State (odds ratio [OR] - .67; 95% confidence interval [CI] = .45-1.00) relative to Victoria 12 months later. Risk factors for incident DSH included being female (OR = 1.93; CI = 1.35-2.76), high depressive symptoms (OR = 3.52; CI = 2.37-5.21), antisocial behavior (OR = 2.42; CI = 1.46-4.00), and lifetime (OR = 1.85; CI = 1.11-3.08) and past month (OR = 2.70; CI = 1.57-4.64) alcohol use relative to never using alcohol.
   Conclusions: Much self-harm in adolescents resolves over the course of 12 months. Young people who self-harm have high rates of other health risk behaviors associated with family and peer risks that may all be targets for preventive intervention.

AB Background: There are few national or cross-cultural studies of the stigma associated with mental disorders. Australia and Japan have different systems of psychiatric health care, and distinct differences in cultural values, but enjoy similar standards of living. This study seeks to compare the nature and extent of stigma among the public in the two countries.
   Methods: A household survey of the public was conducted in each country using similar methodologies. The Australian study comprised a national survey of 3998 adults aged over 18 years. The Japanese survey involved 2000 adults aged 20 to 69 from 25 regional sites distributed across the country. Interviewees reported their personal attitudes (personal stigma, social distance) and perceptions of the attitudes of others (perceived stigma, perceived discrimination) in the community with respect to four case vignettes. These vignettes described a person with: depression; depression with suicidal ideation; early schizophrenia; and chronic schizophrenia.
   Results: Personal stigma and social distance were typically greater among the Japanese than the Australian public whereas the reverse was true with respect to the perception of the attitudes and discriminatory behaviour of others. In both countries, personal stigma was significantly greater than perceived stigma. The public in both countries showed evidence of greater social distance, greater personal stigma and greater perceived stigma for schizophrenia (particularly in its chronic form) than for depression. There was little evidence of a difference in stigma for depression with and without suicide for either country. However, social distance was greater for chronic compared to early schizophrenia for the Australian public.
   Conclusion: Stigmatising attitudes were common in both countries, but negative attitudes were greater among the Japanese than the Australian public. The results suggest that there is a need to implement national public awareness interventions tailored to the needs of each country. The current results provide a baseline for future tracking of national stigma levels in each country.

TI Pre-sentence mental health service use predicts post-sentence mortality

AB With the high risk of death associated with mental disorders and their increased prevalence in offenders, it is judicious to investigate the risk of post-sentence mortality with respect to offenders' psychiatric treatment history.
   Using linked administrative data for a whole-population retrospective cohort of first-time adult offenders (n = 25,537) sentenced to either prison or non-custodial orders in Western Australia, we determined the risk and baseline predictors of post-sentence mortality.
   Of 192 deaths within 2 years of sentence completion, deaths from injury/poisoning (55.6 %), cancer (13.3 %) and cardiovascular disorders (9.7 %) were the most common. Pre-sentence history of mental health service (MHS) contact doubled the risk of post-sentence all-cause and injury/poisoning-related mortality. Physical comorbidity was the strongest predictor of mortality irrespective of pre-sentence MHS contact. Baseline history of attempted self-harm and being an Indigenous male were associated with an elevated risk of death in offenders with a pre-sentence MHS contact. In offenders without a pre-sentence MHS contact, socio-economic disadvantage and incarceration almost doubled the risk of dying from any cause and injury/poisoning.
   Mortality risk in the 2 years following sentence completion is associated with pre-sentence health service use and a range of socio-demographic factors for both incarcerated and non-custodial offenders. The opportunity afforded by imprisonment could be exploited by provision of funding to identify and treat mental illness, impart preventive health education addressing modifiable risk factors and provide transitional care to community-based services, all of which may help reduce preventable post-sentence deaths. Diversion to non-custodial sentences is also a plausible option.

AB Objectives. To identify and review innovations relevant to improving access, quality, efficiency and/or effectiveness in the organization and delivery of health care services in rural and remote areas.
   Study design. Literature review.
   Methods. Key bibliographic databases that index health research were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL. Other databases relevant to Arctic health were also accessed. Abstracts were assessed for relevancy and full articles were reviewed and categorized according to emergent themes.
   Results. Many innovations in delivering services to rural and remote areas were identified, particularly in the public health realm. These innovations were grouped into 4 key themes: organizational structure of health services; utilization of telehealth and ehealth; medical transportation; and public health challenges.
   Conclusions. Despite the challenges facing rural and remote regions, there is a distinctly positive message from this broad literature review. Evidence-based initiatives exist across a range of areas which include operational efficiency and integration, access to care, organizational structure, public health, continuing education and workforce composition - that have the potential to positively impact health care quality and health-related outcomes.

AB Aims To determine the effects of borderline personality disorder (BPD) on 36-month outcomes for the treatment of heroin dependence. Design Longitudinal cohort study. Setting Sydney, Australia. Participants A total of 429 heroin users enrolled in the Australian Treatment Outcome Study, interviewed at 36-month follow-up. Findings The BPD group enrolled in significantly more different treatment episodes across follow-up, but there was no difference in the cumulative number of treatment days received. At 36 months, there were no group differences in sustained or current heroin abstinence, daily heroin use or level of polydrug use. BPD patients maintained significantly higher levels of crime, injection-related health problems, heroin overdose, major depression and poorer global mental health. In contrast to 12-month follow-up, at 36 months there were no group differences in the proportions who attempted suicide over the preceding 12 months or had recently borrowed used injection equipment. Conclusions The clinical picture provided some cause for optimism since 12-month follow-up. Despite this, BPD patients maintained elevated risk levels across a number of domains. The fact that these risks were maintained indicates that this is a group that requires specific clinical attention for BPD-related risks.

AB Background: Overdose (OD) is a leading Cause of mortality and morbidity for individuals with substance use disorders (SUDS), and there are limited prospective data on OD during the months following treatment for SUDS.
   Methods: Variables associated with an OD in the 12 months after leaving an initial treatment episode were examined in an analysis of the Drug Abuse Treatment Outcomes Study (DATOS), a longitudinal naturalistic multisite study. Participants included 2966 patients with one or more SUDS. Non-fatal OD was ascertained by a positive response to "In the past 12 months, have you overdosed on drugs?" Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify variables associated with OD.
   Results: By 12 months, 93 (3.1%) participants reported one or more ODs. Variables associated with OD were lifetime history of OD, injection drug use (IDU), male sex, greater pain, and history of sexual abuse.
   Conclusions: OD-risk appears to be increased by IDU, lifetime OD, sexual abuse history, and pain. The latter finding is novel for a prospective report and requires further study. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI The most difficult clinical situations: A survey of Victorian general

SO JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRICS AND CHILD HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE general paediatrics; paediatric education
AB Objective: To identify which clinical situations are the most difficult to manage for general paediatricians in Victoria, Australia.
   Methods: Self-administered questionnaires were sent to general paediatricians in Victoria. They were asked their opinions regarding what were the most difficult and the most dangerous clinical situations with which they deal.
   Results: The response rate was 64% (63 out of 98 questionnaires sent). The general paediatricians surveyed believed that behavioural, developmental and psychosocial conditions were the most difficult to deal with; conduct disorder was the most nominated clinical category (26% of respondents). The 'dangerous' cases nominated were predominately traditional medical cases. The most commonly nominated category was sepsis and shock (21% of respondents). The most difficult and dangerous clinical situations overall for general paediatricians in Victoria appear to be in the areas of sepsis, child protection, paediatric and neonatal resuscitation, depression and suicide, raised intracranial pressure, intravenous fluid management, and communication with parents and adolescents.
   Conclusions: The present survey provides useful information to help with training-programme design and it gives trainee paediatricians an idea of what experienced paediatricians find difficult. Severe behavioural, family and social difficulties, as well as neonatal and childhood resuscitation, severe sepsis, raised intracranial pressure, and intravenous fluid management were the clinical situations most frequently described as difficult.

AB The prevalence and correlates of self-harm and suicidal behavior in 515 young offenders (mean age 17.3years, SD=1.7) serving community-based orders (CBOs; n=242) or custodial sentences (n=273) in Victoria, Australia, are described. Results from structured interviews showed that 83 (16.1%) participants reported self-harming in the previous 6months, and this was more common among those serving custodial sentences than those serving CBOs (19.4% vs. 12.4%; OR 3.10, 95% CI: 1.74-5.55). Multiple incidents were more common in females and 24% (95% CI: 19-39) of participants who had self-harmed reported having done so with suicidal intent. Self-harm was associated with recent bullying victimization, expulsion from school, past year violent victimization, cannabis dependence, and risk-taking behavior in the preceding year. The epidemiological profile of self-harm in this population appears to be distinct from that seen in the general population. Young offenders who self-harm are a vulnerable group with high rates of psychiatric morbidity, substance misuse problems, and social risk factors. They may benefit from targeted psychological interventions designed specifically to address impulsivity, delivered both within-and during the transition from-the youth justice system.

AB Background Sheds have been used in Australia for decades as an intervention to try and promote 'health by stealth' among men by providing a social space for those who may be particularly vulnerable to poor mental health. Little is known about the impact of men's sheds in England.
   Methods Members of 19 sheds from one local authority area were invited to participate in focus groups to explore their perceptions of their shed. In total, 32 men participated in five focus groups which were analysed using applied thematic analysis.
   Results While some sheds run activities, the main driving factor of sheds was the social aspect, with many coming along for nothing more than a chat and a cup of tea, allowing men to recapture lost social networks from their working days. However, it was felt that there could be more formal links forged between individual groups, which may result in a better range of activities on offer.
   Conclusions This study indicates that the shed can be an effective way of reducing social isolation in older men. However, further work is needed to understand what impact the shed has on physical and mental well-being.

ID FATALITY
AB The mandate of a formal child death review (CDR) system is to advance understanding of how and why children die, to improve child health and safety, and to prevent deaths and injuries in the future. Areas in which CDR has provided valuable information and/or intervention include sudden death in infancy, unintentional injuries (the leading cause of death in Canadian children and youth one to 19 years of age), suicide in youth, and deaths due to homicide or child maltreatment. When collected systematically using common definitions, information regarding deaths in children and youth can help with understanding the scope of problems. Information about the context of a death can inform potential prevention or intervention activities. CDR can improve medical and mental health best practices, child welfare policies and procedures, and legislation and education relevant to public health and safety. In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, CDR processes are mandated by legislation. In Canada, death review teams have diverse structures and functions, and the CDR system is less well developed. The present statement addresses the need for formal, organized child and youth death review in Canada to help strengthen and systemize injury and death prevention efforts.

AB This study's aim was to determine the impact of medical technologies on patient comfort and survival time, through retrospective review of the clinical course, symptom profile, and illness trajectory in 102 consecutive patients (50 males and 52 females), and of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions delivered to them. The average age of males was 72.3 years and of females 73.1 years. Ninety-four patients were admitted for palliation of symptoms due to malignant disease and eight other patients for non-malignant diseases. The median survival time was 12 days. On admission, higher univariate hazard risks for survival were significantly associated with male gender, metastatic disease, and dyspnea. Higher adjusted Charlson comorbidity scores were associated with significantly decreased survival time, while de novo symptoms and diagnostic interventions were associated with lower univariate risk rates and increased survival times. Palliative therapeutic interventions were not significantly associated with increased patient survival. A multivariate analysis showed that pain, dyspnea, immobility, and adjusted Charlson comorbidity scores were independent risks for shorter patient survival times. Diagnostic interventions were significant for increased patient survival. No requests for euthanasia had been recorded, which may, in part, reflect the significant family support most of these patients had received.

AB Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities have been targets of social and emotional wellbeing programs for many years. However, the few health-care programs and services that are evaluated rarely provide insight into the participants' perspectives of program success or failure. This systematic review assessed 33 social and emotional wellbeing programs across Australia to better understand what Aboriginal community members think about the programs and how they could be improved. Results highlighted the interesting and valuable insights provided by Aboriginal participants, including what kinds of program activities and approaches are most suitable, what program characteristics are successful or desired, and their experiences of wellbeing change before and after program participation. They likewise voiced opinions about poorly received programs, culturally inappropriate services and negative experiences. This review highlighted how health and wellbeing programs must better engage Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients to ensure that services are culturally safe, holistic, integrate appropriate staffing, include culturally relevant activities and value patient/participant experiences. These findings have significant implications for the health and wellbeing sector; specifically, research, policy, program design and implementation, evaluation methods, and self-determination.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether indirect self-destructive behaviors predict mortality in nursing home residents. Method: This cross-sectional study with follow-up after 2 years and 3 months surveyed 593 residents in 10 nursing homes in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, Australia. The following instruments were used: Harmful Behaviors Scale (HBS), Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD), Functional Assessment Staging Scale, Resident Classification Index, Cumulative Illness Rating Scale, Even Briefer Assessment Scales for Depression, and the suicide item from the Structured Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Diagnoses of depression, dementia, and psychosis were obtained from nursing home records. Mortality data were obtained in August 1999. Results: At follow-up, 297 (50.1%) residents were still alive with a mean survival time of 565.4 days. Survival analyses found that mortality was predicted by older age, male gender, lower level of functioning, lower levels of behavioral disturbance on the BEHAVE-AD, and higher scores on the HBS "passive self-harm" factor-based subscale, which includes refusal to eat, drink, or take medication. Discussion: These results suggest that passive self-harm behaviors predict mortality in nursing home residents.

AB Objective:
   The common coexistence of psychiatric disorders has been identified as a significant factor contributing to the disability associated with mental illness. Identifying indicators to the development of coexisting disorders has potential clinical implications. This study aimed to investigate the correlates and impact of coexisting disorders in a rural setting.
   Design:
   Cross-sectional analyses of data from a cohort interviewed in two phases.
   Setting:
   A regional community sample in Northern New South Wales, Australia.
   Participants:
   A total of 1407 participants were interviewed and 968 were re-interviewed at follow up.
   Main outcome measures:
   Multinomial logistic regression modelling compared subjects with multiple psychiatric disorders with those with a single disorder for sociodemographic characteristics, measures of personal and social vulnerability, psychological distress, functional disabilities and help-seeking behaviours.
   Results:
   Participants with coexisting disorders were more likely to be male, report a history of severe childhood assault and had higher levels of neuroticism, psychological distress and help-seeking behaviour.
   Conclusions:
   The findings suggest the role of early developmental factors on the complexity and severity of adult mental illness in a rural setting and the significant clinical consequences of comorbidity.

AB New Zealand is considering a change in law to permit euthanasia and/or assisted dying (EAD). We reviewed 20 years of research to investigate New Zealanders' attitudes towards EAD, including those of health professionals. A systematic search was conducted using relevant databases. We identified 21 quantitative and 5 qualitative studies. For quantitative data, descriptive analyses were used to examine any demographic patterns that influenced attitudes. We reviewed the circumstances under which people think that EAD should be accessible, and which forms of EAD they support. All public attitude studies reported that the majority (68%) of respondents support EAD. There are few statistically significant demographic associations with attitudes toward EAD; exceptions include religiousity, educational attainment, and some ethnic groups. Health professionals' attitudes varied by speciality. Qualitative research was analysed for reoccurring themes; 'feeling like a burden' was evident across most studies. We conclude from the quantitative research that public attitudes are stable and a majority are open to legislative change. However, the qualitative research reveals the complexity of the issue and indicates a need for careful consideration of any proposed law changes. It is unclear what safeguards people expect if the law changes. We found little research involving vulnerable and marginalised populations.

TI Mobile Health for First Nations Populations: Systematic Review

DT Review

   systematic review
ID FEASIBILITY; RESOURCES
AB Background: The ubiquitous presence and functionality of mobile devices offers the potential for mobile health (mHealth) to create equitable health opportunities. While mHealth is used among First Nations populations to respond to health challenges, the characteristics, uptake, and effectiveness of these interventions are unclear.
   Objective: This review aimed to identify the characteristics of mHealth interventions (eg, study locations, health topic, and modality) evaluated with First Nations populations and to summarize the outcomes reported for intervention use, user perspectives including cultural responsiveness, and clinical effectiveness. In addition, the review sought to identify the presence of First Nations expertise in the design and evaluation of mHealth interventions with First Nations populations.
   Methods: The methods of this systematic review were detailed in a registered protocol with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, CRD42019123276). Systematic searches of peer-reviewed, scientific papers were conducted across 7 databases in October 2018. Eligible studies had a primary focus on mHealth interventions with experimental or quasi-experimental design to respond to a health challenge with First Nations people from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Two authors independently screened records for eligibility and assessed risk of bias using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklists. Data were synthesized narratively owing to the mix of study designs, interventions, and outcomes. The review was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.
   Results: Searches yielded 1053 unique records, after review and screening, 13 studies (5 randomized controlled trials and 8 quasi-experimental designs) were included in the final analysis. Studies were conducted in Australia (n=9), the United States (n=2), and New Zealand (n=2). The most common health challenge addressed was mental health and suicide (n=5). Intervention modalities included text messaging (n=5), apps (n=4), multimedia messaging (n=1), tablet software (n=1), or a combination of short messaging service (SMS) and apps (n=1). Results showed mixed engagement with the intervention (n=3); favorable user perspectives, including acceptability and cultural appropriateness (n=6); and mixed outcomes for clinical effectiveness (n=10). A diverse range of risks of bias were identified, the most common of which included a lack of clarity about allocation and blinding protocols and group treatment for randomized controlled trials and a lack of control group and single outcome measures for quasi-experimental designs. First Nations expertise informed all mHealth studies, through authorship (n=8), affiliation with First Nations bodies (n=3), participatory study design (n=5), First Nations reference groups (n=5), or a combination of these.
   Conclusions: mHealth modalities, including SMS and apps, appear favorable for delivery of health interventions with First Nations populations, particularly in the area of mental health and suicide prevention. Importantly, First Nations expertise was strongly embedded within the studies, augmenting favorable use and user engagement. However, evidence of efficacy is limited.

AB Background Repetition of self-poisoning is common. Aims To report the 24-month outcomes of a non-obligatory postcard intervention (plus treatment as usual) compared with treatment as usual. Method In a randomised-controlled trial (Zelen design) conducted in Newcastle, Australia, eight postcards were sent to participants over a 12-month period. The principal outcomes were the proportion of participants with one or more repeat episodes of self-poisoning and the number of repeat episodes per person. Results No significant reduction was observed in the proportion of people repeating self-poisoning in the intervention group (21.2%,95% CI 17.0-25.3) compared with the control group (22.8%,95% CI 18.7-27.0; chi(2)=0.32, d.f.=1, P=0.57); the difference between groups was - 1.7% (95% CI - 7.5 to 4.2). There was a significant reduction in the rate of repetition, with an incidence risk ratio of 0.49 (95% CI 0.33-0.73). Conclusions A postcard intervention maintained the halving of the rate of repetition of hospital-treated self-poisoning events over a 2-year period, although it did not significantly reduce the proportion of individuals who repeated self-poisoning.

AB In spite of the diffusion of focus groups method across disciplines and in several areas of research, and although scholars have indicated the utility of this method in cross-cultural research and research with ethnic minority groups, focus groups have been used in this kind of study to a limited extent. One of the reasons for this might be due to the lack of confidence of the researcher in using this kind of method in culturally diverse populations. Being culturally sensitive and, at the same time, pursuing data comparability, makes doing cross-cultural focus groups research a difficult task that necessitates adequate planning and preparation. In this chapter, I present advantages and possible pitfalls of the use of focus groups in cross-cultural research, referring to my recent experience as moderator of focus group discussions in Italy, India and Australia. Suggestions and recommendations for the use of this method with culturally diverse groups are provided, looking at the three phases of the focus groups process: planning, conducting and analysing/reporting.

AB Research suggests that frequent empathic engagement with others in distress places helpers in registered professional roles (e.g. medical practitioners, psychologists) at risk of functional impairment related to symptoms of psychological distress, including the delivery of sub-optimal care to patients. Preliminary research suggests that telephone crisis support workers may also be impacted in a similar way. This repeated measures study is the first known research to examine telephone crisis support workers' functional impairment related to symptoms of psychological distress before and after speaking with callers in crisis. A representative sample of telephone crisis support workers from Lifeline Australia participated by completing three surveys: 1) directly before; 2) directly after; and 3) one week after completing a shift on the national crisis line. Surveys included standardised measures of functional impairment, psychological distress, lived experience of mental health issues and suicide, motivations for volunteering, coping strategies and help-seeking. Categorical items were used to assess personal and shift related factors. Repeated measures analyses of variance were used to identify changes in symptoms of psychological distress and impairment across time points. Structural equation modelling was used to test relationships within a hypothesised model of impairment. A significant proportion of participants reported functional impairment related to symptoms of psychological distress. Significant differences in functional impairment and symptoms of psychological distress were detected, and were associated with different mechanisms, across time points. An important outcome of this study is empirically-supported models which explain how telephone crisis support workers come to experience functional impairment in relation to their TCS role, as well as other work/study, home/family and social/leisure activities. Results warrant the deliberate development and/or modification of existing service strategies to optimise telephone crisis support workers' psychological wellbeing and functioning, including by structuring the work environment and emphasising certain messages during training and supervision.

SO AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE measurement; mental illness; methodology; mortality; validity
AB Background: The finding by Lawrence, Holman and Jablensky (Duty to Care) that mortality among the mentally ill in Western Australia was 2.5 times that of the general population, seemingly, has great significance for public policy concerning the mentally ill. 'Mortality' could be a useful outcome measure for mental health services.
   Objectives: To replicate that study in the Australian Capital territory (ACT), comparing mortality rates in the mentally ill with those of the total population.
   Method: A list of all people who contacted the ACT mental health services between 1985 and 2000 was compiled. Using the national register of deaths (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare), persons known to the mental health services who died between 1990 and 2000 were identified and sex, date of birth, date of death, cause of death and place of death were noted. Using Australian Bureau of Statistics data for all deaths in the ACT, deaths in the total population and in the mentally ill population were tabulated for the period 1996-2000. With 1996 data as the base, using total population data from the ABS and mental health population data derived by amending 'the list' to remove duplications, pre1996 deaths and post1996 additions, mortality rates for the period 1996-2000 were compared.
   Results: The gender and age distribution of the mentally ill population and the total population, and of deaths in those populations, were very different. One third of all deaths in the mentally ill occurred outside of the ACT. Compared with the general population, mortality in the mentally ill (including deaths outside of the ACT) was only slightly excessive for 'all causes' and ischaemic heart disease but grossly excessive for 'suicide'.
   Conclusions: This study did not confirm the excessive mortality rate in the mentally ill reported by Lawrence et al. except for suicide. Many methodological issues in using population studies to attempt to measure the size of the increase were identified. Differences in method between the ACT and WA studies probably explain the differences in results. Caution is urged in using the results of mortality studies as determinants of public policy or to evaluate services.

ID HEALTH; RESIDENTS; AUSTRALIA; SUICIDE
AB The original of this paper was prepared as invited pre-reading for the Inaugural Rural Health Symposium held in Brisbane in July 2008 under the theme 'The impact of "rurality" ', sub-theme (a) Environmental determinants. The natural environment shapes human activity, both economically and socially. It also directly and indirectly influences health and well-being. People in rural and remote areas are more directly exposed to the natural environment than their urban counterparts. The built environment is largely a product of economic activity; thus, the built environment in rural areas tends to reflect the predominant primary industry/ies. The rural built environment presents many potential hazards and risks to health and well-being, particularly for those involved in the primary industries, which are either not present in urban areas, or are present on smaller or more contained scales. The natural and built environments also influence individuals' attitudes and behaviours, both positively and negatively.
   The environmental determinants of rural health, therefore, can be considered in terms of the natural environment, the built environment and individuals' responses to environmental influences. This paper raises some of the common environmental determinants of rural health and well-being and briefly touches on what these mean for rural health service delivery.

DT Article
ID MAJOR DEPRESSION; COMMUNITY; CAMPAIGN; SUICIDE
AB Objective: To identify changes in mental health literacy in regard to depression between 1998 and 2004.
   Design and setting: Face-to-face interviews with a random and representative sample of the South Australian population in 2004, compared with a similarly conducted surrey in 1998 that used the same vignette, questions and methodology.
   Participants: 3015 randomly selected participants, aged 15 years and over.
   Main outcome measures: Responses to both open-ended and direct questions about symptoms and treatment options for depression.
   Results: The 3015 interviews conducted represented a response rate of 65.9%. Compared with 1998, in 2004 there was a significant increase in the proportion of people recognising depression in the vignette, acknowledging personal experience of depression, and perceiving professional assistance to be more helpful and less harmful. However, although more people nominated psychiatrists or psychologists as therapists of choice, the difference between 1998 and 2004 was not significant.
   Conclusions: There has been a significant increase in mental health literacy, at least as regards depression, in the South Australian community between 1998 and 2004. The lack of significant change in psychiatrists and/or psychologists being perceived as therapists of choice is of concern and suggests that community education about their expertise may be appropriate.

AB 'Suffering' is a central discursive trope for the right-to-die movement. In this article, we ask how proponents of physician-assisted dying (PAD) articulate suffering with the role of medicine at the end of life within the context of a decriminalization and legalization debate. We draw upon empirical data from our study of Carter v. Canada, the landmark court case that decriminalized PAD in Canada in 2015. We conducted in-depth interviews with 42 key participants of the case and collected over 4000 pages of legal documents generated by the case. In our analysis of the data, we show the different ways proponents construct relationships between suffering, mainstream curative medicine, palliative care, and assisted dying. Proponents see curative medicine as complicit in the production of suffering at the end of life; they lament a cultural context wherein life-prolongation is the moral imperative of physicians who are paternalistic and death-denying. Proponents further limit palliative care's ability to alleviate suffering at the end of life and even go so far as to claim that in some instances, palliative care produces suffering. Proponents' articulation of suffering with both mainstream medicine and palliative care might suggest an outright rejection of a place for medicine at the end of life. We further find, however, that proponents insist on the involvement of physicians in assisted dying. Proponents emphasize how a request for PAD can set in motion an interactive therapeutic process that alleviates suffering at the end of life. We argue that the proponents' articulation of suffering with the role of medicine at the end of life should be understood as a discourse through which one configuration of end-of-life care comes to be accepted and another rejected, a discourse that ultimately does not challenge, but makes productive use of the larger framework of the medicalization of dying.

AB High-resolution mineral maps derived from hyperspectral imaging (4.5 m pixel) enable the recognition of various types of hydrothermal alteration and the identification of fluid pathways. Airborne hyperspectral images from the Eastern Fold Belt of the Mount Isa Inlier were tested as a new tool for the detection of Fe-oxide Cu-Au (IOCG) related alteration. Four different types of hydrothermal alteration were identified with the hyperspectral mineral maps: (1) Metasomatic 1: white mica mineral maps show the spatial distribution of regional sodic-calcic alteration in metasedimentary successions of the Soldiers Cap Group in the Snake Creek Anticline. (2) Metasomatic 2: alteration zonation is evident from albitised granites assigned to the Williams-Naraku Suite along the Cloncurry Fault. These show characteristic absorption features in the shortwave infrared range (SWIR) which are depicted on the white mica mineral maps (white mica composition, white mica content, white mica crystallinity index). Alteration zonation in gabbros of the Cloncurry District was detected by a combination of MgOH and Fe2+ mineral maps (MgOH content, MgOH composition, amphibole/chlorite and Fe2+ and MgOH) combined with white mica mineral maps (white mica composition and white mica content). (3) Fluid channels 1: major fault zones, such as the Mt Dore fault zone in the Selwyn Corridor, are interpreted as important fluid pathways, where gradual changes in the mineral chemistry are highlighted with mineral maps (e.g. white mica content, white mica composition, white mica crystallinity index). (4) Fluid channels 2: MgOH and Fe2+ mineral maps were used to map breccia pipes in the northern Cloncurry District north of the Saxby Granite (Suicide Ridge). The MgOH and Fe2+ mineral maps were also used to distinguish various mafic rocks from amphibolites, which are host rocks for some of the IOCG deposits in the Eastern Fold Belt (e.g. Mount Elliott), and calcsilicate breccias pipes (e.g. Suicide Ridge).

TI Service network analysis for agricultural mental health
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID SUICIDE; FARMERS
AB Background: Farmers represent a subgroup of rural and remote communities at higher risk of suicide attributed to insecure economic futures, self-reliant cultures and poor access to health services. Early intervention models are required that tap into existing farming networks. This study describes service networks in rural shires that relate to the mental health needs of farming families. This serves as a baseline to inform service network improvements.
   Methods: A network survey of mental health related links between agricultural support, health and other human services in four drought declared shires in comparable districts in rural New South Wales, Australia. Mental health links covered information exchange, referral recommendations and program development.
   Results: 87 agencies from 111 (78%) completed a survey. 79% indicated that two thirds of their clients needed assistance for mental health related problems. The highest mean number of interagency links concerned information exchange and the frequency of these links between sectors was monthly to three monthly. The effectiveness of agricultural support and health sector links were rated as less effective by the agricultural support sector than by the health sector (p <.05). The most highly linked across all areas of activity were Rural Financial Counsellors, the Department of Primary Industry Drought Support Workers and Community Health Centres. Hence for a mental health service network targeting farming families these are three key agencies across the spectrum of case work to program development. The study limitations in describing service networks relate to the accuracy of network bounding, self report bias and missing data from non participants.
   Conclusion: Aligning with agricultural agencies is important to build effective mental health service pathways to address the needs of farming populations. Work is required to ensure that these agricultural support agencies have operational and effective links to primary mental health care services. Network analysis provides a baseline to inform this work. With interventions such as local mental health training and joint service planning to promote network development we would expect to see over time an increase in the mean number of links, the frequency in which these links are used and the rated effectiveness of these links.

TI Time series robustness checks to test the effects of the 1996 Australian
   firearm law on cause-specific mortality
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL CRIMINOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Australia; Firearm regulation; Interrupted time series; Methods
ID HOMICIDE; CRIME; UNEMPLOYMENT; SUICIDE; IMPACT; RATES
AB Many studies utilize time series methods to identify causal effects without accounting for an underlying time trend. We show that accounting for trends changes the conclusions in the study of Chapman et al. (JAMA, 316(3), 291-299, 2016), who evaluated the impact of the Australian firearm law in 1996. We also introduce a new empirical method that tests whether their empirical strategy can actually identify a causal effect that is also useful for panel analyses.
   We use national data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, assembled in annual counts of: total firearm deaths, firearm suicides, and firearm homicides. These data are used in an independent re-analysis of the impact of the 1996 Australian firearm law that accounts for underlying stochastic trends. We then estimate a series of artificially created interruptions using interrupted times series analysis in a time frame before 1996, to test for changes in the slope of mortality across several years prior to the actual regulatory changes. This tests whether the empirical model produces effects in years other than the year of the intervention, thereby testing if the results can simply be replicated at random using other interruption years.
   Controlling for stochastic trends produces less statistical evidence of the impact of the firearm law on firearm mortality than previously reported by Chapman et al. (JAMA, 316(3), 291-299, 2016). Introducing artificial interruptions in 1990 through 1995 produces statistically significant decreases in all firearm-related mortality measures well above the expected type 1 error. Overall, 19 out of the 36 artificial interruption models we tested were found to be statistically significant, suggesting that the empirical model can be implemented in multiple non-intervention years with results similar to the true 1996 interruption year.
   Current evidence showing decreases in firearm mortality after the 1996 Australian national firearm law relies on an empirical model that may have limited ability to identify the true effects of the law.

AB Background: Sociodemographic factors, alcohol and drug intake, and maternal health are known to be associated with adverse outcomes in pregnancy for women with severe mental illness in addition to their use of psychotropic medication. In this study, we describe the demographic characteristics of women hospitalized for severe mental illness along with their use of medication and other drugs during the pregnancy period.
   Methods: A clinical case note review of women with psychosis who were hospitalized at the State Psychiatric Hospital in Western Australia during 1966-1996, gave birth between 1980 and 1992, and received psychiatric treatment during the pregnancy period. The mother's clinical information was available from the case notes and the midwives record. The demographic characteristics of the mothers were described together with their hospitalization pattern and their medication and substance use during the pregnancy period.
   Results: A total of 428 mothers with a history of severe mental illness were identified who gave birth during 1980-1992. Of these, 164 mothers received psychiatric care during the pregnancy period. One hundred thirty-two had taken psychotropic medication during this period. Mothers who were married, of aboriginal status or living in regional and remote areas appeared less likely to be hospitalized during the pregnancy period, while older mothers and those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were more likely to be hospitalized. The number of mothers taking psychotropic medication in the first trimester of pregnancy was reduced compared to the previous 6 months. The decline in the number taking substances over the same period was not significant. In all, 16% of the women attempted suicide during the pregnancy period and 10% non-suicidal self-injury.
   Conclusion: The women demonstrate a pattern of decreased use of psychotropic medication use from the period before pregnancy to the first trimester of pregnancy. Our data highlight the importance of women with severe mental illness receiving regular ongoing monitoring and support from their psychiatrist during pregnancy regarding the level of medication required as well as counseling with regard to substance use, non-suicidal self-injury, and attempted suicide.

TI Young adult sequelae of adolescent cannabis use: an integrative analysis

LA English
DT Article
ID ILLICIT DRUG-USE; MENTAL-HEALTH; CONSEQUENCES; RISK; DEPENDENCE
AB Background Debate continues about the consequences of adolescent cannabis use. Existing data are limited in statistical power to examine rarer outcomes and less common, heavier patterns of cannabis use than those already investigated; furthermore, evidence has a piecemeal approach to reporting of young adult sequelae. We aimed to provide a broad picture of the psychosocial sequelae of adolescent cannabis use.
   Methods We integrated participant-level data from three large, long-running longitudinal studies from Australia and New Zealand: the Australian Temperament Project, the Christchurch Health and Development Study, and the Victorian Adolescent Health Cohort Study. We investigated the association between the maximum frequency of cannabis use before age 17 years (never, less than monthly, monthly or more, weekly or more, or daily) and seven developmental outcomes assessed up to age 30 years (high-school completion, attainment of university degree, cannabis dependence, use of other illicit drugs, suicide attempt, depression, and welfare dependence). The number of participants varied by outcome (N=2537 to N=3765).
   Findings We recorded clear and consistent associations and dose-response relations between the frequency of adolescent cannabis use and all adverse young adult outcomes. After covariate adjustment, compared with individuals who had never used cannabis, those who were daily users before age 17 years had clear reductions in the odds of high-school completion (adjusted odds ratio 0.37, 95% CI 0.20-0.66) and degree attainment (0.38, 0.22-0.66), and substantially increased odds of later cannabis dependence (17.95, 9.44-34.12), use of other illicit drugs (7.80, 4.46-13.63), and suicide attempt (6.83, 2.04-22.90).
   Interpretation Adverse sequelae of adolescent cannabis use are wide ranging and extend into young adulthood. Prevention or delay of cannabis use in adolescence is likely to have broad health and social benefits. Efforts to reform cannabis legislation should be carefully assessed to ensure they reduce adolescent cannabis use and prevent potentially adverse developmental effects.

DE imprisonment; Indigenous issues; men's health; recidivism; social
   determinants of health
AB Objective: This paper reports on a project conducted between 2008 and 2011 that was established to allow eight Australian Indigenous men who had been in prison to tell their stories of incarceration. Background: The Shed in Western Sydney, NSW, Australia, was set up in response to the high male suicide rate in that area, its objective being to support men at risk. Aboriginal men were the most at risk, and they are presently imprisoned at a rate of 13 times more than non-Indigenous men. This small project sought to give voice to the men behind the statistics and point to a significant problem in Australian society. Methods: Interviews were conducted by an Indigenous male, questions covering age at first entering the penal system, number of prison stays, support, and health. This paper is framed around responses to these questions. Results: All but one of the men were recidivist offenders, and over half were under 15 years of age when first offending. All talked about a lack of support both inside and after leaving prison, and alcohol and depression figured strongly in the accounts. Disadvantage and social exclusion, lack of support such as access to housing and health services, figure significantly in the men's stories. It is only when social issues are addressed that any gains will be achieved and a cycle of recidivism broken.

ID CONSUMER PARTICIPATION; HEALTH; VIOLENCE; CARE; RECOVERY; SUICIDE;
   RESPONSIBILITY; MANAGEMENT
AB Risk is commonly defined as a negative threat which needs to be controlled and mitigated; as a concept, it takes high priority in contemporary mental health services. Health-care organizations and clinicians are now required to use levels of risk as a benchmark for clinical decision-making. However, perceptions of risk change according to the lens through which it is viewed. A qualitative, exploratory research study was undertaken in an aged persons' mental health programme in Victoria, Australia, to explore the notion of risk from the multiple perspectives of service providers and consumers. Data were obtained through in-depth interviews, and analysis was based on the framework of Ritchie and Spencer. Balancing uncertainty emerged as a major theme, and comprised two subthemes: (i) complexity of risk from the perspective of providers of services; and (ii) complexity of safety from the perspectives of recipients of services. These differences emphasize a significant disjuncture between perceptions of risk and the potential for the individual needs and concerns of consumers to be subsumed under broader organizational issues. The uncertainty this tension highlights suggests the need to reconceptualize risk, incorporating the views and experiences of all stakeholders, particularly consumers and carers, to enhance recovery-oriented services and facilitate consumer participation within mental health services.

DT Article
ID OCCUPATIONAL INJURIES; UNITED-STATES; AUSTRALIA
AB Aims. To determine the number and rates of work-related fatal injuries by employment status, occupation, industry, age and gender in New Zealand 1985-1994.
   Methods. Potential cases of work-related injury deaths of persons aged 15-84 years were identified from the national electronic mortality data files. Main exclusions were deaths due to suicide and deaths due to motor vehicle crashes. The circumstances of the deaths of each fatal incident meeting inclusion criteria were then reviewed directly from coronial files to determine work-relatedness.
   Results. The rate of work-related fatal injury in New Zealand was 5.03/100 000 workers per year for the study period. There was a significant decline in crude rate over the study period. However, this was in substantial part accounted for by changes in occupation and industry mix. Older workers, male workers, self-employed workers, and particular occupational groups, all had substantially elevated rates. Agricultural and helicopter pilots, forestry workers and fishery workers had the highest rates. Farmers, forestry workers, and fishery workers also had high numbers of deaths, together accounting for nearly 40% of all deaths.
   Conclusions. This study has demonstrated that work-related fatal injury remains a pressing problem for New Zealand. Several areas in urgent need of prevention efforts were highlighted.

AB Objective: The aim of the present study was to develop and evaluate a multidimensional measure of distress experienced by partners of Australian combat veterans.
   Method: The Partners of Veterans Distress Scale (POV-DS) was developed using factor analysis on a sample of 665 female members of Partners of Veterans Association of Australia. Content validity for the scale was established by using focus groups and expert feedback during item development phase. In addition, two self-report inventories were administered to assess physical/mental health, and satisfaction with life.
   Results: Following principal-axis factoring, 45 items were retained, loading on seven distinct but correlated factors: Sleep problems, Hyper-vigilance, Social isolation, Financial problems, Intimacy problems, Exhaustion, and Negative affect. The factor structure was cross-validated using confirmatory factor analysis on a hold-out sample. The distress subscales all exhibited excellent internal consistency (alpha s ranged from 0.84 to 0.95). Validation analyses revealed subscales derived from the seven-factor model explained 31% to 45% of the variance in partners' physical health, mental health, and satisfaction with life.
   Conclusions: The study found that the POV-DS is a reliable and valid tool for assessing distress in partners of Australian combat veterans.

AB Background and Aims Based on the frequently noted heterogeneity in symptom representation and treatment resistance amongst clients with borderline personality disorder (BPD), this study sought to investigate whether a sample of 77 people with severe personality disorder, primarily BPD (n = 74), could be grouped into clinically meaningful subtypes. A follow-up question was whether the subtypes would respond differently to a specialist intervention.
   Method Participants were public mental health clients referred to a specialist residential treatment programme in Victoria, Australia. Using an existing data set, cluster analysis was applied in order to identify subtypes based on various demographic, clinical and psychological variables. Post-treatment analyses were carried out to investigate change in self-harm, suicide attempts, depression and dissociation.
   Results Three subtypes were identified, namely: withdrawn-internalizing, severely disturbed-internalizing and anxious-externalizing. Furthermore, the subtypes responded differently to the treatment, with the withdrawn-internalizing subtype showing reduced levels of dissociation and the anxious-externalizing subtype responding by large reductions in levels of depression. The severely disturbed-internalizing subtype did not improve significantly on any of the outcome measures in this study.
   Discussion These findings suggest that subtypes can be identified amongst clients with BPD, and that the subtypes may be related to treatment outcomes. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Background: Interviews with bereaved family carers to examine the end-of-life experience of the deceased are important tools for palliative care researchers, but the ethics of approaching the bereaved when they are grieving and vulnerable is often debated.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the insights of bereaved family carers about the most appropriate time to be involved in a research interview about the end of life and death of their family member.
   Methods: This qualitative study used a social constructionist framework. Twenty-two bereaved family carers of people with motor neurone disease (MND) and cancer were interviewed in Western Australia.
   Results: Most family carers (86%) feel comfortable being interviewed about the death of their family member within the first 5 months of bereavement, with 43% reporting they could be interviewed within weeks after death. Family carers reported that recall would be better earlier in bereavement and felt it may be helpful to them to talk about their experiences earlier. They said bereaved people should be allowed to decide for themselves when to be involved in an interview.
   Conclusions: These findings indicate that interviews with the bereaved may be most fruitful for researchers and beneficial to family carers when they are allowed to make the choice about timing for themselves, beginning weeks after the death of their family member.

   AUSTRALIA; LINE
AB We conducted a systematic review of research into callers making multiple calls to crisis helplines. Two databases were searched, identifying 561 articles from 1960 until 2012, of which 63 were relevant. Twenty-one articles from 19 separate studies presented empirical data about callers making multiple calls to crisis helplines. Of the 19 studies, three were intervention studies, five were surveys of callers and 11 were call record audits. Most studies were conducted in the USA and defined frequent callers as people making two or more calls. Frequent callers were more likely to be male and unmarried compared to other callers. There were no reported differences between frequent callers and other callers with regard to age, mental health conditions or suicidality. Three studies tested interventions designed to better manage frequent callers. These studies, even though small, reported reductions in the number of calls made by frequent callers. Suggested techniques for responding to frequent callers included: limiting the number and duration of calls allowed, assigning a specific counsellor, implementing face to face contact, the service initiating contact with the caller instead of waiting for callers to contact the service, providing short term anxiety and depression treatment programmes by telephone, and creating a specific management plan for each frequent caller. Future work requires robust study design methods using larger sample sizes and validated measurements.

AB ObjectivesCurrent regional conflicts are creating a surge in forced migration, and heightened visa restrictions are increasingly being applied. The current study aimed to examine the relationship between visa insecurity and psychological outcomes within a large clinical sample of refugees and people seeking asylum in Australia.MethodsThe sample comprised 781 clients (53.9% male, 16-93years) attending a clinic for trauma survivors. Country of birth was most frequently identified as Afghanistan (18.1%), Iraq (15.3%) and Iran (15.1%). The Hopkins Symptom Checklist was administered at admission.ResultsLatent class analyses identified four groups varying in severity of symptoms, namely very high (16.1%), high (38.1%), moderate (31.5%), and low (14.3%). People with insecure visa status were at least five times more likely to report high (OR=5.86, p<0.001) or very high (OR=5.27, p<0.01) depression and anxiety symptoms than those with permanent residency. Women were almost twice as likely to report high (OR=1.96 p<0.01) or very high (OR=1.96, p<0.05) symptoms.ConclusionsThe findings suggest that temporary visas play a significant role in psychological distress and that timely immigration processing has important implications for health outcomes.

AB Backgrounds: Although hanging injury is infrequent, its clinical course is usually devastating. Hanging patients usually need cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). However, hanging-associated cardiovascular damage has not been fully established. The aim of this study was to evaluate echocardiographic findings in patients with hanging injury.
   Methods: We enrolled 25 patients (nine males and 16 females with mean age of 33 +/- 15 years) with hanging injury. Echocardiography was performed within 2 weeks after admission. Clinical, demographic, and laboratory data as well as transthoracic echocardiographic findings were analyzed.
   Results: Of the 25 patients, eight (two males and six females with mean age of 34 +/- 13 years) showed left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). Mean LV ejection fraction was 34 +/- 16%. Global hypokinesia was present in one patient. Apical ballooning with sparing of the basal segment was present in two patients. Basal akinesia and apical hyperkinesia were present in one patient. Four patients showed regional wall motion abnormalities unmatched with coronary territories. The duration of suspension or CPR was not significantly different according to the presence of LVSD.
   Conclusion: This study showed the echocardiographic findings in considerable numbers of patients with hanging injury for the first time. Variable patterns of LVSD were present in patients with hanging injury. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID PREVALENCE
AB Objective To identify occupational causes of disease and injury in veterinarians and their staff.
   Design A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to all of the 160 registered veterinary practices in Western Australia.
   Results Injuries accounted for most workers' compensation claims over a le-month period with 31% of respondents losing a total of 360 work days with a mean of 13.3 days whereas non-occupational diseases such as influenza accounted for 408 work days lost. Over a IO-year period, 71% of respondents had been injured. The major physical injuries were dog and cat bites, cat scratches, scalpel blade cuts and back injuries from lifting heavy animals. Exposure to chemicals such as flea rinses, formalin, glutaraldehyde, x-ray developers and gaseous anaesthetics were reported to cause headache, nausea and allergies. Thirty percent of respondents did not have extractor fans for scavenging waste anaesthetic gases. The study showed high use of radiography (94%) for diagnostic purposes with 24% of respondents believing radiation exposure is a major occupational health and safety issue. Stress, drug abuse, suicide and burglary were also reported. Despite a high awareness of zoonotic diseases, there were very few reports of these.
   Conclusion Injuries and other occupational hazards reported together with work days lost demonstrate a need for improving the working environment of veterinarians and their staff and the development of comprehensive health and safety programs.

AB Objectives To investigate associations between Grade 9 and 10 cyber-bullying perpetration and victimization and Grade 11 problem behavior and mental health problems after controlling for risk factors for these outcomes in the analyses.
   Methods The sample comprised 927 students from Victoria, Australia who completed a modified version of the self-report Communities That Care Youth Survey in Grades 9-11 to report on risk factors, traditional and cyber-bullying perpetration and victimization, problem behavior, and mental health. Complete data on over 650 participants were analyzed.
   Results Five per cent of Grade 9 and 10 students reported cyber-bullying perpetration only, 6-8 % reported victimization only, and 8-9 % both cyber-bullied others and were cyber-bullied. Results showed that cyber-bullying others in Grade 10 was associated with theft in Grade 11, cyber-victimization in Grade 10 was linked with Grade 11 depressive symptoms, and Grade 10 cyber-bullying perpetration and victimization combined predicted Grade 11 school suspension and binge drinking.
   Conclusions Prevention approaches that target traditional and cyber-bullying, and established risk factors are necessary. Such multi-faceted programs may also reduce problem behavior and mental health problems.

ID KOREA; AUSTRALIA; INJURIES; SUICIDE
AB Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyze the outcomes of patients with hanging-induced cardiac arrest who underwent therapeutic hypothermia (TH).
   Method: In this multicenter, retrospective registry-based study, discharged patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and treatment with TH were enrolled between June 2007 and March 2013. Several prehospital and hospital variables were examined for an outcome analysis with multivariable logistic regression.
   Results: A total of 964 patients who had cardiac arrest were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent TH during post-cardiac arrest care after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Of all patients, 105 were assigned to the hanging group and 859 to the non-hanging group. Six patients (6%) with good neurologic outcomes (Cerebral Performance Category 1 or 2) in the hanging group at the time of discharge were found. A shorter time interval between witnessed arrest and ROSC and a Glasgow Coma Scale over 4 after ROSC are statistically significant variables of good neurologic outcomes after hanging-induced cardiac arrest treated with TH.
   Conclusion: A small number of patients who underwent TH after a hanging-induced cardiac arrest provided good neurologic outcomes, and some variables influenced these outcomes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Absconding, where patients under an involuntary mental health order leave hospital without permission, can result in patient harm and emotional and professional implications for nursing staff. However, Australian data to drive nursing interventions remain sparse. The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate absconding in three acute care wards from January 2006 to June 2010, in order to determine absconding rates, compare patients who did and did not abscond, and to examine incidents. The absconding rate was 17.22 incidents per 100 involuntary admissions (12.09% of patients), with no significant change over time. Being male, young, diagnosed with a schizophrenia or substance-use disorder, and having a longer hospital stay were predictive of absconding. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients had higher odds of absconding than Caucasian Australians. Over 25% of absconding patients did so multiple times. Patients absconded early in admission. More incidents occurred earlier in the year, during summer and autumn, and later in the week, and few incidents occurred early in the morning. Almost 60% of incidents lasted 24 hours. Formulation of prospective interventions considering population demographic factors and person-specific concerns are required for evidence-based nursing management of the risks of absconding and effective incident handling when they do occur.

TI Estimating alcohol-attributable mortality among Indigenous Australians:
   Towards Indigenous-specific alcohol aetiologic fractions
SO DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE alcohol; Indigenous Australian; aetiologic fraction; mortality;
   epidemiology
AB Introduction and Aims. Past estimates of Indigenous alcohol-attributable health in Australia have been based on drinking prevalence estimates from the general population, rather than prevalence figures from the Indigenous population. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the efficacy of using Indigenous-specific drinking prevalence to estimate alcohol-attributable deaths among Indigenous Australians. Design and Methods. Estimates of Indigenous alcohol-attributable deaths between 2000 and 2004 were obtained using both (i) national general-population drinking prevalence estimates and (ii) national Indigenous-specific drinking prevalence. Estimates were calculated using the 'aetiologic fraction' method. Results. By using national general-population drinking prevalence figures, past reports on Indigenous health have underestimated alcohol-attributable deaths for the national Indigenous population. Female deaths due to alcohol-attributable haemorrhagic stroke were estimated to be approximately four times higher and alcohol-attributable suicides among men were estimated to be 30% higher than was previously held, when Indigenous-specific drinking prevalence figures were used. Discussion and Conclusions. By substituting Indigenous-specific alcohol consumption prevalence estimates for general-population drinking prevalence, the accuracy of estimates of alcohol-related harm among Indigenous Australians can be significantly improved.

ID EUTHANASIA; ATTITUDES; SUICIDE
AB Background: Assisted dying remains an emotive topic globally with a number of countries initiating legislation to allow individuals access to assisted dying measures. Victoria will become the first Australian state in over 13 years to pass Assisted Dying Legislation, set to come into effect in 2019. Objectives: This article sought to evaluate the impact of Victorian Assisted Dying Legislation via narrative view and case study presentation. Research design: Narrative review and case study. Participants and research context: case study. Ethical considerations: This legislation will provide eligible Victorian residents with the option to request access to assisted dying measures as a viable alternative to a potentially painful, protracted death. Findings: This legislation, while conservative and inclusive of many safeguards at present, will form the basis for further discussion and debate on assisted dying across Australia in time to come. Discussion: The passing of this legislation by the Victorian parliament was prolonged, emotive and divided not only the parliament but Australian society. Conclusion: Many advocates for this legislation proclaimed it was well overdue and will finally meet the needs of contemporary society. Protagonists claim that medical treatment should not provide a means of ending life, despite palliative care reportedly often failing to relieve the pain and suffering of individuals living with a terminal illness.

AB Women's experiences of drought are often made invisible particularly in terms of their long-term effects. Drought differs from other "natural disasters" in that droughts are, by definition, experienced over an extended time. This means those experiencing drought do so as they age, with elderly cohorts particularly vulnerable. As such, there is a need to better understand the longitudinal needs and experiences of women living with drought. This study investigates the experiences of drought for 15 Australian women aged over 70, over a period of 12 years. Longitudinal qualitative free-text comments written by the oldest cohort of women in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health were subject to a thematic analysis. Findings indicate that experiences of drought have a relationship to women's ability to age in ways they may have hoped. Themes of Work and Physical activity, Connection to place, and, Service access were prominent in women's comments. These results demonstrate that place is an important aspect in the experience of ageing, that work and physical activity often intensify during drought for elderly people who might otherwise be expecting to retire, and that drought presents particular challenges for older women in terms of access to services. This study highlights the complex interactions of living and ageing in drought for Australian women.

AB Background: Young men experiencing mental ill health report the lowest rates of professional help-seeking of any demographic group across the lifespan. This phase of life (i.e. adolescence and emerging adulthood) also corresponds to a period of disconnection from healthcare services for young men.
   Aims: The present exploratory qualitative study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to mental health care, as identified by a sample of young help-seeking men and staff involved in mental health service provision.
   Method: Interviews and focus groups were undertaken with 25 young males (mean = 18.80 years, SD = 3.56) and four service providers. Participants were recruited from headspace enhanced primary care early intervention centres in Australia.
   Results: Thematic analysis indicated four overarching barriers and facilitators. The identified barriers were male role expectations, talk therapy as unknown territory, difficulties navigating the system and intake processes. The identified facilitators were positive initial contact, effective cross-sector partnerships, availability of male practitioners and use of targeted messaging.
   Conclusions: Given the ongoing low rates of help-seeking, high rates of suicide and other adverse outcomes for young men, priority research and clinical attention is needed for this group. Recommendations are offered for future research, including suggestions for implementation of targeted strategies addressing gender-based health needs.

AB Aims To compare morbidity and mortality in opioid dependence patients following the commencement of treatment with the general population.
   Methods Morbidity and mortality in all patients treated with methadone, buprenorphine or implant naltrexone for opioid dependence for the first time between 2001 and 2010 in Western Australia was compared to a cohort of age and gender matched controls using state health records.
   Results Compared to community controls rates of all-cause mortality, hospital admissions and Emergency Department attendances are significantly elevated in opioid dependent persons following the commencement of their first treatment. Not surprisingly, rates of opioid and non-opioid drug poisoning, and intentional self-harm/suicide mortality and hospital admissions were significantly elevated in opioid dependent patients compared with non-dependent controls. However, significant increases in mortality and hospital admissions for conditions which are not generally associated with opioid use were also identified including cardiovascular, respiratory and traffic accidents. Life-time prevalence of both HBV and HCV were significantly elevated in opioid dependent patients compared with non-dependent patients.
   Conclusions Even after the commencement of treatment, opioid dependent patients are at a high risk of morbidity and mortality compared with non-dependent age and gender matched controls.

AB Background: Isolation, long work days, climate change and globalization are just some of the many pressures that make farming a vulnerable occupation for incurring mental health issues. The objective of this study was to determine whether farming in Australia is associated with poorer wellbeing, physical and mental health, and less health service use.
   Methods: The Australian Rural Mental Health Study, a longitudinal cohort study was analysed over four time points comparing farmers with non-farming workers (n = 1184 at baseline). Participants were recruited from rural NSW, Australia. A number of physical, mental health, wellbeing, service use outcomes were assessed using generalised estimating equations including all waves in each model. Barriers to seeking help were also assessed.
   Results: Farmers who lived remotely reported worse mental health (beta -0.33, 95 % CI -0.53, -0.13) and wellbeing (beta -0.21(95 % CI -0.35, -0.06) than remote non-farm workers regardless of financial hardship, rural specific factors eg drought worry, or recent adverse events. All farmers were no different to non-farming workers on physical health aspects except for chronic illnesses, where they reported fewer illnesses (OR 0.66, 95 % CI 0.44, 0.98). All farmers were half as likely to visit a general practitioner (GP) or a mental health professional in the last 12 months as compared to non-farm workers regardless of location (OR 0.59, 95 % CI 0.35, 0.97). Rural workers felt that they preferred to manage themselves rather than access help for physical health needs (50 %) or mental health needs (75 %) and there was little difference between farmers and non-farm workers in reasons for not seeking help.
   Conclusions: Remoteness is a significant factor in the mental health and wellbeing of farmers, more so than financial stress, rural factors and recent adverse events. Creative programs and policies that improve access for farmers to GPs and mental health professionals should be supported.

AB Walkability describes the capacity of the built environment to promote walking, and has been proposed as a potential focus for community-level mental health planning. We evaluated this possibility by examining the contribution of area-level walkability to variation in psychosocial distress in a population cohort at spatial scales comparable to those used for regional planning in Sydney, Australia. Data on psychosocial distress were analysed for 91,142 respondents to the 45 and Up Study baseline survey between January 2006 and April 2009. We fit conditional auto regression models at the postal area level to obtain smoothed "disease maps" for psychosocial distress, and assess its association with area-level walkability after adjusting for individual-and area-level factors. Prevalence of psychosocial distress was 7.8%; similar for low (7.9%), low-medium (7.9%), medium-high (8.0%), and high (7.4%) walkability areas; and decreased with reducing postal area socioeconomic disadvantage: 12.2% (most), 9.3%, 7.5%, 5.9%, and 4.7% (least). Unadjusted disease maps indicated strong geographic clustering of psychosocial distress with 99.0% of excess prevalence due to unobserved and spatially structured factors, which was reduced to 55.3% in fully adjusted maps. Spatial and unstructured variance decreased by 97.3% and 39.8% after adjusting for individual-level factors, and another 2.3% and 4.2% with the inclusions of area-level factors. Excess prevalence of psychosocial distress in postal areas was attenuated in adjusted models but remained spatially structured. Postal area prevalence of high psychosocial distress is geographically clustered in Sydney, but is unrelated to postal area walkability. Area-level socioeconomic disadvantage makes a small contribution to this spatial structure; however, community-level mental health planning will likely deliver greatest benefits by focusing on individual-level contributors to disease burden and inequality associated with psychosocial distress.

AB Children whose parents have mental health disorders are at increased risk for deliberate self-harm (DSH). However, the effect of timing of parental mental health disorders on adolescent DSH risk remains under-researched. The aim of this study was to investigate how parental hospital admissions for mental health disorders and/or DSH in different developmental periods impact on the child's DSH risk in adolescence. A nested case-control sample was compiled from a total population cohort sample drawn from administrative health records in Western Australia. The sample comprised 7,151 adolescents who had a DSH-related hospital admission (cases), and 143,020 matched controls who hadn't had a DSH-related hospital admission. The occurrence of parental hospital admissions related to mental health disorders and/or DSH behaviours was then analysed for the cases and controls. The timing of the parental hospital admissions was partitioned into four stages in the child's life course: (1) pre-pregnancy, (2) pregnancy and infancy, (3) childhood, and (4) adolescence. We found that adolescents of a parent with mental health and/or DSH-related hospital admissions in all developmental periods except pregnancy and infancy were significantly more likely than controls to have a DSH-related hospital admission. Compared to parental hospital admissions that occurred during childhood and adolescence, those that occurred before pregnancy conferred a higher risk for adolescent DSH: adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.25 for having only one parent hospitalised and 1.66 for having both parents hospitalised for mental health disorders; aOR = 1.97 for having any parent hospitalised for DSH, all being significant at the level of p<.001. This study shows that timing is important for understanding intergenerational transmission of DSH risk. The pre-pregnancy period is as critical as period after childbirth for effective intervention targeting adult mental health disorders and DSH, highlighting the important role of adult mental health services in preventing DSH risk in future generations.

AB Accessible summary
   Patient referrals to a psychiatric facility may be from a variety of sources including medical practitioners, health professionals and family members. When responding to a situation where a person displays aggressive or disruptive behaviour, police have to decide if the person should be taken to a psychiatric facility for care. There is little known about how police referrals differ from referrals from other sources.
   This paper reports on an audit of files for patients admitted to a psychiatric hospital. A total of 101 files for patients referred by the police and admitted over a 6-month period and 99 files of those referred from other sources and admitted were examined.
   Patients referred by police and admitted to the hospital differed to those admitted by other sources. Police referrals were more likely to be aggressive, have drug and alcohol problems and to require admission to the psychiatric intensive care unit.
   Abstract
   To identify any differences between patients referred by police compared with patients referred from other sources, to a psychiatric hospital in Australia, a retrospective audit of 200 patient files was undertaken. The two most common reasons for the involuntary referral of patients by police were bizarre ideas (33%) and threats of suicide (28%). When 101 patients referred by police were compared with 99 patients from other sources, police referrals were three times more likely to be diagnosed with a mental and behavioural disorder because of psychoactive substance use, less likely to be diagnosed with a mood disorder, and less likely to be diagnosed as psychotic. Police referrals were more likely to have worse functional scores; exhibit aggressive behaviour; spend fewer days in hospital; more likely to be admitted to the psychiatric intensive care unit, and to be secluded. The most important predictor for a police referral was drug or alcohol problems. The study indicates that patients referred by the police were more likely to demonstrate particular characteristics compared with patients referred by other sources.

TI Reducing all-cause mortality among patients with psychiatric disorders:
   a population-based study
SO CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID COMMUNITY TREATMENT ORDERS; WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; HEALTH-CARE; NOVA-SCOTIA;
   INDIVIDUALS
AB Background: Among patients with psychiatric disorders, there are 10 times as many preventable deaths from physical disorders as there are from suicide. We investigated whether compulsory community treatment, such as community treatment orders, could reduce all-cause mortality among patients with psychiatric disorders.
   Methods: We conducted a population-based survival analysis of an inception cohort using record linking. The study period extended from November 1997 to December 2008. The cohort included patients from all community-based and inpatient psychiatric services in Western Australia (state population 1.8 million). We used a 2-stage design of matching and Cox regression to adjust for demographic characteristics, previous use of health services, diagnosis and length of psychiatric history. We collected data on successive cohorts for each year for which community treatment orders were used to measure changes in numbers of patients, their characteristics and outcomes. Our primary outcome was 2-year all-cause mortality. Our secondary outcomes were 1- and 3-year all-cause mortality.
   Results: The study population included 2958 patients with community treatment orders (cases) and 2958 matched controls (i.e., patients with psychiatric disorders who had not received a community treatment order). The average age for cases and controls was 36.7 years, and 63.7% (3771) of participants were men. Schizophrenia and other nonaffective psychoses were the most common diagnoses (73.4%) among participants. A total of 492 patients (8.3%) died during the study. Cox regression showed that, compared with controls, patients with community treatment orders had significantly lower all-cause mortality at 1, 2 and 3 years, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.62 (95% confidence interval 0.45-0.86) at 2 years. The greatest effect was on death from physical illnesses such as cancer, cardiovascular disease or diseases of the central nervous system. This association disappeared when we adjusted for increased outpatient and community contacts with psychiatric services.
   Interpretation: Community treatment orders might reduce mortality among patients with psychiatric disorders. This may be partly explained by increased contact with health services in the community. However, the effects of uncontrolled confounders cannot be excluded.

SO AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY

DT Article
DE Australia; psychiatrists; satisfaction; stress; workforce
ID PHYSICIANS; SATISFACTION; PREDICTORS
AB Objective: To examine the levels of satisfaction and stress of Australian psychiatrists.
   Method: A survey was mailed in December 2002 to all Fellows of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists residing in Australia; 1039 out of 2059 (50%) returned the questionnaire.
   Results: The large majority of respondents (79%) were proud of being a psychiatrist. Most (88%) reported being satisfied with their work. Reasons for dissatisfaction varied between public and private psychiatrists. Private psychiatrists nominated litigation/indemnity issues as the most frequent (69%) while the most common for public psychiatrists was lack of beds (47%). The main reason for satisfaction was helping patients get better (72%). Sixty-two percent found their work in the previous 12 months to be stressful. Dissatisfied psychiatrists were 11 times as likely to report being stressed as those satisfied. In the previous 12 months, 34% reported having had a threat of legal action, 39% had to answer a formal complaint, 67% had been verbally or physically abused by patients or relatives and 29% had patients who had suicided. Overall, psychiatrists were more pessimistic about the future than optimistic and 15% said they would not do psychiatry again. There were few differences according to state of origin or type of practice. However, females differed from males in several areas.
   Conclusion: Helping patients was reported as the main source of satisfaction for Australian psychiatrists while not being able to provide the best care for patients was described as one of the main reasons for dissatisfaction. Although most Australian psychiatrists are satisfied and proud of their profession, they are stressed and often experience verbal or physical abuse and threats of legal action and complaints. They are apprehensive about the future. The increasing number of females in the profession, their higher levels of stress and dissatisfaction, and other differences from males must be taken into account as the profession reshapes its future. There is a need for regular surveys of this kind.

TI A modelling tool for policy analysis to support the design of efficient
   and effective policy responses for complex public health problems
SO IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE
LA English

   PRISONERS; PROGRAMS; DISEASE; MAKERS
AB Background: In the design of public health policy, a broader understanding of risk factors for disease across the life course, and an increasing awareness of the social determinants of health, has led to the development of more comprehensive, cross-sectoral strategies to tackle complex problems. However, comprehensive strategies may not represent the most efficient or effective approach to reducing disease burden at the population level. Rather, they may act to spread finite resources less intensively over a greater number of programs and initiatives, diluting the potential impact of the investment. While analytic tools are available that use research evidence to help identify and prioritise disease risk factors for public health action, they are inadequate to support more targeted and effective policy responses for complex public health problems.
   Discussion: This paper discusses the limitations of analytic tools that are commonly used to support evidence-informed policy decisions for complex problems. It proposes an alternative policy analysis tool which can integrate diverse evidence sources and provide a platform for virtual testing of policy alternatives in order to design solutions that are efficient, effective, and equitable. The case of suicide prevention in Australia is presented to demonstrate the limitations of current tools to adequately inform prevention policy and discusses the utility of the new policy analysis tool.
   Summary: In contrast to popular belief, a systems approach takes a step beyond comprehensive thinking and seeks to identify where best to target public health action and resources for optimal impact. It is concerned primarily with what can be reasonably left out of strategies for prevention and can be used to explore where disinvestment may occur without adversely affecting population health (or equity). Simulation modelling used for policy analysis offers promise in being able to better operationalise research evidence to support decision making for complex problems, improve targeting of public health policy, and offers a foundation for strengthening relationships between policy makers, stakeholders, and researchers.

AB Introduction: Farmers as a group have unique attitudes, sources of stress and a heightened risk of suicide. In the context of a prolonged drought and associated stress and increased risk of mental-health problems, this study provides an insight into the levels of psychological distress experienced by different demographic groups within the Australian farming community. The study also addresses a significant gap in the literature by exploring ways in which this unique cohort copes and may better cope, with the inevitable challenges of life 'on the land'.
   Methods: A sample of 309 drought-affected South Australian farmers and their spouses (M=51.81, SD=11.69) completed questionnaires containing measures of psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale) and coping (situational version of the COPE) in response to a recent stressor.
   Results: There was no significant difference detected between the levels of distress reported by men and women. Younger farmers (25-54 years) were experiencing significantly higher levels of distress than those in the 55-64 age group but not those aged 65-74 years. The most commonly employed coping strategies were planning, acceptance and active coping and least used were alcohol/drug use, denial, behavioural disengagement and religion. Gender, age-group and the type of stressor (ie farm related, non-farm related, combination) were found to affect farmers' choice of some coping strategies. A multiple regression analysis suggested that behavioural disengagement (beta = .28, p < .05),suppression of competing activities (beta = .20, p < .05), venting (beta = .18, p < .05), alcohol/drug use (beta = .18, p < .05), and mental disengagement (beta = .12, p < .05) all significantly and positively predicted distress in this population, collectively accounting for 34.6% of the variance.
   Conclusion: This study offers a rare examination of farmers' psychological distress and coping in a time of drought. The results demonstrate that in this unique context it is erroneous to assume the universality of models of coping that have been validated in other samples. The results provide for the development of tailored interventions to help farmers cope more effectively during future times of drought.

AB Background and Aims There are numerous factors putting health-care professionals (HCP) at a higher risk of substance abuse and premature death, including high-stress jobs, access to controlled substances, long hours of practice and constant contact with the critically ill. This study aimed to examine fatal drug toxicity in this high-risk cohort, in order to: (1) estimate the rate of drug-caused deaths of Australian HCPs; (2) describe the key characteristics of the cohort; and (3) examine the relationship between HCP occupation and drug type, or intent. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting The National Coronial Information System (NCIS), a database of cases reported to an Australian coroner. Participants A total of 404 drug-caused deaths reported to an Australian coroner between 2003 and 2013 involving HCPs (including medical practitioners, paramedics, nurses, dentists, psychologists, pharmacists and veterinarians). Measures chi(2) tests and descriptive statistics were used to examine relationships. The primary outcome measures were drug type and intent. Covariates included occupation type, mental illness and self-harm. Findings Females comprised nearly two-thirds of the cohort. The highest number of cases involved nurses (62.87%) and medical practitioners (18.07%). The mortality rate was highest among the veterinary group [confidence interval (CI) = 42.21-58.79]. Most were intentional self-harm deaths (50.25%), followed by unintentional deaths (37.62%) (CI = 92.15-109.85). Mental illness was common, diagnosed in almost half of cases (46.04%), with the majority involving depression (CI = 33.48-44.12). Specific drugs were associated significantly with certain professions, such as intravenous barbiturates among veterinarians (chi(2)((7)) = 237.391). A number of cases reported additional stressors, such as relationship, work-place or financial issues, and drugs were diverted from the work-place in nearly a fifth of cases. Conclusions Between 2003 and 2013, Australian health-care professionals averaged 37 deaths per year attributed to drug toxicity, with a mortality rate of nearly five deaths per 1000 employed HCPs. Drug-caused deaths among HCPs in Australia commonly involve females in their mid-40s, with a diagnosis of mental illness, personal and professional stress and the intent to self-harm.

ID RECRUITMENT STRATEGY; ABORIGINAL MEN; GIPPSLAND; ILLNESS; IMPACT
AB Context: The significant impact of mental ill health in rural and remote Australia has been well documented. Included among innovative approaches undertaken to address this issue has been the Mental Health Academic (MHA) project, established in 2007. Funded by the Australian Government (Department of Health), this project was established as a component of the University Departments of Rural Health (UDRH) program. All 11 UDRHs appointed an MHA. Although widely geographically dispersed, the MHAs have collaborated in various ways. The MHA project encompasses a range of activities addressing four key performance indicators. These activities, undertaken in rural and remote Australia, aimed to increase access to mental health services, promote awareness of mental health issues, support students undertaking mental health training and improve health professionals' capacity to recognise and address mental health issues. MHAs were strategically placed within the UDRHs across the country, ensuring an established academic base for the MHAs' work was available immediately. Close association with each local rural community was recognised as important. For most MHAs this was facilitated by having an established clinical role in their local community and actively engaging with the community in which they worked. In common with other rural health initiatives, some difficulties were experienced in the recruitment of suitable MHAs, especially in more remote locations. The genesis of this article was a national meeting of the MHAs in 2014, to identify and map the different types of activities MHAs had undertaken in their regions. These activities were analysed and categorised by the MHAs. These categories have been used as a guiding framework for this article.
   Issues: The challenge to increase community access to mental health services was addressed by (i) initiatives to address specific access barriers, (ii) supporting recruitment and retention of rural mental health staff, (iii) developing the skills of the existing workforce and (iv) developing innovative approaches to student placements. Strategies to promote awareness of mental health issues included workshops in rural and remote communities, specific suicide prevention initiatives and targeted initiatives to support the mental health needs of Indigenous Australians. The need for collaboration between the widely dispersed MHAs was identified as important to bridge the rural divide, to promote project cohesiveness and ensure new ideas in an emerging setting are readily shared and to provide professional support for one another as mental health academics are often isolated from academic colleagues with similar mental health interests.
   Lessons learned: The MHA project suggests that an integrated approach can be taken to address the common difficulties of community awareness raising of mental health issues, increasing access to mental health services, workforce recruitment and retention (access), and skill development of existing health professionals (access and awareness). To address the specific needs and circumstances of their community, MHAs have customised their activities. As in other rural initiatives, one size was found not to fit all. The triad of flexibility, diversity and connectedness (both to local community and other MHAs) describes the response identified as appropriate by the MHAs. The breadth of the MHA role to provide university sponsored educational activities outside traditional student teaching meant that the broader health workforce benefited from access to mental health training that would not otherwise have occurred. Provision of these additional educational opportunities addressed not only the need for increased education regarding mental health but also reduced the barriers commonly faced by rural health professionals in accessing quality professional development.

TI Lack of association between drought and mental health in a cohort of

AB Objective: To evaluate the impact of drought on the mental health of rural Australian women and those in vulnerable sub-populations: women who were more isolated, poorer and less educated; and women who had histories of chronic disease or poor mental health.
   Methods: Surveys were mailed in 1996, 1998, 2001, 2004 and 2008 to 6,664 women born between 1946 and 1951 who were participating in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health. The surveys included the Mental Health Index of the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 (MHI). Drought was assessed by linking the latitude and longitude of women's place of residence at each survey to the Hutchinson Drought Index. Associations between MHI and drought were assessed using linear mixed-models.
   Results: While 31% of the women experienced drought in 1998 and 50% experienced drought in 2007; experience of droughts was less common in the other years. Although drought varied from survey year to survey year, mental health did not vary with drought conditions for rural women or vulnerable sub-populations.
   Conclusions: These findings are contrary to the long-held assumption that droughts increase mental health problems in Australia.
   Implications: While similar results may not be true for men, empirical evidence (rather than assumptions) is required on associations between drought and mental health.

AB We have carried out a bibliometric study about the international scientific publications on clozapine. We have used the EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, and we applied bibliometric indicators of production, as Price's Law on the increase of scientific literature. We also calculated the participation index (PI) of the different countries. The bibliometric data have also been correlated with some social and health data from the 12 most productive countries in biomedicine and health sciences. In addition, 5607 original documents dealing with clozapine, published between 1970 and 2013, were downloaded. Our results state non-fulfilment of Price's Law, with scientific production on clozapine showing linear growth (r = 0.8691, vs. r = 0.8478 after exponential adjustment). Seven of the 12 journals with the highest numbers of publications on clozapine have an Impact Factor > 2. Among the countries generating clozapine research, the most prominent is the USA (PI = 24.32), followed by the UK (PI = 6.27) and Germany (PI = 5.40). The differences among countries on clozapine research are significantly related to economic variables linked to research. The scientific interest in clozapine remains remarkable, although after the application of bibliometric indicators of production, a saturation point is evident in the growth of scientific literature on this topic.

TI Transgender adolescents and legal reform: How improved access to
   healthcare was achieved through medical, legal and community
   collaboration
SO JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRICS AND CHILD HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID GENDER DYSPHORIA; CHILDREN
AB y Transgender children and adolescents face hardships in all domains of their lives, with many experiencing family rejection, social exclusion, discrimination, bullying and assaults. The mental health implications of these experiences include high rates of depression, anxiety, self-harm and attempted suicide. Gender-affirming social support and medical treatment has been shown to ameliorate the poor mental health outcomes of transgender youth, with those who are supported in their social and medical transition reporting rates of depression and self-worth equivalent to general population levels. Advocacy efforts that improve access to support and medical treatment are therefore likely to produce significant positive health and well-being outcomes for this vulnerable population. The transgender community in Australia identified the legal restrictions placed on children and adolescents accessing medical treatment as a significant barrier to positive psychological well-being. Australian law, unique internationally, required the parents of transgender adolescents to apply for court authorisation prior to the commencement of their child's gender-affirming medical treatment. Concerned by the harm created by this process, a coalition of experts, including transgender children, adolescents and their parents, as well as academic and clinical experts in the fields of law and medicine, was created to advocate for reform. Over a period of approximately 4 years, a collaborative process was undertaken, which ultimately led to law reform and improved access to medical treatment for the transgender community.

AB The present review will describe the formation of two pharmacologically selected lines of rats, their behavioral phenotypes, their responses to select drugs, their possible neurochemical correlates, and their use to detect the therapeutic potential of antidepressant drugs. The Flinders Line rats were established at Flinders University in Australia by selectively breeding for differential responses to an anticholinesterase agent from outbred Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats; the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rats were more sensitive to the hypothermic and behavioral suppressing effects of this agent than the Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) rats. The 8-OH-DPAT line rats were established at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill by selectively breeding for differential hypothermic responses to the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT; the high DPAT sensitive (HDS) line rats were more sensitive to the hypothermic effects of 8-OH-DPAT than the low DPAT sensitive (LDS) line rats. Studies of these two pairs of lines have indicated that the FSL and HDS rats are both more susceptible to stress-induced behavioral disturbances. Their usefulness in detecting potential antidepressant drugs and the relationship between mood disorders and drug abuse will be discussed.

AB ObjectiveTo determine whether adolescents who self-harm are at increased risk of heavy and dependent substance use in adulthood.
   MethodFifteen-year prospective cohort study of a random sample of 1943 adolescents recruited from secondary schools across the state of Victoria, Australia. Data pertaining to self-harm and substance use was obtained at seven waves of follow-up, from mean age 15.9years to mean age 29.1years.
   ResultsSubstance use and self-harm were strongly associated during the adolescent years (odds ratio (OR): 3.3, 95% CI 2.1-5.0). Moreover, adolescent self-harmers were at increased risk of substance use and dependence syndromes in young adulthood. Self-harm predicted a four-fold increase in the odds of multiple dependence syndromes (sex- and wave-adjusted OR: 4.2, 95% CI: 2.7-6.6). Adjustment for adolescent anxiety/depression attenuated but did not eliminate most associations. Adolescent substance use confounded all associations, with the exception of multiple dependence syndromes, which remained robustly associated with adolescent self-harm (fully adjusted odds ratio: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.2-3.2).
   ConclusionAdolescent self-harm is an independent risk factor for multiple dependence syndromes in adulthood. This level of substance misuse is likely to contribute substantially to the premature mortality and disease burden experienced by individuals who self-harm.

AB Backsground: This study builds on previous studies reporting that depressive symptoms among adolescents are reduced and personal satisfactions with one's achievements and competence with peers are enhanced when students are taught strategies for engaging in more optimistic thinking (explanatory style) (Gillham, Reivich, & Freres et al., 2006) and social problem-solving (Ingoldsby, Kohl, McMahon, & Lengua, 2006). Additionally, engaging in regular exercise has also been found to be useful in reducing depressive symptoms in this age group (Bodin & Martinsen, 2004). Aim: The study investigated the effects of three interventions explanatory style (cognitive training), conflict resolution, and exercise known to help adolescents develop a strong sense of wellbeing. It involved 31 students aged 11 to 13 years and their parents, and six class teachers from a large, metropolitan, private boys' college in Brisbane, Australia. Methods: Twenty-live boys participated in the three interventions, while six boys acted as a comparison group. A counterbalanced, multiple baseline design was implemented so that students participated in the three interventions in a different order. Results: The results showed that students in the intervention group experienced a reduction of internalising behaviours such as withdrawal and depressive symptoms following all three interventions. Collectively, the interventions were successful in reducing depressive symptoms; individually, they also significantly reduced depressive symptoms. conclusions: The results showed that explanatory style, conflict resolution, and exercise interventions are effective in reducing depressive symptoms in adolescents.

AB This study aims to investigate hospital admission of major depressive disorders (MDD) before and after birth. Population data for all primiparous women admitted to the hospital with depressive disorders before and after birth were used. The comparison group consisted of 10 % of primiparous women not admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder or substance use. A total of 728 women had a first admission with depressive disorders (501 in the first postpartum year). The rate of first hospital admission for depressive disorders decreased during pregnancy and increased markedly in the first three months after birth (peaking in the second month with a rate of 10.74/1,000 person year and rate ratio of 12.56) compared with the 6 months prior to pregnancy. Admission remained elevated in the second postpartum year. Older maternal age, smoking, elective caesarian section and admission to a neonatal intensive care unit or special care nursery were associated with a higher rate of admission. Women born outside Australia and those most socioeconomically disadvantaged were less likely to be admitted to the hospital in the first postpartum year. Overall risk of hospital admission with depressive disorders rose significantly across the entire first postpartum year. This has significant implications for policy and service planning for women with mood disorders in the perinatal period.

AB Mortality rates in drug-dependent patients in substitution treatment remain a matter of debate. Although several retrospective toxicological or forensic postmortem studies on this issue have been conducted, few prospective studies have addressed this problem. In a nationally representative sample of 2694 opioid dependent patients in substitution treatment either with methadone or buprenorphine at baseline were monitored over a 12-month period (response rate, 91%). A total number of 1629 (60.4%) were still in treatment after 12 months. The overall mortality rate was 1.04%. In total, 28 patients of the initial sample deceased within the 1-year follow-up period. Eleven (0.4%) of these deaths are due to a fatal intoxication. Three patients (0.1%) died of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and 3 (0.1%) committed suicide. Thirteen of these patients (4 with overdose/ polyintoxication) were not in substitution treatment at the time of death. Other reasons included accidents and deaths due to other medical conditions. Only in one case the reason could not be ascertained. The mortality rate was similar in methadone as compared with buprenorphine patients. Taking into account the high comorbidity of opioid dependent patients and the severity of dependence, the mortality rate of approximately 1% confirms that maintenance treatment could be regarded as a fairly safe treatment.

AB Objective: To discuss, using two case examples, the potential utility of Internet-based depression information and automated therapy programs in rural regions.
   Design: Systematic review of evaluations of two Australian web-based mental health programs: MoodGYM and BluePages Depression Information.
   Setting: Community, school, university.
   Participants: A total of 12 papers and reports derived from nine separate studies of MoodGYM and BluePages involving sample sizes ranging from 78 to 19 607 people.
   Outcome measures: Depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, dysfunctional thoughts, depression literacy, stigma, help seeking and cost-effectiveness.
   Results: Internet-based applications were effective in reducing depressive symptoms and stigmatising attitudes to depression and in improving depression literacy. School-based programs also showed promise in decreasing depressive symptoms.
   Conclusions: Depression self-help and information programs can be delivered effectively by means of the Internet. As accessibility of face-to-face mental health services in rural areas is poor and as there is a strong culture of self-reliance and preference for self-managing health problems among rural residents, the Internet might offer an important platform for the delivery of help for depression in rural regions. Consideration should be given to developing programs tailored to rural settings and future research should evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of such programs in rural settings.

AB Despite its growing popularity there is a paucity of information exploring the potential of the Internet to build a trusted community that helps reduce stigma, facilitates help-seeking and aids in the prevention or helps in the management of mental health difficulties for young people. Unsupervised online forums or chat rooms hold potential dangers for young people including the possibility of attracting adults who may take advantage of vulnerable adolescents. Contagion with members organizing suicide pacts, or describing suicidal or self-harming intentions and methods and young people ruminating about feeling depressed are also potential risks. This paper describes the development and conceptual underpinnings of the Reach Out! Online Community Forum, a moderated bulletin board, developed in consultation with, and facilitated by young people aged 16-25. The Forum, although facilitated by young people, is supported and monitored by trained moderators. Anecdotal evidence collected via unsolicited feedback from young people using the Forum suggests that it is a positive, unique and helpful online experience although little is known about the impact on stigma reduction and help seeking in the offline world. Given the proliferation of unsupervised forums and chat rooms there is a need for further research to determine the effectiveness or potential dangers of online forums in mental health prevention and early intervention work.

AB Objective: To examine the level and type or service utilisation by rural residents for mental health problems, and to explore the influence or level of need, sociodemographic factors and town size on such service use.
   Method: This was a cross-sectional, community-based study. Subjects were recruited from three locales in rural north-west Victoria: a large regional centre, towns or 5,000-20,000 population and towns of < 5,000 population. Three hundred and ninety-one individuals (54% females) participated. A logistic regression analysis was used to investigate which factors (i.e. need, sociodemographic and town size) predicted lifetime help-seeking for emotional or mental problems from formal health providers in the study sample.
   Results: Factors that predicted having ever sought help from a formal health provider for emotional or mental health problems were: a lifetime and/or current psychiatric disorder, being female, being separated, divorced or widowed, and living in medium sized towns (population 5,000-20,000).
   Conclusions: While traditionally known predictors of help-seeking, Le need and gender, were associated with help seeking in this study, help seeking for mental health problems was also more common amongst individuals living in medium sized rural towns than those living in a large regional city. Possible explanations include availability, accessibility and organisation of services, and individual and/or community attitudes towards help seeking.

AB In Alice Springs, assault and attempted homicide, self-harm and attempted suicide and transportation accidents contribute substantially to the burden of disease, especially among the aboriginal population who are poor and disadvantaged. While road traffic accidents and self-inflicted injuries are the leading causes of injury-related deaths worldwide, violence is a major factor in Alice Springs trauma. Violence accounted for more than half the annual trauma case toad. Aboriginal Central Australians bear a disproportionate risk of injury and illness compared to their non-aboriginal counterparts. Rampant alcoholism and social and family breakdown are thought to be significant contributors to the high incidence of violence in Alice Springs. There were 2,800 trauma admissions to Alice Springs hospital in 2006 compared to 1,800 admissions in 2003. Geographical location often limits timeliness, access and level of health care available to rural and isolated regions of central Australia. Solutions to the trauma epidemic in our Remote indigenous population must look past the Emergency and Surgical Departments that care for the injured to the individual, community, environmental, social and economic factors that underpin the traumas. Traumatic injury and death maybe the most preventable of all health issues. While tremendous resources are spent caring for injured patients in hospital, less attention is paid towards gaining a better understanding of injury prevention. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Given previous evidence that not all Scotland's higher mortality compared to England & Wales (E&W) can be explained by deprivation, the aim was to enhance understanding of this excess by analysing changes in deprivation and mortality in Scotland and E&W between 1981 and 2011. Mortality was compared by means of direct standardisation and log-linear Poisson regression models, adjusting for age, sex and deprivation. Different measures of deprivation were employed, calculated at different spatial scales. Results show that Scotland became less deprived compared to E&W between 1981 and 2011. However, the Scottish excess (the difference in mortality rates relative to E&W after adjustment for deprivation) increased from 4% higher (c.1981) to 10% higher in 2010-12. The latter figure equates to c. 5000 extra deaths per year. The increase was driven by higher mortality from cancer, suicide, alcohol related causes and drugs-related poisonings. The size and increase in Scottish excess mortality are major concerns. Investigations into its underlying causes continue, the findings of which will be relevant to other populations, given that similar excesses have been observed elsewhere in Britain.

AB Oncolytic virus therapy has recently been recognized as a promising new option for cancer treatment. Oncolytic viruses replicate selectively in cancer cells, thus killing them without harming normal cells. Notably, T-VEC (talimogene laherparepvec, formerly called OncoVEX(GM-CSF)), an oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 1, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of inoperable melanoma in October 2015, and was subsequently approved in Europe and Australia in 2016. The efficacies of many types of oncolytic viruses against urological cancers have been investigated in preclinical studies during the past decade, and some have already been tested in clinical trials. For example, a phase I trial of the third-generation oncolytic Herpes simplex virus type 1, G47 Delta, in patients with prostate cancer was completed in 2016. We summarize the current status of clinical trials of oncolytic virus therapy in patients with the three major urological cancers: prostate, bladder and renal cell cancers. In addition to Herpes simplex virus type 1, adenoviruses, reoviruses, vaccinia virus, Sendai virus and Newcastle disease virus have also been used as parental viruses in these trials. We believe that oncolytic virus therapy is likely to become an important and major treatment option for urological cancers in the near future.

AB The bodies of socially isolated people may remain undiscovered in their own houses for prolonged periods. Occasionally the body is in situ for sufficient time to become skeletonised, or partially so. Medico-legal investigation of these cases is complicated by degradation and contamination of evidence. Thus, a multidisciplinary forensic investigation is recommended. The potential contributions of forensic pathology, anthropology, odontology and entomology are outlined here with reference to two cases that occurred in Victoria, Australia, in 2003. Forensic pathologists are often unable to determine the cause of death in skeletonised bodies, however, they may find evidence to support either a natural or unnatural mode of death, and they may describe skeletal pathology or trauma, and identify skeletal features to support radiological identification of the deceased. Anthropologists can provide supplementary evidence of skeletal trauma. Additionally, they can assess age, sex, stature and racial affiliation from skeletal remains. Odontologists can identify individuals through comparison with ante-mortem dental records; however, potential difficulties exist in identifying the treating dentist of a socially isolated person. Odontologists may also examine the teeth and oro-facial skeleton for trauma. Entomologists may estimate minimum death time and/or season of death. Entomological examination of insect remains may also confirm that a body has lain in situ for a considerable period. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective To investigate the types of self-destructive behaviours identified by the Harmful Behaviours Scale (HBS) and the variables associated with them.
   Method A cross sectional survey involving 647 residents in 11 nursing homes in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, Australia. The following instruments were used: Harmful Behaviours Scale (HBS); Behavioural Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale; Functional Assessment Staging Scale; Resident Classification Index; Health of the Nation Outcome Scale; Even Briefer Assessment Scales for Depression; Abbreviated Mental Test Scale; and the suicide item from the Structured Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Diagnosis of dementia was obtained from nursing home records.
   Results Latent class analysis of the HBS identified four groups of residents, described as 'aggressive resistant' (34.9%), 'food refusal' (26.8%), 'behaviourally disturbed' (5.4%) and a 'non-symptomatic' group (33.0%) with little self-destructive behaviour. The behaviourally disturbed group engages in a widespread combination of direct and indirect self-destructive behaviours and displays other behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. In contrast, the food refusal group whose only behavioural symptom was refusal to eat and drink had the most cognitive impairment and did not show higher levels depression or suicidal ideation.
   Conclusions We have found three groups of residents with self-destructive behaviours and each group is associated with a different pattern of variables. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Objective: To investigate relationships between firesetting, antisocial behaviour, individual, family and parenting factors in a large community sample of adolescents.
   Method: A cross-sectional study of students (n = 2596) aged 13 years on average, from 27 schools in South Australia with a questionnaire on firesetting, antisocial behaviour (adapted 21-item Self Report Delinquency Scale), risk-taking, drug use, suicidality, physical and sexual abuse, depressive symptomatology, hopelessness, anxiety, locus of control, self-esteem, family functioning (McMaster Family Assessment Device) and parenting style (Influential Relationships Questionnaire). Data analysis included chi(2), anova and logistic regression.
   Results: Large significant differences are found between firesetters and non-firesetters on all measures. Among adolescents with serious levels of antisocial behaviour (7+ acts included in diagnostic guidelines for DSM-IV conduct disorder), firesetters differ from non-firesetters in reporting more extreme antisocial behaviour (10+ acts), extreme drug use, suicidal behaviour, and perceived failure at school. Gender differences are apparent. A study limitation is the single item assessment of firesetting.
   Conclusions: Self-report firesetting is strongly associated with extreme antisocial behaviour in young community adolescents, in support of existing evidence from incarcerated delinquent and psychiatric populations. Early detection of community firesetters demands further assessment and intervention. Clinicians should consider its coexistence with serious drug use and high risk-taking (especially in girls), and suicidality, sexual and physical abuse (in boys).

AB Objective: To compare rates of visits to a general practitioner between users and non-users of mental health services (MHS).
   Design, participants and setting: Population-based retrospective cohort study of 204 727 users and 294 076 matched non-users of MHS in Western Australia from 1 January 1990 to 30 June 2006, based on linked records of the use of MHS, hospital admissions, Medicare claims for GP and specialist services, electoral roll registration and deaths.
   Main outcome measures: Adjusted rate ratios (ARRs) for the number of visits to GPs by users of MHS relative to non-users, and for different categories of mental disorders.
   Results: Relative to non-users of MHS, the ARR of visits to GPs by users of MHS was 1.622(95% CI, 1.613-1.631) overall, and was elevated in each separate category of mental illness. ARRs were highest for alcohol/drug disorders, schizophrenia and affective psychoses (2.404, 1.834 and 1.798, respectively). The results were not changed by location (metropolitan, rural or remote addresses). However, the 4% of MHS users with no fixed address had a very low ARR of visits to GPs (0.058; 95% CI, 0.057-0.060).
   Conclusions: Users of MHS visit GPs substantially more often than non-users, with the exception of those with no fixed address who seldom see a GP at all. MJA 2010; 192: 501-506

TI Messages from the "Edge of the World": Aksel Valgma's Letters to Artur
   Adson
SO TUNA-AJALOOKULTUURI AJAKIRI
LA Estonian
DT Article
AB Aksel Valgma was born in Estonia in 1910 and died in Australia in 1966. In 1933 he became a professional journalist. lie worked for several newspapers in Tallinn and, in addition to this, he published humorous stories and children's books. During the Second World War, Valgma fled to Germany and emigrated from there to Sydney - to the "edge of the world", as he himself called his new domicile. He worked at a felt factory, managed a chicken farm, and was editor of the Australian Estonians' weekly Meie Kodu (Our Home).
   While he was working as a journalist in Tallinn, he became acquainted with Artur Adson (1889-1977), a poet, writer and theatre critic, who fled to Sweden from the Soviet occupation. They never met again, yet for a short while their old acquaintance was renewed through correspondence. Artur Adson and Marie Under's collection at the Estonian Cultural History Archives contains thirteen letters written by Valgma to Adson in the period from 3 February 1964 to 25 May 1966. The addressee on the envelopes is Artur Adson, yet in several letters he turns to Adson and his wife, the poetess Marie Under, with news for both of them. Some of the letters are in aerogram format, whereas others are in ordinary envelopes, as they contained photographs and banknotes, which could not be enclosed in the aerogram. The collection of letters is complete, without gaps in content, so it could be assumed that Adson preserved all of Valgma's letters. The last letter by Valgma is dated three months before he committed suicide. Its content suggests that life goes on and the correspondence continues; there is no indication of its being the last letter, which it actually was.
   When Valgma started correspondence with Adson, twenty years had passed since their last meeting. The letters indicate several reasons for renewing their acquaintance. Valgma was looking for contributions to the newspaper and wished it to come from Europe; he had a strong province complex and considered Australia to be a cultureless country. On the other hand, Valgma was looking for someone to whom he could confess the pain he felt from losing his homeland. The first letters focus on reminiscences, the later ones discuss more topics from the present. Valgma suggests collaboration to Adson, hoping that his articles would enhance the prestige of Meie Kodu among the readership and would have a considerable impact on the editor's unstable self-esteem.
   The topic most often discussed by Valgma and Adson is trends in refugee literature. Adson is disturbed by the depictions of intimate life in the works of younger authors, and in his reply Valgma agrees with him, although this topic is not very important for him. Valgma is worried about the writers' divergence from the refugees who constitute the only target group of exile literature. In Valgma's opinion, the interest of the refugees in Estonian-language literature was approaching the critical line. Valgma thinks that exile literature should refrain from "philosophical sophistry" and use, above all, refugees' everyday life as a source of inspiration. During the years of correspondence, Valgma wrote his novel Elu uksiklinnud (The Solitary Birds of Life, Lund 1966), which precisely follows the requirements for exile literature that he had explained to Adson. As Valgma wrote the novel and letters in parallel, they overlap remarkably in terms of sentiments and their general mood, which in places is rather depressive. The book reviews and obituaries dedicated to the author have emphasised the biographical side of the novel.
   In his fourth letter to Adson, Valgma writes that his mother-in-law, Mrs. Moolmann, who stayed in Estonia during the war, has been granted a permit to settle in Australia. The seventh letter evidences that Adson has asked Mrs. Moolmann, through Valgma, to help him find out about the destiny of his former neighbours. The tenth letter reveals an interesting fact: mediation of news from their homeland developed into a correspondence between Moolmann and Under. Together with Adson's letters addressed to Valgma, Under's letters to Moolmann reached Australia. Valgma enclosed his mother-in-law's answers in the envelopes addressed to Adson, and this is how news from Soviet Estonia moved through Australia to Sweden.
   The sub-section "Selected letters" presents complete texts of three letters which provide an insight into the problems that creative intellectuals focused on in their discussions in the first decades of exile. The letters also refer to the reasons that inhibited Estonian refugees' adaptation to life in Australia.

AB The drug duloxetine (Cymbalta (R)) is a newer antidepressant which has been available in Australia since 2008. Duloxetine is a serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), which is associated with adverse effects in the first 6 weeks of therapy, including tachycardia and worsening symptoms in people with advanced heart failure. It is also associated with serotonin toxicity in combination with certain drugs. Few reports have been published in the toxicology literature regarding duloxetine and its prevalence in coroners' cases. This study documents the prevalence of duloxetine in coronial cases between 2009 and 2012 and seeks to better understand the role of duloxetine in deaths where concomitant use with other drugs may cause adverse outcomes. Duloxetine was analyzed in blood specimens taken for the purpose of assisting the pathologist in determining a cause of death and analyzed using a validated LC-MS/MS method employed for overnight screening. There were 34 cases where duloxetine was detected of which 19 were attributed to drug toxicity. The median femoral blood concentration in the cohort was 0.14 mg/L (range 0.01-1.42 mg/L). Many deaths involved the concomitant use of numerous other medications; up to 13 other drugs were co-detected in a case. Over half of the deaths were attributed to fatal combined drug toxicity. SSRIs and venlafaxine that may have increased the risk of serotonin toxicity in combination with duloxetine were detected in five cases. Metoclopramide, contraindicated with duloxetine use, was detected in two cases. NSAIDs (n = 11), antipsychotics (n = 15) and benzodiazepines (n = 14) were also commonly co-detected. Heart disease was observed in over 40% of the cohort, mostly in the form of coronary artery disease or cardiomegaly. Death involving duloxetine alone was uncommon (n = 4); however with certain comorbidities and co-administered drugs, the risk of a fatal event is increased, particularly in the setting of other proserotonergic agents. In deaths where duloxetine is detected and the cause of death is believed to be natural or unascertained, it is essential that other serotonin drugs or inappropriate drug combinations be examined for their possible contribution to death.

AB Background PBT2 is a metal protein-attenuating compound that might reduce metal-induced aggregation of mutant huntingtin and has prolonged survival in a mouse model of Huntington's disease. We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of PBT2 in patients with Huntington's disease.
   Methods In this 26-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adults (>= 25 years old) with early-stage to mid-stage Huntington's disease were randomly assigned (1:1:1) by a centralised interactive response system to once daily PBT2 250 mg, PBT2 100 mg, or placebo. Randomisation was stratified by site with a block size of three. Participants, carers, the steering committee, site investigators, study staff, and the study sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability. The safety population consisted of all participants who were randomly assigned and had at least one dose of study drug. The principal secondary endpoint was cognition, measured by the change from baseline to week 26 in the main composite Z score of five cognitive tests (Category Fluency Test, Trail Making Test Part B, Map Search, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, and Stroop Word Reading Test) and scores on eight individual cognitive tests (the five aforementioned plus the Trail Making Test Part A, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and the Speeded Tapping Test). The intention-to-treat population comprised participants who were randomly assigned and had at least one efficacy assessment after administration of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01590888.
   Findings Between April 18, 2012, and Dec 14, 2012, 109 participants were randomly assigned to PBT2 250 mg (n=36), PBT2 100 mg (n=38), or placebo (n=35) at 19 research centres in Australia and the USA. 32 (89%) individuals on PBT2 250 mg, 38 (100%) on PBT2 100 mg, and 34 (97%) on placebo completed the study. Six serious adverse events (acute coronary syndrome, major depression, pneumonia, suicide attempt, viral infection, and worsening of Huntington's disease) occurred in five participants in the PBT2 250 mg group, three (fall with subdural haematoma, suicide attempt, and hospital admission for stabilisation of Huntington's disease) occurred in two participants in the PBT2 100 mg group, and one (increasing aggression) occurred in a participant in the placebo group. The site investigators deemed all, except the worsening of Huntington's disease, as unrelated to study drug. 32 (89%) participants on PBT2 250 mg, 30 (79%) on PBT2 100 mg, and 28 (80%) on placebo had at least one adverse event. Compared with placebo, neither PBT2 100 mg (least-squares mean 0.02, 95% CI-0.10 to 0.14; p=0.772) nor PBT2 250 mg (0.07, -0.05 to 0. 20; p=0. 240) significantly improved the main composite cognition Z score between baseline and 26 weeks. Compared with placebo, the Trail Making Test Part B score was improved between baseline and 26 weeks in the PBT2 250 mg group (17.65 s, 0.65-34.65; p=0. 042) but not in the 100 mg group (0. 79 s improvement, -15.75 to 17.32; p=0.925); neither dose significantly improved cognition on the other tests.
   Interpretation PBT2 was generally safe and well tolerated in patients with Huntington's disease. The potential benefit on executive function will need to be confirmed in a larger study.

AB Objectives Comorbidity is a common feature of mental disorders. However, needs assessment surveys focus largely on individual disorders rather than on comorbidity even though the latter is more important for predicting suicidal thoughts and behaviors. In the current report, we take a step beyond this conventional approach by presenting data on the prevalence and correlates (sociodemographic factors, college-related factors, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors) of the main multivariate profiles of common comorbid Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV disorders among students participating in the first phase of the World Health Organization World Mental Health International College Student initiative. Method A web-based mental health survey was administered to first year students in 19 colleges across eight countries (Australia, Belgium, Germany, Mexico, Northern Ireland, South Africa, Spain, United States; 45.5% pooled response rate) to screen for seven common DSM-IV mental disorders: major depression, mania/hypomania, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, alcohol use disorder, and drug use disorder. We focus on the 14,348 respondents who provided complete data; 38.4% screened positive for at least one 12-month disorder. Results Multivariate disorder profiles were detected using latent class analysis (LCA). The least common class (C1; 1.9% of students) was made up of students with high comorbidity (four or more disorders, the majority including mania/hypomania). The remaining 12-month cases had profiles of internalizing-externalizing comorbidity (C2; 5.8%), internalizing comorbidity (C3; 14.6%), and pure disorders (C4; 16.1%). The 1.9% of students in C1 had much higher prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors than other students. Specifically, 15.4% of students in C1 made a suicide attempt in the 12 months before the survey compared with 1.3-2.6% of students with disorders in C2-4, 0.2% of students with lifetime disorders but no 12-month disorders (C5), and 0.1% of students with no lifetime disorders (C6). Conclusions In line with prior research, comorbid mental disorders were common; however, sociodemographic correlates of LCA profiles were modest. The high level of comorbidity underscores the need to develop and test transdiagnostic approaches for treatment in college students.

TI Methodological issues associated with collecting sensitive information
   over the telephone-experience from an Australian non-suicidal
   self-injury (NSSI) prevalence study
SO BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID UNIVERSITY-STUDENTS; HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS; SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR; HEALTH-CARE;
   HARM; ADOLESCENTS; NONRESPONSE; POPULATION; RELIABILITY; QUESTIONS
AB Background: Collecting population data on sensitive issues such as non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is problematic. Case note audits or hospital/clinic based presentations only record severe cases and do not distinguish between suicidal and non-suicidal intent. Community surveys have largely been limited to school and university students, resulting in little much needed population-based data on NSSI. Collecting these data via a large scale population survey presents challenges to survey methodologists. This paper addresses the methodological issues associated with collecting this type of data via CATI.
   Methods: An Australia-wide population survey was funded by the Australian Government to determine prevalence estimates of NSSI and associations, predictors, relationships to suicide attempts and suicide ideation, and outcomes. Computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) on a random sample of the Australian population aged 10+ years of age from randomly selected households, was undertaken.
   Results: Overall, from 31,216 eligible households, 12,006 interviews were undertaken (response rate 38.5%). The 4-week prevalence of NSSI was 1.1% (95% ci 0.9-1.3%) and lifetime prevalence was 8.1% (95% ci 7.6-8.6). Methodological concerns and challenges in regard to collection of these data included extensive interviewer training and post interview counselling. Ethical considerations, especially with children as young as 10 years of age being asked sensitive questions, were addressed prior to data collection. The solution required a large amount of information to be sent to each selected household prior to the telephone interview which contributed to a lower than expected response rate. Non-coverage error caused by the population of interest being highly mobile, homeless or institutionalised was also a suspected issue in this low prevalence condition. In many circumstances the numbers missing from the sampling frame are small enough to not cause worry, especially when compared with the population as a whole, but within the population of interest to us, we believe that the most likely direction of bias is towards an underestimation of our prevalence estimates.
   Conclusion: Collecting valid and reliable data is a paramount concern of health researchers and survey research methodologists. The challenge is to design cost-effective studies especially those associated with low-prevalence issues, and to balance time and convenience against validity, reliability, sampling, coverage, non-response and measurement error issues.

AB Groups at seasonal risk for deliberate self-harm (DSH) vary according to their geographic location. It is unknown, however, if seasonal risk factors for DSH are associated with place of birth or place of residence as these are confounded in all studies to date. In order to disaggregate place of birth from place of residence we examined general and seasonal risk factors for DSH in three different population birth groups living in Western Australia: Australian Aborigines, Australian born non-Aborigines, and UK migrants. We found Aborigines are at much higher general risk for DSH than non-Aborigines, but are not at seasonal risk, whereas non-Aboriginal Australians and UK migrants are. For UK migrants, this is only found for females. For all groups at seasonal risk this peaks during the austral ( southern hemisphere) spring/summer. Furthermore, non-Aboriginal Australians and UK migrants show a consistent pattern of increased case fatality with increasing age. In contrast, case fatality does not increase with age among Australian Aborigines. Overall, despite living in the same environment, the three birth groups show different patterns of seasonal risk for DSH. In particular, the sex difference found between UK migrants and non-Aboriginal Australian birth groups suggests that predisposition toward seasonal risk for DSH is established early in life, but when present this is expressed according to local conditions.

   wellbeing
SO AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE health-promoting schools; mental health education; wellbeing
   whole-school approach; young people
AB Objective: MindMatters is an innovative, national mental health promotion program which provides a framework for mental health promotion in Australian schools. Its objectives are to facilitate exemplary practice in the promotion of whole-school approaches to mental health promotion; develop mental health education resources, curriculum and professional development programs which are appropriate to a wide range of schools, students and learning areas; trial guidelines on mental health and suicide prevention and to encourage the development of partnerships between schools, parents, and community support agencies to promote the mental wellbeing of young people.
   Method: A team of academics and health education professionals, supported by a reference group of mental health experts, developed MindMatters. The program was piloted in 24 secondary schools, drawn from all educational systems and each State and Territory in Australia. The pilot program was amended and prepared for dissemination nationally.
   Results: The program provides a framework for mental health promotion in widely differing school settings. The teacher professional development dimension of the program is central to enhancing the role of schools in broad population mental health promotion.
   Conclusions: Promoting the mental health and wellbeing of all young people is a vital part of the core business of teachers by creating a supportive school environment that is conducive to learning. Teachers need to be comfortable and confident in promoting and teaching for mental health. Specific, targeted interventions, provided within a whole-school framework, address the needs of the minority of students who require additional support.

TI Premature deaths of nursing home residents: an epidemiological analysis
SO MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
LA English
DT Article
ID SYSTEM; HEALTH
AB Objectives: To conduct a descriptive epidemiological analysis of external cause deaths (premature, usually injury-related, and potentially preventable) of nursing home residents in Australia.
   Design: Retrospective study of a cohort of nursing home residents, using coronial data routinely recorded by the National Coronial Information System.
   Setting and participants: Residents of accredited Australian nursing homes, whose deaths were reported to coroners between 1 July 2000 and 30 June 2013, and determined to have resulted from external causes.
   Main outcome measures: Causes of death, analysed by sex and age group, and by location of incidents leading to death and location of death. Rates of death were estimated on the basis of Australian Bureau of Statistics population and Australian Institute of Health and Welfare nursing home data.
   Results: Of 21 672 deaths of nursing home residents, 3289 (15.2%) resulted from external causes. The most frequent mechanisms of death were falls (2679 cases, 81.5%), choking (261 cases, 7.9%) and suicide (146 cases, 4.4%). The incidents leading to death usually occurred in the nursing home (95.8%), but the deaths more frequently occurred outside the nursing home (67.1%). The annual number of external cause deaths in nursing homes increased during the study period (from 1.2 per 1000 admissions in 2001-02 to 5.3 per 1000 admissions in 2011-12).
   Conclusion: The incidence of premature and potentially preventable deaths of nursing home residents has increased over the past decade. A national policy framework is needed to reduce the incidence of premature deaths among Australians living in nursing homes.

AB Background: Recently released prisoners are at markedly increased risk of death and drug-related causes predominate. Non-fatal overdose (NFOD) is considerably more common than fatal overdose, but has received relatively little research attention and most studies of NFOD in this population have suffered from small samples of unknown representativeness. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and correlates of lifetime NFOD among prisoners in NSW and Queensland.
   Methods: Cross-sectional surveys of adult prisoners in two Australian states: New South Wales (n = 972) and Queensland (n = 1316). Use of similar measures and methods in the two states made direct comparison of findings possible.
   Results: In both NSW and Queensland, 23% of participants reported a lifetime history of NFOD and prisoners with a history of injecting drug use were significantly more likely to report lifetime NFOD. The lifetime prevalence of NFOD among prisoners with a history of injecting drug use was significantly higher in NSW than in Queensland (44% vs. 35%; p < 0.01). Independent correlates of lifetime NFOD were similar across the two states and included ever attempting suicide, ever injecting heroin, and ever injecting opioids.
   Conclusions: The risk of NFOD among prisoners with a history of injecting drug use is high. An understanding of the risk factors for NFOD in this population can inform targeted, evidence-based interventions to reduce this risk. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adolescent health and wellbeing is composed of many different dimensions and ail important part of adolescent self perception includes body image. This chapter discusses the definition and meanings of body image and how body image is reported by Australian adolescents. The problems resulting from poor body image are discussed and the importance of developing a healthy body image is presented. A summary of recent research into body image issues among Australian adolescents is presented and the ways in which health professionals can promote self-esteem, self-acceptance and acceptance of others to improve adolescent health and body image are discussed. Body image concerns affect both male and female adolescents in Australia and the desire for the "perfect" body often leads young people in the direction of dieting, disordered eating, excessive exercise, drug taking, steroid abuse and weight lifting injuries. The basis of a poor body image is linked to low self esteem, which in turn is linked to eating disorders, depression, anxiety, drug and alcohol abuse, steroid use, teen pregnancy and suicide. Conversely, positive self esteem is a protective factor for adolescent mental health. The common links between self esteem development and body image improvement, eating disorder prevention and childhood obesity prevention are outlined to highlight the commonalities between these issues among adolescents and the need for preventive measures that will "First, do no harm". Finally, a school-based self esteem approach for body image improvement in the prevention of eating disorders and youth obesity is presented and discussed.

   humans; adolescent
ID STUDENT ABUSE; ALCOHOL
AB AIM One of the aims of medical selection is to deselect students who have personal characteristics that would impact negatively on their ability to interact with patients, supervisors and peers and impede their ability to cope with the stress of medical training. The arduous requirements of the formal curriculum, the customs and rituals of the socialisation process and the mistreatment and abuse reportedly experienced by students all contribute to stress, mental illness, suicide, lowered self-confidence in clinical ability, decreased ability to learn and alcohol and substance abuse. There has been little research on the effectiveness of the selection interview in deselecting students with negative personal characteristics. Our research profiles the dysfunctional interpersonal tendencies of students already selected into a medical programme through the process of academic merit, application and interview.
   METHODS During 2001 and 2002, 159 students enrolled in an Australian undergraduate medical programme completed the Hogan Development Survey (HDS), which is a self-report measure of dysfunctional personality characteristics that inhibit the development of working relationships with others.
   RESULTS The HDS identified negative personality characteristics in medical students that were not detected in the selection interview.
   CONCLUSIONS The presence of patterns of dysfunctional behaviour in medical training has implications for the selection, teaching and pastoral care of medical students. The HDS has the potential to identify negative personal characteristics that are hard to detect during a selection interview, and may be a valuable adjunct to the interview.

AB Background and objectives: Previous research on the toxicology of homicide has shown that about half of offenders and victims have psychoactive substances in their blood. The purpose of this study was to examine this topic in a Swedish setting.
   Methods: Toxicological data were sought in a database for all victims (n = 273) and perpetrators (n = 257) of homicide in Sweden from 2007 to 2009. Sufficient tests were identified for 97.1% of all victims (n = 265) and 46.7% of all offenders (n = 120). Additional information was obtained from court records and police reports.
   Results: A majority of individuals involved in homicides displayed positive toxicology (57.0% of victims and 62.5% of offenders). The most commonly detected substances, in both victims and offenders, were ethanol (44.9% vs. 40.8%) and benzodiazepines (8.3% vs. 19.2%). The difference between offenders and victims concerning benzodiazepines was statistically significant (OR 2.6; p = 0.002). Perpetrators of homicide-suicide had a lower prevalence of positive toxicology (30.8%) than other homicide offenders (66.4%; p = 0.04) and victims in unsolved cases more often exhibited positive drug toxicology compared to victims in solved cases (36.1% vs. 8.3%; p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: The results of the study support the notion that substance abuse is firmly linked to committing homicide and to becoming a victim thereof. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Hope seen through the eyes of 10 Australian young people
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING
LA English
DT Article
DE gadamer; hope; hope facilitation; phenomenology; photography; youth
AB Aim. The aim of this paper is to report the findings of a phenomenological study that explored hope in 10 young people in Australia.
   Background. Evidence suggests many Australian young people are in crisis. Examination of key reports that detail the incidence of suicide, early drug-taking behaviours, homelessness, self-harm behaviours, joblessness, depressive disorders, crime statistics and alcohol abuse suggest that many of today's young people have lost resilience as well as vital connections to their community.
   Method. Two methods were employed to encourage the participants to reflect on their experiences of hope - what it is and what it meant to them. The first was to supply participants with a disposable colour film camera and ask them to take pictures that, in their view, showed hope. The second was participation in an in-depth interview that was prompted in part, by their photographs. Interview audiotapes were transcribed verbatim and analysis of the text used the Turner method. The data were collected in 2002.
   Findings. Four horizons of hope were revealed: at-one-with; a driving force; having choices; and connecting and being connected. These horizons are discussed, showing how, or if, the literature treats these dimensions of hope. Perspectives are offered on how they might be considered by nurses who are charged with caring for today's young people.
   Conclusion. Registered Nurses who work with young people must understand the phenomenon of hope from their unique perspective before they can offer appropriate hope-facilitating strategies.

   current research effort against stakeholders' priorities

DT Article
DE carers; consumers; general practitioners; mental health; nurses;
   psychiatrists; psychologists; research priorities
AB Objective: To examine the current distribution of mental health research in Australia and compare this with the priorities of various stakeholder groups.
   Method: A content analysis was carried out on a year's worth of published articles and a year's worth of competitive research grants. A questionnaire for stakeholders was developed in which respondents were asked to rate priorities for research using the same categories. Questionnaires were sent to mental health researchers, members of panels that evaluate mental health research grant applications, general practitioners, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, mental health nurses, mental health consumer and carer advocates, and members of the National Mental Health Working Group.
   Results: Different groups of stakeholders tended to have differing perspectives on research priorities, with some major differences between committees that evaluate research grants and consumer and carer groups. Different stakeholder groups also tended to obtain their information about research from different sources. However, there were also a number of areas of agreement. When different research topics are considered, the following tended to be under-researched: affective disorders, suicide, primary care and community settings, prevention and promotion, evaluation of services, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and socially and economically disadvantaged people.
   Conclusions: It is of concern that committees that evaluate research are guided by different values from consumers and carers in setting priorities. Nevertheless, there is consensus across stakeholder groups that a number of areas should be a high priority.

SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF RURAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE primary mental health care; rural service innovation; rural support

ID SUICIDE; AUSTRALIA; REMOTE
AB Objective: The primary mental health care needs of farmers require that service innovations incorporate rural support workers into a local service network. This component of the FarmLink pilot sought to develop a social network analysis method that would describe local mental health-related human service networks. The purpose is to inform improvements in this network and to serve as a baseline against which such improvements can be evaluated.
   Design: A pilot survey of rural human service providers who deal with mental health-related issues among farmers about their self-reported links between each other.
   Setting: Service delivery agencies associated with a small rural town in New South Wales.
   Participants: Twenty-five agents from a range of human services involved in rural human support services to farmers, such as from agricultural and drought support, welfare, primary health care and education. Intervention: Telephone interview prior to the conduct of a Mental Health First Aid seminar and a Farmers Mental Health and Wellbeing workshop. Main
   outcome measures: Agent self-reported service links over the past three months for information exchange, client referrals and working together in relation to helping farmers for mental health, emotional health or stress-related problems. Analysis trialled on the 'made referrals' link shows the network influence, prominence and intermediary status of the rural financial counsellor.
   Conclusions: Within the limitations of recalled self-report data, social network analysis provides a useful network description for informing and evaluating service network improvements.

AB Background: Mental disorders have been found to be positively associated with temperature in cool to cold climatic regions but the association in warmer regions is unclear. This study presented the short-term association between temperatures and mental disorder hospitalizations in a subtropical city with a mean annual temperature over 21 degrees C. Methods: Using Poisson-generalized additive models and distributed-lagged nonlinear models, daily mental disorder hospitalizations between 2002 and 2011 in Hong Kong were regressed on daily mean temperature, relative humidity, and air pollutants, adjusted for seasonal trend, long-term trend, day-of-week, and holiday. Analyses were stratified by disease class, gender and age-group. Results: 44,600 admissions were included in the analysis. Temperature was positively associated with overall mental-disorder hospitalizations (cumulative relative risk at 28 degrees C vs. 19.4 degrees C (interquartile range, lag 0-2 days) = 1.09 (95% confidence interval 1.03, 1.15)), with the strongest effect among the elderly (>= 75 years old). Transient mental disorders due to conditions classified elsewhere and episodic mood disorders also showed strong positive associations with temperature. Conclusion: This study found a positive temperature mental-disorder admissions association in a warm subtropical region and the association was most prominent among older people. With the dual effect of global warming and an aging population, targeted strategies should be designed to lower the disease burden.

DT Article

   SUBTYPES
AB Background: Although it is well established that prostate cancer (PCa) patients are more likely to experience clinical depression than their age-matched non-prostate cancer peers, and that such depression can have negative effects upon survival, little is known about the underlying nature of the depressive symptomatology that these men experience. In particular, the incidence of melancholic symptoms of depression, which are signs of increased risk of suicide and resistance to treatment, has not previously been reported in PCa patients. The present study aimed to measure the incidence and nature of Melancholia in PCa depression.
   Method: A sample of 507 PCa patients in Queensland, Australia, completed anonymous and confidential questionnaires about their background, treatment status, and depression. Data were analysed to select depressive symptoms that were part of the definition of Melancholia vs those which were not. Regression was used to determine the links between Melancholia and overall depressive status, and factor analysis revealed the underlying components of Melancholia, which were mapped over time since diagnosis for 3 years.
   Results: Psychometric data were satisfactory. Melancholia significantly predicted depressive status for the most depressed subset of patients, but not for the total sample. Melancholia was factored into its components of Anhedonia and Agitation, and the first of these was more powerful in predicting Melancholia. Variability over the 3 years following diagnosis was noted for each of these two components of Melancholia.
   Conclusions: The strong presence of Melancholia in the depressive symptomatology of this sample of PCa patients suggests that some forms of treatment for depression may be more likely to succeed than others. The dominance of Anhedonia and Agitation over other symptoms of Melancholia also holds implications for treatment options when assisting these men to cope with their depression.

AB Purpose: To examine the effect of time spent homeless on young people's substance use and use of drug and alcohol services in two countries with contrasting policy and service environments.
   Methods: A crossnational survey was conducted of recently homeless and experienced homeless young people in Melbourne (N = 674) and Los Angeles (N = 620), Questions were asked about alcohol and drug use in the past 3 months, frequency of use, injecting drug use, drug dependency, and perceived need for, and use of, drug and alcohol services. Data were analyzed using logistic regression.
   Results: Substantial numbers of young people reported use of alcohol and drugs. More Australians than Americans and more experienced than newly homeless reported drug use, although there were no differences in frequency of use in the past 3 months. Polydrug use was common, ass were injecting drugs and responses that signified drug dependency. All were more common among Australians and experienced homeless young people. A substantial number of young people had "ever" taken part in a drug or alcohol program, but only a minority believed that they needed help from services. Of these, only a minority had sought help. This was particularly so among those who were classified as drug dependent. Reasons for failure to seek help varied.
   Conclusions: Substance use is alarmingly high compared to national samples of young people, especially among those who had been homeless for longer periods. Programs to reduce substance use must take account of the prevailing drug cultures, as well as different subgroups of the population. (c) 2008 Society for Adolescent Medicine. All rights reserved.

DT Article
ID ELDERLY SUICIDES; NEWCASTLE; TRENDS; ADULTS; INTENT; DRUGS
AB Objective: To examine the epidemiology and severity of self-poisoning by older people in Australia; to compare these data with those for overdoses in younger adults.
   Design, setting, participants: A cohort study of people presenting to a tertiary toxicology centre after self-poisoning over 26 years (1987-2012).
   Main outcome measures: Hospital length of stay (LOS); types of drug ingested; intensive care unit (ICU) admissions; in-hospital deaths.
   Results: Of 17 276 admissions, 626 patients (3.6%) were at least 65 years old. There was a steady decline in the number of overdoses with age. Most self-poisoning by older people was intentional (80% of admissions), but the proportion of unintentional poisonings increased with age (P < 0.001). Median LOS for older patients was 34 h (interquartile range [IQR], 16-75 h), longer than for younger patients (16 h; IQR, 9-25 h; P < 0.001). 133 older patients (21.2%) were admitted to an ICU, compared with 1976 younger patients (11.9%; P < 0.001).
   24 older patients (3.8%) and 93 younger patients (0.6%) died; mortality among older patients declined over time. Hypotension and arrhythmias were more common in patients over 65.
   Benzodiazepines (24%) were the drugs most commonly ingested by older patients, but opioids the most frequently taken drugs in fatal cases. Toxic ingestion of cardiovascular drugs increased threefold over the 26 years; about one-third of poisonings were unintentional or iatrogenic. Recreational drugs were implicated in the admissions of four older patients (0.6%), but in 7.8% of those of people under 65.
   Conclusion: Older patients treated for self-poisoning differ in several important respects from patients under 65. They are more severely affected by self-poisoning: LOS is greater, and ICU admission and mortality rates are higher.

TI Development of Mental Health Indicators in Korea
SO PSYCHIATRY INVESTIGATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Mental health; Mental health indicator; Development
AB Objective Promoting mental health and preventing mental health problems are important tasks for international organizations and nations. Such goals entail the establishment of active information networks and effective systems and indicators to assess the mental health of populations. This being said, there is a need in Korea develop ways to measure the state of mental health in Korea.
   Methods This paper reviews the mental health indicator development policies and practices of seven organizations, countries, and regions: WHO, OECD, EU, United States, Australia, UK, and Scotland. Using Delphi method, we conducted two surveys of mental health indicators for experts in the field of mental health. The survey questionnaire included 5 domains: mental health status, mental health factor, mental health system, mental health service, and quality of mental health services. We considered 124 potential mental health indicators out of more than 600 from indicators of international organizations and foreign countries.
   Results We obtained the top 30 mental health indicators from the surveys. Among them, 10 indicators belong to the mental health system. The most important five mental health indicators are suicide rate, rate of increase in mental disorder treatment, burden caused by mental disorders, adequacy of identifying problems of mental health projects and deriving solutions, and annual prevalence of mental disorders.
   Conclusion Our study provides information about the process for indicator development and the use of survey results to measure the mental health status of the Korean population. The aim of mental health indicator development is to improve the mental health system by better grasping the current situation. We suggest these mental health indicators can monitor progress in efforts to implement reform policies, provide community services, and involve users, families and other stakeholders in mental health promotion, prevention, care and rehabilitation.

DE job satisfaction; working conditions; Generation Y; labour situation;

AB Previous reports indicate that German veterinarians work longer hours, earn lower incomes and suffer from higher stress levels than comparable professions. Motivated by this situation our objectives were to describe the current working conditions and the associated satisfaction among German veterinary practitioners. The study is based on a questionnaire that allows comparisons of the results with similar occupations and a previous study. This is relevant since the veterinarian workforce has substantially changed: on the one hand, Generation Y (born after 1980) is entering the job market with different work-life balance objectives. On the other hand, the female proportion of veterinarians is increasing. Our questionnaire was distributed in spring 2016, and data from 1930 respondents could be analysed (9% of the target population). Full time practitioners worked long hours (median 50h per week), with equine practitioners having particularly long working hours. Fathers worked almost 19h per week longer than mothers. Almost 50% of the employees worked more hours than the legally defined maximum. Full time self-employed practitioners earned significantly more (pre-tax earnings in men 26 (sic)/h, in women 19 /h) than employees (men 14 /h, women 13 /h). Salaries of employees showed a slight increase since 2006. However, especially among recent graduates and particularly in clinics, incomes below the legally defined minimum wages were reported. Respondents with long working hours and small income were less satisfied with their work. Employees and female veterinarians were less satisfied with most aspects of their life when compared to comparable occupations in the general population. The results call for further discussions about working conditions and the associated satisfaction of all German veterinary practitioners.

AB Objectives: High rates of dementia have been observed in Aboriginal Australians. This study aimed to describe childhood stress in older Aboriginal Australians and to examine associations with late-life health and dementia. Design: A cross-sectional study with a representative sample of community-dwelling older Aboriginal Australians. Setting: Urban and regional communities in New South Wales, Australia. Participants: 336 Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander Australians aged 60-92 years, of whom 296 were included in the current analyses. Measurements: Participants completed a life course survey of health, well-being, cognition, and social history including the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), with consensus diagnosis of dementia and Alzheimer disease. Results: CTQ scores ranged from 25-117 (median: 29) and were associated with several adverse childhood indicators including separation from family, poor childhood health, frequent relocation, and growing up in a major city. Controlling for age, higher CTQ scores were associated with depression, anxiety, suicide attempt, dementia diagnosis, and, specifically, Alzheimer disease. The association between CTQ scores and dementia remained significant after controlling for depression and anxiety variables (OR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.05-2.45). In contrast, there were no significant associations between CTQ scores and smoking, alcohol abuse, diabetes, or cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusions: Childhood stress appears to have a significant impact on emotional health and dementia for older Aboriginal Australians. The ongoing effects of childhood stress need to be recognized as people grow older, particularly in terms of dementia prevention and care, as well as in populations with greater exposure to childhood adversity, such as Aboriginal Australians.

DT Article
DE electroconvulsive therapy; prevalence; use rate
ID AUSTRALIA; METAANALYSIS; DEPRESSION; VICTORIA; RATES
AB Objectives: A formal meta-analysis of the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has never been conducted before in literature reviews or syntheses. Such a study would be hampered by heterogeneity and potential reporting biases. However, it would provide a single comparable measure to allow an analysis of statistical key dimensions such as trends across time and psychiatric resources available. It would also help planners and decision makers to set standards and benchmarks for national and regional guidelines for quality assurance and research in health services.
   Methods: We surveyed different databases for relevant studies, limited from 1973 to October 2013. Data were extracted independently by 4 reviewers. The articles retrieved were peerreviewed studies (data-based studies or surveys) presenting ECT population rates (annual patient rates calculated from the general population) or number of patients receiving ECT during or after 1973 and attending a psychiatric establishment (either hospitals or approved ECT delivery centers for inpatients and outpatients in well-defined geographic areas).
   Results: This meta-analysis includes a total of 18 studies from 12 countries. A composite event rate of 16.9/100,000 inhabitants emerged, characterized by high heterogeneity. Across the countries assessed, the prevalence of ECT was higher in older studies.
   Conclusions: By its prevalence, ECT remains rare to exceptional as a specialist treatment for mental disorders. Heterogeneity across regions or countries could best be explained by insufficient standardization of ECT procedures and practices. Linked health databases and audits could help strengthen the effectiveness of ECT in relation to primary outcomes such as suicide and help determine the gap in ECT provision, if any.

AB Purpose: This paper reports the first prospective study of risk factors for continuation of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) during adolescence.
   Methods: We examined whether NSSI became more severe among those continuing to self-injure 1 year later, as well as characteristics and predictors of continuation, relative to cessation, drawn from a sample of 1,973 community-based adolescents from five states in Australia. Multiple sociodemographic and psychosocial factors were assessed in a series of sequential logistic regressions.
   Results: Of those reporting NSSI at follow-up (12% total sample), 4.1% (95% CI: 3.3%-5.0%; n = 80) continued from baseline and an additional 4.1% had stopped this behavior by follow-up (95% CI: 3.3%-5.1%, n = 81; 3.8% new cases). Frequency, potential lethality and number of methods of NSSI increased among adolescents continuing to self-injure. These individuals also had overall higher frequency and more serious wounds compared with those who had stopped self-injuring, possibly providing parameters to differentiate these groups. Continuation of NSSI was associated with higher frequency (OR = 1.06; 95% CI = .99-1.13, p = .08), lower cognitive reappraisal (OR = .86; 95% CI = .78-.95, p = .004) and higher emotional suppression (OR = 1.10; 95% CI = .98-1.22, p = .09) relative to cessation at T1.
   Conclusions: These findings may assist to better identify young people more likely to continue self-injuring and also highlight potentially modifiable factors to inform early intervention initiatives. (C) 2013 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Aims: Our aim was to compare the weapons used in lethal or potentially lethal violence against parents according to the age (adolescent vs. adult) of the offender and victim (mother vs. father) of the offence. Method: All forensic psychiatric examination statements of male offenders who had offended violently against one of their parents during 1973-2004 in Finland (n=192) were reviewed retrospectively. Data on the weapons used by adolescent and adult offenders in relation to the sex of the victim, mental disorder, criminal responsibility and intelligence were gathered. Results: In the whole sample, sharp-edged weapons were the most commonly used weapons. Firearms were more commonly used in offences against fathers (i.e. patricidal offences) than against mothers (i.e. matricidal offences). Adolescent offenders were more likely to use firearms than adult offenders in violent acts against a parent. Among personality-disordered subjects, patricidal offenders used firearms more commonly than did matricidal offenders. Homicidal matricidal offenders had higher full-scale and verbal IQ scores as compared to homicidal patricidal offenders. The matricidal offenders using firearms were shown to be more intelligent as measured by full-scale and verbal scale IQs than the patricidal offenders using firearms. Conclusions: Consistent with the physical strength hypothesis, firearms are used more often in lethal or potentially lethal violence against parents by adolescents than by adults in Finland. As firearms legislation in Finland is currently under reform the study findings suggest that restriction of gun availability may have an influence on intrafamilial homicides, particularly those committed by adolescents.

AB Aims The opportunity to study deaths as they occur within the framework of a prospective cohort study is relatively uncommon. This study investigates deaths among drug misusers over a 4-year period, with specific attention to the circumstances and causes of death, and risk factors for mortality. The study also critically examines the recording of drug-related deaths.
   Design, Setting, Participants Prospective cohort study of 1075 drug misusers recruited to 54 treatment programmes during 1995.
   Measurements Data derived from interviews conducted with clients at intake, death certificates and post-mortem examinations.
   Findings The annual mortality rate was 1.2%, about six times higher than that for a general, age-matched population. Fourteen per cent of the deaths were due to self-inflicted injuries, accidents or violence and 18%, were due to medical causes. The majority of deaths (68%,) were associated with drug overdoses. Opiates were the drugs most commonly detected during post-mortem examinations. In the majority of cases, more than one drug was detected. Polydrug use and, specifically, heavy drinking, and use of benzodiazepines and amphetamines, were identified as risk factors for mortality. Anxiety and homelessness Were also predictive of increased mortality.
   Conclusions We suggest that drug misusers and those working with drug misusers need to be more alert to the risks of polydrug use, including the combined use of alcohol with illicit drugs. The study revealed inconsistencies in the recording of drug-related deaths on death certificates. The routine recording of all substances detected during toxicological examination would improve the accuracy of death certification.

AB Compared to the general population, military personnel are particularly vulnerable to developing gambling problems. The present study examined the presentation of gambling-including gambling frequency, personal thoughts on reducing gambling and recommendations from others to reduce gambling-across these populations. Additionally, the study measured the association between gambling and various psychosocial risk and protective factors-including psychological distress, suicidal ideation, external encouragement to reduce substance use, days out of role, personal wellbeing, resilience, social support and intimate bonds. Data was extracted from the Global Health & Wellbeing Survey, an online self-report survey conducted in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. Of the 10,765 eligible respondents, 394 were military veterans and 337 were active military personnel. Consistent with previous research, a higher proportion of gambling behaviours were observed in both current and ex-serving military samples, compared to the general population. To varying degrees, significant associations were found between the different gambling items and all psychosocial risk and protective factors in the general population sample. However, the military sample yielded only one significant association between gambling frequency and the protective factor 'resilience'. A post hoc stepwise linear regression analysis demonstrated the possible mediating role resilience plays between gambling frequency and other psychosocial risk (psychological distress, and suicidal thoughts and behaviour) and protective factors (personal wellbeing) for the military sample. Given the findings, it is recommended that routine screening tools identifying problem gambling are used within the military, and subsequent resilience focused interventions are offered to at risk personnel.

TI Characteristics of medication overdose presentations to the ED: how do
   they differ from illicit drug overdose and self-harm cases?
SO EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT; PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS; SUICIDE; MANAGEMENT;
   POPULATION; REPETITION; INJURY; ADOLESCENTS; COMMUNITY; ACCIDENT
AB Background Medication overdose accounts for >80% of hospital presentations for self-harm. Previous research has identified typical characteristics of medication overdose cases; however, these cases have not been well differentiated from other similar presentations, namely (1) illicit drug overdose and (2) self-harm by means other than overdose.
   Method A 12-month audit of medication overdose cases (both intentional and unintentional) attending the emergency department (ED) of a major metropolitan public hospital in Melbourne, Australia was conducted. Comparison was made with patients attending for illicit drug overdose or for self-harm by means other than overdose.
   Results Medication overdose cases (n=453) showed a broadly comparable profile with those found in earlier studies (predominantly female gender, aged in their 30s and referred for psychosocial assessment). A similar though not identical profile was noted for self-harm cases (n=545). In contrast, patients attending for illicit drug overdose (n=409) could be characterised as male, in their 20s and not referred for psychosocial assessment. Illicit drug overdose cases were more likely than either the medication overdose or self-harm cases to be triaged in the most urgent category (19.3, 3.8 and 3.9% respectively), suggesting a high level of acuity in this group. However, the illicit drug overdose group on average spent less time in the ED than medication overdose patients, and were less likely to require hospital admission.
   Conclusion On both demographic and treatment variables, patients attending the ED following a medication overdose more closely resemble those attending for self-harm by means other than overdose than those attending for illicit drug overdose.

AB Objective: To describe psychotropic medications prescription patterns among adolescents in Taiwan; focusing on age, gender, duration of treatments and various classes of psychotropic medications.
   Design: A retrospective description analysis.
   Setting: Taiwan National Health Insurance Database.
   Participants: Twelve to seventeen years' patients treated with psychotropic medications.
   Intervention: None.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Percentage and duration of treatment with psychotropic medications during the study periods by medication classes and age groups were calculated. In addition, top three prescribed psychotropic medications were also determined.
   Results: A total of 3,120 patients were prescribed psychotropic drugs. The percentage of adolescent patients that received anxiolytics and antidepressants in 2002-2012 were 2.89% and 2.15%, respectively. Also, 851 patients (1.21%) were prescribed hypnotics and 638 (0.91%) were given sedatives. The prevalence rate of the prescription of psychotropic drugs increased steadily with age and females were more treated than males except antipsychotic. Among psychotropic drugs, antidepressants (mean: 8.6 times) were refilled more but antipsychotics (mean 188 days) were the long-term treatment drugs. Additionally, the trend of hospital visits fluctuated over the year while May and December showed a higher rate of visits.
   Conclusions: These findings show that the prevalence of psychotropic drug prescriptions in Taiwanese adolescents is even low but increasing trends in the prescription of these medications raises some concern. As the evidence of psychotropic drug safety and effectiveness in adolescents is still inadequate; we recommend that healthcare providers should consider psychotropic drugs therapy, continuously monitor for outcomes and empower their patients to improve their knowledge, therapeutic outcomes and quality of life.

AB Injecting drug users (IDUs) experience numerous health problems, but report barriers to utilising general practitioners (GPs). A nurse-led Harm Minimisation-based Primary Healthcare (HMPH) service for IDUs was established within a needle and syringe program in inner-city Sydney with Area Health Service medical support and clinical governance. This paper aimed to describe the HMPH service, review service utilisation and assess nurses' perceptions of their work with IDUs. A review of the most recent 200 clinic files was undertaken. Service utilisation, GP and other health service use and access were extracted and analysed using SPSS. A semi-structured qualitative interview with clinic nurses regarding their experience working with IDUs and local GPs was conducted and analysed. Since its inception in mid-2006, the service has been utilised by 417 clients. Of the most recent 200 files, blood-borne virus and sexually transmitted infection screening were the primary reason for presentation (64.5%). At least one follow-up visit was attended by 90% of clients. A total of 62% of clients reported consulting a GP in the last 12 months. The service provided 102 referrals. Nurses believed that IDUs tend to utilise GPs ineffectively and that self-care is a low priority, but that they can support IDUs to overcome some barriers to GPs and facilitate access. Targeted primary health care services led by nurses with focussed medical support and co-located with needle and syringe programs can fill an important gap in delivering and facilitating health care to IDUs.

DE farmers; mediating; moderating; stress; work-home interface
ID FAMILY CONFLICT; MENTAL-HEALTH; OUTCOMES; SUICIDE; MODEL
AB Objective:
   This study investigated whether work-home (WHI) or home-work interference (HWI) explained or affected the strength of the relationship between farmers' stresses and reported psychological distress.
   Design:
   Distribution of questionnaire package; included Work-Home Conflict Scale, Farm Stress Survey, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. Participants recruited via advertising in newsletters and newspapers, and distribution through businesses and meetings.
   Participants:
   The majority of farmers (N = 51, male = 45, female = 5) were recruited from the one district. Farmers were individuals who identified their occupation as a farm owner, farm manager, or farm hand.
   Main outcome measures:
   It was predicted farmers would report higher levels of WHI than HWI; time, a determinant of interference, would mediate the relationship between farmers' stresses and psychological distress; WHI and HWI would moderate farmers' stresses and their psychological distress; overall reported level of psychological distress would be in normal to mild range because of positive general economic conditions.
   Results:
   Farmers reported significantly higher levels of WHI than HWI (M = 3.21, M = 2.76, P < 0.001 respectively). WHI and time-based WHI mediated farmers' stresses and psychological distress, particularly anxiety. WHI, time and strain, determinants of WHI mediated personal finances and subcomponents of psychological distress (stress, anxiety, depression). Time-based HWI mediated personal finances and stress. No moderating effects were found for WHI (r = -0.02, P = 0.882) or HWI (r = 0.15, P = 0.306).
   Conclusions:
   Farmers of this specific sample presented a unique work-home interface. Limitations include the small sample size, recruitment methods, and culturally irrelevant measures as well as only assessing work-related stresses. Future research should aim to develop measures appropriate for farmers of Australia.

AB Aims To investigate the role of recent life problems in non-fatal overdose among heroin users entering various drug treatment settings.
   Design Cross-sectional data from a longitudinal study investigating drug treatment effectiveness.
   Setting Five prison drug treatment services, three residential rehabilitation units, three residential detoxification units and 21 community drug treatment services located in rural, urban and inner-city areas of Scotland.
   Participants Of a total of 793 primary heroin users commencing drug treatment during 2001-02, 337 (42.5%) were prison drug service clients; 91 (11.5%) were residential rehabilitation clients; 97 (12.2%) were residential detoxification clients; and 268 (33.8%) were community drug treatment clients.
   Measurements Univariate and stepwise multivariate logistic regression analyses examined associations between overdosing in the 90 days prior to treatment entry and basic demographic characteristics, recent drug use and recent life problems.
   Findings Ninety-one study participants (11.5%) reported at least one overdose and 19 (2.4%) reported more than one overdose in the 90 days prior to treatment entry. A chi(2) test revealed no significant difference in rates of recent overdosing between the four treatment settings (P = 0.650). Recent drug use and recent life problems-but not demographic characteristics-were associated independently with recent overdosing. However, recent life problems were not associated independently with recent overdosing among clients entering prison, clients entering residential rehabilitation or with multiple recent overdosing.
   Conclusions Associations between recent life problems and recent overdose were evident, but varied by treatment setting. Treatment providers should identify and address heroin users' life problems as part of a broad strategy of overdose prevention.

Little is known as to how and why coroners select particular deaths for discretionary inquests.
   Methods: We analyzed the deaths investigated by Australian coroners for a period of seven and one-half years in five jurisdictions. We classified inquests as mandatory or discretionary. After excluding mandatory inquests, we used logistic regression analysis to identify the factors associated with coroners' decisions to hold discretionary inquests.
   Results: Of 20 379 reported deaths due to external causes, 1252 (6.1%) proceeded to inquest. Of these inquests, 490 (39.1%) were mandatory and 696 (55.6%) were discretionary. In unadjusted analyses, the rates of discretionary inquests varied widely in terms of age of the decedent and cause of death. In adjusted analyses, the odds of discretionary inquests declined with the age of the decedent; the odds were highest for children (odds ratio [OR] 2.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.54-3.06) and lowest for people aged 65 years and older (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.28-0.51). Using poisoning as a reference cause of death, the odds of discretionary inquests were highest for fatal complications of medical care (OR 12.83, 95% CI 8.65-19.04) and lowest for suicides (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.30-0.65).
   Interpretation: Deaths that coroners choose to take to inquest differ systematically from those they do not. Although this vetting pro cess is invisible, it may influence the public's understanding of safety risks, fatal injury and death.

AB Aim: Japanese psychiatrists have increasingly reported patients with depression that does not seem to fit the criteria of the ICD-10 and the DSM-IV, and which has recently been called modern type depression (MTD). We explored whether MTD is frequently seen in Japan and also in other countries, and if so, how patients with MTD are diagnosed and treated.
   Methods: The questionnaires, with two case vignettes (traditional type depression (TTD) and MTD), were sent to psychiatrists in Australia, Bangladesh, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the USA. Participants rated their opinions about each case's prevalence in their country, etiology, diagnosis, suicide risk, and treatment using Likert scales.
   Results: Out of 247 responses (123 from Japan and 124 from other countries), two hundred thirty-nine valid responses were received. MTD was recognized in all participating countries, and especially in urban areas. Generally, the factor of personality was regarded as the most probable cause of MTD. Whereas about 90% of Japanese psychiatrists applied the ICD/DSM criteria to TTD, only about 60% applied the criteria to MID.
   Conclusion: Our results indicate that Japan's MID seems to be occurring in many other countries, and that the present ICD/DSM criteria may not be sufficient to diagnose MID. Therefore, it could be an important candidate for a new international diagnostic criterion as a subtype of depression. A clear diagnostic framework and consensus on the interventions to treat MID would be valuable. Further clinical, psychopathological and international epidemiological studies are needed to confirm our preliminary findings of MID. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Relative toxicity of venlafaxine and selective serotonin reuptake
   inhibitors in overdose compared to tricyclic antidepressants
SO QJM-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICINE

DT Article

AB Background: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and venlafaxine have been regarded as less toxic in overdose than tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Within the TCAs, dothiepin has greater toxicity. Venlafaxine may be more toxic than SSRIs.
   Aim: To assess the toxicity in overdose of venlafaxine and SSRIs compared to TCAs, and of dothiepin compared to other TCAs.
   Design: Cohort study of prospectively collected data from the Hunter area, NSW, Australia.
   Methods: First admissions with antidepressant deliberate self-poisoning (DSP) (November 1994 to April 2000) were identified; the presence of seizures, life-threatening arrhythmias, coma, serotonin toxicity or ICU admission, and QRS duration were noted.
   Results: There were 538 admissions, with no deaths. The odds ratio (OR) for seizures with dothiepin vs. other TCAs was 3.4 (95%CI 1.2-9.9). Seizures occurred in 7/51 (14%) venlafaxine overdoses; all patients with seizures consumed greater than or equal to900 mg. The OR for seizures vs. TCAs was 4.4 (95%CI 1.4-13.8). Coma was less likely with venlafaxine and SSRIs. SSRIs, but not venlafaxine, were less likely to prolong the QRS to greater than or equal to100 ms. ICU admission was less likely for SSRIs. Serotonin toxicity was much more common with venlafaxine and SSRIs.
   Discussion: Venlafaxine and dothiepin are pro-convulsant in overdose. Venlafaxine is more likely to cause serotonin toxicity, but less likely to cause coma than TCAs. SSRIs are less likely to cause coma, require ICU admission, or prolong the QRS, but are more likely to cause serotonin toxicity. Antidepressants other than TCAs or venlafaxine should be considered in patients at risk of seizure or suicide.

AB BackgroundUnilateral do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders (against patient/family wishes) have been ethically justified in cases of medical futility. We investigated whether electrophysiology practitioners believe medical futility justifies unilateral implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) deactivation.
   Methods and ResultsEmail invitations to take an online survey were sent to 1,894 electrophysiology practitioners. A total of 384 responses were collected (response rate 20.6%). Though the sample included respondents from Europe, Asia, Australia, South America, and Africa, the majority were from North America (78%), were academically affiliated (64%), and practiced in an urban setting (67.8%). Deactivation of ICD shock function in agreement with patient wishes and a preexisting DNR were not considered physician-assisted suicide (93.2%, 358/384). However, a majority of the sample responded that it was not ethical/moral for doctors to deactivate ICDs against patients' wishes (77.1%, 296/384) or against family/surrogates' wishes (72.4%, 278/384), even in the context of medical futility. A majority indicated that deactivating ICD shock function is not ethically/morally different than withholding cardiopulmonary resuscitation or external defibrillation in a code (72.7%, 277/381), but was different than deactivating pacing in a pacemaker-dependent patient (82.8%, 318/384). In the classification of interventions, a plurality (43.0%, 165/383) regarded ICDs to be unlike any other intervention. Concerning pacemakers, 50% (191/382) considered them to be like dialysis (a therapy that keeps patients alive).
   ConclusionsThis international sample of electrophysiology practitioners considered ICD and pacemaker deactivation to be ethically distinct. While ICD deactivation was considered appropriate in the setting of patient/family agreement, unilateral deactivation was not.

AB Background: Job loss is a discrete life event, with multiple adverse consequences for physical and mental health and implications for agency. Our research explores the consequences of job loss for retrenched workers' mental health by examining the interplay between their agency and the structures shaping their job loss experiences.
   Methods: We conducted two waves of in-depth, semi-structured interviews with a sample of 33 of the more than 1000 workers who lost their jobs at Mitsubishi Motors in South Australia during 2004 and 2005 as a result of industry restructuring. Interviews capturing the mental health consequences of job loss were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was employed to determine the health consequences of the job loss and the impact of structural factors.
   Results: Main themes that emerged from the qualitative exploration of the psychological distress of job loss included stress, changes to perceived control, loss of self-esteem, shame and loss of status, experiencing a grieving process, and financial strain. Drawing on two models of agency we identified the different ways workers employed their agency, and how their agency was enabled, but mainly constrained, when dealing with job loss consequences.
   Conclusions: Respondents' accounts support the literature on the moderating effects of economic resources such as redundancy packages. The results suggest the need for policies to put more focus on social, emotional and financial investment to mediate the structural constraints of job loss. Our study also suggests that human agency must be understood within an individual's whole of life circumstances, including structural and material constraints, and the personal or interior factors that shape these circumstances.

AB The present study examines reasons for adolescent deliberate self-harm. A cross-sectional survey using an anonymous self-report questionnaire was carried out in seven countries (Australia, Belgium, England, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands and Norway). Data on 30,477 school pupils between the ages of 14-17 were analysed. Past year and lifetime deliberate self-harm were assessed, along with the self-reported reasons for deliberate self-harm. The results showed that 'wanted to get relief from a terrible state of mind' and 'wanted to die' were most commonly reported. Principal component analysis indicated two underlying dimensions in the reasons for deliberate self-harm, i.e. a cry of pain motive and/or a cry for help motive. The majority of self-harmers reported at least one cry of pain motive ('to die', 'to punish myself', and 'to get relief from a terrible state of mind') and an additional cry for help motive ('to show how desperate I was feeling', to frighten someone', 'to get my own back on someone', 'to find out whether someone really loved me', and 'to get some attention'). Females reported more reasons than males. Only females showed an age difference, with girls aged 16-17 more frequently reporting a cry for help motive. There was considerable consistency in choice of motives across countries and genders. Systematic assessment of the reasons for deliberate self-harm can help clinicians to better understand the meaning of self harming behaviour, select appropriate treatment, suggest alternative coping strategies, and hopefully prevent future suicidal behaviour.

AB There has been a recent increase in public and professional concern about the prescription of strong prescription opioids for pain. Despite this concern, research to date has been limited because of a number of factors such as small sample sizes, exclusion of people with complex comorbidities, and studies of short duration. The Pain and Opioids IN Treatment is a 2-year prospective cohort study of 1500 people prescribed with pharmaceutical opioids for their chronic pain. This article provides an overview of the demographic and clinical characteristics of the cohort using the baseline data of 1514 community-based people across Australia. Participants had been in pain for a period of 10 years and had been on prescription opioids for-approximately 4 years. One in 10 was on a daily morphine equivalent dose of >= 200 mg. Employment and income levels were low, and two-thirds of the sample reported that their pain had impacted on their employment status. Approximately 50% screened positive for current moderate-to-severe depression, and 1 in 5 had made a lifetime suicide attempt. There were a number of age-related differences. The younger groups experienced higher levels of pain and pain interference, more mental health and substance use issues, and barriers to treatment, compared with the older group. This study found that the people who have been prescribed strong opioids for chronic pain have very complex demographic and clinical profiles. Major age-related differences in the experiences of pain, coping, mental health, and substance use suggest the necessity of differential approaches to treatment.

   RISK; AVAILABILITY; EXPERIENCE; PREVENTION; SUICIDE
AB Because of the inconvenience and longer time required to punch out the tablets, strip packaging may reduce the number of tablets that can be readily swallowed by adults with self-poisonings. In fact, hospital-based studies of paracetamol poisoning in the U.K. and Hong Kong have shown that blister packs were associated with fewer tablets being ingested and large overdoses were mostly from loose preparations. In Australia, following the change in packaging for carbamazepine from bottles of tablets to blister packs, a marked decrease in the reported number of tablets ingested by patients was seen.
   Reducing the maximum number of tablets that can be available in individual preparations or prescriptions may also reduce the likelihood of severe poisonings. In France, but not in the UK, the content of each pack of paracetamol has been legally limited to 8 g. This was thought to be one reason why severe liver damage and deaths after paracetamol poisonings are less common in France than in the UK. Medicated oils containing methyl salicylate pose the threat of rapid-onset, severe salicylate poisoning if swallowed. To reduce the amount of methyl salicylate that can be readily swallowed, the methyl salicylate content and the size of the bottle and its opening should be restricted.
   In adults with Dettol poisoning, serious complications such as pulmonary aspiration are more likely if a large amount is ingested. Similarly, the risk may be reduced by restricting the size of bottle and its opening.

AB Background: Assessing factors associated with non-fatal overdose is important as these could be useful to identify individuals with substance use disorders at high risk of adverse outcomes and consequences. Depression may play an important role in terms of overdose risk. We aimed to test if drug users suffering from a depressive disorder might have significantly higher risk of non-fatal overdose as compared with drug users without depression.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed, Embase and Web of Knowledge were searched. The pooled analyses were based on prevalence rates, risk difference (RD) and odds ratio (OR), reporting 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The combined estimates were obtained weighting each study according to random effects model for meta-analysis.
   Results: Seven articles, involving 12,019 individuals, and run in the US, Canada, Sweden, Norway, and Australia, were included. Pooled analyses comparing depressed with not depressed individuals highlighted a RD (95% CIs) for non-fatal overdose of 7.3% (4.8-9.7%) and an OR (95% CIs) of 1.45 (1.17-1.79). The subgroups analyses based on specific characteristics of included studies confirmed the association between depression and overdose.
   Conclusions: Depressive disorders seem to be important factors associated to the risk of-non-fatal overdose. Longitudinal studies might appropriately clarify causal inference issues. Future research should address the role of depressive disorders as predictors of subsequent non-fatal overdoses. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Despite dramatic increases in the rate of fatal accidental overdose in recent years, risk factors for this outcome remain poorly understood, particularly in clinical populations. The authors examined the association of psychiatric and substance use diagnoses with death from accidental overdose.
   Method: The study followed a cohort of patients from 2000 to 2006. The cohort included all patients treated in Veterans Health Administration facilities during fiscal year 1999 who were alive at the start of fiscal year 2000 (N=3,291,891). Death by accidental overdose was determined using National Death Index records and defined as a death with underlying cause of death coded to ICD-10 codes X40-X45 (N=4,485). Diagnoses were determined by patient medical records.
   Results: Adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics, hazard ratios of death by accidental overdose associated with prior psychiatric and substance use disorder diagnoses ranged from 1.8 to 8.8. Significant associations of non-substance-related psychiatric disorders with risk of death by accidental overdose persisted after additional adjustment for substance use disorders (hazard ratios from 1.2 to 1.8). Depressive disorders and anxiety disorders other than posttraumatic stress disorder had stronger associations with risk of medication-related overdose death (hazard ratios, 3.02 and 3.07, respectively) than with risk of overdose death related to alcohol or illegal drugs (hazard ratios, 1.89 and 1.23, respectively).
   Conclusions: Among patients receiving care from the Veterans Health Administration, death from accidental overdose was found to be associated with psychiatric and substance use disorders. The study findings suggest the importance of risk assessment and overdose prevention for vulnerable clinical subpopulations.

AB Objectives. 1) To investigate ECG changes following co-proxamol (paracetamol 325 mg and dextropropoxyphene 32.5 mg) overdose in comparison to co-codamol (paracetamol and codeine) or co-dydramol (paracetamol and dihydrocodeine) in a prospective study. 2) To examine the relationship between estimated dextropropoxyphene dose and ECG changes in a larger patient population. Background. Co-proxamol is a common cause of drug-induced death and hospital admission in the United Kingdom. ECG changes following dextropropoxyphene have been reported in animals and man, including QRS prolongation. Methods. The prospective study was conducted on 15 patients and controls with overdose. A retrospective study of a cohort of 159 co-proxamol overdoses from a combined data set from Edinburgh and Newcastle, Australia was also conducted. The measured or estimated "four hour" plasma paracetamol level was used as a surrogate of the amount of dextropropoxyphene ingested. Results. In the prospective study co-proxamol overdose caused statistically significant QRS prolongation (mean [95% CII 99.36 [96.19, 102.53] msec), compared to the other combination opioid-paracetamol products (82.84 [80.81, 84.88] msec) but no effect on PR or QTc. QRS duration increase was evident soon after exposure and remained prolonged and stable over the following 24 h. In the retrospective cohort study a dose dependency of effect on QRS was documented, although the correlation coefficient relating paracetamol level to effect was relatively weak (r=0.338, Sig. [2-tailed] 0.003, n=74). Conclusions. QRS is significantly prolonged in co-proxamol overdose, and this prolongation is dose dependent. These findings have clinical relevance to the management of patients with coproxamol poisoning.
