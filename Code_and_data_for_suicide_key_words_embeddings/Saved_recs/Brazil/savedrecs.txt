AB CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: The World Health Organization recognizes suicide as a public health priority. Increased knowledge of suicide risk factors is needed in order to be able to adopt effective prevention strategies. The aim of this study was to analyze and compare the association between the Gini coefficient (which is used to measure inequality) and suicide death rates over a 14-year period (2000-2013) in Brazil and in the United States (US). The hypothesis put forward was that reduction of income inequality is accompanied by reduction of suicide rates.
   DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive cross-sectional time-series study in Brazil and in the US.
   METHODS: Population, death and suicide death data were extracted from the DATASUS database in Brazil and from the National Center for Health Statistics in the US. Gini coefficient data were obtained from the World Development Indicators. Time series analysis was performed on Brazilian and American official data regarding the number of deaths caused by suicide between 2000 and 2013 and the Gini coefficients of the two countries. The suicide trends were examined and compared.
   RESULTS: Brazil and the US present converging Gini coefficients, mainly due to reduction of inequality in Brazil over the last decade. However, suicide rates are not converging as hypothesized, but are in fact rising in both countries.
   CONCLUSION: The hypothesis that reduction of income inequality is accompanied by reduction of suicide rates was not verified.

AB Several studies have confirmed seasonal variation in suicide rates according to hours of sunshine. The suicide pattern was assessed in Sao Paulo, southeastern Brazil, at the tropic of Capricorn from 1996 to 2004. Poisson regression was employed to estimate parameters of seasonality, as well as to verify associations for each day between daylight duration and suicide. During the nine-year study period, there were 3,984 suicides (76.9% in men; median age=38.7 years old). Seasonal averages of suicides were similar, as were monthly averages. Poisson regression did not reveal any association between suicide rates and hours of sunshine (p=0.45) for both sexes. In conclusion, no seasonal pattern was observed for suicides.

AB Objective. To describe suicide rates by county size in the five geopolitical areas of Brazil.
   Methods. This was an ecological, descriptive study of suicide deaths in Brazil that occurred among the population 10 years of age and older in 2004-2010. Data were obtained from the National Mortality Information System of Brazil. Counties were defined by size as: very large (200 000+), large (< 200 000-100 000), medium (< 100 000-50 000), small (< 50 000-20 000), very small (< 20 000-10 000, and micro (< 10 000). Age-adjusted suicide rates were calculated for all counties and for population-size groups in each geopolitical area. Rate ratio and 95% confidence interval were used to compare suicide risk between groups and the reference.
   Results. The national, average suicide mortality rate was 5.7 deaths/100 000 inhabitants. Except in the North and North-East, suicide mortality rates increased from the very large (> 200 000) to the micro counties (< 10 000 population). Very high rates were scattered in the North and Mid-West among the indigenous peoples (> 30 deaths per 100 000). At highest risk were micro counties in the South (13.6 deaths per 100 000), with elderly males (60+ years, 31.4) and males 40-59 years (31.3) being the sex/age group with the highest rates.
   Conclusions. To reduce suicide mortality in Brazil, public health authorities must support mental health training in small cities and multi-professional interventions among the indigenous peoples. In addition, the causes behind underreporting of suicide deaths must be resolved in several areas.

TI Impact of Income Inequality and Other Social Determinants on Suicide
   Rate in Brazil
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH; MORTALITY; AREAS; PANEL
AB Studies about suicide worldwide have mainly focused on individual-level psychiatric risk factors. In Brazil, suicide is an important public health problem. Brazil has evidenced important socioeconomic changes over the last decades, leading to decreasing income inequality. However, the impact of income inequality on suicide rate has never been studied in the country.
   Purpose
   To analyze whether income inequality and other social determinants are associated with suicide rate in Brazil.
   Method
   This study used panel data from all 5,507 Brazilian municipalities from 2000 to 2011. Suicide rates were calculated by sex and standardized by age for each municipality and year. The independent variables of the regression model included the Gini Index, per capita income, percentage of individuals with up to eight years of education, urbanization, average number of residents per household, percentage of divorced people, of Catholics, Pentecostals, and Evangelicals. A multivariable negative binomial regression for panel data with fixed-effects specification was performed.
   Results
   The Gini index was positively associated with suicide rates; the rate ratio (RR) was 1.055 (95% CI: 1.011-1.101). Of the other social determinants, income had a significant negative association with suicide rates (RR: 0.968, 95% CI: 0.948-0.988), whereas a low-level education had a positive association (RR: 1.015, 95% CI: 1.010-1.021).
   Conclusions
   Income inequality represents a community-level risk factor for suicide rates in Brazil. The decrease in income inequality, increase in income per capita, and decrease in the percentage of individuals who did not complete basic studies may have counteracted the increase in suicides in the last decade. Other changes, such as the decrease in the mean residents per household, may have contributed to their increase. Therefore, the implementation of social policies that may improve the population's socioeconomic conditions and reduce income inequality in Brazil, and in other low and middle-income countries, can help to reduce suicide rates.

AB Background: Attempted suicide is the main predictor of suicide constituting a major public health issue worldwide. It is estimated that for every completed suicide, 10 to 20 suicide attempts occur. Important part of the occurrences of suicide attempts in Brazil are registered in the hospital information system for coverage of more than 70 % allows to evaluate the extent of this problem in the country. The scope of this article is to analyse hospitalizations resulting from suicide attempts at public hospitals or services contracted out by the public health system (SUS) in Brazil from 1998 to 2014.
   Methods: This is an ecological study of secondary morbidity data obtained from the Hospital Information System. The overall rate of suicide attempts per 100 000 (105) individuals and rates stratified by age group and sex were calculated. To measure trends, simple linear regression coefficients were calculated. The hospital mortality rate was calculated per 100 individuals.
   Results: The overall rate of hospitalization decreased from 1998 to 2014. The young and adult age groups had the highest hospitalization rates. Men were admitted more and the elderly had higher hospital mortality rates. The main cause of hospitalization was poisoning, accounting for 70.4 % of hospitalizations. Among the people who used poisoning by non-medical drugs as the method of attempted suicide, 58 178 (69.6 %) were men and 49 585 people who are poisoned by medical drugs (60.1 %) were women.
   Conclusions: Although hospitalization rates for attempted suicide have declined in Brazil, it remains a serious public health problem. Because a suicide attempt is the main predictor of suicide, studies to identify those most vulnerable to attempted suicide will help in the development of prevention strategies for mental health.

AB Background: In light of the few reports from intertropical latitudes and their conflicting results, we aimed to replicate and update the investigation of seasonal patterns of suicide occurrences in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: Data relating to male and female suicides were extracted from the Mortality Information Enhancement Program (PRO-AIM), the official health statistics of the municipality of Sao Paulo. Seasonality was assessed by studying distribution of suicides over time using cosinor analyses. Results: There were 6,916 registered suicides (76.7% men), with an average of 39.0 +/- 7.0 observed suicides per month. For the total sample and for both sexes, cosinor analysis estimated a significant seasonal pattern. For the total sample and for males suicide peaked in November (late spring) with a trough in May-June (late autumn). For females, the estimated peak occurred in January, and the trough in June-July. Conclusions: A seasonal pattern of suicides was found for both males and females, peaking in spring/summer and dipping in fall/winter. The scarcity of reports from intertropical latitudes warrants promoting more studies in this area.

AB Objective: To perform a spatial analysis of suicide mortality and its correlation with socioeconomic indicators in Brazilian municipalities.
   Methods: This is an ecological study with Brazilian municipalities as a unit of analysis. Data on deaths from suicide and contextual variables were analyzed. The spatial distribution, intensity and significance of the clusters were analyzed with the global Moran index, MoranMap and local indicators of spatial association (LISA), seeking to identify patterns through geostatistical analysis.
   Results: A total of 50,664 deaths from suicide were registered in Brazil between 2010 and 2014. The average suicide mortality rate in Brazil was 5.23/100,000 population. The Brazilian municipalities presenting the highest rates were Taipas do Tocantins, state of Tocantins (79.68 deaths per 100,000 population), Itapora, state of Mato Grosso do Sul (75.15 deaths per 100,000 population), Mampituba, state of Rio Grande do Sul (52.98 deaths per 100,000 population), Paranhos, state of Mato Grosso do Sul (52.41 deaths per 100,000 population), and Monjolos, state of Minas Gerais (52.08 deaths per 100,000 population). Although weak spatial autocorrelation was observed for suicide mortality (I = 0.2608), there was a formation of clusters in the South. In the bivariate spatial and classical analysis, no correlation was observed between suicide mortality and contextual variables.
   Conclusion: Suicide mortality in Brazil presents a weak spatial correlation and low or no spatial relationship with socioeconomic factors.

AB Suicide is one of the main causes of violent death worldwide, and has become a public health issue. Since alcohol consumption is associated with the increase in the number of suicides and hanging is one of the main methods used worldwide, the present study consists of an epidemiological analysis of BACs in victims of suicide by hanging autopsied in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The objective of the present work was to establish an epidemiological profile and evaluate blood alcohol concentrations in victims of suicide by hanging in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, in the year of 2007. A cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted by collection of secondary data from autopsy reports of victims of hanging. According to the present study, positive results for alcohol were higher in male victims, but the mean BAC was higher in women. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine.

AB Background: In a classical study, Durkheim noted a direct relation between suicide rates and wealth in the XIX century France. Since that time, several studies have verified this relationship. It is known that suicide rates are associated with income, although the direction of this association varies worldwide. Brazil presents a heterogeneous distribution of income and suicide across its territory; however, evaluation for an association between these variables has shown mixed results. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between suicide rates and income in Brazil, State of Sao Paulo (SP), and City of SP, considering geographical area and temporal trends.
   Methods: Data were extracted from the National and State official statistics departments. Three socioeconomic areas were considered according to income, from the wealthiest (area 1) to the poorest (area 3). We also considered three regions: country-wide (27 Brazilian States and 558 Brazilian micro-regions), state-wide (645 counties of SP State), and city-wide (96 districts of SP city). Relative risks (RR) were calculated among areas 1, 2, and 3 for all regions, in a cross-sectional approach. Then, we used Joinpoint analysis to explore the temporal trends of suicide rates and SaTScan to investigate geographical clusters of high/low suicide rates across the territory.
   Results: Suicide rates in Brazil, the State of SP, and the city of SP were 6.2, 6.6, and 5.4 per 100,000, respectively. Taking suicide rates of the poorest area (3) as reference, the RR for the wealthiest area was 1.64, 0.88, and 1.65 for Brazil, State of SP, and city of SP, respectively (p for trend <0.05 for all analyses). Spatial cluster of high suicide rates were identified at Brazilian southern (RR = 2.37), state of SP western (RR = 1.32), and city of SP central (RR = 1.65) regions. A direct association between income and suicide were found for Brazil (OR = 2.59) and the city of SP (OR = 1.07), and an inverse association for the state of SP (OR = 0.49).
   Conclusions: Temporospatial analyses revealed higher suicide rates in wealthier areas in Brazil and the city of SP and in poorer areas in the State of SP. We further discuss the role of socioeconomic characteristics for explaining these discrepancies and the importance of our findings in public health policies. Similar studies in other Brazilian States and developing countries are warranted.

AB This study aimed to estimate the lifetime prevalence rates for suicidal ideation, suicide plans, and attempted suicide, based on a cluster sample of 515 residents of Campinas, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The Multisite Intervention Study on Suicidal Behavior interview was performed, and lifetime prevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated. Lifetime prevalence rates were 17.1% (95%CI: 12.9-21.2) for suicidal ideation, 4.8% (95%CI: 2.8-6.8) for suicide plans, and 2.8% (95%CI: 0.09-4.6) for attempted suicide. Suicidal behavior was more frequent among women and young adults. The suicide plan/attempt ratio was approximately 5:3. Only one-third of those who attempted suicide contacted a health service following the attempt. Prevalence rates for suicidal behavior were similar to most studies from other countries. Suicide prevention strategies should take data from community-based studies into account.

We chose to use an exploratory review of the literature, in the respective Scielo database (Scientific Electronic Library Online), using only published articles in Portuguese language of the last 10 (ten) years. Based on this research, it is concluded from official data that there is evidence of suicidal cases among elderly people of both genders in all regions of the country, and it was found that moving attention to the situation on<bold> </bold>suicide in Brazil is essential. When related to the gerontological public, it reveals the incidence of the suicidal act as a life-threatening act, not restricted to a standard public and a public health case that develops under multiple factors, which when understood increase the effectiveness of measures of preventing the psychological impact of the suicide act on those around them.

AB Objectives: To analyze time trends of suicide rates in Brazil overall and in Brazilian states and compare the estimated suicide rates projected for 2020 with the World Health Organization (WHO) Mental Health Action Plan target.
   Methods: This was an ecological time-series study from 1997 to 2015, stratified by Brazilian states, specific age groups, and sex. Data were obtained from the Mortality Information System (Sistema de Informacties sobre Mortalidade [SIM]) of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Polynomial regression models were used to analyze the trends in suicide rates and to project suicide rates for 2020.
   Results: Considering 224 units of analysis, 21 (9.4%) showed a decreasing trend, 108 (48.2%) were stable, and 95 (42.4%) showed an increasing trend. Thus, 67% of units of analysis will not meet the WHO target in 2020. Mean suicide rates were higher in males than in females. People aged 60 years and older presented the highest suicide rates, while 84.7% of total deaths by suicide occurred among 15-to-59-year-olds.
   Conclusion: Overall, 90.6% of units of analysis had a stable or increasing trend in suicide rates from 1997 to 2015. If these trends remain, most of Brazil will fail to achieve the WHO-recommended reduction in suicide rates by 2020.

AB Background: Suicide is known to be the leading cause of death among police officers (PO) worldwide. However, most studies were conducted in developed countries, with no data from Brazil. The present study aimed to evaluate the incidence and the sociodemographic profile of suicide among a military PO subpopulation in South Brazil.
   Methods: This retrospective cohort evaluated 31,110 military PO with available data on cause of death from 2006 to 2016. Participants were monitored for an average of 18.8 +/- 9.6 years following the date of entry into the military police.
   Results: Mean age at the end of the follow up time was 41.4 +/- 9.1 years, with 90.7% males. A total of 650 participants died (2.1%), with 43 suicides (6.6% of all deaths) - cumulative incidence of 138/100,000. Bivariate analysis revealed a significant association (p < 0.05) between suicide and age (HR = 0.70, 95%Cl = 0.66-0.74), females (HR = 1.67, 95%Cl = 1.08-2.60) and enlisted military rank (HR = 14.9, 95%Cl = 2.05-108.5). Multivariate models showed an independent association between suicide and age (HR = 0.71, 95%Cl = 0.67-0.74) and enlisted military rank (HR = 9.96, 95%Cl = 130-763).
   Conclusions: The incidence of suicide among military PO in South Brazil was high, compared to the national suicide rate. Younger age and lower military rank were independent predictors of suicide in this subpopulation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB As suicide rates have increased in rural areas in Brazil, it was postulated that pesticide exposure may play a role in this phenomenon. Our study compared the suicide mortality rates observed among agricultural workers from a pesticide-intensive area in Brazil to the suicide mortality frequency noted in three reference populations. In addition, hospitalization rates attributed to suicide attempts and mood disorders including depression in residents of the same agricultural area were compared to two reference populations. Finally, data on pesticide sales per agricultural worker were obtained for each city of Rio de Janeiro State and suicide mortality risk was then calculated according to the quartiles of pesticide sales per agricultural workers, using the first quartile as reference. Agricultural workers were at greater risk for lethality due to suicide when compared to all three reference populations. In addition, residents of the same study area showed higher hospitalization rates by suicide attempts and mood disorders than observed in comparison populations. Results also showed that the risk of death by suicide was significantly higher among agricultural workers who lived in areas of Rio de Janeiro State displaying higher rates of pesticide expenditure per agricultural worker. These results suggest that pesticide exposure may indeed increase the risk of suicide frequency, especially among agricultural workers.

AB The article analyzes two high profile initiatives related to suicide prevention in Brazil, based on documents produced by their responsible and released by the media. It discusses the medicalization in suicide approach regarding the "Yellow September" campaign and the moralization that underpins the National Policy for the Prevention of Self-Harm and Suicide, related to the conservative concept of family. It notes that such initiatives are articulated as a result of the union of conservative forces in the country. Although they have fundamental contradictions in the way they understand suicide, they have in common the erasure of the social determinants of mental suffering. Finally, it discusses the risks of its implementation in the school context.

AB Objective To describe epidemiological aspects of suicide mortality in a 10-year time series.
   Methods Suicide deaths reported in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil, were put together as historical time series based on data from the Ministry of Health Mortality Reporting System for the period 1980 to 1999. Suicides were grouped according to the WHO criteria and analyzed using standard demographic variables.
   Results Suicide rates (proportional mortaliry and mortality rates) in RS during the study period were the highest in Brazil. The standardized rates grew from around 9 per 100,000 in the 1980s to 11 per 100,000 in 1999. This increase in mortality was attributed mainly to male mortality rates that grew from 14 per 100,000 to the current 20 per 100,000. The male:female ratio increased from 3 to 5. The highest ratios were seen among the elderly although this ratio has been increasing in voting adults as well. Widows, widowers and farmers/fishers had the highest mortality rates.
   Conclusions The study highlights suicide as a collective health problem in RS and shows aspects that could contribute to preventive action.

AB This essay article examines suicide among young people in Brazil on the basis of Durkheim's classical approaches as revisited in current discussions of social integration networks. It presents arguments regarding the behaviour of suicide mortality rates in the light of classical public health assumptions as to social causality in processes of health and illness. The mortality rates, updated in line with international statistics, review of data in Brazilian studies and recent series for Brazil, reveal suicide "aptitudes" by age, sex and social group. The linear and non-linear nature of the trends are treated in the context of pathways in complex social systems. Current data were prospected in the Ministry of Health's National Mortality Information System and World Health Organisation databases. In this policy analysis study, a conceptual outline was built up from classical theory updated to the present-day context, analysis of data relevant to the study object and observation of target groups for comprehensive, inclusive policies. The results of this analysis reveal that adolescents and young people are highly liable to growing, sustained, high-impact vulnerability to suicide.

DT Article
AB This article argues that Durkheim's theory of suicide is deficient because of its monocausal reasoning, its conception of suicide as an action without subjects, and its characterization of preliterate societies as harmonious, self-contained, and morphologically static. It shows that these deficiencies can be overcome by including cultural and social-psychological considerations in the analysis of suicide-specifically by including culture as a causal force in its own right and drawing links between social circumstances, cultural beliefs and values, and individual dispositions. The authors make their case by analyzing ethnographic and quantitative data on the preliterate Guarani-Kaiowa of southwestern Brazil, one of the most suicide-prone groups in the world.

AB The objective was to evaluate correlations between suicide, homicide and socio-demographic variables by an ecological study. Mortality and socio-demographic data were collected from official records of the Ministry of Health and IBGE (2010), aggregated by state (27). The data were analyzed using correlation techniques, factor analysis, principal component analysis with a varimax rotation and multiple linear regression. Suicide age-adjusted rates for the total population, men and women were 5.0, 8.0, and 2.2 per 100,000 inhabitants respectively. The suicide rates ranged from 2.7 in Para to 9.1 in Rio Grande do Sul. Homicide for the total population, men and women were 27.2, 50.8, and 4.5 per 100,000, respectively. The homicide rates ranged from 13.0 in Santa Catarina to 68.9 in Alagoas. Suicide and homicide were negatively associated, the significance persisted among men. Unemployment was negatively correlated with suicide and positively with homicide. Different socio-demographic variables were found to correlate with suicide and homicide in the regressions. Suicide showed a pattern suggesting that, in Brazil, it is related to high socioeconomic status. Homicide seemed to follow the pattern found in other countries, associated with lower social and economic status.

AB Excessive alcohol consumption is a serious public health issue, because drunkenness affects critical judgment and self-control which could trigger violent and self-harm behavior, with thus a potential association between alcohol consumption and suicide deaths. The objective of the present study was to assess the association between alcohol consumption and suicide deaths in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, from 2011 to 2015, and its relationship with socio-demographic characteristics of the victims and the circumstances of the suicide. A cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted by collection of data from 1,700 suicide victims subjected to examination of blood alcohol concentration (BAC) from toxicology reports from the Institute of Legal Medicine of the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Alcohol was detected in blood samples of 30.2% of the victims and mean BAC levels were 1.73 +/- 0.08 g/L. The mean age of the victims was 39.90 +/- 0.75 years. The majority of the victims were male (74.6%) and the prevalence of positive BAC was higher amongst men (34.7%) than women (17.1%), p < 0.05. The majority of the victims were white skinned (64.7%), but there was a higher proportion of victims with positive BAC among mulatto and black individuals, p < 0.05. Hanging was the most prevalent suicide method in the sample (48.7%) and amongst men (55.4%), but amongst women it was jumping from a height (35%), p < 0.05.

DE Suicide; Gender; Culture
AB This essay discusses the female suicide from gender relations. We approach the female suicide in two cultures, China and Brazil. From the connections of this event in the male-female cultural interactions emerged different female disqualification strategies that were related to suicide, whether, discursive and behavioral strategies. So, we can consider that female suicide is a social event and intrinsically related to the issue of women's identity in the two cultures.

AB Most of what is known about the seasonal variation in suicide rate originates from studies conducted in the northern hemisphere; very few studies have been done in the southern hemisphere. The purpose of the present study was to explore the possibility that in Brazil, the seasonal variation of suicides is a function of photoperiod. This was accomplished by analyzing monthly suicide data for a 12 yr period (1979 to 1990), within latitudes ranging from 2 degrees N to 33 degrees S. Single cosinor analyses with periods of 12 or 6 months were applied to time series of monthly total and suicidal deaths, separated by gender and state. Significant spring or early summer peaks of suicide were found only in the south of Brazil for both men and women, except for the latter in one state. These peaks did not coincide with those found for total deaths, which occurred in the autumn or winter in all areas. No significant six-month period was found. In the present study, the chance of a suicide was typically 10-17% higher during the peak period than during the other months of the year. Although this moderate seasonal effect might not be sufficient to justify planning large scale prophylactic interventions, those dealing with patients who have suicide ideation should be aware of this high risk time.

AB The aim of this study was to describe suicide time trends in Brazil from 1980 to 2005. The data were obtained from the National Mortality Information System and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). Suicides rates were calculated for the entire period for the country as a whole and the 26 States and Federal District. Annual increases or decreases in mortality rates were also estimated using Prais-Winsten generalized linear regression. The mean suicide rate was 4.12 per 100,000 inhabitants (6.45/100,000 in men and 1.80/100,000 in women). The study showed an increasing suicide trend in men (+1.41% per year, 95% CI: 1.00; 1.23) and a decreasing trend in women (-0.53% per year, 95% CI: -0.04; -1.02). Suicide rates increased with age. In general, for all age groups and for both genders, the highest rates were in Sao Paulo and in the States of the South and Central-West regions.

AB Objective: To characterize the profile of suicide attempts treated at an emergency department in the municipality of Arapiraca, state of Alagoas, Brazil, from 2009 to 2012.
   Methods: We analyzed all emergency department records containing a diagnosis of suicide attempt. Data were evaluated using Student's t test and Pearson's chi-square test. Significance was accepted at p<0.05.
   Results: We identified 2,142 cases. Suicide attempts were more frequent among women and young adults, but deaths were more frequent among men. Suicide attempts were most frequent among patients aged 10 to 39 years (81.1%). Drug intoxication (65.0%) and non-drug poisoning (16.2%) were significantly more prevalent than other methods of suicide. The month of April (10.6%) accounted for the greatest number of cases, and July had the smallest number (5.5%). Suicide attempts were most prevalent in spring (28.3%), on Sundays (18.4%) and Saturdays (16.8%), and from 12: 00 p.m. to 5: 59 p.m.
   Conclusion: Suicide prevention measures should focus on young women. Further research into the care provided to suicide attempters and better monitoring of the sale and use of medicines and poisons could be useful.

DE Aged; Suicide, trends; Mortality

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe mortality from suicide in Brazil, with emphasis on the older adult population.
   METHODS: Temporal analysis and trend analysis by polynomial regression were conducted on suicide in the population above 10 years old in Brazil and the State of Rio de Janeiro (Southeastern Brazil) from 1980-2006. The data were extracted from the Mortality Information System, and the rates calculated by gender and age per 100,000 inhabitants, considering the resident population provided by DATASUS. For the period between 1980 and 1995, the ninth revision of International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems was used, and for 1996 to 2006, the tenth revision.
   RESULTS: Suicide rates significantly increased in Brazil and in Rio de Janeiro (respectively reaching 5.7 and 3.1 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants in 2006). The change was caused by the increase in suicides among the male population at all ages. The increase occurred especially among men over 60 years. In Rio de Janeiro, the increase was not statistically significant among men, while there was a decrease among women. The principal means utilized for suicide by men were hanging, suffocation, strangulation and firearms. For women, death by hanging also ranks first, followed by ingestion of solids or liquids, smoke or fire, and jumping from heights. The high rate of suicide by unspecified means reveals problems with data quality.
   CONCLUSIONS: Suicides are important events in the male population, especially among older men over time. In Rio de Janeiro, the suicide rate is also higher in men, although the difference is not statistically significant. According to the World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health, suicide is preventable, and established interventions exist for each age group.

DE Intoxication; Attempetd Suicide; Suicide; Information Systems

AB Poisoning is one of the three main means used in suicide and suicides attempts. In order to improve the quality of such information, a cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on case records in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 2006 to 2008, in the databases of the Information System on Diseases of Notification (SINAN), the Mortality Information System (SIM), and the Poison Control Center in Niteroi (CCIn-Niteroi). Probabilistic linkage was used to develop a model for monitoring suicides and suicide attempts by poisoning. Although 68.8% of the 948 records at CCIn had been reported by health professionals, only 2.6% were included in the other databases. Linking CCIn and SIM showed 61.3% underreporting. Information is important for surveillance, public policy-making, and decision-making. Probabilistic linkage allowed identifying problems in each system and provided better data quality and a more accurate diagnosis of the real situation in a complex and serious problem like suicidal behavior.

AB PurposeTo evaluate changes in standardized suicide rates in Brazil between 2000 and 2016, stratified by sex and age.MethodsDescriptive analyses of data from the Brazilian Mortality Information System were performed.Results156,292 suicides were registered in the period, with a standardized rate of 4.82/100,000. The risk for males was 3.81 times higher than for females, without meaningful regional variations. This ratio was 8.2 at the 80+ group. An increase from 2000 to 2016 was demonstrated in nearly all subgroups over the 17, especially men aged 20-39 and women aged 40-59.ConclusionsSuicide rates continue to rise in Brazil, especially among young men and middle-aged women. Older men remain exposed to the highest absolute risk.

ID PREVENTION; TRENDS
AB Objective: To describe the characteristics and the raw suicide mortality rates (RSMR) during the period 2000-2007 in the municipality with the largest proportion of self-reported indigenous people in Brazil, Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira (SGC), State of Amazonas. Method: A retrospective descriptive study was carried out using data from the Information Department of the Brazilian Unified Health System (DATASUS). We considered suicide the cause of death coded in the records as voluntary self-Inflicted injuries according to the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision. Results: Forty-four suicide cases were registered in this period. The average RSMR was 16.8 per 100,000 inhabitants (male, 26.6; female, 6.3). The highest rates were observed in the age groups 15-24 years and 25-34 years, with RSMR of 43.1 and 30.2 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively. Most suicides occurred among indigenous people (97.7%), males (81.8%), and unmarried people (70.5%). In most cases, deaths occurred at home (86.4%), during weekends (59.1%) and mainly by hanging (97.7%). Conclusion: Suicide is a significant health and social problem in SGC. The suicide profile observed in this municipality was, as a whole, more similar to that observed in certain indigenous communities than that found in most urban and non-indigenous environments, demonstrating the sociocultural specificity of these events in Brazil.

   one's autonomy
SO REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE DIREITO
LA Portuguese
DT Article
DE Altruistic Manner; Assisted Suicide; Autonomy; Decriminalization; End of
   Life
AB This paper aims to analyse the right to assisted suicide. Assisted suicide consists of ending one's own life, following instructions from a medical doctor, which means the person causes their own death. Autonomy means self-determination, in which the person builds their life according to their own preferences. Based on the respect of one's autonomy, a capable person facing a terminal illness or an untreatable illness, which causes suffering, has the right of choosing death after receiving the necessary orientations by a physician to commit suicide. In Brazil assisted suicide is characterized as a crime of inducement, instigation or assistance to suicide, according to article 122 of the criminal code. Considering that several European countries, five states of the United States of America, Quebec and Colombia allow assisted suicide practiced according to the procedure established by the law, in respect of self-determination and taking into consideration that living is a choice and not an imposition, the practice of assisted suicide in Brazil in an exclusively altruistic manner, could be considered non culpable conduct.

AB Background Recent studies in Brazil have demonstrated that suicide rates have been rising over the last years. The objective of this study was to investigate trends in suicide from 1979 to 1998 in Rio de Janeiro State, with emphasis on age, period, and cohort effects. Method Age-specific suicide rates from 1979 to 1998 were estimated for males and females based on mortality data obtained from the Brazilian Mortality Information System, and population counts from the 1980, 1991 and 2000 censuses. Poisson regression and graphical methods were used to evaluate age, period and cohort effects. Results Suicide rates increased steadily with age, particularly among males. In both males and females, age-adjusted suicide rates decreased until 1992. In 1993, rates started to rise. Cohort effects showed that younger generations had significantly lower rates of suicide than older ones. Conclusion The recent rise in suicide rates might be a result of the increasing levels of firearm availability, drug use, and unemployment. Follow-up over longer periods and powerful epidemiological studies are needed to sustain the implication of socio-economic changes in the observed features.

AB Background: This study compares sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of 102 first-time hospital-treated suicide attempters (first-evers) with a group of 101 repeat suicide attempters (repeaters) consecutively admitted to a general hospital in Brazil, during the intake phase of the WHO Multisite Intervention Study on Suicidal Behaviors (SUPRE-MISS). Aims: To compare sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of first-time hospital-treated suicide attempters (first-evers) with a group of repeat suicide attempters (repeaters). Methods: A standardized interview and psychometric scales were administered to all patients. Results: Repetition was associated with being of female sex ( OR = 2.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2-6.2), a housewife (OR = 3.8; 95% CI = 1.2-11.8), and having a score above median on the Beck Depression Inventory (OR = 5.2; 95% CI = 1.7-15.6). Conclusions: The findings suggest that repeaters, namely, depressed housewives who have attempted suicide previously, need specific treatment strategies in order to avoid future suicide attempts.

DE Suicide; Work; Protestant ethics; German culture
AB Suicide is a serious public health issue with increasing rates. The state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, has a history of high mortality rates, mainly in regions colonized by German populations. The present investigation is a social case study, whose information was obtained through narratives of 14 informers from the health, agriculture, justice, public safety, social communication and education fields. The decisive factors for suicide reported by the informers were the German culture, protestant ethics and suffering at work, which affects family farmers who grow tobacco. The reflections of the interviewees point to suicide as a resource used in the culture of people who descend from German populations to cope with difficulties, which persists as a consequence of the introduction of capitalism in the countryside and the subordination of producers to the tobacco industry.

DE Suicide; Child; Indigenous Population
AB This study aimed to describe the characteristics, distribution, and mortality rates from suicide in indigenous children in Brazil compared to non-indigenous children. This descriptive study covered the years from 2010 to 2014, using national databases. The study collected deaths in individuals 10 to 14 years of age whose underlying cause was "inentional self-inflicted injury". Hanging was the most frequently used means in both indigenous and non-indigenous children, although it was more frequent in the former. Among indigenous children, suicides in hospitals or other healthcare establishments were less common than in non-indigenous. Approximately three-fourths of suicides in indigenous children occurred in just 17 municipalities. The mortality rate from suicide among indigenous children was 11.0/100,000 (8.4-14.3), or 185 times higher (10.9-31.6) than in non-indigenous, which was a 6/ 100,000 (0. 5-0.6), with no differences between boys and girls. This study showed for the first time on a national scale the specific characteristics of suicide in indigenous children, with high rates, and also identified priority areas for interventions.

DE Suicide; Suicide prevention programs; Networks
AB This article focuses on the theme of suicide prevention based on analysis of a work in progress. A case study of the Program for Promotion of Life and Suicide Prevention of Candelaria in the State of Rio Grande do Sul was conducted. It is a Brazilian municipality that has high suicide mortality rates in the general population and among the elderly. The scope of this paper is to present a experience that has proved successful and is based on a local initiative. The data presented here result from participant observation, interviews with the team carrying out the work, discussion groups and document analysis. The following categories were used: line of care, management and evaluation process. The results of intervention show that suicide rates declined from 5 deaths per year (21/100,000 inhabitants) between 1996 and 2000 to 3.6 deaths per year (12/100,000 inhabitants) between 2007 and 2009. The study establishes a dialogue with the experiences of others locations and provides contributions to prevention programs that can be set up in Brazil.

DE Adolescent; suicide; socioeconomic factors; unemployment; inequality

AB Objective: To examine suicide rates among adolescents from six large cities in Brazil and to analyze the relationship between adolescent suicide rates and socioeconomic indicators between 2006 and 2015.
   Methods: Generalized estimating equation models were used to assess the impact of socioeconomic factors - including social inequality and unemployment rates - on adolescent suicide rates.
   Results: The rate of adolescent suicide increased by 24% over the course of the study period. Social inequality (assessed using the Gini index), was positively associated with overall adolescent suicide rates (beta = 10.68; 95%CI = 2.32-19.05; p <= 0.012). After disaggregating the findings by age (10-14 and 15-19 years), social inequality was associated with suicide rate only for adolescents aged 15-19 years (beta = 9.63; 95%CI = 2.31-16.96; p <= 0.005). Disaggregating these findings by sex, the association with economic variables became significant only among females. Males had a higher overall suicide rate than females, and the highest rate was observed in male adolescents aged 15-19 years. Higher levels of unemployment were associated with higher suicide rates.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that socioeconomic indicators, particularly unemployment and social inequality, are relevant social determinants of suicide in adolescence.

ID BEHAVIOR; MEN; AUTOPSIES; PEOPLE
AB This article is based on a multicenter study in Brazil, analyzing 51 cases of suicide in elderly individuals (40 men and 11 women) based on psychosocial autopsies. A more in-depth study was conducted on the 11 cases in women. Data interpretation was based on classical authors and the recent national and international literature on the phenomenon. Women's motives for committing suicide differed partially from those of men. Like men, women committed suicide mainly by hanging themselves, and their suicide was frequently associated with degenerative illnesses and comorbidities. The main differences were due to cultural gender issues. The results agree largely with the literature and show that in Brazil the main factors associated with suicide in women are: gender and intra-family violence, suffering due to loss of significant others and the traditional role of wife and mother, and depression. The study highlights the importance of greater attention to the cumulative effect of problems with aging in women, especially those related to gender specificities.

AB In this study, we described the frequency of attempted suicide among women of reproductive age (10 to 49 years) in a General University Hospital in Ribeirao Preto, Brazil (conducted 2005). Relevant comorbidities associated with the suicide attempt were calculated. Secondary data were obtained through the hospital's records where attempted suicides were reported. Findings revealed 132 attempted suicides; most women took a toxic substance or their own medication. Half of the women previously had attempted suicide. Depression was the most frequent psychiatric diagnosis on discharge from the hospital, specifically borderline personality disorder, personality disorders axis B and depression without association.

AB Objective: to describe sociodemographic aspects and time evolution of mortality due to suicide among elderly individuals in Bahia State, Brazil, from 1996 to 2013. Methods: time series descriptive and ecological study, with data from the Mortality Information System (SIM); Prais-Winsten regression was used for trend analysis and to calculate annual percent change (APC). Results: 858 deaths due to suicide were identified in elderly in Bahia; 85.4% were men, and 53.8% were in the 60-69 age group; 64.3% of deaths resulted from hanging/strangulation, followed by self-poisoning by pesticides and chemical products (13.1%); there was an increasing trend in suicide mortality rate in the general elderly population (APC 11.0; 95% CI 6.9; 15.3) and in the male sex (APC 12.1; 95% CI 7.1; 17.3), whilst in the female population it remained stable. Conclusion: in Bahia, mortality due to suicide among elderly individuals presented an increasing trend in the period studied and was higher among males.

DE Suicide; Suicide of the elderly; Suicide of elderly men; Masculinities
ID MORTALITY; PEOPLE; GENDER
AB This paper assesses the suicide of elderly men in Brazil. The text is based on studies of gender and masculinity and emphasizes the sense of "hegemonic masculinity" within the logic of patriarchalism that, in the case of suicide, is expressed in the loss of employment as an existential reference and as a loss of honor. The study includes 40 cases of men over 60 who committed suicide between 2007 and 2010 in ten districts of the country. Using the psychosocial autopsy technique, data were collected and analyzed from their history and lifestyle; evaluation of the background to the act; the impact on their families; lethality of the method; proximity to sources of support; previous attempts; mental status which preceded the act; reaction of families and communities. Although many factors are associated with self-inflicted death in this social group, the influence of a hegemonic masculinity culture in the predominance of suicides among elderly men compared with elderly women is undeniable. It is essential to give special attention to men at the moment of transition from working life to retirement, loss or important family members, and when they are diagnosed with chronic and degenerative diseases that cause disabilities, loss of autonomy or sexual impotence.

SO REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE PSIQUIATRIA

DE Suicide; Time series; Male; Brazil; Tropical zone
AB Objective: To evaluate suicide seasonality in the city of Sao Paulo within an urban area and tropical zone. Method: Suicides were evaluated using the chi-square test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) by comparing monthly, quarterly and half-yearly variations, differentiating by gender. Analyses of time series were carried out using the autocorrelation function and periodogram, while the significance level for seasonality was confirmed with the Fisher's test. Results: The suicides of the period between 1979 and 2003 numbered 11,434 cases. Differences were observed in suicides occurring in Spring and Autumn for the total sample (ANOVA: p-value = 0.01), and in the male sample (ANOVA: p-value = 0.02). For the analysis of time series, seasonality was significant only for the period of 7 months in the male sample (p-value = 0.04). Discussion: In this study, no significant seasonal differences were observed in the occurrences of suicides, with the exception of the male sample. The differences observed did not correspond with the pattern described in studies carried out in temperate zones. Some of the climatic particularities of the tropical zone might explain the atypical pattern of seasonality of suicides found in large populations within an urban area and tropical zone.

DE Suicide; Nurse; Primary Health Care
ID STRATEGIES
AB Introduction: Suicide is a serious public health issue in Brazil. Primary Care plays a fundamental role in the prevention and treatment of suicide cases. Therefore, as members of the Primary Care team, nurses have crucial importance in the prevention of this problem. Thus, this study aims to describe the viewpoint of Primary Care nurses on suicide prevention in relation to the current public policies in Brazil. Materials and Methods: A descriptive, exploratory qualitative research was conducted at the Primary Health Care Units in Teresina, Piaui in which 18 nurses participated. IRAMUTEQ software was used to process the data collected. Results: The lexical analysis showed the existence of two thematic axes, composed of five semantic classes, namely: the articulation of the health care and family support network, which constitute class I - How to deal with situations and the nursing role; Class V - Reference as a care measure; Class II - Health care networks as a protection factor, Class III - Lack of training in nurses in front of suicide prevention: Class IV - The essential nature of health actions to prevent suicide. Discussion and Conclusions: It is considered that primary care nurses are able to respond to suicide prevention since they manage to articulate the health actions with the services available in the health care network.

AB This study presents the profile of suicide attempts using intentional overdose with medicines, treated at the Poison Control Center in Londrina, Parana State, Brazil. A retrospective study of cases treated from 1997 to 2007 was performed. Suicide attempts were significant among unemployed men, housewives, and retired women, and there was an association with other substances in 51.5% of the cases, with a higher frequency among men. 51.1% of the men combined the medicine with an alcoholic beverage, while in women, 84.8% of the associations involved other medicines. The most frequent pharmacological groups were tranquilizers (25.5%), antidepressants (17%), anticonvulsants (15%), and NSAIDs (11.9%). Prescribers must evaluate patients correctly before prescribing psychoactive drugs, since this is the pharmacological group most frequently associated with suicide attempts. Awareness-raising campaigns for rational use of medicines and social programs for suicidal patients should also help decrease the frequency of such cases.

AB Objective: To describe mortality by suicide among physicians in the state of sao Paulo, Brazil, between 2000 and 2009.
   Methods: Secondary analysis of government mortality data. The variable of interest was "underlying cause of death", specifically deaths classified by the ICD-10 as intentional self-harm (X60 to X84).
   Results: The analyses examined 2,297 declarations of death, among which suicide accounted for 50 cases, i.e., 1.7% of all causes of death. Women comprised 13.2% of the total sample and represented 24% of the death-by-suicide group, indicating an overrepresentation of women in the latter (p = 0.02). Deaths by suicide occurred on average 20 years earlier than deaths by other causes (46.8 +/- 14.2 years and 68.1 +/- 15.8 years, respectively; p = 0.001). There was a significant association between single and/or divorced status and suicide (p < 0.001). The average mortality rate during the study period was 4.2 deaths per 100,000 physicians registered with the Regional Board of Medicine of the State of Sao Paulo.
   Conclusion: Deaths by suicide occurred 20 years earlier than deaths by other causes. Medical institutions should develop strategies for the prevention and early detection of mental disorders and occupational stressors that elevate the risk of suicide among physicians.

AB Objective: To investigate the suicide-related attitudes and associated factors among nursing undergraduates
   Methods: A quantitative cross-sectional study, conducted with 244 nursing undergraduates from a rural higher education institution of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Data were collected in 2016, by self-administration of a sociodemographic questionnaire and the Suicide Behavior Attitude Questionnaire. The Spearman correlation coefficient and Mann-Whitney tests were used for data analysis.
   Results: Women presented more negative attitudes related to suicide. Men and students who participated in a psychiatric nursing discipline, class or laboratory on suicide, were perceived to be more capable professionally. Baccalaureate students who read specific material about suicide, or had ever thought about committing suicide, showed a less moralistic or condemnatory attitude related to suicide.
   Conclusion:The study highlights the need for educational interventions on suicide involving attitudinal knowledge.

AB Objective: To evaluate suicide rates and trends in Sao Paulo by sex, age-strata, and methods. Methods: Data was collected from State registry from 1996 to 2009. Population was estimated using the National Census. We utilized joinpoint regression analysis to explore temporal trends. We also evaluated marital status, ethnicity, birthplace and methods for suicide. Results: In the period analyzed, 6,002 suicides were accrued with a rate of 4.6 per 100,000 (7.5 in men and 2.0 in women); the male-to-female ratio was around 3.7. Trends for men presented a significant decline of 5.3% per year from 1996 to 2002, and a significant increase of 2.5% from 2002 onwards. Women did not present significant changes. For men, the elderly (> 65 years) had a significant reduction of 2.3% per year, while younger men (25-44 years) presented a significant increase of 8.6% from 2004 onwards. Women did not present significant trend changes according to age. Leading suicide methods were hanging and poisoning for men and women, respectively. Other analyses showed an increased suicide risk ratio for singles and foreigners. Conclusions: Specific epidemiological trends for suicide in the city of Sao Paulo that warrant further investigation were identified. High-risk groups - such as immigrants - could benefit from targeted strategies of suicide prevention.

TI <i>Jurupari</i> committed suicide?: notes for suicide investigation in
   indigenous context
SO SAUDE E SOCIEDADE
LA Portuguese
DT Article
DE Suicide; Indigenous Population; Interdisciplinary
ID TRENDS; BRAZIL
AB Several evidences shows that in Brazil, suicide mortality rates of some indigenous people are significantly higher than national and regional rates. Furthermore, evidence points to the difficulties to transport biomedical categories to the indigenous societies, because they use specific symbolic references to understand the health-disease process and the death. The aim of this paper was to reflect on the difficulties to use the concept of suicide in the indigenous context, an important principle to explore this theme from a less ethnocentric way. The proposed way for this was to resort to the so-called "anthropological strangeness" of the biomedical concept of suicide. To this end, we did an analysis of an indigenous myth that is widespread in the Upper Rio Negro region, the myth of Jurupari, using three guiding questions: Jurupari wanted to die?; Jurupari died?; Who killed Jurupari? To answer these questions we used the ethnographic information about suicide among Brazilian indigenous. Through the performed analysis, the difficulty to transport the biomedical concept of suicide to the indigenous context was demonstrated. This was down when we presented: i) the amplification of the difficulties to speak of intentionality in this context, ii) the different indigenous conceptions about death and dying, iii) the complex correlation between suicide and homicide in native's etiological systems. Finally, even in a preliminary way, some potential difficulties and possible ways to approach indigenous suicide by qualitative and quantitative strategies was presented.

AB A sizeable proportion of all suicides have mental health issues in the background. The association between access to mental health care in the community and decreased suicide rates is inconsistent in the literature. Brazil undertook a major psychiatric reform strengthening psychiatric community-based care. To evaluate the impact of the new Brazilian community mental health care units (CAPS-Psychosocial-Community-Centres) on municipal rates of suicide, and hospitalisations by attempted suicide, psychiatric and alcohol problems. We performed robust multivariable negative binomial regression models with fixed effect for panel data from all 5507 Brazilian municipalities. Suicide and hospitalization rates were calculated by sex and standardised by age for each municipality and year from 2008 to 2012. The main variable of interest was municipal CAPS coverage. CAPS municipal coverage was associated with lower suicide rates but this was not statistically significant (RR: 0.981; 95% CI 0.952-1.011). However, increased CAPS coverage was associated with lower hospitalizations for attempted suicide (RR: 0.887; 95% CI 0.841-0.935), psychiatric (RR: 0.841; 95% CI 0.821-0.862), and alcohol problems (RR: 0.882; 95% CI 0.860-0.904). Our results suggest that access to community mental health services seems to reduce hospitalisations due to attempted suicide, psychiatric and alcohol problems but not suicidal rates. Therefore, increased investments in community mental health services in low-middle-income countries might decrease costs associated with potentially avoidable hospitalizations.

AB There are only a few published studies about suicide attempts in Brazil. The validity of these studies' findings still need to be established. In order to help advance the available knowledge of suicide attempts in Brazil, this chapter describes all cases of suicide attempts handled during a one-year period by a public hospital emergency service in Rio de Janeiro. All suicide attempters identified between April 2006 and March 2007 were invited to participate in the study. We used assertive outreach methods, used in clinical work with hard-to-reach populations, to recruit responders from this target population. We used the CIDI (Composite International Development Interview) to assess mental disorders. The majority of all participants (n=96) were female (62.5%), young adults (55.4%), single (44.8%), and had a low educational level (66.7%). A total of 38.6% were unemployed. Fifty-one percent had a history of prior suicide attempt, 44.8% reported prior psychiatric or psychological treatment and 40.6% had a current history psychotropic medication use. The most common method used was medication (39.6%). Women used medication as the most common method (46.7%) while men used pesticides (38.9%). These findings are similar to national and international studies. The most prevalent mental disorder found was major depressive disorder (35.4%), followed by psychoactive substance abuse/dependence (21.9%), post-traumatic stress disorder (20.8%), alcohol abuse/dependence (17.7%) and schizophrenia (15.6%). Our findings suggest that suicide prevention needs to be comprehensive, including promotion of education and employment, focusing on young people and those individuals with prior suicide attempts and addressing the distinctive characteristics of women and men at risk for suicide.

AB Objective: To examine spatial-temporal distribution and risk of suicide, as well as trends in suicide mortality rates, in the indigenous and non-indigenous population of the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.
   Methods: Data were obtained from the Information Department of the Brazilian Unified Health System. Deaths recorded as voluntary self-inflicted injuries (ICD-10 codes X60.0 to X84.9) were considered suicide. Suicide rates were estimated and adjusted by age in the population > 9 years of age. Kernel analysis was used to assess the spatial distribution of suicide cases, while trend analysis was carried out using a non-parametric test (Mann-Kendall).
   Results: The suicide risk among the indigenous population was 8.1 (95% CI 7.2-9.0) times higher than in the non-indigenous population. For indigenous residents in the 15-24 age group, the risk was 18.5 (95% CI 17.5-19.6) times higher than in the non-indigenous population. The majority of indigenous cases were concentrated in a few villages in reservation areas, mainly occupied by Guarani-Kaiowa and Guarani-Nandeva groups. Rate patterns remained stable over time in both groups.
   Conclusion: Suicide is a serious public health problem in Mato Grosso do Sul, and has had an alarming and disproportionate impact on the indigenous population for more than a decade.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify the socio-demographic profiles, suicidal ideation, the presence of mental disorders and the quality of life of patients using mental health services in Arapiraca, Alagoas, Brazil.
   METHOD: Interviews were conducted in family health units and the Psychosocial Attention Center. The sample included 202 mental disorder patients with a risk of suicide attempts, 207 mental disorder patients without a risk of suicide attempts and 196 controls. This study used an identification questionnaire, the abbreviated World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire, Beck's Suicidal Ideation Scale and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview.
   RESULTS: Patients who had a mental disorder and a risk of suicide attempts tended to be single, had less education and lower family income, were not working and showed lower scores in quality of life domains; 73 of these patients had suicidal ideation in the previous week. Depressive disorders, manic episodes, hypomanic episodes, social phobias, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychotic syndromes and generalized anxiety disorder were more frequent and statistically significant for patients at risk for suicide attempts.
   CONCLUSION: The management of patients with a risk of suicide attempts must focus on individual patients because this risk is directly linked to changes in quality of life and the improvement of these patients' prognosis.

AB Analyze the epidemiological profile of and years of life lost to suicide in Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, from 2000 to 2015. This is an ecological study in which data on death were sourced from the Mortality Information System. Years of Potential Life Lost were calculated over the historical series. A total of 2,266 deaths by suicide were analyzed, identified during the period, with the most frequent cases being those occurring at home, by hanging, among men, black people, single people and the elderly. More Years of Potential Life Lost were counted in the economically active age group (30-39 years old). Thus, recognizing the epidemiological characteristics of suicide in Rio Grande do Norte may guide more effective actions and strategies targeting risk populations and reinforces the need for further studies focusing on regions with the highest rates in the state. Moreover, mental health care must be adapted to age and gender, besides approaching social support needs and feeling of belonging.

AB A literature review was carried out focusing on the main factors associated with suicidal ideation, attempts and completed suicide in elders. The following databases were searched: MEDLINE, PsychINFO, SciELO and Biblioteca Virtual em Violencia e Saude da BIREME (BIREME's Violence and Health Virtual Library), referring to the period from 1980 to 2008. Fifty-two references were selected and analyzed. They showed a strong relationship among suicide ideation, attempt and completion in elderly individuals, which results from the interaction of complex physical, mental, neurobiological and social factors. Suicide associated with depression in the elderly can be prevented, provided the person is properly treated. In Brazil, it is necessary to invest in research, given the persistent increase in suicide rates among aged people, especially among males.

AB A cross-sectional study was developed to evaluate suicide risk and associated factors in HIV/AIDS patients at a regional reference center for the treatment of HIV/AIDS in southern Brazil. We assessed 211 patients in regard to suicide risk, clinical and sociodemographic characteristics, drug use, depression, and anxiety. Suicide risk was assessed with Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, Module C. Multivariate analysis was performed using Poisson regression. Of the total sample, 34.1% were at risk of suicide. In the multivariate analysis, the following variables were independently associated with suicide risk: female gender; age up to 47 years; unemployment; indicative of anxiety; indicative of depression; and abuse or addiction on psychoactive substances. Suicide risk is high in this population. Psychosocial factors should be included in the physical and clinical evaluation, given their strong association with suicide risk.

   HISTORY
AB Suicide is among the main causes of death of people aged between 15 and 44 years old. Childhood trauma is an important risk factor for suicide. Hence, the objective of this study was to verify the relationship between childhood trauma and current suicide risk (suicidal behavior and ideation) in individuals aged 14-35 years, in the city of Pelotas, Brazil. This is a cross-sectional, population-based study. Sample selection was performed by clusters. Suicide risk was evaluated using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and Childhood trauma was assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Moreover, the participants responded to a questionnaire concerning socioeconomic status, work, and substance use. The sample was composed of 1,380 individuals. The prevalence of suicide risk was 11.5%. The prevalence figures of childhood trauma were 15.2% (emotional neglect), 13.5% (physical neglect), 7.6% (sexual abuse), 10.1% (physical abuse), and 13.8% (emotional abuse). Suicide risk was associated (p < .001) with gender, work, alcohol abuse, tobacco use, and all types of childhood trauma. The odds of suicide risk were higher in women (OR = 1.8), people who were not currently working (OR = 2.3), individuals who presented alcohol abuse (OR = 2.6), and among tobacco smokers (OR = 3.4). Moreover, suicide risk was increased in all types of trauma: emotional neglect (OR = 3.7), physical neglect (OR = 2.8), sexual abuse (OR = 3.4), physical abuse (OR = 3.1), and emotional abuse (OR = 6.6). Thus, preventing early trauma may reduce suicide risk in young individuals. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In Latin American ( LA) and the major developed countries' (MDC) suicide and undetermined deaths are analyzed as methods of suicide and the number of undetermined deaths are similar, possibly containing hidden suicides. The goal was to test the likelihood that LA cultural attitudes lead to higher undetermined rates and more hidden suicides. We used 3-year WHO average mortality data to compare LA and MDC mortality by age and gender, and chi(2) tests to examine any differences. In 13 LA countries younger-aged (15-34) men and women's suicides were higher than all-age rates, and undetermined deaths exceeded the suicide rates. Nine LA countries had significantly more undetermined younger-aged male deaths than females. Sixteen of 18 LA countries had significantly higher undetermined death rates than the MDC.

AB This retrospective cohort study aimed to analyze the epidemiological profile of individuals that attempted suicide from 2003 to 2009 in Barbacena, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, to calculate the mortality rate from suicide and other causes, and to estimate the risk of death in these individuals. Data were collected from police reports and death certificates. Survival analysis was performed and Cox multiple regression was used. Among the 807 individuals that attempted suicide, there were 52 deaths: 12 by suicide, 10 from external causes, and 30 from other causes. Ninety percent of suicide deaths occurred within 24 months after the attempt. Risk of death was significantly greater in males, married individuals, and individuals over 60 years of age. Standardized mortality ratio showed excess mortality by suicide. The findings showed that the mortality rate among patients that had attempted suicide was higher than expected in the general population, indicating the need to improve health care for these individuals.

ID RISK; DEPRESSION
AB Both substance dependence and depressive mood seem to be associated with increased suicide risk. Clinical information on suicide attempts and depressive symptoms were obtained from a sample of 211 psychoactive substance dependents attending a university clinic program for addicts in Brazil. 49 subjects (23.4%) had attempted suicide at least once, and the frequency of reporting attempts was 4.32 times greater among women than among men. Male addicts also tended to engage in potentially more dangerous attempt methods than women. Depressive male addicts were 2.17 times more likely to have attempted suicide than nondepressive addicted men. Among women, no association could be established between having attempted suicide and the presence of depression. Substance addicts have a relatively high risk of attempting suicide and the co-occurrence of depression seems to increase prevalence of suicidal behavior among men.

AB The main goal of this study was to evaluate the association between daily cases of hanging suicides and meteorological conditions in Sao Paulo, Brazil. We considered a retrospective observational study based on the analysis of all necroscopic medical-expert reports available in digital form from the central unit of the Instituto Medico Legal (Medical Legal Institute) of Sao Paulo between July 1, 2006 and June 31, 2007. The meteorological variables were combined via Principal Components Analysis. In order to explain their association with the frequency of suicides, Poisson regression models were employed. The analysis suggests that hotter and brighter days are associated with higher incidence of hanging suicides.

AB CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Knowledge of socioeconomic impact of attempted suicide may sensitize managers regarding prevention strategies. There are no published data on this in Brazil. The aim here was to describe the direct and indirect costs of care of hospitalized cases of attempted suicide and compare these with the costs of acute coronary syndrome cases.
   DESIGN AND SETTING: Cost-of-illness study at a public university hospital in Brazil.
   METHOD: The costs of care of 17 patients hospitalized due to attempted suicide were compared with those of 17 acute coronary syndrome cases at the same hospital, over the same period. The direct costs were the summation of the hospital and out-of-hospital costs resulting from the event, determined from the medical records. The indirect costs were estimated through the human capital lost. The Mann-Whitney test and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with transformation adjusted for age were used for comparisons.
   RESULTS: The average costs per episode of attempted suicide were: direct cost, US$ 6168.65; indirect cost, US$ 688.08; and total cost, US$ 7163.75. Comparative analysis showed a difference between the indirect costs to family members, with significantly higher costs in the attempted suicide group (P = 0.0022).
   CONCLUSION: The cost of care relating to attempted suicide is high and the indirect cost to family members reinforces the idea that suicidal behavior not only affects the individual but also his social environment.

AB This cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence of suicide planning and associated factors in a representative sample of 12- to-18-year-old students in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. Two self-administered questionnaires were used to collect data: a questionnaire, standardized by the World Health Organization, about use of alcohol and drugs, violence, feelings of loneliness and sadness, family relationships, suicide planning, behavior in school, and relationships with friends; and the Body Shape Questionnaire. Prevalence of suicide planning was 6.3%. Multivariate analysis using Cox regression showed that the prevalence of suicide planning was higher among girls and among adolescents that reported problems in the relationships with their parents. Drug use by friends and having a small number of close friends increased suicide planning by 90% and 66%, respectively. Prevalence of suicide planning was two to three times greater among adolescents bullied by classmates or who reported feelings of loneliness or sadness. Adverse family relationships, aggressive interactions with classmates, and depressive symptoms increase the prevalence of suicide planning. Therefore, preventive measures should be developed

AB This study presents a qualitative analysis of how older people who had attempted suicide began to overcome the desire and the urge to take their own life. This article is based on a survey of 87 Brazilian men and women aged 60 and over, living in different regions of Brazil, who have demonstrated suicidal behaviour; twenty of whom gave important information about their coping strategies. The analysis in this article only refers to the aforementioned twenty participants. All the participants were heard through semi-structured interviews, which included questions about the process of overcoming suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. The central focus of the analysis - overcoming suicidal ideation and suicide attempts - was based on the following concepts: coping strategies, autonomy, and emotional balance. Irrespective of the gender of the respondents, five centers of meaning emerged from the discourses of the elderly, which highlighted the effectiveness of the following factors: religiosity and religious practices; social and family support; the support of health services; contact with pets; and the recovery of the autonomy to manage their own lives. This study can help to support the primary and secondary prevention of suicidal behavior in older people.

AB Studies in temperate countries show a direct correlation between the hours of daily light and the frequency of suicides. This relationship is damped in countries at the equatorial level, and what happens near the tropic lines is unknown. In this paper the suicide rates as well as the monthly average of daily light were analyzed in hours from 1990 to 2016 in Campeche, Mexico, a place with a high rate of suicide deaths and near the latitude of the Tropic of Cancer. The results showed that total suicides and sunshine were positively correlated (r = 0.649; p = 0.022) and the peak of maximum light in June coincides with the maximum suicide peak. There were non-significant peaks of higher suicides in June and December for men and in May for women. However, a clear, significant peak (p = 0.003) showed up in spring. We recommend strengthening the prevention programs during these periods.

AB The study analyzed the print media discursive production of the Federal District about the suicide of gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgenders (LGBT). It was a documentary research with the collections of the Documentation Center of the newspaper Correio Braziliense, with publications from 01/01/2004 to 09/20/2016. The research was done by combining eight descriptors in the LGBT field, singular and plural, associated with the terms "suicide" and "self-extermination". In total, there were 32 search combinations of word pairs. The production of meanings related to LGBT suicide in the selected material was analyzed. Differences attributed to the suicidal behavior of homosexuals and transsexuals and the low representativeness of the self-extermination of lesbians, bisexuals and travestites were observed.

AB News stories printed in Gazeta de Campinas (1871-1887) are used to investigate the views expressed at the time of the suicides of captives and freedmen in Sao Paulo province, and to discuss the data available. As suicide is a form of human behavior which cannot be reduced to one single explanation, it does not seem justifiable that amongst the slaves, these cases should also be taken as self-explanatory because of the conditions in which they occurred. By noting the circumstances in which these acts took place, it is hoped that the fallacy of oversimplified explanations can be belied, which refer to the suicide of slaves as quite simply being due to a 'dislike of captivity'.

AB Objective: to associate the life experiences of older women from the Northeast of Brazil with their suicidal ideation and attempts. Method: Qualitative study with fourteen older adults from Piripiri (PI), Teresina (PI), Fortaleza (CE) and Recife (PE) who were interviewed between November 2013 and July 2014. The organization of data originated the themes: experiences of abuse throughout their lives; marital fractures and social isolation; weakened motherhood. Results: The women were born and lived most of their life in the countryside, amid poverty and social exclusion. They had a history of abuse, physical and sexual violence, perpetrated by intimate partners and/or family members. They experienced social isolation, weakened emotional bonds and several suicide attempts. Final considerations: The life of these older women was affected by traumatic events that enhanced feelings of hopelessness, depressive symptoms and the absence of a plan for the future, making them consider suicide as a way to anticipate death.

SO REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE PSIQUIATRIA
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective: To analyze the spatial distribution of suicide incidence rate in a residential municipality of the state of Espirito Santo (ES), Brazil, from 2003 to 2007. Methods: Ecologic study of the exploratory kind, based on secondary data. Deaths per suicide, which took place in each municipality of ES, were included in the data according to information provided by the Mortality Information System. For the spatial data analysis, a Bayesian approach was used (Global empirical and Local Bayesian ones) to correct epidemiological rates. Moran's / index was calculated to a worldwide spatial level dependence, and Local Moran (LISA) to a local spatial correlation. The following software applications were used: Excel; R 2.6.2; SPSS 11.5 and TerraView 3.3.1. Results: The geographical localization of the municipalities that showed an incidence rate characterized as the average for suicide after adjustment (EBest Global) forms a corridor in the countryside. Some common characteristics among these municipalities are: a) immigration (Italians, Pomeranians/Germans); b) rural population (average of 53%); c) supporting economy (agriculture, husbandry and livestock). A global and local spatial correlation was found among the municipalities (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The study identified the spatial context where the greatest death incidence rate per suicide occurred in the state of ES, during the mentioned period.

AB Suicide prevention has become a public health issue of great concern. Previous studies proved that ambient temperature had an impact on suicide death, but few studies focus on regional studies in large cities. We aimed to estimate the association between ambient temperature and suicide in 31 capital cities in China during 2008 similar to 2013. Distributed lag non-linear model was used to explore the relationship between ambient temperature and suicide, adjusting for long-term trend, seasonality, and humidity confounders. Multivariate meta-analysis was used to pool the city-specific estimates to explore the overall relative risk in China. High temperature had a significant impact on suicide death. The country-level relative risk of high temperature on suicide was 1.37 (95% CI, 0.96 similar to 2.57), and the RR was higher in male and age < 65-year-old group than that in female and age 65-year-old group. There has no consistent pattern of associations in city-level with sex and age. The high temperature has a greater impact on suicide in south region compared with north region. We found the positive association between ambient temperature and suicide in China.

AB Objective: To investigate whether suicide risk among agricultural workers is higher in regions with heavier pesticide use and/or presence of tobacco farming. Methods: Suicide mortality data were gathered from residents of the Brazilian state of Alagoas. Agricultural census data were used to arrange and classify Alagoas cities into distribution groups on the basis of variables concerning pesticide use and/or tobacco farming. Mortality odds ratio calculations were then used to compare suicide risk among agricultural and nonagricultural workers in different groups. Results: Suicide risk was higher among agricultural workers than among nonagricultural workers, elevated in regions that used more pesticides, and greatest in regions that produced more tobacco. Conclusions: This is one of the first studies of its kind to suggest that combined effects of pesticide and tobacco exposure may be linked to higher suicide risk among agricultural workers.

Method: This is a study with a qualitative approach based on Oral Story. Participants were ten women with a history of suicide attempt, who experienced intrafamily violence in childhood and/or adolescence. The research was carried out at the Center for the Study and Prevention of Suicide, linked to a Toxicological Information Center in the city of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. Results: From the orality of women, the study allowed the emergence of the following representative categories of intrafamily abuse experienced in childhood and/or adolescence: psychological violence, rejection, neglect, physical violence and sexual violence. Final considerations: The study alerts to intrafamily violence as an aggravation related to suicidal behavior, offering elements that help in the identification of their expressions, which will raise awareness to suicidal behavior and consequently suicide prevention.

AB Purpose
   This study examined trends in the suicide rates of persons with foreign background in Japan.
   Methods
   Using the nationwide death records in the Vital Statistics of Japan, we first reported the age-adjusted suicide rates of 8 foreign nationals (Brazil, China, Korea, Peru, the Philippines, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States) in Japan by sex from 1980 to the mid-2010s. We also computed rate ratios to compare the suicide rate of each group with those of the Japanese population. Second, we focused on Koreans, who had the highest suicide rate in Japan. We compared the suicide rates of Koreans in Japan with Koreans in South Korea to examine whether their suicide rates were more closely related to those of their country of origin or those of their host country.
   Results
   We found that the suicide rates of Koreans and Chinese in Japan were similar to or higher than those of Japanese, while other groups tended to show lower suicide rates. Most notably, Koreans displayed consistently high suicide rates from 1980 to the mid-2010s, which were nearly twice as high as those of the Japanese population. Korean males and females in Japan had higher suicide rates than those in South Korea.
   Conclusions
   Immigrants in Japan were not necessarily influenced by the suicide rates of the host country. The high suicide rates among Korean residents in Japan might be explained by various disadvantages and adversities that they face in Japan.

DE Suicide; Mortality; Risk Factors; Linear Models
AB Epidemiology has identified violence as a major worldwide public health concern. Suicide is classified as violence. This study analyzes the association between suicide and socio-demographic factors. The methodological design was ecological, using correlation techniques and backward multiple linear regression. Normality of the residuals in the final model was analyzed. Proportional mortality in relation to total deaths was identified as the best outcome for modeling (R-2 = 0.41). The resulting variables were: % Pentecostal religion, % single marital status in the population over 10 years of age, mean years of schooling, altitude of the municipality, % homes without latrines, % population over 10 years of age working in the educational sector, and % population over 10 years with per capita earnings up to one minimum wage. All these variables were statistically significant at 5%. The results support the idea of the influence of extrinsic causal factors in determination of suicide.

ID MORTALITY; IDEATION
AB The authors analyze 51 cases of suicide among the elderly from ten Brazilian municipalities. The objective is to understand the interaction of variables associated with suicide among the elderly. A bibliographic review gives theoretical support to this study. Based on psychological autopsy, the study begins with a semi-structured interview format, which was applied and analyzed by peer researchers, using the same procedure for gathering, organizing and analyzing the data. This material was reviewed using a psychosocial and qualitative meta-analysis approach based on family interview data, researchers' interpretations, socio-anthropological contextualization and relevance categories. Ways of committing suicide, reasons for suicide, associated factors, attributed motives and lethality were studied by sex, age and socioeconomic characteristics. The interaction of major precipitant factors was analyzed. The conclusions showed that there are convergences among epidemiological and qualitative studies. Severe illness, disabilities and mental disorders are the major causes, followed by depression and family and marital conflicts. Close attention to the quality of life of the elderly is recommended, especially of men who constitute the main suicide risk group.

AB Objective: Considering the scarcity of reports from intertropical latitudes and the Southern Hemisphere, we aimed to examine the association between meteorological factors and suicide in Sao Paulo.
   Method: Weekly suicide records stratified by sex were gathered. Weekly averages for minimum, mean, and maximum temperature (degrees C), insolation (hours), irradiation (MJ/m(2)), relative humidity (%), atmospheric pressure (mmHg), and rainfall (mm) were computed. The time structures of explanatory variables were modeled by polynomial distributed lag applied to the generalized additive model. The model controlled for long-term trends and selected meteorological factors.
   Results: The total number of suicides was 6,600 (5,073 for men), an average of 6.7 suicides per week (8.7 for men and 2.0 for women). For overall suicides and among men, effects were predominantly acute and statistically significant only at lag 0. Weekly average minimum temperature had the greatest effect on suicide; there was a 2.28% increase (95% CI 0.90-3.69) in total suicides and a 2.37% increase (95% CI 0.82-3.96) among male suicides with each 1 degrees C increase.
   Conclusion: This study suggests that an increase in weekly average minimum temperature has a short-term effect on suicide in Sao Paulo.

AB The aim of this study was to assess suicide risk and risk behavior in young people. A cross-sectional study in the urban area of Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil was performed using systematic sampling with young people between the ages of 18 to 24 years. We measured the risk of suicide (MINI), behavior (YRBSS), abuse/substance dependence (ASSIST) and socioeconomic status (ABEP). Data was analyzed using SPSS software. The sample consisted of 1,560 young people and the prevalence of suicide risk was 8.6%. Suicide risk was associated with: having suffered an accident that required a visit to the emergency room (p = 0.011), fighting (p = 0.016), carrying a weapon (p = 0.001) and carrying a firearm (p <= 0.001), substance abuse/dependence (p <= 0.001), not having used a condom during the last sexual relationship (p = 0.025), not having a steady partner (p <= 0.001) and having sex with five or more people (p = 0.018). Young people that present risk behavior also represent a suicide risk.

AB Objective To determine whether brief intervention and contact is effective in reducing subsequent suicide mortality among suicide attempters in low and middle-income countries.
   Methods Suicide attempters (n = 1867) identified by medical staff in the emergency units of eight collaborating hospitals in five culturally different sites (Campinas, Brazil; Chennai, India; Colombo, Sri Lanka; Karaj, Islamic Republic of Iran; and Yuncheng, China) participated, from January 2002 to October 2005, in a randomized controlled trial to receive either treatment as usual, or treatment as usual plus brief intervention and contact (BIC), which included patient education and follow-up. Overall, 91 % completed the study. The primary study outcome measurement was death from suicide at 18-month follow-up.
   Findings Significantly fewer deaths from suicide occurred in the BIC than in the treatment-as-usual group (0.2% versus 2.2%, respectively; chi(2) = 13.83, P<0.001).
   Conclusion This low-cost brief intervention may be an important part of suicide prevention programmes for underresourced low-and middle-income countries.

AB Objective: Discussing the factors associated with major depression and suicide risk among nursing professionals. Method: An integrative review in PubMed/MEDLINE, LILACS, SciELO and BDENF databases, between 2003 and 2015. Results: 20 published articles were selected, mostly from between 2012 and 2014, with significant production in Brazil. Nursing professionals are vulnerable to depression when young, married, performing night work and having several jobs, and when they have a high level of education, low family income, work overload, high stress, insufficient autonomy and a sense of professional insecurity and conflict in the family and work relationship. Suicide risk was correlated with the presence of symptoms of depression, high levels of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and low personal accomplishment; characteristics of Burnout Syndrome. Conclusion: Suicide risk among nursing professionals is associated with symptoms of depression and correlated with Burnout Syndrome, which can affect work performance.

AB This article analyzes different aspects of depression association with suicide among the elderly based on psychological autopsies. The retrospective method was used to study indeterminate deaths, based on interviews and reports, which analyze psychosocial circumstances related to suicide. The paper reveals the predominance of gender, social class and race - women, middle and upper class, white - and, in an unprecedented manner, contextualizes depression in a poorly studied population in Brazil and in the world with high risk of suicide. The physical and mental health, social circumstances and predominant biographical characteristics of the suicide victim were reconstructed in order to assess the impact of depression on suicide. Depression was presented in almost all cases, in primary or secondary diagnosis, as the symptom associated with other co-morbidities or as a reaction to social stressors, demanding different therapeutic approaches and procedures. The association between depression and multiple co-morbidity accentuates the case prognosis and cumulatively increases the risk of suicide. Depression followed by suicidal tendencies is a risk factor which justifies immediate preventive measures. Increasing assertive ways to diagnose and treat depression in old age is recommended.

   The trend of crude rates of suicide mortality by sex in the city of Campinas, Brazil, for the period 1976-2001 was assessed. Data from the Mortality Registry were used for sociodemographic analyses in the period 1996-2001. An ecological approach was used to examine socioeconomic differences and the 42 city areas of health care units were classified into 4 homogeneous strata. Rates were age-adjusted using direct method.
   Results
   The city has a low suicide rate (less than 51100,000) in comparison with other countries. Male excess mortality was over 2.7 male suicides for each female suicide. While in 1980-1985 the older group (55 years and older) had the highest suicide rates, in 199 7-2001 the middle-aged adult group (35-54 years old) showed the highest ones. As for suicide methods, men used hanging (36.4%) and firearms (31.8%), while women used poisoning (24.2%) and firearms and hanging (21.2% each). Hangings led to death at home, while firearms or poisoning deaths took place more often in hospitals. Suicide is different from homicide in that there is no rate increase with lower socioeconomic level.
   Conclusions
   Suicide rates are low with successive increments and decrements without consistent growing or lowering trends. The risk of dying by suicide is higher among men and does not increase with lower socioeconomic condition.

AB Purpose: To examine suicide mortality trends among young people (10-24 years of age(1)) in selected countries and territories of the Americas.
   Methods: An ecological study was conducted using a time series of suicide mortality data from 19 countries and one territory in the Region of the Americas from 2001 to 2008, comprising 90.3% of the regional population. The analyses included age-adjusted suicide mortality rates, average annual variation in suicide mortality rates, and relative risks for suicide, by age and sex.
   Results: The mean suicide rate for the selected study period and countries/territory was 5.7/100,000 young people (10-24 years), with suicide rates higher among males (7.7/100,000) than females (2.4/100,000). Countries with the highest total suicide mortality rates among young people (10-24 years) were Guyana, Suriname, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Chile, and Ecuador; countries with the lowest total suicide mortality rates included Mexico, Venezuela, Cuba, and Brazil, and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. During this period, there was a significant increase in suicide mortality rates among young people in the following countries: Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, and Suriname; countries with significant decreases in suicide mortality rates included Canada, Colombia, Cuba, El Salvador, and Venezuela. The three leading suicide methods in the Americas were hanging, firearms, and poisoning.
   Conclusions: Some countries of the Americas have experienced a rise in adolescent and youth suicide during the study period, with males at a higher risk of committing suicide than females. Adolescent and youth suicide policies and programs are recommended, to curb this problem. Methodological limitations are discussed. (C) 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

AB OBJECTIVE: To estimate age and sex-specific suicide rates, compare suicide rates between indigenous communities, and quantify the frequency of intrafamilial suicide clustering.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study involving 14,666 indigenous individuals in reservations in Dourados, state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, from 2003 through 2013 using national and local census.
   RESULTS: The overall suicide rate was 73.4 per 100,000 person-years. Adolescent males aged 15-19 and girls aged 10-14 had the highest rates for each sex at 289.3 (95%CI 187.5-391.2) and 85.3 (95%CI 34.9-135.7), respectively. Comparing the largest reservations, Bororo had a higher suicide rate than Jaguapiru (RR = 4.83, 95%CI 2.85-8.16) and had significantly lower socioeconomic indicators including income and access to electricity. Nine of 19 suicides among children under 15 occurred in household clusters. Compared with adult suicides, a greater proportion of child (OR = 5.12, 95%CI 1.89-13.86, p = 0.001) and adolescent (OR = 3.48, 95%CI 1.29-9.44, p = 0.017) suicides occurred within household clusters.
   CONCLUSIONS: High rates of suicide occur among children and adolescents in these indigenous reservations, particularly in poor communities. Nearly half of child suicides occur within household clusters. These findings underscore the need for broad public health interventions and focused mental health interventions in households following a suicide.

AB The association of childhood maltreatment and suicide has been extensively examined within the population. Depression figures as a main cause for the elevated suicide rate in advanced ages and is often related to childhood maltreatment. The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between childhood maltreatment subtypes and suicide risk, testing geriatric depression as a moderator. This is a cross-sectional study looking at a sample of 449 individuals 60 years old or older from the Multidimensional Study of the Elderly of Porto Alegre Family Health Strategy, Brazil (EMI-SUS/PGA). Childhood maltreatment (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire), geriatric depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale), and suicide risk (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview) were assessed. The subtypes of childhood abuse and neglect were significantly associated with suicide risk. In the multivariate analysis, controlling for age, gender, income, marital status, ethnicity, smoking, and geriatric depression symptoms, all trauma subtypes remained associated with suicide risk with the exception of physical neglect (EA = 3.65; PA = 3.16; SA = 5.1; EN = 2.43; PN = 1.76). The present study showed that childhood maltreatment subtypes predicted suicide risk, and geriatric depression does not directly mediate this relation.

DE Suicide; Suicide attempted; Case studies
AB The objective of this work was to analyze the occurrence of suicidal attempts and deaths that happened in the district of Independencia, Ceara State, Brazil, in 2005. A case study was carried out, including attempts and deaths by suicide. A data gathering source was composed out of the SIS (Mortality Information System) and of the SIH (Hospital Admittance System), regarding the year 2005, besides documentary research on district hospital records. Out of six recorded obits, two happened in the age group of 10 to 19, three from 20 to 29, and one from 30 to 59. One half of the suicide victims were male, and the prevailing method was hanging. Considering the attempts, most of them concentrated in the age group of 10 to 19, prevailing females (seven cases). The main signs and symptoms presented by victims, before exerting suicidal attempt were: sadness, loss of sleep, anorexia, nervousness, will to cry, and aggressiveness; there also was some kind of affective relationship among those persons. It was concluded that the events recorded in the district of Independencia must be analyzed as a social fact, highlighting the small time interval between the deaths and attempts and, the existence of relational links among the victims.

AB Objective: Examine prevalence and level of suicide risk, and its associations with sociodemographic factors and mood disorders.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study with a random sample of 530 individuals aged 60 years or more from Family Health Strategy of Porto Alegre, Brazil. Diagnosis was made by psychiatrists using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview plus (MINIplus).
   Results: Suicide risk was found in 15.7% of the sample. Female gender, elderly with no income or with no paid activity and those who have lost one or more of his sons presented association with suicide risk. Bipolar disorder shows association with suicide risk for those with or without current episode. For unipolar depression only elderly with a current episode shows association with suicide risk.
   Limitations: The cross-sectional design limits the examination of causative relationships. The MINIplus questions are not broad enough to assess other important self-destructive behaviors.
   Conclusions: A high rate of suicide risk was found. As expected an increased rate of mood disorders were related to the risk of suicide. The loss of sons may partly explain a subtype of late-life risk of suicide or mood disorders especially in the oldest-old. These findings can be a useful to generate other research hypothesis and for health professionals who care older persons. Detecting characteristics linked to suicide, therefore opening up the possibility of preventing tragic outcomes providing a proper treatment. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: Suicide is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, especially among young subjects. Suicide is considered the outcome of a multidimensional and complex phenomenon, which is a result of the interaction between several factors. The association between psychopathology and suicide has been extensively investigated. Major depression plays an important role among the psychiatric diagnoses associated with suicide. This finding seems to be confirmed by different study designs, and in distinct populations. The present paper aims to briefly review the recent findings regarding the suicide-related clinical features of depression. Moreover, strategies for suicide prevention were also reviewed. Review: Recent references were identified and grouped in order to illustrate the main contributions about depression and suicide. Briefly, the literature review stresses the high prevalence of major depression among subjects presenting suicide behaviors. Psychopathological traits, such as aggression and impulsivity play a relevant role in triggering suicidal behaviors. Strategies for suicide prevention were also reviewed in Brazil and internationally. In general, detection and treatment are effective in reducing suicide rates. Conclusion: Studies regarding suicide behaviors have had a pragmatic approach, and generated a large body of evidence about correlates of suicide. However, these studies have not been able to provide a consistent theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. The recent adoption of modern strategies represents a possibility of enhancing the research capability of such studies. In order to be clinically useful, findings should make it possible to deepen the understanding over the experience of a suicidal person, as well as to design specific strategies for prevention and treatment in population subgroups.

AB This study uses statistical techniques to evaluate reports on suicide scenes; it utilizes 80 reports from different locations in Brazil, randomly collected from both federal and state jurisdictions. We aimed to assess a heterogeneous group of cases in order to obtain an overall perspective of the problem. We evaluated variables regarding the characteristics of the crime scene, such as the detected traces (blood, instruments and clothes) that were found and we addressed the methodology employed by the experts. A qualitative approach using basic statistics revealed a wide distribution as to how the issue was addressed in the documents. We examined a quantitative approach involving an empirical equation and we used multivariate procedures to validate the quantitative methodology proposed for this empirical equation. The methodology successfully identified the main differences in the information presented in the reports, showing that there is no standardized method of analyzing evidences.

AB The chemical control of rodents with anticoagulant products, especially derivatives of the coumarin chemical group, is legally authorised in Brazil. These products provide effective control and are safe for humans. However, the use of illegal 'rodenticides' has increased in many Brazilian cities recently, accompanied by increased numbers of suicides, homicides, and intoxications. The National Toxicology Information System ( Sinitox) registers the number of rodenticide intoxications, including suicides, but does not differentiate between the legal and illegal rodenticides. Intoxications by rodenticides outnumber those by illicit drugs and pesticides. A survey of data from 2005-2011 revealed an average of about 3,800 intoxications per year, about 60% of which were suicides. Many of these intoxications probably involved illegal rodenticides, some with unknown chemical compositions, which confound the data on rodenticide intoxication. This evaluation of Sinitox data highlighted the need to ensure the proper use of the term 'rodenticide' when registering intoxication cases. Intoxication by-products that are not rodenticides, but are erroneously used for this purpose, should be classified separately to improve the quality of information.

AB Background: Comparative and predictive analyses of suicide data from different countries are difficult to perform due to varying approaches and the lack of comparative parameters.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: A simple model (the Threshold Bias Model) was tested for comparative and predictive analyses of suicide rates by age. The model comprises of a six parameter distribution that was applied to the USA suicide rates by age for the years 2001 and 2002. Posteriorly, linear extrapolations are performed of the parameter values previously obtained for these years in order to estimate the values corresponding to the year 2003. The calculated distributions agreed reasonably well with the aggregate data. The model was also used to determine the age above which suicide rates become statistically observable in USA, Brazil and Sri Lanka.
   Conclusions/Significance: The Threshold Bias Model has considerable potential applications in demographic studies of suicide. Moreover, since the model can be used to predict the evolution of suicide rates based on information extracted from past data, it will be of great interest to suicidologists and other researchers in the field of mental health.

AB The impact of religiosity in suicidal behavior was evaluated in Brazil through a case-control study in which 110 subjects who had attempted suicide through the use of toxic substances were compared with 114 control subjects with no history of suicide attempts. Religiosity was measured in three aspects: organizational religious activities (ORAs), nonorganizational religious activities (NORAs), and intrinsic religiosity (IR). Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the impact of religiosity on suicide attempts, controlling for sociodemographic variables, impulsivity, and mental illness. Religiosity, in its three dimensions, was shown to be an important protective factor against suicide attempts, even after controlling for relevant risk factors associated with suicidal behavior: ORA: odds ratio (OR), 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45-0.89); NORA: OR, 0.56 (95% CI, 0.42-0.75); and IR: OR, 0.59 (95% CI, 0.49-0.70). These data have important implications for understanding religiosity factors that might protect against suicide.

AB This study examines the relationship between suicide and aging from a gender perspective, examining the socially imposed boundaries of masculinity and femininity in the lives of elderly people who committed suicide. It is a qualitative study in which 50 psychosocial autopsies conducted with elderly relatives were selected from 10 cities in the North, South, Northeast and Midwest of Brazil. In this article we have identified situations of gender vulnerabilities in the lives of 13 people who committed suicide: 10 men and 3 women selected for their exemplary character. Two main categories were listed: the first refers to femininity including the "gender destiny" experienced by elderly women who commit suicide when they can no longer care for themselves or work. The second concerns the hegemonic masculinity in crisis, in which old men die after changing from the role of providers due to retirement or illness. It should be stressed that gender norms, codes of honor, power inequalities and stereotypes affect both women and men in terms of susceptibility to suicidal behavior.

TI Statistical Signs of Social Influence on Suicides
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID CITIES
AB By treating the suicide as a social fact, Durkheim envisaged that suicide rates should be determined by the connections between people and society. Under the same framework, he considered that crime is bound up with the fundamental conditions of all social life. The social effect on the occurrence of homicides has been previously substantiated, and confirmed here, in terms of a superlinear scaling relation: by doubling the population of a Brazilian city results in an average increment of 135% in the number of homicides, rather than the expected isometric increase of 100%, as found, for example, for the mortality due to car crashes. Here we present statistical signs of the social influence on the suicide occurrence in cities. Differently from homicides (superlinear) and fatal events in car crashes (isometric), we find sublinear scaling behavior between the number of suicides and city population, with allometric power-law exponents, beta = 0.84 +/- 0.02 and 0.87 +/- 0.01, for all cities in Brazil and US counties, respectively. Also for suicides in US, but using the Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), we obtain beta = 0.88 +/- 0.01.

AB Background: The World Health Organization defines suicide as the act of deliberately killing oneself. It is the second leading cause of death among 15-29 year olds globally.
   Objective: To analyze the epidemiological profile and the spatial distribution of suicide deaths in the state of Sergipe.
   Methods: We performed an ecological time-series study with data from the Brazilian Mortality Information System (Sistema de Informacoes sobre Mortalidade - SIM) about deaths by suicide occurring between 2000 and 2015. We considered as suicide deaths cases recorded as voluntary self-inflicted injuries. Suicide rates were estimated and age-adjusted in the population above 9 years. We analyzed temporal trends by sex and age groups using the simple linear regression model. For the spatial analysis, we performed Kernel density estimation with the software TerraView version 4.2.2.
   Results: We identified 1,560 suicide cases in the state of Sergipe between 2000 and 2015, with a mean of 97.5 cases per year. We also observed that suicide rates in the state increased 102.3% (from 2.69/100,000 population in 2000 to 5.44 in 2015). Suicides occurred predominantly among males (1,160 cases; 74.35%), single people (1,010 cases; 64.7%), and brown-skinned people (1,039 cases; 66.6%). We observed significantly growing temporal trends in the general population, especially among male adults. Spatial analysis allowed us to draw a map that showed the regions with the highest occurrence of suicide.
   Conclusion: We observed growing suicide trends in the state of Sergipe and the spatial analysis was an important tool that showed the areas with higher incidences of suicide.

AB Background: The attitudes towards suicide of emergency nurses may affect the care provided. However, the factors associated with these attitudes remain unclear.
   Objective: To investigate attitudes towards suicidal behaviour and associated factors among nursing professionals working in emergency settings.
   Methods: A cross-sectional observational study including 28 nurses and 118 who were nursing assistants employed at two emergency services in Brazil was conducted.Data were collected in 2015 using a self-administered sociodemographic questionnaire and the Suicide Behavior Attitude Questionnaire (SBAQ).
   Results: The majority of participants reported having no experience or training in mental health or suicide. They reported more negative feelings towards the patient and a lower self-perception of professional competence regarding suicidal behaviours, and these attitudes seemed to reinforce each other. Nurses who worked in mental health services reported less moralistic/judgemental attitudes. Working in prehospital services was associated with having a lower self-perception of professional competence. There were professionals who reported thinking seriously about committing suicide.
   Conclusion: When combined with support and training, practicing mental health nursing may serve as an opportunity to develop favourable attitudes and emotional competences, and these issues need to be addressed in suicide education strategies.

AB This study sought to verify the records on file and the number of cases of attempted suicide among children and adolescents who were attended by Emergency Care health professionals in the municipality of Matozinhos, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Documentary and descriptive research was conducted, the data for which was collected by means of an investigation of Outpatient Records from 2008 to 2010. Of the 73,000 files evaluated, those dealing with cases of attempted suicide among children and adolescents between the age of 3 and 18 years were selected. It was revealed that the health professionals, particularly physicians and nurses, fail to register the cases appropriately, invalidating information about the problem and potential prevention measures. The conclusion reached was that underreporting and the discrepancy of the diagnoses which were not duly referred to the competent agencies require rethinking and reviewing medical practices, and taking a systematic and careful look to address the individual as a complex whole.

AB Background: Attempted suicide is a strong risk factor for subsequent suicidal behaviors. Innovative strategies to deal with people who have attempted suicide are needed, particularly in resource-poor settings. Aims: To evaluate a brief educational intervention and periodic follow-up contacts (BIC) for suicide attempters in five culturally different sites (Campinas, Brazil; Chennai, India; Colombo, Sri Lanka; Karaj, Islamic Republic of Iran; and Yuncheng, People's Republic of China) as part of the WHO Multisite Intervention Study on Suicidal Behaviors (SUPRE-MISS). Methods: Among the 1,867 suicide attempters enrolled in the emergency departments of the participating sites, 922 (49.4%) were randomly assigned to a brief intervention and contact (BIC) group and 945 (50.6%) to a treatment as usual (TAU) group. Repeated suicide attempts over the 18 months following the index attempt - the secondary outcome measure presented in this paper - were identified by follow-up calls or visits. Subsequent completed suicide - the primary outcome measure has been reported in a previous paper. Results: Overall, the proportion of subjects with repeated suicide attempts was similar in the BIC and TAU groups (7.6% vs. 7.5%, chi(2) = 0.013; p = .909), but there were differences in rates across the five sites. Conclusions: This study from five low-and middle-income countries does not confirm the effectiveness of brief educational intervention and follow-up contacts for suicide attempters in reducing subsequent repetition of suicide attempts up to 18 months after discharge from emergency departments.

AB This cross-cultural study investigates whether religiosity assessed in three dimensions has a protective effect against attempted suicide. Community controls (n = 5484) were more likely than suicide attempters (n = 2819) to report religious denomination in Estonia (OR = 0.5) and subjective religiosity in four countries: Brazil (OR = 0.2), Estonia (OR = 0.5), Islamic Republic of Iran (OR = 0.6), and Sri Lanka (OR = 0.4). In South Africa, the effect was exceptional both for religious denomination (OR = 5.9) and subjective religiosity (OR = 2.7). No effects were found in India and Vietnam. Organizational religiosity gave controversial results. In particular, subjective religiosity (considering him/herself as religious person) may serve as a protective factor against non-fatal suicidal behavior in some cultures.

AB Objective: to analyze the nursing care to people admitted in emergency for attempted suicide in the perception of the nursing staff. Method: descriptive and exploratory study, of qualitative approach, developed from semi-structured interviews with eight nurses and eight nursing technicians of the emergency service of a University Hospital in south Brazil. Data analysis was performed through content analysis. Results: three categories emerged: nursing care to the person who attempted suicide; the adult emergency service as a scenario of mental health practices; and permanent education-related needs in mental health Final considerations: initiatives capable to potentialize good practices in mental health care are still incipient and lack encouragement in the health service. There is an urgent need to think about changes in the care culture of the emergency service, especially to ensure the scope of psychosocial care actions.

AB Exposure to toxic substances, including pesticides, can cause irreversible damage to humans, including death, and is therefore considered a serious public health problem worldwide. This is a retrospective study using data gathered by the Toxicological Information and Assistance Center of Brazil's Federal District (Ciat-DF) between 2004 and 2007. During this period, 709 intoxications with pesticide occurred in the DF and were analyzed in this study. Fifty-one percent of the intoxicated individuals were men; the events occurred mostly in the home (91%), in the urban area (86.3%) and by ingestion (84%). Children from 1 to 4 years of age and adults from 20 to 39 years were involved in 30% and 36% of the cases, respectively. Accidental intoxication corresponded to 47.1% of the cases, followed by attempted suicide (44.2%). The illegal rodenticide known as "chumbinho", the main ingredient of which is carbamate insecticide aldicarb, was involved in 35.1% of the cases, mostly in suicide attempts. In eighteen cases, the intoxicated individuals died after exposure to the pesticides, namely 15 suicides and 3 accidental poisonings. When compared with other data sources, this study identified a high level of underreporting to the Ciat-DF of intoxication by pesticide during the period under study.

AB Objective: There is a paucity of data about risk factors for suicide attempts in bipolar disorder. The aim of this study is to examine the association between suicide attempts and obesity in people with bipolar disorder.
   Methods: Two hundred fifty-five DSM-IV out-patients with bipolar disorder were consecutively recruited from the Bipolar Disorder Program at Hospital das Clinicas de Porto Alegre and the University Hospital at the Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, Brazil. Diagnosis and clinical variables were assessed with Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-axis I (SCID I) and Program structured protocol. History of suicide attempts was obtained from multiple information sources including patients, relatives and review of medical records. Patients with body mass index (BMI) >= 30 were classified as obese.
   Results: Over 30% of the sample was obese and over 50% had a history of suicide attempt. In the multivariate model, obese patients were nearly twice (OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.06-3.69, p = 0.03) as likely to have a history of suicide attempt(s).
   Conclusion: Our results emphasise the relevance of obesity as an associated factor of suicide attempts in bipolar disorder. Obesity may be seen as correlate of severity and as such, must be considered in the comprehensive management of bipolar patients.

AB Suicide is an important problem in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The importance of mental disorders and social vulnerability on suicidal behaviors is described in the literature; however, the impact of childhood traumatic events in this scenario is not clear. The aim of this study was to verify the mediation effect of mental disorder comorbidities and social vulnerability in association with childhood trauma intensity and suicide risk level. This cross-sectional study of HIV-positive outpatients was conducted in a specialized care service in the city of Pelotas in Southern Brazil. Sociodemographic data and HIV-related information were collected and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire was applied. A total of 364 patients underwent psychiatric evaluation using MINI Plus including module C of suicide risk severity. Suicide risk was present in 39.3% of the sample. The relation between childhood traumatic events and the level of suicide risk is mediated by mental disorder comorbidities and socioeconomic vulnerability. Specific psychosocial interventions in PLWHA should consider the potential role of abusive traumatic experiences in the current mental health conditions and suicidal behaviors.

AB OBJECTIVE: To quantify the occurrence of deaths directly associated with urban violence among fatal work-related accidents.
   METHODS: Verbal autopsies were performed with the relatives and coworkers of residents of Campinas, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, who died from external causes in 2015. We have also analyzed police reports and reports of the Legal Medical Institute related to these deaths.
   RESULTS: We have identified 82 fatal work-related accidents in Campinas in 2015, of which 25 were murders, 35 were traffic accidents not directly related to work activities, and three were suicides at work. The proportional mortality rate for homicides, traffic accidents, and suicides among fatal work-related accidents was estimated at 30.5%, 42.7%, and 3.7%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Urban violence accounted for three-fourths of the fatal work-related accidents recorded in the period studied.

ID PORTUGUESE VERSION; WHOQOL-BREF; SCALE; DEPRESSION; VALIDATION;
   SYMPTOMS; CARE
AB Shneidman (e.g., 1998) has theorized that psychache-general psychological and emotional pain that reaches intolerable intensity-is an important suicide-related variable, and indeed, represents a source of suicidal behavior. This conceptualization, while prominent and clinically and intuitively appealing, has received relatively little empirical scrutiny. In this study, we determined whether an index closely related to psychache, psychological quality of life, would display a special and resilient association to suicidality among 60 adult psychiatric outpatients in Brazil. All patients underwent structured clinical interviews and completed various clinical and quality-of-life measures. We found that the association between psychological quality of life and suicidality remained, even when depression, hopelessness, and other domains of quality of life were controlled. Psychache appears to deserve its place among key suicide-related variables, and deserves the attention of clinicians working with suicidal people.

AB The scope of this article is to describe hospitalizations resulting from intentionally self-inflicted injuries attended by the Unified Health System (SUS) for the 2002-2013 period. It is an observational, descriptive study of hospital admissions in the SUS arising from intentionally self-inflicted injuries in Brazil between 2002 and 2013. A decreasing trend was observed for the rate of hospitalization in individuals aged 10 and above. Hospitalizations were concentrated between 30 to 49 years of age for men, while for women it was between 20 to 29 years of age. The highest rates of hospitalization and hospital deaths were in the Southeast. The main cause of hospitalization was intentional intoxication with medication and unspecified biological substances. Studies of this type provide input for defining prevention strategies taking into consideration the most vulnerable groups and the complexity of factors associated with suicidal behavior.

AB Objective: To determine the prevalence of the risk of suicide among adolescents and to investigate associations between the risk of suicide and depressive symptoms.
   Methods: A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted with 1,379 students aged 10-17 years enrolled in state-run public schools in northeastern Brazil in 2014. The following instruments were used to collect data: a socio-bio-demographic questionnaire; the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and the International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I. Brazilian version 5.0.0). Unidimensional and bidimensional tables were constructed for the data analysis, with absolute and relative frequencies. Odds ratios (OR) and respective intervals (95% confidence) were calculated and associated with the descriptive levels of Pearson's chi-square independence test.
   Results: The prevalence of the risk of suicide was 29.7% in the population studied. Females aged between 14 and 17, those with siblings and those with depressive symptoms were at the greatest risk.
   Conclusion: The present findings revealed a very high risk of suicide and confirmed the significant that depressive symptoms are significantly associated with the risk of suicide among adolescents. Thus, it is necessary to develop suicide prevention programs for schools, with interdisciplinary primary healthcare actions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Using official data, this study analyzed violent deaths (homicide, suicide, events of undetermined intent and deaths due to legal intervention) in Brazil and Mexico in the three-year periods 2002-2004 and 2012-14, the impact of these causes of death on life expectancy in both countries and the role of the different age groups in years of life expectancy lost (YLEL). Abridged life tables were constructed for both countries for both periods. Temporary life expectancy and YLEL between zero and 80 years by selected causes and age groups were calculated for each triennium. The leading cause of YLEL among men was homicide in both periods in Brazil (1.5 years) and in the second period in Mexico (one year). Violent deaths (VD) accounted for around 16% of YLEL in Brazil and 13% in Mexico in 20122014. Among women, YLEL due to homicides and suicides showed the greatest relative increase in both countries, although VD accounted for barely 3% of total YLEL. The highest percentage of YLEL due to VDwas found among the 15 to 29 year age groups in both countries and for both sexes. The increase in rates of VD in Mexico, above all among young people, has curbed further increases in life expectancy in recent years, especially among men. Likewise, the high rates of VD in Brazil in both periods have hindered the growth of life expectancy.

AB Background: suicide is a problem with world impact and the leading cause of premature deaths. The study of its distribution over time can bring a changed understanding of parameters attributed to, and the prevention of, suicide.
   Aim: to identify the temporal pattern of suicide by systematic review.
   Methods: Pubmed (Medline), LILACS, Virtual Health Library (VHL), Science Direct and Scopus (Elsevier), Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) and PsyNET (APA) were searched, using suicide-related descriptors and terms, for observational epidemiological studies of the temporal distribution of suicide. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42016038470).
   Limitations: The lack of uniformity in reporting or standardisation of methodology in the studies selected, hindered comparison of populations with similar socioeconomic and cultural profiles, considerably limiting the scope of the results of this review.
   Results: forty-five studies from 26 different countries were included in this review. Clear seasonal patterns were observed by day of the week, month, season and age-period-cohort effects. Few studies studied by trend, time of day or day of the month.
   Conclusion: the review findings provide further evidence of substantial temporal patterns influenced by geographic, climatic and social conditions.

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze the socioeconomic background and its relationship with spatial distribution of mortality due to violence.
   METHODS: Ecological study conducted to explore the space distribution of mortality due to violence in the city of Vitoria, Southeastern Brazil, between 2000 and 2003, based on population and socioeconomic information. Mortality data were correlated with information on victim's place of residence, type of violence, gender, and skin color. Data were analyzed using space average, odds ratio, and cluster analysis.
   RESULTS: There were reported 828 deaths due to violence during the study period, accounting for 17% of all deaths in the city. Of these, 72% were homicides, 21.8% traffic accidents, and 6% suicides. Violence victims were mostly young black males, living in poorer areas of the city. In contrast, as for suicide and traffic accidents, the victims were older white females living in the wealthiest area of the city.
   CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that violence is a phenomenon occurring in all socioeconomic levels but black people at the lowest level are more likely to die from homicides while white well-off people are more likely to die from suicide and traffic accidents.

AB The objective of this study was to understand the views and work of the professionals working in a Psychosocial Care Center regarding the embracement of people who attempted or are at the risk of suicide. This qualitative study was performed at a city in southern Rio Grande do Sul-Brazil. Twenty-six semi-structured interviews were performed with the professionals of a team from a Psychosocial Care Center, in the second half of 2006. The data were analyzed and organized according to the following themes: the embracing reality - the client who attempted or is at risk of suicide in the relevant area-territory; the paths of intersectoral collaborationi; and the care provided to clients of the Psychosocial Care Center who attempted or are at risk of attempting suicide. It was observed that there is a committed multiprofessional team that aims to perform humanized follow-up care, joining efforts with different systems and sectors of civil society, with the purpose of implementing a care plan and eliminating the client's risk of suicide.

AB Some authors have reported an association of BDNF Val66Met polymorphism with suicidal behavior and/or clinical aspects of suicidal attempts. We evaluated, here, the impact of BDNFVal66Met polymorphism on the clinical characteristics of suicide attempts. The study was conducted on a cohort of 120 consecutive patients who were admitted to the Emergency Hospital of Porto Alegre, Brazil, due to a suicide attempt. Variables of univariate analyses were included in a logistic regression model to test whether the risk factors had independent effect. In univariate analyses, sex, BDNF genotype, intent and method of suicide attempt were all risk factors for high lethality in suicide attempts. After logistic regression analysis, male sex (O.R.=3.03; 95% C.I = 1.34-6.84; 0.008) and the presence of BDNF 66Met allele (O.R.= 2.62; 95% C.I = 1.04-6.57; 0.04) were significantly and independently associated with the high lethality in suicide attempts. The present study showed that BDNF 66Met allele is an independent predictor of high lethality in suicide attempts of depressed patients. This finding is important because it might allow earlier identification of patients at high risk for suicide, perhaps providing better tools for clinical care of these patients in the future.

AB Background. The objectives were to assess thoughts about suicide, plans to commit suicide and suicide attempts in the community, to investigate the use of health services following a suicide attempt, and to describe basic socio-cultural indices of the community.
   Method. The community survey was one component of the larger WHO multisite intervention study on suicidal behaviours (SUPRE-MISS). In each site, it aimed at randomly selecting and interviewing at least 500 subjects of the general population living in the catchment area of the emergency department where the intervention component of the study was conducted. Communities of eight SUPRE-MISS sites (in Brazil, China, Estonia, India, Iran, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam) participated plus two additional sites from Australia and Sweden conducting similar surveys.
   Results. Suicide attempts (0(.)4-4(.)2%), plans (1(.)1-15(.)6%), and ideation (2(.)6-25(.)4%) varied by a factor of 10-14 across sites, but remained mostly within the ranges of previously published data. Depending on the site, the ratios between attempts, plans, and thoughts Of Suicide differed substantially. Medical attention following a suicide attempt varied between 22% and 88% of the attempts.
   Conclusions. The idea of the suicidal process as a continuous and smooth evolution from thoughts to plans and attempts of suicide needs to be further investigated as it seems to be dependent on the cultural setting. There are indications, that the burden of undetected attempted suicide is high in different cultures; an improved response from the health sector on how to identify and support these individuals is needed.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of some mental disorders and suicide risk, and the association between them in youths.
   METHODS: Data from the 1993 Pelotas Birth Cohort (Brazil) was used. The prevalence of mental disorders at 22 years [major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorders type 1 and 2 (BD1; BD2), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and antisocial personality disorder (APD)1 and of suicide risk were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (n = 3,781). Comorbidity between disorders was also assessed. Association of each mental disorder and the number of disorders with suicide risk was assessed using Poisson regression.
   RESULTS: The prevalence of any mental disorder was 19.1% (95%CI 17.8-20.3), and GAD was the most prevalent (10.4%; 95%CI 9.5-11.4). The prevalence of current suicide risk was 8.8% (95%CI 5.9-9.7). All disorders (except APD) and the suicide risk were higher among women. Mental disorders were associated with a higher suicide risk, with the highest risks being observed for MDD (RR = 5.6; 95%CI 4.1-7.8) and PTSD (RR = 5.0; 95%CI 3.9-6.3). The higher the number of co-occurring mental disorders, the higher the risk of suicide.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that about 20% of the youths had at least one mental disorder. However, this prevalence is underestimated since other relevant mental disorders were not assessed. Mental disorders were associated with higher suicide risk, especially the comorbidity between them.

AB This study is a descriptive epidemiological analysis of morbidity and mortality from suicide in people aged 10 to 19 years living in the state of Minas Gerais. The source of the mortality data were the data available in the Mortality Information System, DATASUS of the Ministry of Health, over the period 1980-2002. The morbidity data were collected from the Hospital Information System, over the period 1998-2003. Absolute and relative simple frequencies of 2.338 hospitalizations and 1.212 deaths from attempted suicide and suicide over the chosen period were analyzed according to sex, age and method used. The population data used for calculating rates was extracted from the census conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. The International Classification of Diseases-ICD 9, from the years 1980 to 1995 and the 10th review since 1996, codes E950 to E959 and X60 to X84, were adopted respectively. The highest hospitalization rates were found among women. Self-poisoning was the most common method for attempting suicide in both sexes. However, adolescent males had the highest mortality rates and the most common methods of suicide (hanging and use of firearms) were more lethal than the method commonly chosen by females (self-poisoning). Based on these findings, the authors emphasize the need for preventing these events among young people.

ID ILLNESS
AB Higher suicide mortality rates are recurrently found among indigenous in comparison with surrounding populations, including Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira, in the state of Amazonas, the Brazilian city with the highest percentage of self-declared indigenous people. To understand how suicide is represented in specific indigenous contexts is a qualitative and relevant dimension, which is poorly explored. The aim of this study was to analyze seven narratives about suicide of a shaman from the most populous indigenous community of Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira. In the analytical and interpretative process, we attempted to make the practice of double hermeneutic, interpret the interpretation of the narrator, seeking support on the classical and contemporary ethnographic literature, theories about the construction of the person and of kinship in the Amerindian context. The analysis of the narratives allowed reconstructing the suicide as a phenomenon associated with conflicts that are deeply inserted in socio-cultural and historical aspects of the indigenous populations of that region, which refer to intergenerational tensions, gender and kinship. The management of these conflicts seems to be compromised, since traditional strategies appear to lose their symbolic effectiveness, and other appropriate alternatives were not found to replace them. Alcohol use, although an important element in the understanding of the suicide, should not be taken as the central explicative element, but above all as a catalyst of these conflicts.

AB Background: Bipolar affective disorder is one of most injurious psychiatric diseases, not, rarely leading patient for suicide, and its prevalence keeps increasing worldwide, notably on low and middle-income countries. For children living in northeast Brazil, extreme social conditions constitute, an environment of special vulnerability.
   Objective: Here we show that bipolar disorder incidence, between children and adolescents in this Brazilian region increased 34.2% from 2005 to 2014 and, in, the same area and age group, deaths provoked by self caused injuries also became progressively, greater.
   Results: According to DATASUS, the Brazilian national databank for public health, information, in the last five years, we observed an increase of Bipolar Disorder incidence rates under, 19 year old of about 342% in the northeast region of Brazil, while the increase for Brazilian general, population was 12.4%. If considered only patients under 10, this number is even greater, of 472%. Content of Table 2 shows this disproportion, while comparing the advance of bipolar disorder, morbidity indices nationwide and worldwide.
   Conclusion: Children living in Brazil's northeast, region are in a condition of extreme social disadvantage, what can be determinant for the recent and, sequential increase of bipolar disorder prevalence and the mortality in this age-group due to suicide, one of possible reflections of untreated mood disorders. For protecting these children is important to, identify the factors which prevent these illnesses and promote resilience for these young people. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

AB This article seeks to analyze the association between sexual violence, manic and depressive episodes, and suicide risk among young adults. This is a cross-sectional population-based study carried out with young people between 18 and 24 years of age in a town in southern Brazil. The sample was selected through clusters. The prevalence of sexual violence, manic, depressive and mixed episodes and suicide risk were evaluated, as well as the association between them. The chi-square test and Poisson regression were used for statistical analysis. The study sample comprised 1,560 subjects. Among these, 3.1% had suffered sexual violence at some point in their life. The prevalence of depressive, mixed episodes, and (hypo) manic episodes were 10%, 2.4% and 2.3%, respectively. Suicide risk had a prevalence of 8.6% in the total sample. Young people who have suffered sexual violence are more likely to be subject to mood changes or suicide risk than those who have not (p < 0.05), except for the occurrence of (hypo) manic episodes. These results revealed a strong association between sexual violence and depressive and mixed episodes and suicide risk.

AB There are few Brazilian studies on prevalence of mental disorders in suicide attempters. The available studies have mainly used secondary data and screening instruments. The principal objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of mental disorders in 96 suicide attempters seen in an emergency ward in Rio de Janeiro, Brasil (2006-2007) using the Composite International Development Interview. Most were female, young, and illiterate, and the main method was ingestion of psychoactive drugs. Other factors included history of prior attempts and use of alcohol at the time of attempt. The most frequent mental disorders were: depression (38.9%), use of psychoactive substances (21.9%), posttraumatic stress disorder (20.8%), alcohol abuse (17.7%), and schizophrenia (15.6%). Total prevalence of mental disorders was 71.9%. These findings are largely consistent with studies conducted in other developing countries. Besides access to treatment for mental disorders, public policies with an emphasis on the control of suicide methods and social responses for the reduction of suicidal behavior are needed.

AB Worldwide data shows that approximately one million people committed self inflicted violence in 2000 and that the consequences have been alarming. One person dies for this reason every 40 seconds, with another attempting to take his/her life every three seconds. This exploratory study targeting the epidemiological analysis of mortality by self-inflicted violence in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, through calculating the Standardized Mortality Coefficient and Potential Years of Life Lost. Mortality calculated from 1996 to 2007 was 4.29 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, with men (6.9) outpacing women (1.73). The age range of 40 to 59 years reached a mortality coefficient of 7.0 deaths per 100,000 residents. In relation to the distribution of years of life lost, the average age of those who died remained around 40 years, focusing on the loss of the potential social subject taken by self-inflicted violence.

AB Objective: The primary objective of this research was to identify mental disorders in patients admitted for attempted suicide to the Hospital de Pronto Socorro de Porto Alegre, Brazil. The secondary objective was to investigate suicide attempt methods; and mental disorders as well as family history of psychiatric diseases. Methods: A case-control study, where participants were selected by convenience among adult patients. Data collection was carried out over a period of seven months. The following instruments were used: Beck Depression Inventory, Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview, and Medical Outcomes Study. Results: 84 subjects met inclusion criteria (28 suicide attempt and 56 other reasons). Among the subjects with suicide attempt, 94.4% showed high risk for a new attempt and the majority presented a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, while in the group admitted for other reasons, no patient presented high suicide risk or incidence of depressive disorder. Suicide attempt methods showed strong correlation with gender: 87% of the women resorted to exogenous intoxication, while men tried more violent methods 54%. Likewise, it was found that risk behaviors in traffic can be related to emotional problems linked to commemorative dates Conclusions: The data suggest that the severity of the disorder interferes with the role of social support, as it has been verified that the greater the severity of the disorder, the smaller the social support network. Hence, the disorder overlaps with social support; that is, social support helps when the disorder is severe.

AB The scope of this article is to analyze and describe the risk factors and determinants linked to 24 suicides in the city of Palmas in the state of Tocantins between 2006 and 2009. The psychological and psycho-social autopsy method was used in order to investigate the consummated suicides by interviewing family members. It contextualized the subjects' life characteristics to understand the family dynamics and the affective, social, economic and cultural background, based on the reconstruction of the history and personality of the individuals. The associated socio-economic factors were: being male, aged between 20 and 40, single, with mixed ethnicity and basic education. The major risk factors identified were: mental disorder, alcohol and other drug abuse, disturbed family relationship and a history of previous suicide attempts. An attempt was made to contextualize and reflect on some cases reported by family members, as well as on the response of the health care teams to the demands of the families. The need to implement prevention programs and to train the primary health care professionals was considered a priority.

AB Introduction: The association between pesticide use and an increased suicide risk is a controversial issue. Previous studies have shown higher rates of suicide among agricultural workers and people living in small municipalities, but have not identified the causes of these results.
   Objective: To investigate the association between pesticide exposure and suicide rates.
   Methods: Crude suicide rates of a 15-year time series (1996-2010) were examined, followed by an ecological study using age-standardized suicide rates for the period 2006-2010. The unit of analysis was all 558 Brazilian micro-regions. Pesticide exposure was evaluated according to the proportion of farms that used pesticides and had reported cases of pesticide poisonings. The statistics were analysed using Pearson's correlation and multiple linear regression adjusted for socioeconomic, demographic and cultural factors.
   Results: Among the age group that was analysed, the mean suicide rate was 6.4 cases/100,000 per year in the 2006-2010 period, with a male/female ratio of 4.2. The times series showed that there were higher suicide rates among people aged 35-64 years and among men aged 15-34 years. The ecological analysis showed that the suicide rates were higher in micro-regions with a higher proportion of farms run by 3564 year olds, female workers and on farms with better economic indicators (higher farming income, level of mechanization and farm area). There was a positive association between the Catholic religion and suicide rates. Micro-regions with a greater use of pesticides, and with a high proportion of pesticide poisoning had the highest suicide rates for all three groups analysed: both genders, men, and women (p ranging from 0.01 to p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: This study reinforces the hypothesis that pesticide use and pesticide poisoning increase the suicide rates. However, due to the limitations of the study's ecological design, such as ecological fallacy, further appropriately designed studies are needed to confirm the causal relationships.

AB Objective: To identify sociodemographic, psychosocial and clinical differences between men and women who attempted suicide and were seen at a university general hospital. Method: This is a non-controlled cross-sectional study, sub-project of the Multisite Intervention Study on Suicidal Behavior by the World Health Organization. A standardized interview that comprised psychometric scales was used. The comparison between genders was made by means of uni and multivariate logistic regression. Results: 210 subjects (68.1 % women) participated. Women had worse scores on the WHO Well-Being Index (p = 0.005), the Beck Depression Inventory (p = 0.01) and the Psychiatric Disability Assessment Schedule (p = 0.03). In the multivariate logistic regression, men presented more mental disorders due to alcohol and drug use (26.1% vs 7%, p = 0.02) and used alcohol at the suicide attempt more frequently (28.3% vs 16%, p = 0.03). Men reported that most of the time they had been feeling "active and vigorous" (50% vs 22%, p < 0.001). Women had had more physical and sexual abuse (27% vs 8.7%, p = 0.01). Conclusion: There are some distinctive characteristics between men and women who attempt suicide. Such differences may also be present in the general population and suggest there is a need for further studies, as well as the adoption of different strategies in suicide prevention for men and women.

AB Is important to evaluate suicidal potential and related factors during pregnancy among women who have attended public health services. To determine the suicidal potential, question 10 from Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used. In this sample (N = 1,334), 8.1% of pregnant women demonstrated suicidal potential. The potential risk factors for suicide in depressed pregnant women were being single, divorced or widowed, thinking about having an abortion, and having anxiety symptoms; in nondepressed pregnant women were lower age, low education level, low socioeconomic class, thoughts about having an abortion and anxiety symptoms.

AB A literature review was carried out focusing on the main factors associated with suicide attempts among the elderly. The research was conducted between 2002 and 2013 in the MEDLINE, Lilacs, Pubmed, PsychINFO, SciELO, the Virtual Library in Violence and Health from BIREME and the Virtual Library of Public Health databases. 105 texts were selected and 75 were analyzed. Studies are on the increase in North America, Europe and Asia, rare in Latin America and do not exist in Africa. The major causal factors for attempted suicide are degenerative and chronic diseases, physical dependence, mental disturbances and suffering, as well as severe depression. Depression is the most relevant cause found, combined with chronic physical suffering, loss, abandonment, loneliness and family conflicts. Differences in gender, ethnicity, the ageing process, social issues and cultural backgrounds are also major contributing factors. The subject of suicide attempts among the elderly is a problem that is extremely relevant to the Unified Health System (SUS); however, this problem is not addressed in Brazil in theoretical or practical terms. We trust that this review can serve as a model for empirical studies to contribute to health support for the elderly and promote health in old age.

TI Geospatial, racial, and educational variation in firearm mortality in
   the USA, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia, 1990-2015: a comparative analysis
   of vital statistics data
SO LANCET PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; DEATH RATES; SUICIDE
AB Background Firearm mortality is a leading, and largely avoidable, cause of death in the USA, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia. We aimed to assess the changes over time and demographic determinants of firearm deaths in these four countries between 1990 and 2015.
   Methods In this comparative analysis of firearm mortality, we examined national vital statistics data from 1990-2015 from four publicly available data repositories in the USA, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia. We extracted medically-certified deaths and underlying population denominators to calculate the age-specific and sex-specific firearm deaths and the risk of firearm mortality at the national and subnational level, by education for all four countries, and by race or ethnicity for the USA and Brazil. Analyses were stratified by intent (homicide, suicide, unintentional, or undetermined). We quantified avoidable mortality for each country using the lowest number of subnational age-specific and period-specific death rates.
   Findings Between 1990 and 2015, 106-3 million medically-certified deaths were recorded, including 2 472 000 firearm deaths, of which 851 000 occurred in the USA, 272 000 in Mexico, 855 000 in Brazil, and 494000 in Colombia. Homicides accounted for most of the firearm deaths in Mexico (225 000 [82.7%]), Colombia (463 000 [93.8%]), and Brazil (766 000 [89.5%]). Suicide accounted for more than half of all firearm deaths in the USA (479000 [56.3%]). In each country, firearm mortality was highest among men aged 15-34 years, accounting for up to half of the total risk of death in that age group. During the study period, firearm mortality risks increased in Mexico and Brazil but decreased in the USA and Colombia, with marked national and subnational geographical variation. Young men with low educational attainment were at increased risk of firearm homicide in all four countries, and in the USA and Brazil, black and brown men, respectively, were at the highest risk. The risk of firearm homicide was 14 times higher in black men in the USA aged 25-34 years with low educational attainment than comparably-educated white men (1.52% [99% CI 1-50-1.54] vs 0.11% [0.10-0.12]), and up to four times higher than in comparably-educated men in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. In the USA, the risk of firearm homicide was more than 30 times higher in black men with post-secondary education than comparably educated white men. If countries could achieve the same firearm mortality rates nationally as in their lowest-burden states, 1 777 800 firearm deaths at all ages and in both sexes could be avoided, including 1 028 000 deaths in men aged 15-34 years.
   Interpretation Firearm mortality in the USA, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia is highest among young adult men, and is strongly associated with race and ethnicity, and low education levels. Reductions in firearm deaths would improve life expectancy, particularly for black men in the USA, and would reduce racial and educational disparities in mortality. Copyright (C) 2019 The Author(s).

AB The article describes the research realization phases of field work in ten municipalities in five regions entitled "Is it possible to prevent the anticipation of the end? Suicide among the elderly in Brazil and the possibilities for action by the Health Sector." The sample comprises 51 psychosocial autopsies of 5 elderly people who committed suicide in 9 locations and 6 in another. 84 family members were interviewed. Semi-structured psychosocial autopsies and contextual observations were used. Each interview lasted 60 minutes on average and in the majority of the cases there was more than one encounter with family members. The study consisted of a collective process that involved bibliographic review, discussion of the samples, approach strategies, field results and empirical analysis. This article highlights the theoretical, conceptual and practical preparation of researchers and production and standardization of instruments; information about existing data sources and those that are actually used; introduction of institutional credentials; assessment of the family context, difficulties and strategies for empirical study; entrance to and exit from the field; and the impact of the research on the investigators.

   Rigor and quality of research instruments
AB The article analyzes the quality and consistency of a semi-structured interview script, adapted for the study on suicide among elderly people, and presents the psychological and psychosocial autopsy method, which is the result of application of this instrument. The objective is to demonstrate how the in-depth interview and subsequent data organization and analyses were tested and improved by a network of researchers from eight regions in Brazil. Evaluation of the method was conducted before and after the application of the instruments to collect, systematize and analyze the data. This methodology was applied in 51 cases of elderly people who committed suicide in ten Brazilian municipalities. The study did more than just collect data with scientific rigor, since it also verified the consistency of the instrument used and the applicability of the method. The improved script and the instructions of how to apply and analyze it are thus presented here. The results reveal the rigor and credibility of this methodological approach tested and qualified by a multidisciplinary and inter-institutional procedure.

   Amazonian metropolis
SO REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze the narratives of family members on the suicide of older adults in Manaus, State of Amazonas, Brazil.
   METHODS: This is a qualitative study of the narratives of eight older adults, who committed suicide in the period of 2001-2012. In the analytic-interpretative process, we have tried to perform the hermeneutic double exercise: to interpret the interpretation of narrators. We have used as theoretical references authors who have investigated suicide from the perspective of gender and its correlations with the sociofamiliar context and with mental disorders.
   RESULTS: The family members would conceive the suicide of the older adults as related to losses, which would occur in a strained sociofamiliar scenario, leading to the appearance of psychopathological situations that, if not properly followed, would result in death. There would also be something inexorable in this sequence of events. The older adults, by the very time of their life, would tend to accumulate losses of different aspects in their trajectory. Their rigor and other relational limitations would simultaneously stress family relationships, favoring conflicts, and hinder adherence to treatment. This model of understanding, which has a wide support in the hegemonic medical-psychological discourse, in a sense minimizes possible self- or hetero-accusations directed at family members.
   CONCLUSIONS: Special attention should be given to identify the older adults who present losses, family conflicts, and signs of psychopathology and who do not follow-up psychosocial care services. Strategies to help older adults handle family conflicts and losses, empowering them, should be developed and made available by intersectoral actions. The adequate treatment of psychopathological conditions should be implanted in a context in which active search mechanisms also existed for older adults who abandoned follow-up. The implementation of these actions is a challenge to be faced in Manaus, State of Amazonas, Brazil, where there is a low availability of psychosocial care services, which are not articulated with specialized care services in tertiary medical conditions, and there is still low coverage by the basic care.

AB The meaning ascribed to suicidal behaviours may influence the quality of the care provided to people at risk of suicide. Such a phenomenon has yet to be properly investigated amongst nursing undergraduate students, the aim of this study being to gain an understanding of the meanings of suicidal behaviour for a particular group of nurses. The study, which utilized grounded theory, was conducted in Brazil in 2016-2017 with 30 undergraduate students. The findings indicated that suicidal behaviour, classified according to the individual beliefs and judgements of the participants, presented a significant barrier to the delivery of care and was complex and multifaceted care phenomenon. Participants were often reluctant to discuss the topic, seemingly wanting to distance themselves from the care of persons exhibiting suicidal behaviour, and to avoid professional engagements relating to suicide prevention. Significant work is required in raising both an awareness and knowledge of suicidal behaviour befitting the promotion of tolerance, emotional competency, resilience, and empathy amongst nursing students.

DT Article
AB Stefan Zweig's relationship with Brazil was without any doubt not unproblematic. There is on the one hand his famous eulogy Brazil, a Land of the Future, but on the other hand it is also the country where he committed suicide shortly after its publication. The reception of the book in Brazil can be described as ambivalent: a huge success with the general readership, but rubbished by the media. But what is most intriguing is the impact of the translation into Portuguese as it created a popular epithet that is still being used today. This article attempts to offer an explanation for this rather unusual phenomenon by closely examining the historical context in general and the reaction of the Brazilian media in particular.

ID VIOLENCE; SUICIDE
AB This study analyzed 5,690 toxicological screenings carried out on blood and viscera of fatally injured victims at the Institute of Forensic Medicine in the Metropolitan area of Sao Paulo during 1994. The screenings analyzed correspond to 39.5% of all deaths due to injury in this metropolitan area during the same period. Almost half of the victims (48.3%) presented a positive blood alcohol content (BAC). The exact proportion however, varied according to the cause of death with 64.1% of victims of drowning testing positive for alcohol, 52.3% of homicides, 32.2% of suicides and 50.6% of motor vehicle accidents. Blood alcohol concentration was also found to vary, with suicide victims presenting low concentrations and 70% of pedestrians hit by cars presenting high concentrations (0.2% or greater). Few cases tested positive for drugs other than alcohol, and of those who did, the majority were positive for cocaine. However, it should be emphasized that the methods used for the detection of substances other than alcohol were only accurate enough to detect cases of overdose. These findings highlight the need to improve surveillance of alcohol-related fatalities in Brazil and suggest an important link between alcohol intoxication and fatal injury.

AB This report describes the reasons of the suicidal behavior in adolescents, taking in this anthropologic analysis, the impact in the familiar and social context. The study was conducted during the period of March to August, 2005 using a qualitative approach and ethnography as methods. The participants of this study were 12 teenagers, assisted in an emergency hospital in Fortaleza, Ceara State, Brazil, for suicide attempt using any kind of mechanisms. As shown in the experiment's result, the main reason of the attempts was a broken heart, this as a reason of dating someone and others love relationship established between two persons. Not only broken heart was mentioned, there were also cases of problems with family bonds, the affection and the lack of attention to the individual adolescent. In this context, the inability of the health professional was very clear. Under the presented circumstances, the professional must come up with a new praxis approach. The suicide is a real fact present at the teenagers' life and it is necessary to redirect the Brazilian Unified Health System 's philosophy and operational principles of the way health professionals cope with this demanding the society to embrace the politics that cares for the human being life and wellness.

AB In the present study, clinical and epidemiological aspects of 529 intoxication cases of organophosphate or carbamate pesticides in the northwest of the state of Parana, Brazil, over a twelve-year period (1994-2005), are presented. One hundred-five of 257 patients (40.8%) who attempted suicide were admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICUs), with an average hospital stay of two days (range 1-40 days). Men corresponded to 56.4% of the cases of suicide attempts and sixteen individuals died. One hundred-forty patients intoxicated due to occupational exposure were all young adults and nine of them were admitted to ICU, with average hospital stays of eight days (range 1-16 days). Of these cases, two patients died. One hundred twenty-four patients intoxicated due to accidental exposure were mainly children and had a hospital average stay of four days. Twenty patients were admitted to the ICU, and one of them died. Overall complications included respiratory failure, convulsions, and aspiration pneumonia. Deliberate ingestion of organophosphates and carbamates Was much more toxic than occupational and accidental exposure. Men aged 15-39 years were the most likely to attempt suicide with these agents and had more prolonged ICU with significant complications and mortality

AB Background: There is evidence that depression is accompanied by inflammation, oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS) and metabolic disorders. However links between oxidative stress and suicide attempts in depressed patients are poorly understood. This study examines whether a history of suicide attempts is associated with inflammation, O&NS and metabolic disorders.
   Methods: Blood specimens were collected from study participants aged 18-60 (N=342) recruited at the State University of Londrina, Brazil, and measured for oxidative stress biomarkers: nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), lipid hydroperoxides, malondialdehyde, advanced oxidation protein products and plasma total antioxidant potential (TRAP); inflammatory biomarkers: fibrinogen, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha; and metabolic variables. Subjects were divided into those with (n=141) and without (n=201) a history of suicidal attempts.
   Results: Individuals with a history of suicide attempts had significantly higher levels of NOx and lipid hydroperoxides and lowered TRAP as compared to individuals without suicide attempts. There were no significant associations between a history of suicide attempts and inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers and metabolic syndrome. Logistic regression showed that both unipolar and bipolar disorder, female gender, smoking behavior and lipid hydroperoxides were significantly associated with a history of suicide attempts. The combined effects of oxidative stress, smoking, depression, female gender were independent from classical risk factors, including marital status, years of education and anxiety.
   Conclusions: O&NS as well as lowered antioxidant levels may play a role in the pathophysiology of suicidal behavior independently from the effects of depression and smoking, both of which are associated with increased O&NS, and classical suicide predictors, such as years of education and marital status.

AB OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of suicide risk in a group of patients who have been diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (PC) and to identify the factors that affect suicidal behavior.
   METHODS: Patients from a tertiary care oncology center in Sao Paulo, Brazil participated in this study and were interviewed after being diagnosed with low-risk or intermediate-risk PC, per the D'Amico risk classification, between September 2015 and March 2016. Patients underwent suicide risk assessment sessions using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the CAGE substance abuse screening tool before they started treatment and surveillance. Psychiatric treatment history, family history of suicidal behavior, and the use of psychotropic drugs were also examined.
   RESULTS: The prevalence of suicide risk among 250 patients who were recently diagnosed with low-risk or intermediate-risk PC was 4.8%. According to the HADS, 10.8% and 6.8% of patients had a positive score anxiety and for depression, respectively. Alcoholism was suspected in 2.8% of the group. Suicide risk was associated with anxiety (p=0.001); depression (p=0.005); being divorced, separated, widowed, or single (p=0.045); living alone (p=0.028); and prior psychological treatment (p=0.003).
   CONCLUSIONS: After being diagnosed with PC, patients who display risk factors for suicide should be monitored by a mental health team.

AB Objective: To evaluate a brief training program on suicide prevention for front-line general hospital personnel in terms of its impact on their attitudes and beliefs towards suicidality.
   Method: Forty non-clinical (e.g., security staff), and 102 clinical (e.g., nursing attendants) professionals employed in a university hospital in Brazil were evaluated with the Suicide Behavior Attitude Questionnaire [SBAQ] before the start and immediately after a 3-hour training on suicide prevention.
   Results: Surprisingly, there were no significant differences for the great majority of the SBAQ items (i.e., 20 of 21) between clinical and non-clinical staff both pre- and post-training. Furthermore, their attitudes and beliefs towards suicidality were significantly improved after training in the majority of SBAQ items, with p-values ranging from 0.01 to <0.0001.
   Limitations: Relatively small sample size, and absence of a randomized controlled design and long-term follow-up.
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that attitudes and beliefs of clinical and non-clinical general hospital personnel towards suicidality were unexpectedly similar, and reinforces the need for suicide awareness training programs in the general hospital setting. Additionally, we have shown that it is feasible to provide such basic knowledge concerning suicidal behavior to this specific population. This is particularly important for the development of suicide prevention programs in under-resourced countries. However, our results are preliminary, and further studies are needed to address a number of important questions in the field. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Research in the prevalence of and risk factors for suicidality in the postpartum is extremely limited. We present here data on the prevalence of and factors associated with suicidality from two postpartum samples.
   Method: The first sample (SC) comprised 317 women consecutively screened for a trial of psychotherapy for postpartum depression. The second sample was a population-based (PB) sample of 386 women. We used the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to assess suicidality in the SC sample and the self-harm question of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI9) in the PB sample.
   Results: According to the MINI and the BDI9, prevalence of high suicide risk was 5.7% and 11.1%, respectively, in the SC sample. Previous suicide attempts and a positive BDI were retained as predictors of suicidality. The BDI9 indicated suicidality in 8.3% of the 386 women in the PB sample; a positive BDI was retained in the multivariate analysis as a risk of suicidality.
   Conclusion: Clinicians should enquire vigorously about suicidality in women presenting with depressive symptoms or previous suicide attempts in the postpartum.

AB This article analyzes the presence of gender inequality and violence in the lives of elderly women who have attempted suicide. This survey is part of a qualitative research study developed in twelve municipal regions in Brazil with high levels of suicide, and is coordinated by Claves-Fiocruz. Information was obtained by means of semi-structured interviews with thirty-two women from a sampling of fifty-nine elderly women with a history of attempted suicide. It was decided not to identify the interviewees, and to construct a narrative based on events that have occurred in the lives of all these women. The study was based on the women's life cycle (infancy, youth, adult life and old age) to see if gender inequality had been an issue in each of these phases. The inequalities began in infancy with differentiated gender upbringing; these continued during their youth and with their sexual initiation, marriage and maturity these continued during their adult life through acts of violence committed by their partners and/or other family members which culminates in old age, when they are deprived of their independence and have lost ties, possessions and points of reference. These lives permeated with violence result in a feeling of emptiness and unworthiness, and lead many elderly women to view death as their only solution.

ID SUICIDES; DEATHS
AB Gun Buyback programs have been implemented in various forms in countries such as the UK, USA, Brazil, Australia, and Argentina. Whether or not these programs are an effective approach for reducing national violent crime and homicides, however, remains unclear. Much of the uncertainty is due to the different ways in which Gun Buyback programs have been implemented. The Australian Gun Buyback program is distinguished from Gun Buyback programs in other countries by its abrupt implementation, its narrow focus on a particular class of firearms, and its broad application across the entire population. We assess the impact of Australia's 1996 Gun Buyback program on national homicide rates using a synthetic control group quasi-experimental design, comparing the results to suicide and motor vehicle fatality trends to test for plausible alternative hypotheses. Results suggest that the Gun Buyback program significantly reduced Australia's homicide rate in the decade following the intervention (1997-2007).

TI Do Childhood Adversities Predict Suicidality? Findings from the General

AB Background
   Childhood adversities have been associated with a number of medical and psychiatric outcomes. However, the reported effects that specific childhood adversities have on suicidality vary across studies.
   Method
   This was a cross-sectional, stratified, multistage area probability investigation of a general population in Brazil, designated the Sao Paulo Megacity Mental Health Survey. The World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview was applied in 5037 individuals >= 18 years of age, in order to assess 12 different adversities occurring during childhood and/or adolescence, as well as to look for associations between those adversities and subsequent suicidality in different age strata.
   Results
   Over half of the respondents reported at least one childhood adversity. Only physical abuse was consistently associated with suicide attempts in all subsequent life stages (OR = 2.1). Among adults 20-29 years of age, the likelihood of a suicide attempt was correlated with parental divorce, whereas suicidal ideation was associated with prior sexual abuse. Among adults over 30 years of age, physical illness and economic adversity emerged as relevant childhood adversities associated with suicide attempts, whereas sexual abuse, family violence, and economic adversity were associated with suicidal ideation.
   Conclusion
   Childhood adversities, especially physical abuse, are likely associated with unfavorable consequences in subsequent years. For suicidality across a lifespan, the role of different childhood adversities must be examined independently.

AB This study was intended to analyze the intersection of experience of sexual stigma low-socioeconomic status, and suicide attempt amongst young Brazilians (11-24 years old). In each of the data collection periods (2004-2006: n = 7185; 2010-2012: n = 2734), participants completed a questionnaire-based instrument. Network analysis provided support for a Minority Stress Model, oriented around whether participants had experienced sexual stigma. Although suicide attempts decreased by 20% for participants who had not experienced sexual stigma, there was a 60% increase for those who had experienced sexual stigma. Of particular note were the increases in rates of reported community and familial physical assault, molestation, and rape for those who had experienced sexual stigma. An analysis of centrality statistics demonstrated that both experiences of this Minority Stress Model were fundamentally different, and that those disparities increased over the time frame observed in this study. At the center of this model, shortest paths statistics exhibited a direct conditioned connection between experiencing sexual stigma and suicide attempts. We discuss the social and historical contexts that contributed to these dynamics, and emphasize the need for policy change.

TI Reductions in firearm-related mortality and hospitalizations in Brazil

SO HEALTH AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Editorial Material
ID SUICIDE
AB This paper provides evidence suggesting that gun control measures have been effective in reducing the toll of violence on population health in Brazil. In 2004, for the first time in more than a decade, firearm-related mortality declined 8 percent from the previous year. Firearm-related hospitalizations also reversed a historical trend that year by decreasing 4.6 percent from 2003 levels. These changes corresponded with anti-gun legislation passed in late 2003 and disarmament campaigns undertaken throughout the country since mid-2004. The estimated impact of these measures, if they prove causal, could be as much as 5,563 firearm-related deaths averted in 2004 alone.

AB Objective: To investigate in a community sample the association of suicide-related cognitions and behaviors ("thoughts of death", "desire for death", "suicidal thoughts", and "suicidal attempts") with the comorbidity of depressive disorders (major depressive episode or dysthymia) and alcohol or substance use disorders. Method: The sample was 1464 subjects interviewed in their homes using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview to generate DSM-III-R diagnosis. Descriptive statistics depicted the prevalence of suicide-related cognitions and behaviors by socio-demographic variables and diagnoses considered (major depressive episode, dysthymia, alcohol or substance use disorders). We performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis to estimate the effect of comorbid major depressive episode/dysthymia and alcohol or substance use disorders on each of the suicide-related cognitions and behaviors. Results: The presence of major depressive episode and dysthymia was significantly associated with suicide-related cognitions and behaviors. In the regression models, suicide-related cognitions and behaviors were predicted by major depressive episode (OR = range 2.3-9.2) and dysthymia (OR = range 5.1-32.6), even in the presence of alcohol use disorders (OR = range 2.3-4.0) or alcohol or substance use disorders (OR = range 2.7-2.8). The interaction effect was observed between major depressive episode and alcohol use disorders, as well as between dysthymia and gender. Substance use disorders were excluded from most of the models. Conclusion: Presence of major depressive episode and dysthymia influences suicide-related cognitions and behaviors, independently of the presence of alcohol or substance use disorders. However, alcohol use disorders and gender interact with depressive disorders, displaying a differential effect on suicide-related cognitions and behaviors.

AB The temporal analyses of crime date back almost 200 years with mixed empirical support. In this paper, we contribute to this literature investigating the temporal variations (seasons, months, days of week, and periods of day) of homicide in a city with a tropical climate, Recife, Brazil. Invoking both temperature aggression and routine activity theory as theoretical explanations, we found no statistically significant differences across seasons or months despite modest increases in the hottest and driest months. We did, however, find statistically significant increases in homicides during the weekends and evenings. Moreover, we found evidence for changes in the spatial patterns of homicide at different temporal dimensions. Overall, we found little empirical support for temperature aggression theory and strong support for routine activity theory. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB AIM: To understand emergency nursing experiences in assisting people with suicidal behavior.
   METHOD: Grounded theory study with symbolic interactionism conducted in 2015 to 2016 in Brazil with 19 nurses.
   RESULTS: Assistance for people with suicidal behavior is critical, challenging, evokes different feelings and requires knowledge, skills and emotional control. Nurses did not feel prepared or supported, and identified recurrent gaps and problems. Nurses occupied a limited role, restricted to attending to physical needs. They predominantly manifested opposition, judgments and incomprehension about patients.
   CONCLUSION: This study presents key elements to be addressed in interventions and investigations regarding nursing support, training and supervision. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This article is the product of research undertaken in the city of Porto Alegre, in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. The goal is to bring to light and discuss a little known phenomenon attempted suicide by the elderly. Under-reporting of suicide attempts among this population makes it difficult to place this serious public health problem on the political agenda. As part of this study, we interviewed not only elderly persons who had attempted suicide, but also their family members and mental health and emergency and urgent service professionals. These interviews took place during the course of 2014. From a textual discourse analysis of the various reports, there emerged a category we will call Convergence and Non-Convergence, which deals with the relationship between the elderly population's need for care and the healthcare model in use. This study uses three short stories of individuals to question the biomedical model of serving risk situations, stressing the concept of an Expanded Clinic to provide integrated healthcare. This concept focuses on the different types of care and the uniqueness of each user, which often the biomedical model neglects. This study also highlights the need to develop a line of care for the elderly, with investments in continued education about active aging and care in times of crises, articulating a cross-sectorial network.

AB Suicide is one of the major causes of preventable death. We evaluated suicidality among pregnant women who participated in prenatal care in Brazil. A total of 255 patients were assessed using semi-structured interviews as well as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) Plus. Thereafter, Stata 12 was used to identify the significant predictors of current suicide risk (CSR) among participants using univariate and multivariate analyses (p < 0.05). According to MINI Plus module C, the lifetime suicide attempt rate was 12.55 %. The overall CSR was 23.53 %, distributed across risk levels of low (12.55 %), moderate (1.18 %), and high (9.80 %). Our rates approximate those found in another Brazilian study (18.4 %). Antenatal depression (AD), lifetime bipolar disorder, and any current anxiety disorder (as measured using the MINI) as well as BDI scores a parts per thousand yen15 and EPDS scores a parts per thousand yen11 were identified as positive risk factors in a univariate analysis (p < 0.001). These factors changed after a multivariate analysis was employed, and only years of education [odds ratio (OR) = 0.45; 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) = 0.21-0.99], AD (OR = 3.42; 95 % CIs = 1.37-8.53), and EPDS scores a parts per thousand yen11 (OR = 4.44; 95 % CIs = 1.97-9.97) remained independent risk factors. AD and other psychiatric disorders were the primary risk factors for suicidality, although only the former remained an independent factor after a multivariate analysis. More than 10 years of education and EPDS scores a parts per thousand yen11 were also independent factors; the latter can be used as a screening tool for suicide risk.

AB ObjectivesTo report worldwide trends in suicidemortality during a period that covers 7years after the 2008 global crisis.MethodsWe performed a time trend analysis with joinpoint regression.ResultsOver the 2000s, suicide mortality decreased with the largest declines observed in some Eastern European countries. The downward trends were followed by an increase in concomitance with the 2008 global crisis in some countries, including Greece (annual percentage change=+6 in men and +11.8 in women), the Netherlands (+4.2 in men and +4.0 in women), and the UK (+1.6 in men), while the pre-crisis downward trends stopped in Germany, Italy, and Spain. The joinpoint analysis also revealed long-term rises in Brazil (+0.8 since 1990 in men and +1.8 since 1999 in women), Mexico (+1.3 since 1995 in men and +3.6 since 1990 in women), the USA (+1.7 since 2005 in men and +4.2 since 2010 in women), and Australia (+1.8 in men and +3.7 in women, since 2006 in both sexes).ConclusionsDespite downward trendsin several areas of the world, in some countries suicide rates increased since the 2008 global crisis.

AB P>Purpose:
   To provide information about psychiatric comorbidity and suicidal behavior in people with epilepsy compared to those without epilepsy from a community sample in Brazil.
   Methods:
   An attempt was made to evaluate all 174 subjects with epilepsy (cases) identified in a previous survey. For every case identified, an individual without epilepsy (control) matched by sex and age was selected in the same neighborhood. A structured interview with validated psychiatric scales was performed. One hundred and fifty-three cases and 154 controls were enrolled in the study.
   Results:
   People with epilepsy had anxiety more frequently [39.4% vs. 23.8%, odds ratio (OR) 2.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-3.5; p = 0.006], depression (24.4% vs. 14.7%, OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.01-3.5; p = 0.04), and anger (55.6% vs. 39.7%, OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-3.1; p = 0.008). They also reported more suicidal thoughts [36.7% vs. 23.8%, OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.1; p = 0.02), plans (18.2% vs. 3.3%, OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0-4.0; p = 0.04), and attempts (12.1% vs. 5.3%, OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-3.2, p = 0.04) during life than controls.
   Conclusions:
   These findings call attention to psychiatric comorbidity and suicidal behavior associated with epilepsy. Suicide risk assessment, mental evaluation, and treatment may improve quality of life in epilepsy and ultimately prevent suicide.

AB Objective: To describe the prevalence of health risk behaviors and identify risk and protective factors that are associated with several health risk behaviors (cigarette smoking, drug use, onset of sexual intercourse before age 15, pregnancy, gun-carrying, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts) among adolescents in Brazil, as well as to explore gender differences.
   Methods: We estimated prevalence rates, evaluated bivariate associations, and explored multivariate analyses using logistic regression on data from a 1997 survey of adolescent health among 2059 eighth- and 10(th)-grade students in Santos, Brazil.
   Results: Youth in Santos, Brazil report high rates of gun-carrying, suicidal thoughts and attempts, sexual intercourse, and pregnancy. Factors associated with diminished involvement for nearly all health risk behaviors, for both boys and girls, included having good family relationships, and feeling liked by friends and teachers. Factors associated with increases in nearly all health risk behaviors were: gun-carrying and gun availability in the home, drug use, and sexual abuse.
   Conclusions: Factors that are associated with a wide range of health risk behaviors among adolescents in Brazil appear to parallel those found in industrialized countries: access to guns, substance use, and sexual abuse. Likewise, connectedness to family, school, and peers is consistently the protective factor associated with diminished risky behaviors. (C) Society for Adolescent Medicine, 2001.

ID ECONOMIC-CRISIS
AB Economic crisis is often managed with austerity policies. These measures seem to burden the population disproportionately, with the poorer being more affected. This paper aims to investigate health outcomes performance after the recent Brazilian crisis and gauge whether that pattern also emerged. Public domain data from 2010 to 2017 was used, and it was found that suicide and homicide rates increased after 2014, while mortality by road traffic injuries decreased at the same time. Furthermore, these trends were exacerbated in the North and Northeast regions and in the municipalities with the poorest quintiles of Human Development Index (HDI). The austerity policies followed by the Brazilian economic crisis may have influenced the mortality trends due to external causes, with a possible stronger impact in the North and Northeast regions and among less developed municipalities.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate pesticide poisonings in the southern region of Brazil between years 1999 and 2014. Data were collected from the database Sinitox. Intoxications and deaths were evaluated according to the distribution by gender (female and male), age group (<= 14, 15-59 and >= 60 years), area of occurrence (urban and rural), circumstance (accident, occupational and suicide attempt) and evolution of the cases over time (cure, unconfirmed cure, death and sequelae). In the evaluated period, 21,305 cases of intoxication were registered. The results show that males between the ages of 15 and 59 years are more affected; and there is a greater representativeness in the urban area. These results are related to the application of agrochemicals being carried out by individuals between 15 and 59 years of age. The great correlation of urban area possibly occurs in function of the air currents brought from the field and as a result, population has been more affected and the consumption of contaminated food. It was observed that women handling pesticides more cautiously, in this way the accidents with male gender are more frequent, however, many women use the product intentionally to provoke suicide.

DE Suicide; The elderly; Temporal trends; Poisson regression
AB The scope of this paper is to determine the temporal evolution of mortality by suicide in people aged 60 or more per State in Brazil between 1980 and 2009. Historical mortality by suicide data (ICD-9 codes E950 to E959 and ICD-10 codes X60 to X84 and Y87.0) were obtained from the Mortality Information System (SIM / MS). Data regarding population counts were obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. In the assessment of temporal trends the Poisson regression model was used, in which the dependent variable was the number of deaths and the centralized calendar year was the explanatory variable. Statistically significant trends were considered those whose p-value was d" 0.05. The results revealed the presence of a statistically significant increasing trend in four states and a decrease in two (general population; 60 years or more). In the male population there was an increase in five states and a reduction in two. The female rate showed an increase in one state and a decrease in three. There was an increasing trend in Piaui, Ceara and Rio Grande do Norte and a reduction in Amazonas, Roraima, and Sao Paulo for people aged between 60 and 69. Increasing rates were observed in the population aged 70-79 in Piau and decreasing trends in Roraima.

AB Suicide is a major public health concern worldwide, and mental disorders have been identified as a main risk factor. Suicide is also one of the leading causes of perinatal maternal mortality, but very few studies have focused on suicide attempts (SA) in the perinatal period. This work aims to assess risk factors associated with SA in pregnancy and in the post-partum period in women with mental health disorders.
   Women (n = 1439) with psychiatric disorders jointly admitted with their infant to 16 psychiatric Mother-Baby Units over 10 years (2001-2010) were assessed retrospectively for the occurrence of SA in pregnancy or the postpartum period. Multinomial logistic regression was used to explore the independent impact of maternal sociodemographic characteristics, history of childhood maltreatment and abuse, current mental illness and pregnancy data on SA in pregnancy and/or postpartum.
   One hundred and fifty-four women (11.68%) attempted suicide: 49 in pregnancy (3.71%) and 105 (7.97%) in the post-partum period. SA in pregnancy was related to alcohol use (OR = 2.37[1.02-5.53]; p = 0.04) and smoking during pregnancy (OR = 1.87[1.01-3.49]; p = 0.04) and also to a history of miscarriage (OR = 2.29[1.18-4.43 p = 0.01). SA in the post-partum period was associated with major depressive episode (OR = 2.72[1.40-5.26]; p = 0.003) or recurrent depression (OR = 4.12[2.25-7.51], p < 0.001) and younger age (OR = 0.96[0.93-0.99], p = 0.03).
   SAs in the course of pregnancy and the postpartum period have different risk factors. Special attention to risk of suicide is needed during pregnancy for women with severe mental illness and a history of miscarriage, alcohol or cigarette use, young age and depression in the perinatal period.

AB Suicidal behaviours are one of the most important contributors to the global burden of disease among women, but little is known about prevalence and modifiable risk factors in low and middle income countries. We use data from the WHO multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence against women to examine the prevalence of suicidal thoughts and attempts, and relationships between suicide attempts and mental health status, child sexual abuse, partner violence and other variables. Population representative cross-sectional household surveys were conducted from 2000-2003 in 13 provincial (more rural) and city (urban) sites in Brazil, Ethiopia, japan, Namibia, Peru, Samoa, Serbia, Thailand and Tanzania. 20967 women aged 15-49 years participated. Prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts, lifetime suicidal thoughts, and suicidal thoughts in the past four weeks were calculated, and multivariate logistic regression models were fit to examine factors associated with suicide attempts in each site. Prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts ranged from 0.8% (Tanzania) to 12.0% (Peru city): lifetime thoughts of suicide from 7.2% (Tanzania province) to 29.0% (Peru province), and thoughts in the past four weeks from 1.9% (Serbia) to 13.6% (Peru province). 25-50% of women with suicidal thoughts in the past four weeks had also visited a health worker in that time. The most consistent risk factors for suicide attempts after adjusting for probable common mental health disorders were: intimate partner violence, non-partner physical violence, ever being divorced, separated or widowed, childhood sexual abuse and having a mother who had experienced intimate partner violence. Mental health policies and services must recognise the consistent relationship between violence and suicidality in women in low and middle income countries. Training health sector workers to recognize and respond to the consequences of violence may substantially reduce the health burden associated with suicidal behaviour. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: To identify the association of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and psychiatric disorders in young adults in southern Brazil.
   Methods: This population based cross-sectional study involved a total of 1,023 young adults between the ages of 21 and 32 years. Current episodes of psychiatric disorders were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview-Plus version. MetS was evaluated using the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP/ATP III).
   Results: Of the 1,023 participants, 24.3% were identified with MetS, 13.5% were diagnosed with anxiety disorders, 7.5% with current depression, 3.9% with bipolar disorders and 10.1% were at risk of suicide. MetS was associated with ethnicity (p = 0.022), excess weight (p < 0.001), current anxiety disorders (p < 0.001), current mood disorders (bipolar disorder in mood episode and current depression) (p < 0.001), and suicide risk (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: MetS was associated with psychiatric disorders. Awareness of factors associated with MetS can help identify high-risk individuals and stimulate disease prevention and control programs, as well as lifestyle changes.

AB Objective To compare the psychosocial profile and suicidal behavior of 110 pregnant teenagers (PT) with 110 nonpregnant teenagers (NPT). Method Subjects were matched by age and residential district. The research instruments used were a structured clinical interview and a self-reporting questionnaire based on psychometric scales whose answers were subjected to univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results Prevalence in the PT and the NPT groups were found to be as follows: attempted suicide (20.0 vs. 6.3%); depression (26.3 vs. 13.6%); anxiety (43.6 vs. 28.0%). Univariate analysis revealed the following significant associations with pregnancy: relocation in the previous 3 years (odds ratio (OR) = 6); years of schooling <= 7 (OR = 3.4); repeating a year in school (OR = 2.4); dropping out of school (OR = 5.2); death of a parent during childhood (OR = 2.9); use of alcohol/drugs in the family (OR = 2.5); previous attempted suicide (OR = 3.6); suicide by a relative (OR = 2.1); threats of physical/sexual abuse (OR = 3.5); depression (OR = 2.2); low level of social support (OR = 4.2); traumatic events (OR = 5.1) and psychosocial difficulties (OR = 4.4); prior use of tobacco and marijuana (OR = 4.0 and 4.8 respectively); weekly intake of alcohol over the previous 12 months (OR = 4.2). Multivariate analysis identified the following associations: relocation (OR = 6.4); prior use of tobacco (OR = 2.9); dropping out of school for a period in excess of 6 months (OR = 2.3); suicide by a social acquaintance (OR = 2.5). Conclusion The PT case group exhibited a psychosocial profile whose characteristics clearly differentiate this group from the NPT control group. Preventive mental health care is needed to help PT because their behavioral pattern exposes them to high risk for suicide.

AB Objective: To evaluate psychiatric comorbidities in outpatients receiving care for HIV and Chagas disease at Instituto de Pesquisa Clinica Evandro Chagas (IPEC), Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
   Methods: Cross-sectional study with a consecutive sample of 125 patients referred to an outpatient psychiatric clinic from February to December 2010. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used. Factors associated with more frequent mental disorders were estimated by odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%Cl) by multiple logistic regression.
   Results: Seventy-six (60.8%) patients with HIV, 40 (32%) patients with Chagas disease, and nine (7.2%) patients with human T-Iymphotropic virus were interviewed. The majority were women (64%), with up to 8 years of formal education (56%), and unemployed (81.6%). The median age was 49 years. Suicide risk (n=71) (56%), agoraphobia (n=65) (52%), major depressive episode (n=56) (44.8%), and alcohol/drug abuse (n=43) (34.4%) predominated, the latter being directly associated with lower family income (OR = 2.64; 95%Cl 1.03-6.75) and HIV infection (OR = 5.24; 95%Cl 1.56-17.61). Suicide risk was associated with non-white skin color (OR = 2.21; 95%Cl 1.03-4.75), unemployment (OR = 2.72; 95%Cl 1.01-7.34), and diagnosis of major depression (OR = 3.34; 95%Cl 1.54-7.44).
   Conclusion: Measures targeting adverse socioeconomic conditions and psychiatric and psychological monitoring and care should be encouraged in this population, considering the association with abuse of alcohol/other psychoactive drugs and suicide risk.

TI Severe Depression, Suicide Attempts, and Ideation During the Use of
   Interferon Beta by Patients With Multiple Sclerosis
SO CLINICAL NEUROPHARMACOLOGY
LA English
DT Review
DE multiple sclerosis; interferon beta; depression; suicide
ID PROBABILITY; DISORDERS; THERAPY; ALPHA
AB Background: Interferon (IFN) beta is a safe and efficient drug for treating multiple sclerosis (MS). It is widely accepted that previously depressed patients may get worse when using IFN-beta. There are few reports on the association of IFN-beta and severe depression among patients without previous psychiatric history.
   Methods: Discussion of a case of a patient with MS who developed severe depression and attempted suicide while using IFN-beta encouraged us to review the subject. A group of neurologists in Brazil retrospectively gathered together their similar cases for the present paper.
   Results: The present paper reports on 11 cases of severe depression with suicide attempts or ideation among patients with MS who were using IFN-beta. These patients had no previous history of any psychiatric disease. Nine patients developed the symptoms over a relatively short period (4 months, on average). Two patients developed severe depression after more than 1 year of treatment with IFN-beta. Phobic, aggressive, behavioral, psychotic, and manic symptoms also were observed in these patients, thus suggesting the existence of a complex mood-behavior disorder associated with this drug. Interferon beta withdrawal led to complete remission of symptoms. The Naranjo algorithm established a highly probable association between IFN-beta and this adverse reaction in these patients.
   Conclusions: Although uncommon, severe depression with suicide ideation or attempts may be observed during treatment of MS with IFN-beta. This association should not discourage the use of this drug, but physicians need to be aware of this possible adverse event from IFN-beta.

AB Epilepsy has been associated with increased risk of suicide; however, few studies have examined the relationship between epilepsy and suicidal behavior. The aims of this study were to evaluate the frequency of suicidal behavior in people with epilepsy and to identify characteristics that are associated with suicidal ideation in epilepsy. Of 171 people with epilepsy identified in a previous survey, 139 were included. A structured interview was conducted, and a second psychiatric evaluation was scheduled for those who agreed. The frequencies of suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts during lifetime were 36.7, 18.2, and 12.1%, respectively. The following conditions were strongly associated with suicidal thoughts; anxiety (OR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.4-7.5, P = 0.001), depression (OR = 4.8, 95% Cl = 1.9-12.5, P = 0.001), and two or more standardized psychiatric diagnoses (OR = 21.6, 95% CI = 4.4-105.9, P < 0.0001). Although specific characteristics of epilepsy were found to be related to suicidal thoughts, psychiatric diseases also play an essential role. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study was to analyze mortality due to the main external causes of death (traffic accidents, other accidents, homicides and suicides) in Mexico, calculating the years of life lost between 0 and 100 years of age and their contribution to the change in life expectancy between 2000 and 2013, at the national level, by sex and age group. Data came from mortality vital statistics of the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia (INEGI) [National Institute of Statistics and Geography]. The biggest impact in mortality due to external causes occurred in adolescent and adult males 15-49 years of age; mortality due to these causes remained constant in males and slightly decreased in females. Mortality due to traffic accidents and other accidents decreased, with a positive contribution to life expectancy, but this effect was canceled out by the increase in mortality due to homicides and suicides. Mortality due to external causes can be avoided through interventions, programs and prevention strategies as well as timely treatment. It is necessary to develop multidisciplinary studies on the dynamics of the factors associated with mortality due to these causes.

AB Objective To investigate the prevalence of several health behaviors among students of public and private schools in S. Paulo, Brazil.
   Methods An epidemiological survey about health behaviors among high school students was carried our in S. Paulo in 1998. Seventh to eleventh graders from ten public and seven private schools were interviewed. All students were asked to fill out a Portuguese version of the questionnaire used by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in their annual "Youth Health Risk Behavior Survey". This abuse, sexual practices, dietary habits and body weight control.
   Results. A significant proportion of the students, mainly in the range of 15-18 years old, reported engaging in health-risk behaviors. In public schools, the most prominent risk behaviors were: riding a motorcycle without helmets (reported by 70.4% of the students who were either passengers or the driver); not using condoms in the last sexual intercourse (34% among those sexually active); carrying guns (4.8% in the last year), and suicide attempts (8.6% in the last year). In private schools, substance abuse was the most prominent risk-behavior: 25% reported at least on episode of binge-drinking in the last 30 days, 20.2% sniffed solvents at least once in the last year and 22.2% smoked marijuana in the same period: 13.8% reported using tobacco on regular basis. Not wearing helmets while riding a motorcycle was also very high, reported by 66.3%. Female students reported less risk-behaviors, except for suicide attempts and unhealthy weight control methods.
   Conclusions The information gathered could contribute to the development of preventative programs at school level, which takes into consideration the students' risk behaviors.

   Brazil's Long Fin de Siecle

DE Raul Pompeia; Roberto Gomes; decadence; suicidals; modernism
AB This essay considers a heterogeneous and often unreadable group of fin-de-siecle Brazilian writers that includes Parnassians, Symbolists, and Decadents. These artists imagined themselves part of a cosmopolitan, transnational movement that posed as extravagant or queer, turning their back on both emerging nationalist sentiments and urgent social issues of their time. This detachment, I argue, points to a queer mode of historicity. I further argue that an affirmative rhetoric of hope and community is insufficient to understand or cope with negative figures, that is, those who turn away from social life, communication, and, ultimately, from futurity. I first focus on two queer fin-desiecle writers who committed suicide, Raul Pompeia (1863-95) and the playwright Roberto Gomes (1882-1922). I then propose that an archive of Brazilian "suicidals" may provide ways of reading these fin-de-siecle writers, as well as others who resist accommodation in the genealogy of national culture.

AB Background: Patients burned intentionally experience extensive injuries with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Nonetheless, there is no consensus if these patients have worse outcomes than unintentional burns considering injury severity and other preexistent comorbidities.
   Methods: We conducted a ten-year retrospective review on all patients treated at the Burn Unit of Hospital de Pronto Socorro, Porto Alegre, Brazil, between 2003 and 2012. The aim was to compare survival of self-inflicted burns and burns from assaults with unintentional injuries using a MulPivariable Cox Regression Analysis.
   Results: 1734 patients were included in the study, 87.7% non-intentional, 6.6% self-inflicted and 5.8% from aggression. Intentional injuries resulted in more severe injuries and were associated with psychiatric disorders and drug abuse. After controlling for injury severity, previous clinical comorbidities and previous psychiatric disorders, only self-inflicted burns correlated significantly with a higher risk of death (HR = 1.59, CI 95% 1.05-2.41, p = 0.03).
   Conclusions: Self-inflicted injuries were independently associated with a higher risk of death. Bums from aggression were not associated with higher mortality in this model. Prevention of these injuries must be priority and treating the main associated factors such as drug abuse and psychiatric disorders may lower its occurrence. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

AB Prevalence of depressive disorders has been reported among physicians in a number of different settings. The aim of the present study is to assess the prevalence of self-reported depression and its associated factors among physicians working in the public healthcare system of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais state, Brazil.
   A cross-sectional survey was carried out in 2009 to investigate individual and occupational dimensions of depressive disorders in a group of physicians working at several municipal healthcare units. The percentage of physicians that self-reported a confirmed diagnosis of depression by another physician was used as the prevalence proportion; the Poisson regression univariate and multivariate models were applied to study factors associated with depression.
   The response rate was 81.2 %, of which 12.0 % reported depression confirmed by another physician. Reports of RSI/WMSD (p < 0.001) and passive work (p < 0.05) were positively and independently associated with the outcome.
   Our data bring valuable information that may help guide interventions and health-promoting activities for physicians by indicating concrete measures to change working conditions that affect mental health.

AB Background: Religiosity is inversely related to depression and is directly associated with positive psychological outcomes. Nonetheless, there is no consensus on whether or how religiosity could impact and protect against depression. The present study evaluated the association between intrinsic religiosity and resilient psychological characteristics in depressed inpatients.
   Methods: A sample of 143 depressed patients was prospectively evaluated in an inpatient psychiatric treatment in South Brazil, High Intrinsic Religiosity (HIR) and Low Intrinsic Religiosity (LIR) patients were compared across socio-demographic information, clinical measures, religiosity, resilience and quality of life. A linear regression model was used to evaluate the association between intrinsic religiosity and resilience, and the Cohen d test was utilized to assess effect sizes.
   Results: At admission, HlR patients showed higher HAM-D (p=0.05), BPRS (p =0.02), GAF (p=0.02), and CGI (p=003) scores, lower educational levels (p =0.04), higher social support (p =0.05), and fewer previous suicide attempts (p =0.05). At discharge, HlR patients showed higher quality of life (p =0.001) and higher resilience (p =0.000), with a large effect size difference between groups (1.02). Based on a linear regression model (adjusted r =0.19, p =0.000), intrinsic religiosity was associated with resilience, controlling for covariates.
   Conclusion: In a sample of depressed inpatients, intrinsic religiosity was found to be associated with resilience, quality of life, and fewer previous suicide attempts. These findings support the relevance of religiosity assessments in mental health practice and support the hypothesis that resilient psychological characteristics may mediate the positive effects of intrinsic religiosity in depression.

AB Introduction: Child suicidal behavior is related to specific childhood variations, constituting risk factors, including predisposing factors, internal factors, and environmental factors.
   Objective: To characterize suicidal behavior among children aged 5 to 12 years diagnosed with a depressive episode.
   Methods: Fifteen participants, aged 5 to 12, were assessed at a child and adolescent mental health center in Belo Horizonte, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. All participants had a history of suicide attempt and were in a depressive episode at the time of assessment.
   Results: Vulnerabilities related to the children themselves were self-harm, aggression, loss of an important family figure, sexual abuse, sexuality disorders, use of alcohol or other drugs, and ill-treatment. Factors of family structure and dynamics found were psychiatric illness in family members, family conflict or violence, abandonment or rejection, history of suicidal behavior in family, parents users of alcohol and other drugs, and separated parents. Factors related to school were bullying, school difficulties/delays, high school performance, bad behavior, physical aggression, school dropout, and aggressiveness. The main methods used in suicide attempts were injury by sharp or blunt objects and intentional self-poisoning.
   Conclusions: Psychiatric comorbidities and a previous history of disturbances in the family and at school are important factors to consider with relation to suicidal behavior by children with depressive episodes.

AB Background: Little is known about the extent to which delay of initiation of mood-stabilizing treatment may influence outcomes in bipolar patients (BP). In this study, our aim was to investigate the association between delay of mood stabilizer treatment in bipolar patients and lifetime history of suicide attempts.
   Method: A consecutive sample of 268 bipolar I outpatients from two teaching hospitals in Brazil was recruited. The assessment included a socio-demographic history form, a clinical interview regarding clinical variables and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Participants were divided into three groups: BP that initiated the first mood stabilizer in the same year of the first episode of the disease (FMS <= 1), between 1 and 5 years after the first episode of the disease (l< FMS <= 5), and after 5 years after the first episode of BD (FMS> 5).
   Results: The mean time from the first episode until the first mood stabilizer medication was 8.6 years (SD 9.8 years). The FMS> 5 group, showed a higher lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts than the other two groups (PR =1.75, 95% CI: 1.24-2.47), p = 0.001. These results remained significant after adjusting for potential confounders, (PR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.29-2.60), p = 0.001.
   Limitations: This study evaluated patients retrospectively and does not permit a cause-effect relationship.
   Conclusion: The present study supports the importance of early diagnosis and early intervention for BP in order to limit the potentially lethal impact of the disease. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Family conflicts and problems involve meanings that are constructed during the course of an existence, and become associated with other factors in manifestations of suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts in elderly people. These questions are analyzed in a qualitative study of interviews with elderly people in four different locations in Brazil. A total of 63 men and women took part, and the interviews were held in 2013 and 2014. The field data showed the following factors - in order of the importance that the interviewees gave to them: significant family losses; family and inter-generation conflicts; and explicit and veiled violence. The speech of the subjects showed, as elements that led them to try to end their lives: sadness; feelings of abandonment; isolation, incomprehension of their desires by their family members, and absence of manifestations of affection and/or respect. When telling their stories, they also gave clues about what they expect from their families: welcome, acceptance, comprehension and freedom to carry out their minor wishes; to end their lives in a dignified manner without suffering; to find help and protection for the progressive reduction of their capacities; to continue to participate in family decisions, and to prolong to the maximum their social achievements and prerogatives, such as property, authority and respect.

The Burn Centre provides health care to a large population from Istanbul, which is located at the crossroads between Asia and Europe. The demographic data and information of 32 patients who were admitted to the GATA HEH Burn Center in Istanbul for attempted suicide were retrospectively reviewed over a 7-year period (2001-2008). Twenty-eight of the 32 patients were men, whereas the remaining four patients were women. The average age was 25.9 years. Seventeen patients had a previous history of self-harming and 22 patients were unemployed. History of a psychiatric illness was found in 20 patients. Mean total body burn Surface area was 70%. The mortality rate was 43.4%. This Study demonstrates that suicide attempts by burning differ from Eastern and Western cultures by factors and demographic features. It has been concluded that the solution to preventing self-inflicted burns calls for the joint efforts of physicians, psychologists, and sociologists. Furthermore, it is necessary to reinstate prevention programs and revise strategies for prevention based on the country and its culture. (J Burn Care Res 2009;30:427-431)

TI Epidemiology of suicide in the state of Guanajuato.

DE Suicide; epidemiology; Guanajuato; migration; social-demograph
ID MEXICO
AB From the epidemic perspective, suicide appears as an international public health problem due to the remarkable increase of its incidence. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in the year 2000, suicide had the greater percentage (49%) in the statistics of "deaths by intentional injuries"; followed by violence (32%) and war (19%).
   This source also notifies that in countries with population over 100 millions, Mexico is the country that shows the higher increase of "changes in age-standardized groups in specific intervals of time" (+61, 9% in period 81-83/93-95). Followed in descendent order by: India (+54%, period 80-93), Brazil (+13.2%, period 79-81/93-93), and the Russian Federation (+5.3%, period 80-82/96-98). The United States of America (-5.3%, period 80-82/93-97) and Japan (-14.3%, period 80-82/95-97) have shown decreasing rates.
   The increase in the rates of suicide in Mexico has been registered by various studies, which also have proved that the States where those rates were the highest are: Veracruz, Mexico City and, in third place, Guanajuato.
   Some specific sectors of Guanajuato State show an association of two phenomena: suicide and migration, basically migrants travelling to the United States of America and Canada, both countries with a high frequency of suicides. The information on suicide in Mexico come from sources such as local or international studies, and also from reports obtained through public institutions, the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica, Geografia e Informatica (INEGI), the Secreteria de Salud (SS) and the Procuraduria General de Justicia (PGJ). Nevertheless, the data given by these institutions show discrepancies in statistics, a fact due perhaps to differences in the classification criteria for deaths, and to registration and filing mistakes.
   The aim of the present research was to collect and report epidemiological data on suicides and the characteristics of the suicidal events, in the State of Guanajuato, during the period between 1995 and 2001. To this purpose the files of the PGJ in Guanajuato State were analyzed; these files contain detailed information about suicides and the suicidal act, as well as the transcription of suicidal notes, in case they be left. They also contain declarations and testimonies from people who are close (relatives, friends, acquaintances) to the suicidal victim.
   The data gathered included socio-demographical information, migrant condition, variables related to the Suicidal act, alcohol and drug use at the moment of the event, and the transcription of the suicidal note. The declarations and testimonies from the suicide acquaintances were kept for further studies.
   The data-gathering lasted six months and was made by last semester students of the Faculty of Psychology.
   Data were analyzed according to the State distribution Of the PGJ that divides it into 4 zones: Leon, Irapuato, Celaya and San Miguel de Allende. Frequency analysis were made and for some variables, chi square statistical tests.
   Of the 747 cases of death caused by suicide registered by the PGJ in Guanajuato, during the 1995 - 2001 period, 733 were analyzed because the lacking 13 files Could not be located. From the total of cases 80.1% were men and 19.9%, women. The rank of age goes from 8 to 9 1 years. The average for men was 30 years and the mode 20 years; for women the average was 28 wars and the mode 18 years old. This shows that Suicide was committed at,an earlier age by women than by men.
   Only 10% of the whole had no schooling; almost half of the total had completed elementary Studies and 21% had attained high school level. Besides, 30% of the people who committed suicide were employees and only 1.6% were professionals.
   Regarding the characteristics of the suicidal act, the place more used to committ it, was the suicide's house (78%), mainly in the case of women (with significant difference) (p=.001). The suicide method used in most cases was different for both sexes: men preferred hanging (p=.001), and women poisoning (p=.001).
   Forty one per cent of the men had ingested alcohol before committing suicide and only 7.8% of the women. In addition, alcohol use was more frequent in the group of 35 to 44 years of age, and by those who were married. The use of other drugs was present in 13% of the total (no significant differences between sexes).
   As to the migration phenomenon, most of migrant suicides were between 20 and 34 years old. The rate of non-migrant suicides was 4:1 (4 men committed suicide for every suicidal women) and it changed in the migrant group to 3:2. This migration phenomenon is data included: returning migrants, people who were going to leave Mexico in the near future (one day or week later) and also people who had one or more close relatives living as migrant laborers in the northern countries.
   Finally, other differences found when comparing the migrant group with the non-migrants Suicidal group are: the greater use of firearms registered as suicidal method (p=.001) and the higher percentage of psychiatric medication.
   On the other hand, the higher frequency Of Suicides was registered in the month of May (13%), and the lower percentage in October (5.7%).
   State regionalization, showed the higher percentage of suicides in Celaya (254 cases), and the lower corresponded to San Miguel de Allende (103 cases).
   It may be concluded that in the State Of Guanajuato the phenomenon of suicide presents alarming peculiarities: more risked groups include children, adolescents and Young people (this sample found 42 suicidal children under 14 years old).
   Also, considering that migration is the most important social phenomenon in Guanajuato State, we may observe that it has contributed to modify the patterns Of Suicide of some population groups. This is shown by the increasing suicidal women percentage and the most frequent use of firearms, drug and alcohol usage, and psychiatric medication; a possible explanation to this has to do with the Cultural shock of the migration process.
   Although it is difficult to consider the suicidal phenomenon as a consequence of drug abuse and vice versa, from the current frequency of suicide cases involved with drugs, at least at the moment of death, we may observe that this circumstance increases the complexity and difficulty, of the suicide problem.
   Finally, we may stress that obtaining information through the files of the PGJ demonstrated to be fruitful, because they have important elements to consider in the suicide research. Data as the transcription Of suicide notes, the declaration of relatives or close friends of the suicide, and the detailed description of the suicidal event, aren't registered by Other instances. Nevertheless, it is urgent to combine the efforts of the institutions related to the study of the suicidal behaviors, in order to systematize and to unify, the official statistics. This will optimize the registration forms and add some variables aimed to favor research purposes.

AB The main purpose of this article is to examine, from a post-structuralist perspective, the coverage of the attacks of September 11, 2001 by O Globo and Folha de S. Paulo, the newspapers with the largest circulation in Brazil, on the day after the attacks. The central argument is that the performance of such papers has been fundamental in the definition of exclusionary practices at the international level, because, when they locate Brazil as an insider due to its approximation to the US and Western values after the end of the Cold War, they develop a 'foreign policy' in which societies and groups that are not adapted to this standard are classified as 'dysfunctional' and 'anomalous' in an order of 'civilized' actors. Thus, the understanding of difference - in this case, terrorist organizations and their sponsors - as otherness is consolidated and hierarchies between identity and difference are naturalized.

AB The first objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of mood, anxiety, and somatoform disorders (MASD) using the screening tool Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 Items (SRQ-20) in a community assisted by the Family Health Program (FHP) in Santa Cruz do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The second goal was to verify associations between demographic variables and MASD. We invited all residents >= 14 years of age to participate. The total sample consisted of 1,122 subjects. MASD prevalence was 38% (95% CI: 35.12-40.88). Female gender, low schooling, and unemployment were independently associated with MASD. The high prevalence of MASD observed in this study confirms the relevance of these disorders for public health planning, and could also help explain the high suicide rate in Santa Cruz do Sul in the last decade (4.66 times the national rate). Finally, the study highlights the importance of including mental health in the FHP priority agenda in Brazil.

AB To assess the associations of the perceived quality of parental bonding with suicidality in a sample of pregnant adolescents.
   A cross-sectional study with a sample size of 828 pregnant teenagers receiving prenatal medical assistance in the national public health system in the urban area of Pelotas, southern Brazil. Suicidality and psychiatric disorders were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), and the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) was employed to measure the perceived quality of parental bonding. A self-report questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic, obstetric and other psychosocial data.
   Forty-three (4.94 %) teenagers from a consecutive sample of 871 refused to participate, resulting in 828 participants. Prevalence of suicidality was 13.3 %, lifetime suicide attempts were 7.4 % with 1.3 % reporting attempting suicide within the last month. Significant associations of suicidality with the 18-19-year-old subgroup, low education, prior abortion, physical abuse within the last 12 months were present, and most psychiatric disorders were associated with a higher suicidality prevalence. Additionally, after adjustment in the multivariate analysis, the style of parental bonding was independently associated with suicidality in the pregnant adolescent, with a PR of 2.53 (95 % CI 1.14-5.59) for the maternal 'affectionless control' and a PR of 2.91 (95 % CI 1.10-7.70) for the paternal 'neglectful parenting.'
   We found that maternal 'affectionless control' and paternal 'neglectful parenting' were independent predictors of suicidality in this sample of pregnant teenagers.

AB Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among medical students, second to car accidents. We investigated the prevalence and predictors of suicidal ideation (SI) among medical students in Brazil. This is a cross-sectional study with 475 medical students of a public university. The research protocol included data on sociodemographics and academic life, and structured instruments to assess social support and psychopathological symptoms, including the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The outcome was evaluated using the BDI suicide item. Bivariate analyses were followed by logistic regression. SI was present in 34 participants (7.2%). In the logistic regression, SI remained associated with living alone, thoughts of abandoning the course, moderate or severe depressive symptoms, and probable obsessive-compulsive disorder. SI is frequent among medical students and can be identified with a simple screening question. Special attention should be given to students living alone, with thoughts of abandoning the course, and relevant depressive or obsessive-compulsive symptoms.

DT Article
AB This article questions the forms and issues of the publication of one of Stefan Zweig's last essays, Brazil, Land of the Future, by re-situating the work in Zweig's personal trajectory, as well as in the context of Brazil during the second World War. It seeks to understand how Zweig, a cosmopolitan writer, apostle of individualism and fierce critic of the nationalisms at the origin of devastating European wars, could produce a book that has been read since its publication as a paean to the cultural nationalism promoted by Vargas during the most authoritarian period of his regime. If the text has been disqualified by its characterization as ingratiatory towards Vargas, and even in Vargas' pay, this perception is less due to the work's content than to the link that Zweig and his editor fostered with the regime's sycophants and to their distance from local avant-garde modernists. The book would intensify a painful isolation, which was explicitly articulated by the suicides of Zweig and his wife. The mobilization of methodological tools from literary sociology permits us to grasp misunderstandings about Zweig and his work, and to shed light upon the particular motives at work among different actors.

AB Objective and Method: A large increase in the number of Brazilian studies on psychiatric genetics has been observed in the 1970's since the first publications conducted by a group of researchers in Brazil. Here we reviewed the literature and evaluated the advantages and difficulties of psychiatric genetic studies in the Brazilian population. Conclusion: The Brazilian population is one of the most heterogeneous populations in the world, formed mainly by the admixture between European, African and Native American populations. Although the admixture process is not a particularity of the Brazilian population, much of the history and social development in Brazil underlies the ethnic melting pot we observe nowadays. Such ethnical heterogeneity of the Brazilian population obviously brings some problems when performing genetic studies. However, the Brazilian population offers a number of particular characteristics that are of major interest when genetic studies are carried out, such as the presence of isolated populations. Thus, differences in the genetic profile and in the exposure to environmental risks may result in different interactions and pathways to psychopathology.

TI Notification of Huntington's disease as primary cause of death in Brazil
   from 1984 to 2008
SO GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Huntington's disease; Mortality; Brazil
ID PREVALENCE
AB The aim of this article was to conduct a retrospective observational study on reported deaths due to Huntington's disease (HD) in Brazil in the past 25 years (from 1984 to 2008). Data were obtained from the Brazilian Mortality Information System (SIM/DATASUS), the official system of Brazilian Mortality Database. The data obtained included information regarding the gender of the deceased and the number of death notifications, which we stratified by demographic regions and states. HD mortality per 100,000 was calculated and plotted in a graph. Linear regression was calculated using ordinary least square technique. We observed that the mortality due to HD recorded by SIM/DATASUS from 1984 to 2008 had increased at much higher rates than the population in the same period. Also, some Brazilian regions still show very low rates of HD mortality compared to the national average of deaths due to HD. These findings suggest that HD mortality has been underestimated. Ignorance about the disease as well as the fact that death from HD can occur as a consequence of heart disease, pneumonia, or suicide can strongly contribute to the misguided notification of HD as the cause of death in the official reports.

AB Current methodologies employed in collecting data for suicide research present several limitations. In this article, we describe a novel method and tool to prospectively study suicidal behavior and its related risk and protective factors in different countries. This tool is a web-based database, which will initially be developed and piloted by suicide research groups from Austria, Brazil, Chile, France, Italy, Mexico, Spain, Sweden, and the US. The database will develop and integrate research tools key to collaboration, permit exploration of ethical considerations, and provide a universal interface in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, and German that will make it possible to incorporate new groups from different countries to the network. The common database resulting of this cross-national effort will allow researchers to share and compare data across countries in a large sample of patients. Using anonymous electronic records of patients, we will: 1) determine the impact of risk and protective factors (viz. aggression and religious affiliation) in different socio-cultural environments; 2) develop a clinical model of suicidal behavior that integrates the multiple dimensions implicated; 3) try differentiating the effects of biological, environmental, and cultural factors on suicidal behavior, and 4) offer the global psychiatric research community a tool that will standardize assessment across nations, allowing for better generalization.

TI Clinical and Socio-Demographic Characteristics of College Students
   Exposed to Traumatic Experiences: A Census of Seven College Institutions
   in Northeastern Brazil
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; SUICIDE ATTEMPTS; MENTAL-HEALTH; FULL

AB Background: Epidemiological studies show that most of the adult population will be exposed to at least one potentially traumatic event in the course of his/her life; adolescence and early adulthood are the most vulnerable periods of life for exposure to traumatic experiences (70% of their deaths are due to external causes). Posttraumatic Stress Disorder is characterized by the development of dysfunctional symptoms that cause distress or social, academic, or occupational impairment, as result of exposure to a traumatic event. The aim of this multicentric study is to establish the proportion of college students, within seven institutions in Northeastern Brazil, who were exposed to traumatic experience and met PTSD criteria.
   Methods/Design: A one-phase census protocol of seven college institutions in three metropolitan regions in Northeastern Brazil was performed (April to July 2011). All students aged 18 years or older, matriculated and attending their first or final semester were eligible. The self-applied protocol consisted of a socio-demographic questionnaire and the following scales adjusted to Brazilian Portuguese standards Trauma History Questionnaire (THQ), PTSD Checklist-Civilian (PCL-C), Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11). Data were entered into SPSS 17.0.
   Results: 2213 (85.5%) students consented to participate, and completely filled in the protocols. Of these, 66.1% were woman, mean age 23.9 (SD 6.3), 82.7% were single, and 57.3% attended university outside their native cities. The total PTSD prevalence was 14%, and the median for frequency of trauma exposure was 5 events.
   Conclusion: A high frequency of exposure to violence, as well as a high rate of PTSD, suicide attempts, and high-risk sexual behavior was found in Brazilian college students. This highlights the importance of effective public health actions in relation to the prevention and treatment of PTSD and other dysfunctional behaviors resulting from traumatic exposure in young individuals, usually an at risk population for violence and traumatic situations.

AB Background: Suicidal behavior and its correlates remain relatively understudied in pregnant teenagers.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study with a consecutive sample of pregnant teenagers recipient of prenatal medical assistance by the national public health system in the urban area of Pelotas, southern Brazil. Sample size was estimated in 871 participants. Suicidal behavior and psychiatric disorders were assessed with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview; the Abuse Assessment Screen was used to identify physical or sexual abuse; social support was assessed with the Medical Outcomes Survey Social Support Scale; a self-report questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic, obstetric and other psychosocial data.
   Results: Forty three (4.94%) teenagers refused to participate, resulting in 828 participants. Prevalence of suicidal behavior was 13.3%; lifetime suicide attempts were referred by 7.4%, with 1.3% reporting attempting suicide within the last month. After adjustment, we found significant associations of suicidal behavior with the 18-19 years old subgroup, low education, prior abortion, previous major depression, and physical abuse within the last 12 months. Pregnant teenagers with high social support showed prevalence ratios (PR) 67% lower (PR: 0.33; 95%CI: 0.19-0.56) than those with low social support. Furthermore, a wide range of psychiatric disorders, most notably major depressive disorder (PR: 2.75; 95%CI: 1.34-5.63) and panic disorder (PR: 6.36; 95%CI: 1.61-25.10), remained associated with suicidal behavior after adjustment. Limitations: The cross-sectional design precludes causal inferences.
   Conclusions: We found that suicidal behavior is a relatively common feature in pregnant teenagers, frequently associated with psychiatric disorders. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Current diagnostic criteria cannot capture the full range of bipolar spectrum. This study aims to clarify the natural co-segregation of manic-depressive symptoms occurring in the general population.
   Methods: Using data from the Sao Paulo Catchment Area Study, latent class analysis (LCA) was applied to eleven manic and fourteen depressive symptoms assessed through CIDI 1.1 in 1464 subjects from a community-based study in Sao Paulo, Brazil. All manic symptoms were assessed, regardless of presence of euphoria or irritability, and demographics, services used, suicidality and CIDI/DSM-IIIR mood disorders used to external validate the classes.
   Results: The four obtained classes were labeled Euthymics (EU; 49.1%), Mild Affectives (MA; 31.1%), Bipolars (BIP; 10.7%), and Depressives (DEP; 9%). BIP and DEP classes represented bipolar and depressive spectra, respectively. Compared to DEP class, BIP exhibited more atypical depressive characteristics (hypersomnia and increase in appetite and/or weight gain), risk of suicide, and use of services. Depressives had rates of atypical symptoms and suicidality comparable to oligosymptomatic MA class subjects.
   Limitations: The use of lay interviewers and DSM-IIIR diagnostic criteria, which are more restrictive than the currently used DSM-IV TR.
   Conclusions: Findings of high prevalence of bipolar spectrum and of atypical symptoms and suicidality as indicators of bipolarity are of great clinical importance, due to different treatment needs, and higher severity. Lifetime sub-affective and syndromic manic symptoms are clinically significant, arguing for the need Of revising DSM bipolar spectrum categories. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Brazil is the world's largest consumer of agricultural pesticides. That represents a serious public health problem caused by the population and environment exposure to those products. Purpose: To identify intoxications by agricultural pesticides in Tocantins during the years 2010-2014. Method: descriptive and exploratory study, having as a secondary data source the Notifiable Disease Information System (SINAN), making use of selected variables. Results: In the total, women are shown as the most affected by exogenous intoxications and men by agriculture pesticides, mainly the general farmer workers. The age groups most affected by agriculture pesticides are 20-29 years and 30-39 years. The most commonly reported toxic agents were insecticides (29.28%) and herbicides (27.07%). The most frequent activities were spraying (29.28%) and dilution (15.47%) and the main routes of exposure/contamination were the digestive and respiratory ones. In terms of exposure/contamination the accidental (49.17%), suicide attempt (32.60%) and environmental (14.64%) were the most present ones. Conclusions: The data reveal a serious picture that requires attention from the managers in facing that public health problem. This scenario represents a great and challenging issue for Brazil, the public health system - SUS, especially concerning health care, sanitary and epidemiological surveillance and environmental and worker health.

AB The present study aimed to assess mortality rates and related demographic factors among indigenous peoples in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Central-West Brazil, compared to the State's general population. Mortality rates were estimated based on data obtained from the Health Care Database for Indigenous Peoples and monthly patient care records as well as demographic data from the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS) and mortality data from the SUS Mortality Database. Compared to the overall population, among indigenous peoples there were proportionally more individuals under 15 years of age and fewer elderly, besides higher mortality rates at early ages and from infectious and parasitic diseases. Indigenous men showed significantly higher mortality rates from external causes and respiratory and infectious diseases, while among women the mortality rates from external causes and infectious diseases were higher. Suicide rates among young indigenous individuals were also particularly alarming. Indigenous people's health conditions are worse than those of the general population in Mato Grosso do Sul.

AB We investigated a series of patients with epileptic psychosis in Brazil and compared our findings with those of other authors. We evaluated 38 outpatients with epileptic psychosis with a semistructured clinical interview, Annett inventory for hand dominance, international classifications for seizures and syndromes, and DSM-IV for psychosis diagnoses. We studied course and outcome for epilepsy and psychosis. Gender distribution was approximately even. Epilepsy and psychiatric disorders among relatives and early CNS insults in personal histories were frequent findings. Mean age of epilepsy onset was 9.3 years. Epilepsy started before psychosis in all cases, and evolved to clinical refractoriness. There was a predominance of temporal lobe epilepsy. Mean age of psychosis onset was 27.4 years, after a mean duration of epilepsy of 18.1 years, with predominance of schizophrenic presentations with interictal onset, frequent psychiatric admissions, suicide attempts, and postpsychosis functional decline. Tumors or lesions of an embryologic nature were uncommon, but mesial temporal sclerosis was frequent. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

AB This study examined compulsive sexual behavior (CSB) and psychopathology in a treatment-seeking sample of men in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Eighty-six men (26% gay, 17% bisexual, 57% heterosexual) who met diagnostic criteria for excessive sexual drive and sexual addiction completed assessments consisting of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, a structured clinical interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders Clinical Version (segment for Impulse Control Disorder), Sexual Compulsivity Scale (SCS), and questions about problematic CSB. The average SCS score for our sample was above the cut-off score reported in other studies, and 72% of the sample presented at least one Axis I psychiatric diagnosis. There were no differences among gay, bisexual, and heterosexual men on SCS scores and psychiatric conditions, but gay and bisexual men were more likely than heterosexual men to report casual sex and sex with multiple casual partners as problematic behaviors. SCS scores were associated with psychiatric co-morbidities, mood disorder, and suicide risk, but diagnosis of a mood disorder predicted higher SCS scores in a regression analysis. The study provides important data on the mental health needs of men with CSB in Sao Paulo, Brazil. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Peculiarities associated with the site and type of death impact the interpretation of entomological evidence in forensic investigations. We investigated the diversity and time to emergence of necrophagous species associated with a hanged cadaver in a city exposed to high levels of homicide in Brazil. Six species of four families of Diptera (Calliphoridae, Fanniidae, Muscidae and Sarcophagidae) colonized the corpse, of which Chrysomya albiceps (Calliphoridae) corresponded to 97% of all emerged adults. We provide supporting evidence for the record of Fannia pusio (Fanniidae) and for Hydrotaea aenescens (Muscidae) as colonizers of human cadavers. The time elapsed from collection of larvae until emergence of adults varied from 8 days (Chrysomya megacephala) until 19 days for F. pusio. A higher density of maggots occurred on the soil immediately below the cadaver when compared with the body. The use of time of development of both C. albiceps and C. megacephala provided similar estimations of the minimum post-mortem interval and suggested that death occurred approximately 36 hours prior to the discovery of the body. This case provides a novel collaboration between entomologists and forensic police in north-eastern Brazil and reinforces the importance of Fanniidae as a forensically important group in medico-legal investigations.

AB The article analyses the quality and consistency of a comprehensive interview guide, adapted to study attempted suicide and its ideation among the elderly, and imparts the method followed in applying this tool. The objective is to show how the use of a semi-structured interview and the organization and data analysis set-up were tested and perfected by a network of researchers from twelve universities or research centers in Brazil, Uruguay and Colombia. The method involved application and evaluation of the tool and joint production of an instruction manual on data collection, systematization and analysis. The methodology was followed in 67 interviews with elderly people of 60 or older and in 34 interviews with health professionals in thirteen Brazilian municipalities and in Montevideo and Bogota, allowing the consistency of the tool and the applicability of the method to be checked, during the process and at the end. The enhanced guide and the instructions for reproducing it are presented herein. The results indicate the suitability and credibility of this methodological approach, tested and certified in interdisciplinary and interinstitutional terms.

AB The present study aimed to evaluate whether variables related to personal and academic characteristics, past history, habits, and addictions were associated with suicidal behavior. Medical records of patients attending the Outpatient Psychiatry Department at the State University of Maringa between July 2016 and December 2017 were included in this retrospective study. The studied population was divided into two groups: 80 employees and 158 students. After performing the univariate analysis using Pearson's chi-square test or Fischer's exact test, the variables with p < 0.30 were included in a multivariate analysis using the binary logistic regression's backward stepwise method. The covariates 'childhood and adolescence maltreatment' and 'treatment phase' were highlighted. The first variable acts as a predictor of suicide attempt, increasing its likelihood by 9.86 times in employees and 5.62 times in students. On the other hand, the treatment phase represents a risk in patients in the adjustment phase and it serves as a predictor of SITBs in employees and students, increasing its likelihood by 7.68 and 8.66 times, respectively.

AB ObjectiveThe aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between peripheral levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) in individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) with and without suicide risk (SR), and controls.
   MethodsA total of 120 young adults (40 controls, 40 subjects with BD without SR, and 40 subjects with BD with SR) were enrolled from a population-based study carried out in the city of Pelotas, Brazil. BD and SR were assessed through the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI 5.0), and peripheral markers were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
   ResultsLevels of CRH were significantly lower both in subjects with BD without SR (p=0.04) and subjects with BD with SR (p=0.02) when compared to controls. However, levels of IL-1 were increased in subjects with BD with SR (p=0.05) when compared to controls. Sociodemographic and clinical variables, current mood episode, and use of psychiatric medications were not associated with changes in these markers. No correlation was found between peripheral levels of CRH and IL-1 (p=0.60) in the population or in the BD with SR group (p=0.88).
   ConclusionsThese results suggest that peripheral mechanisms linking stress hormones and the immune system might be critical patterns involved in suicidal behavior associated with BD.

AB Objective. This article describes the characteristics of violence-related injury (VRI) cases presenting at emergency departments (EDs) in Brazil and compares circumstances for assault-related and self-inflicted cases.
   Methods. The study is cross-sectional. The data describe cases seen in September 2006 in 62 EDs, representing all 26 states and the Federal District. A total of 4 835 case records were analyzed. Basic statistical tabulations were complemented by logistic regression analysis to assess potential associations between type of violence (assault or self-harm) and multiple factors.
   Results. Males comprised 72.8% of cases while those aged 20 to 29 comprised 35.4%. Alcohol use was reported or suspected in 42.7% of cases, more commonly among males. Assault victims comprised 91.4% of cases versus self-inflicted injuries, which accounted for 8.6%. Three-fourths of the assault victims were male, while over half of the self-inflicted injury victims were female. The leading mechanism for assaults was physical force/blunt objects (46.2%), whereas poisoning was the predominant mechanism for self-inflicted injuries (71.4%). Younger females were significantly more likely to have been victims of self-inflicted injuries than younger males, while younger males were more likely to have been victims of assault; this finding is more pronounced in cases where alcohol use was reported. Self-inflicted injuries were significantly more likely to occur in residences, while assaults were more likely to occur away from home.
   Conclusion. These results can improve understanding of the scope and characteristics of VRIs in Brazil (and thus contribute to national injury prevention efforts), and help identify areas for future research.

AB The article aimed to characterize pathological gambling, showing the main consequences of this disorder. Bibliographic survey on this theme was conducted, covering both national and international literature. Publications whose main findings emphasized related prevalence, social and economic costs, gambling legalization and resulting impact on public health, were selected. High suicide rate, comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders, family and work problems, and illicit behavior were consequences reported. The prevalence of this disorder is higher in countries that have legalized gambling and in Brazil there is evidence of growth in the number of pathological gamblers. The development of national research is fundamental to define public policies that are adequate for the Brazilian context.

AB Background: The prevalence of depressive symptoms (DS) before cosmetic breast surgery was analyzed in the public (PbI) and private (PrI) institutions, comparing types of surgery and patients' sociodemographic characteristics.
   Methods: A cross-sectional, observational, analytical study to evaluate the prevalence of DS in 185 patients of 18-71 years of age requesting 4 different cosmetic breast surgeries (with and without implants) at public and private institutions. Patients were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory and analyzed for statistical comparison.
   Results: The most common surgical procedures were reduction mammoplasty in the PbI and augmentation mammoplasty in the PrI. The prevalence of the positive risk for depressive disorder (15 points in Beck Depression Inventory) in the PbI was 25.8%, whereas in the PrI: 11.4% (P = 0.012). Moderate and severe DS were, respectively, 120% and 242% higher in the PbI than in the PrI. No patients requesting mastopexy without implants had DS. The highest prevalence (51.4%) of DS occurred in patients with breast implants indications (augmentation mammoplasty and mastopexy with implants). The presence (P = 0.12) or absence (P = 0.33) of implant did not demonstrate a higher risk of DS. Among all patients, 7% answered positively to the statements on suicide ideation, with predominance within the group of implants (54.5%). There were significant differences between the PbI and PrI.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of DS was high (18.9%), with the risk being 2.3 times greater in the PbI. Patients from PbI and PrI showed significant different profiles. Patients for breast implants showed a higher score for suicide ideation.

AB This study aimed to describe the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and to identify the factors associated with Current Suicide Risk (CSR) in the first trimester of pregnancy. The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) was employed to diagnose mental disorders in 239 women enrolled in a prospective cohort in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Serum lipids, leptin and socio-economic status were the independent variables. CSR, the dependent variable, was entered as binary (yes/no) variable into crude and adjusted Poisson regression models with robust variances. CSR was found to be the main psychiatric syndrome (18.4%), followed by agoraphobia (17.2%), major depressive disorder (15.1%) and generalized anxiety disorder (10.5%). Women with CSR showed higher mean levels of cholesterol (169.2 vs. 159.2; p=0.017), high density lipoprotein (50.4 vs. 47.7; p=0.031) and low density lipoprotein (102.8 vs. 95.6; p=0.022) when compared to women without CSR. The adjusted regression model showed a higher prevalence ratio (PR) of CSR among pregnant women with generalized anxiety disorder (PR=2.70, 95% CI: 1.36-5.37), with >= two parturitions (PR= 2.46, 95% CI: 1.22-4.93), and with major depressive disorder (PR=2.11, 95% CI: 1.08-4.12). We have shown that generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder and higher parity are associated with CSR in the first trimester of pregnancy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB It is important to investigate the care given to people with suicidal behavior, as it is an important predictor of future death by suicide and there is a lack of studies on this issue in Brazil. This study had the objective of investigating assistance related to suicidal behavior at a mobile emergency service and sociodemographic and clinical associated factors. This was a quantitative, cross-sectional study based on documental information. The data were collected through manual consultation of nursing records in which call-outs for suicidal behavior in the year 2014 were documented. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test, correlation tests, and comparison of means tests. In the 313 records analyzed there was a pre-dominance of adult women with self-inflicted drug poisoning, attended to in their own residence and referred to pre-hospital emergency medical services. There was a lack of documentation on signs, symptoms, and grievances in most cases. The interventions most carried out by the nurses were related to monitoring of clinical parameters. There were differences related to the victim's sex and lethality, suicide attempt method, referral to emergency services, and semester of occurrence (January-June, July-December). Suicide attempts through self-poisoning or self-inflicted injuries differed in relation to time of call-out, waiting time, lethality, documentation on clinical assessment and interventions, and referral to emergency services. This study enabled the charting of factors linked with suicidal behavior and associated factors; it offers reflections on limitations and nursing care potential in the prevention of reoccurrence of suicidal behavior.

AB Objective: To estimate the prevalence of suicide risk (SR) and major depressive episodes (MDEs) in early pregnancy, as well as the relationship of serum fatty acid status to these outcomes.
   Methods: Cross-sectional analyses were performed on data from 234 pregnant women enrolled in a prospective cohort study in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. SR and MDE were defined according to the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Fatty acid compositions were determined for serum samples obtained between the 6th and 13th gestational week. Fatty acid data were expressed as the percent of total fatty acids, converted to Z scores and then entered as continuous variables in logistic regression models.
   Results: The prevalence of SR was 19.6% and that of MDE was 17.0%. In the adjusted logistic regressions, a higher likelihood of SR was observed among women with higher arachidonic acid levels [AA (20:4, OR=1.45, 95%CI 1.02-2.07] and adrenic acid levels [AdA (22:4, n-6) OR=1.43, 95%CI 1.01-2.041. A higher likelihood of MDE was also observed among women with higher AA levels [OR=1.47, 95%CI 1.03-2.10] and AdA levels [OR=1.59, 95%CI 1.09-2.32].
   Conclusion: Higher serum levels of AA and AdA were associated with a greater likelihood of SR and MDE among pregnant Brazilian women. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

AB Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) was recently included in DSM-5 as a full diagnostic category. Few studies have investigated PMDD in a community sample of young adults, especially in Brazil. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and the factors associated with PMDD in a community sample of 727 young adult women between the 18 and 24 years of age in southern Brazil. This was a cross-sectional population-based study. The data were collected from 2012 to 2014. PMDD was assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatry Interview (M.I.N.I. - Plus). The prevalence of PMDD was 17.6%. PMDD was significantly higher among older women, and in women from lower socio-economic status. A trend towards significance was found for women without a current occupation (study or work). The comorbidities significantly associated with PMDD were current major depression disorder, agoraphobia, bipolar disorder, current suicide risk, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and specific phobia. The high prevalence found in the present study should be interpreted considering a retrospective report. However, our data showed that clinicians should be alert for PMDD symptoms, especially among young adult women.

AB Fiscal austerity policies have been used as responses to economic crises and fiscal deficits in both developed and developing countries. While they vary in regard to their content, intensity and implementation, such models recommend reducing public expenses and social investments, retracting the public service and substituting the private sector in lieu of the State to provide certain services tied to social policies. The present article discusses the main effects of the recent economic crisis on public health based on an updated review with consideration for three dimensions: health risks, epidemiological profiles of different populations, and health policies. In Brazil, the combination of economic crisis and fiscal austerity policies is capable of producing a direr situation than those experienced in developed countries. The country is characterized by historically high levels of social inequality, an under-financed health sector, highly prevalent chronic degenerative diseases and persisting preventable infectious diseases. It is imperative to develop alternatives to mitigate the effects of the economic crisis taking into consideration not only the sustainability of public finance but also public well-being.

AB Objective: To estimate the frequency of depression/anxiety and to establish the social, epilepsy and psychiatric characteristics in individuals with epilepsy. Method: A cross-sectional study was employed to evaluate 153 subjects with epilepsy who were identified in a previous community-based survey. First, a structured interview was conducted, followed by a psychiatric evaluation. Subjects with depression were compared to those without, and subjects with anxiety were compared to those without. Results: The prevalence of anxiety and depression was 39.4 and 24.4%, respectively. Both were associated with low schooling (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.6 to 9.0 and OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.2 to 6.5 for depression and anxiety, respectively), lifetime suicidal thoughts (OR 4.4, 95% CI 1.9 to 10.3 and OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.7 to 7.7) and lifetime suicide attempts (OR 9.3, 95% CI 2.6 to 32.8 and OR 6.9, 95% CI 1.8 to 26.4). Conclusion: The high rates of depression and anxiety reinforced the need for recognition and treatment of mental disorders in epilepsy.

AB Background: Children exposed to substance use in their families are vulnerable to multiple risk factors in their development and at increased risk for emotional and behavioral problems. The aims of the study were as follows 1) estimate the prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems among children aged 6-11 years old, living with addicted family members in a low-income urban community of Sao Paulo, Southeastern Brazil; 2) evaluate the children's exposure to family psychosocial stressors and substance use; and 3) investigate the factors related to the increased risk of emotional and behavioral problems and substance use.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 101 children aged 6-11 years old (M = 9.16 years, SD = 1.61). The instruments used were a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Psychosocial Stress Factors (PSF).
   Results: High prevalence of problems was found for this sample: the CBCL showed 26.7% of clinical scores for Internalizing Problems, 40.6% for Externalizing Problems, and 40.6% for Total Problems. Exposure to family psychosocial stressors was also high, including severe disease (33%), physical aggression (28.9%), death (27.8%), psychiatric hospitalization (16.7%), suicide attempts (15.5%), and suicide (9.3%). Exposure to these family stressors was associated with an increase of two to four times in the prevalence of internalizing and externalizing problems.
   Conclusions: Children exposed to substance abusers have more mental health problems than general population, even when compared to peers living in similar low-income areas. This is a group that should be target of a selective preventive intervention.

AB Major depressive disorder (MDD) is among the most prevalent neuropsychiatric disorders associated with HIV infection; however, its risks and neurobiologic correlates in diverse cultures are poorly understood. This study aimed to examine the frequency of MDD among HIV+ participants in southern Brazil. We hypothesized that the frequency and severity of MDD would be higher among individuals with HIV+ compared with HIV- and higher in HIV subtype B compared with C. Individuals with HIV (n = 39) as well as seronegative controls (n = 22) were enrolled in a cross-sectional, prospective, observational study. Current and lifetime history of MDD was diagnosed by MINI-Plus; symptom severity was assessed by Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Current and past episodes of MDD were significantly more frequent in the HIV+ versus HIV- group: current MDD, 15 (38.5 %) vs. 0 (0 %), p = 0.0004; past MDD, 24 (61.5 %) vs. 3 (13.6 %), p = 0.0004. The median BDI-II score in the HIV+ group was significantly higher than that in the HIV- (13 (8-27.5) vs. 2.5 (1-5.5); p < 0.0001). Current suicide risk, defined as during the last month, was found in 18 % of participants in the HIV-positive and none in the HIV-negative group. Neither current MDD frequency (8 (57.1 %) vs. 6 (40 %), p = 0.47) nor BDI-II score differed across subtypes B and C. HIV+ group may be more likely to experience current MDD than HIV-. This was the first study to compare the frequency and severity of MDD in HIV subtypes B and C; we found no difference between HIV subtypes B and C.

AB When patients smoke cigarettes in psychiatric services, it brings to the forefront current ethical and political dilemmas. This study aims to explore the meaning attributed to smoking by mental health patients who smoke and who are hospitalized in a psychiatric ward of a general hospital. This qualitative descriptive study was conducted with 96 smokers who were hospitalized in a psychiatric ward in Brazil. Semi-structured interviews, test of nicotine dependence, and content thematic analysis were carried out. The results show that tobacco has an important role in the lives of psychiatric patients. The meanings they attribute to tobacco use are related to overcoming difficulties that are consequential of mental disorders and of side effects caused by their treatments.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LEGAL MEDICINE

DE Chumbinho; Aldicarb; Carbamate; Pesticides; Fatal intoxication
ID PESTICIDES
AB Chumbinho is the popular name given to carbamate aldicarb (Temik), an insecticide commonly used in agriculture and highly toxic (LD50 = 0.9 mg/kg oral in rats) that has been sold clandestinely in several regions of Brazil. Chumbinho is sold illegally as raticide and is available in a formulation of small black granules which are easily mixed with food for criminal purposes, its use often being attributed to accidents and suicides, hence the importance of its inclusion in the toxicology studies of suspicious deaths. With the corpse putrefaction, many pathological and toxicological anatomical parameters are damaged or lost. This study emphasizes the importance of the gastric content observation, which in this case has, despite the advanced putrefaction, recognized the presence of chumbinho and guide its toxicological confirmation.

DE External Causes; Homicide; Mortality; Information Systems
AB This study analyzed the quality of data from the Mortality Information System (SIM) for deaths due to external causes in the State of Parana, Brazil, 1979 to 2005, focusing on events of undetermined intent. Deaths were grouped in motor vehicle accidents, homicides, suicides, and events of undetermined intent, and proportional mortality and relative annual variation of rates over the three-year period were analyzed. Motor vehicle accidents (more than 30% of the total) were the most frequent causes of death throughout the period, and since 1997 homicides have become the second most frequent cause. Deaths due to events of undetermined intent caused by weapons (firearms or knives) decreased from 4.8% in 1981 to 0.3% in 2005. Mortality rates for events of undetermined intent (overall) decreased from 14.9 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants in 1979-81 to 2.0 in 2003-05. Annual percentage variation was 13.1% from 1980 to 1985, -6% from 1996 to 2000, and -11% from 2000 to 2004. The findings show the good quality of SIM data on external causes in the State of Parana, allowing analyses with the potential to support programs to prevent injuries as well as health promotion measures.

   Impact on Hospital-Treated Suicide Attempt (Overdose) in Tehran
SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
ID SPORTS; RATES
AB Social influences on suicidal behaviors may be important but are less frequently studied than the influences of mental illness, physical illness, and demographic variables. Major international sporting events may have an impact on suicidal behaviors at the national and local level, an effect possibly mediated by gender and age. We examined the association of hospital-treated deliberate self-poisoning episodes (by gender and by age) in Tehran: before, during, and after the 2014 FIFA World Cup held in Brazil, in which the Iranian national team participated and was eliminated after the pool games. We used a time series analysis within an autoregressive integrated moving average model and found a significant increase in hospital-treated deliberate self-poisoning during the 4-week period of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil in females but a nonsignificant increase in males. A significant increase was also seen in the youngest age group (12-20years), but not in the two older age groups. If the effects of nonsuccess at major international sporting events could be shown to have a potential harmful effect on aggregate local or national rates of suicidal behaviors, the possibility of preventative interventions and preemptive additional service provision could be planned in advance of these events.

DE Attempted suicide; Ideation; The elderly; Prevention
ID BEHAVIOR
AB Sixty cases of suicidal attempts and ideations among elderly people from thirteen Brazilian municipalities were studied, with the objective of discovering, from what they had to say, their reasons and interpretations for attempting to take their own life. The study, with a hermeneutic and dialectic basis, was based on an interview guide, to steer the conversation with these individuals. It starts with a sociodemographic classification and looks in depth at the person's situation according to their social, community and family circumstances and their physical and mental health, functional capacity, and the reasons given for the suicidal ideations and attempts. This field information was first analysed locally and then cross-categorized according to the method used, severity of the events and reasons given by the elderly people, by sex, age, socioeconomic profile and risk and protection factors. A comprehensive, critical and interpretative summary was made of the material. The results show that failure to listen to and the isolation of elderly people, lack of awareness of the risks on the part of family, the association with physical and mental, functional, social and family losses and violence are predisposing factors, and concurrent in many cases. The conclusion is that vulnerability and self-neglect are reduced where there is family support, care and bonds of unity.

AB IMPORTANCE Understanding global variation in firearm mortality rates could guide prevention policies and interventions.
   OBJECTIVE To estimate mortality due to firearm injury deaths from 1990 to 2016 in 195 countries and territories.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study used deidentified aggregated data including 13 812 location-years of vital registration data to generate estimates of levels and rates of death by age-sex-year-location. The proportion of suicides in which a firearm was the lethal means was combined with an estimate of per capita gun ownership in a revised proxy measure used to evaluate the relationship between availability or access to firearms and firearm injury deaths.
   EXPOSURES Firearm ownership and access.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cause-specific deaths by age, sex, location, and year.
   RESULTS Worldwide, it was estimated that 251 000 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 195 000-276 000) people died from firearm injuries in 2016, with 6 countries (Brazil, United States, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, and Guatemala) accounting for 50.5%(95% UI, 42.2%-54.8%) of those deaths. In 1990, there were an estimated 209 000 (95% UI, 172 000 to 235 000) deaths from firearm injuries. Globally, the majority of firearm injury deaths in 2016 were homicides (64.0%[95% UI, 54.2%-68.0%]; absolute value, 161 000 deaths [95% UI, 107 000-182 000]); additionally, 27% were firearm suicide deaths (67 500 [95% UI, 55 400-84 100]) and 9% were unintentional firearm deaths (23 000 [95% UI, 18 200-24 800]). From 1990 to 2016, there was no significant decrease in the estimated global age-standardized firearm homicide rate (-0.2%[95% UI, -0.8% to 0.2%]). Firearm suicide rates decreased globally at an annualized rate of 1.6%(95% UI, 1.1-2.0), but in 124 of 195 countries and territories included in this study, these levels were either constant or significant increases were estimated. There was an annualized decrease of 0.9% (95% UI, 0.5%-1.3%) in the global rate of age-standardized firearm deaths from 1990 to 2016. Aggregate firearm injury deaths in 2016 were highest among persons aged 20 to 24 years (for men, an estimated 34 700 deaths [95% UI, 24 900-39 700] and for women, an estimated 3580 deaths [95% UI, 2810-4210]). Estimates of the number of firearms by country were associated with higher rates of firearm suicide (P<.001; R-2 = 0.21) and homicide (P<.001; R-2 = 0.35).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study estimated between 195 000 and 276 000 firearm injury deaths globally in 2016, the majority of which were firearm homicides. Despite an overall decrease in rates of firearm injury death since 1990, there was variation among countries and across demographic subgroups.

AB Implementation of primary care has long been a priority in low- and middle-income countries. Violence at work may hamper progress in this field. Hence, we examined the associations between violence at work and depressive symptoms/major depression in primary care teams (physicians, nurses, nursing assistants, and community health workers).
   A cross-sectional study was undertaken in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. We assessed a random sample of Family Health Program teams. We investigated depressive symptoms and major depression using the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and exposure to violence at work in the previous 12 months using a standardized questionnaire. Associations between exposure to violence and depressive symptoms/major depression were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression.
   Of 3141 eligible workers, 2940 (93 %) completed the interview. Of these, 36.3 % (95 % CI 34.6-38.1) presented intermediate depressive symptoms, and 16 % (95 % CI 14.6-17.2), probable major depression. The frequencies of exposure to the different types of violence at work were: insults (44.9 %), threats (24.8 %), physical aggression (2.3 %), and witnessing violence (29.5 %). These exposures were strongly and progressively associated with depressive symptoms (adjusted odds ratio 1.67 for exposure to one type of violence; and 5.10 for all four types), and probable major depression (adjusted odds ratio 1.84 for one type; and 14.34 for all four types).
   Primary care workers presenting depressive symptoms and those who have experienced violence at work should be assisted. Policy makers should prioritize strategies to prevent these problems, since they can threaten primary care sustainability.

AB OBJECTIVE: To estimate the mortality rate due to occupational pesticide poisoning in Brazil.
   METHODS: Data on diagnoses of death from pesticide poisoning between 2000 and 2009 were obtained from the Mortality Information System. ICD-10 codes T60.0-T60.4, T60.8 and T60.9, Y18, X487 and Z578 as the main or secondary cause of death; data on work-related deaths were obtained from the death certificate, from the fields <work related accident>, <circumstances of death> and whether cases were agricultural workers. Homicides and suicides were excluded. To calculate mortality, the number of agricultural workers was obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, National System of Accounts estimates.
   RESULTS: There were 2,052 deaths recorded as caused by pesticide poisoning in Brazil, between 2000 and 2009, of which 36.2% (n = 743) had no occupation data. Of the remaining 1,309, 679 (51.9%) were agricultural workers. Mortality from occupational pesticide poisoning declined from 0.56 100.000 (2000-2001) to 0.39 100.000 (2008-2009) workers during the study period, and there was a larger decrease among men compared with women. Males had a higher mortality from this type of poisoning than women in all study years. Most deaths were caused by organophosphates and carbamate pesticides poisoning. During the study period the number of cases declined in all regions, except for the Northeast.
   CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in the quality of Death Certificate records is needed, particularly for occupation and the assessment of causes of death as work related, crucial for work injuries control and prevention programs. Special attention is required in the Northeast region.

AB This study seeks to analyze the experiences of populations which suffered forced displacement due to the construction of the Ita Hydroelectric Power Plant in southern Brazil by observing the interfaces between this process and mental health. This is a qualitative study based on participant research. The data were collected from February to December 2016, with the participation of 43 people, and subjected to content analysis. The results indicate that the distress factors included situations of violence and the violation of the rights of those who were affected, high impacts on people's lifestyles and mental health, and environmental changes. We conclude that there is a need to discuss the impacts of the construction of dams and its interactions with the mental health of those who are affected.

AB The current study investigates the relationship between involuntary hospitalization, severity of psychopathology, and aggression. Adult psychiatric inpatients hospitalized from August, 2012 to January, 2013 were evaluated via the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Overt Aggression Scale (OAS). Individuals were compared regarding voluntariness of hospitalization. Of the 137 hospitalizations in the period, 71 were involuntary (INV). The variables associated with involuntariness were being brought to hospital by ambulance or police, and aggression in the first 24 h of admission. Risk of suicide at admission, and having personal income were associated with voluntariness. The dimensions of the BPRS associated with involuntary hospitalization were activation, resistance, and positive symptoms. Involuntary psychiatric hospitalization was associated with agitation, psychosis and aggression. The data support the indication of involuntary hospitalization for treatment of patients with severe mental illness.

AB Objective: To describe deaths due to accidents, suicides and homicide among pregnant or puerperal women.
   Methods: This was a retrospective study on 169 deaths (108 of pregnant women and 61 of puerperal women) in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil, covering the years 2006 and 2014, for which the data source was the Mortality Information System (SIM).
   Results: Homicides were the main type of violence for pregnant women (34.9%) and puerperal women (23.1%). The deaths occurred in the age group of 20-49 years (n = 122; 72,2%), among women of nonwhite race/color (n = 141; 83,4%) and with no companion (n = 129; 76,3%).
   Conclusion: Investigating deaths due to external causes during the pregnancy-puerperal period provides information that is useful for implementation of violence prevention strategies.

ID SUICIDE
AB OBJECTIVE: The Tinnitus Handicap Inventory is a questionnaire for assessing the impact of tinnitus by quantifying psychoemotional and functional problems it causes. The objective of the study was to validate the Brazilian Portuguese translation of this questionnaire, named Questionario de Gravidade do Zumbido.
   METHODS: The questionnaire was applied to 135 individuals with tinnitus from two audiology clinics in Bauru, Southeastern Brazil, referred for audiologic evaluation. Its internal consistency was evaluated by Cronbach's alpha coefficients comparing the Brazilian version to the original instrument.
   RESULTS: It was found good reliability for scales (0.76 <alpha < 0.85) and for the whole questionnaire, which global consistency value (alpha=0.93) was identical to the original instrument.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the Brazilian version of the questionnaire can be used in clinical practice to evaluate day-to-day difficulties caused by tinnitus in individuals who are aware of that.

AB Background: The definition and delineation of melancholia have remained elusive for an extended period. A longstanding signal of psychomotor disturbance has been operationalized via the observer-rated CORE measure and with CORE-assigned melancholic and nonmelancholic compared in several Australian studies. Replication studies in other regions have not previously been reported. This study compares Brazilian patients with melancholic and nonmelancholic depression according to the CORE measure of psychomotor disturbance in terms of clinical characteristics, suicide ideation, stressful life events, quality of life, parental care, and personality styles.
   Methods: A total of 181 patients with unipolar major depression attending a tertiary care outpatient service in Brazil were evaluated in relation to melancholic status and study variables.
   Results: The CORE-assigned melancholic patients presented higher symptom severity, greater prevalence of suicide ideation, and Axis I comorbidities than nonmelancholics. Scores of dysfunctional personality styles and dysfunctional parental care measures were also higher among melancholics. Quality-of-life scores were low in both groups.
   Limitations: The absence of a criterion standard for the diagnosis of melancholia and the use of medication can be potential limitations of the study.
   Conclusion: Differences suggest that CORE-assigned melancholia defines a distinct group of patients and probably a disorder distinct from nonmelancholic depression not only in quantitative but also in qualitative aspects. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze deaths from external causes and undefined causes in women of childbearing age occurring during pregnancy and early postpartum.
   METHODS: The deaths of 399 women of childbearing age, resident in Recife, Northeastern Brazil, in the period 2004 to 2006, were studied. The survey utilized the Reproductive Age Mortality Survey method and a set of standardized questionnaires. Data sources included, reports from the Institute of Legal Medicine, hospital and Family Health Strategy records and interviews with relatives of the deceased women. External causes of death during pregnancy were classified according to the circumstance of death, using the O93 code (ICD) and maternal mortality ratios before and after the classification were calculated.
   RESULTS: Eighteen deaths during pregnancy were identified. The majority were aged between 20 and 29, had between four and seven years of schooling, were black and single parents. Fifteen deaths were classified using the O93 code as pregnancy related death (13 for homicide - code 93.7; two by suicide - code 93.6) and three were classified as indirect obstetric maternal deaths (one homicide - code 93.7 and two by suicide - code 93.6). There was an average increment of 35% in the maternal mortality ratios after classification.
   CONCLUSIONS: Deaths from undefined causes in and in early postpartumdid not occur by chance and their exclusion from the calculations of maternal mortality indicators only increases levels of underreporting.

SO ACTAS ESPANOLAS DE PSIQUIATRIA

DE Psychological autopsy; suicide; Spanish; methodology
AB Introduction: objectives. The aim of this work was to adapt and validate into Spanish the Semi-Structured Interview for Psychological Autopsy (SSIPA).
   Method. The SSIPA consists of 69 items distributed into four modules: precipitants and/or stressors, motivation, lethality, and intentionality. The original instrument was translated from Portuguese into Spanish and backtranslated by bilinguals persons. The resulting questionnaire was compared with the original and discussed by an expert panel. The adapted instrument was then applied to the relatives of 26 presumed suicide cases in Ourense (Spain) who voluntarily accepted to participate. Interviews were digitally recorded and evaluated using a decision-making algorithm by the interviewer and two independent judges blind to the results of the others.
   Results. lnterrater agreement was measured using Kappa statistics. Participation in the study (27.60/0) was similar to that obtained in the original study in Brazil >(20%). The Kappa values obtained were statistically significant. Correlation index was considered good (k> 0.60) or very good (k> 0.80) in 15 steps including 3 out of 4 final steps of each module and the final result of the autopsy; moderate (k> 0.40) in 8 steps, 3 of them located in the motivation's module; and weak (k> 0.20) just in 2 steps.
   Conclusions. The Spanish version of the SSIPA is a reliable instrument for psychological autopsy studies. Low correlation in two of the algorithm steps for decision making may be due to the lack of accuracy of the questionnaire and should be improved.

AB Background: Available data regarding posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in bipolar disorder (BD) are scarce and usually from a limited sample size. The present report was carried out using the Brazilian Research Consortium for Bipolar Disorders and aimed to examine whether patients with BD and comorbid PTSD are at an increased risk for worse clinical outcomes.
   Methods: A consecutive sample of bipolar I outpatients from two teaching hospitals in Brazil was recruited. Patients were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, Young Mania Rating Scale, 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and quality of life instrument WHOQOL-BREF. Participants were divided into three groups: a. bipolar patients with PTSD, b. bipolar patients exposed to trauma without PTSD, and c. bipolar patients with no trauma exposure.
   Results: Of the 405 patients who consented to participate, 87.7% completed the survey. All three groups were similar in terms of demographic parameters. The group with comorbid PTSD reported worse quality of life, more rapid cycling, higher rates of suicide attempts, and a lower likelihood of staying recovered.
   Limitations: The cross-sectional design excludes the opportunity to examine causal relationships among trauma, PTSD, and BD.
   Conclusions: The findings indicate that PTSD causes bipolar patients to have a worse outcome, as assessed by their lower likelihood to recover, elevated proportion of rapid cycling periods, increased risk of suicide attempts, and worse quality of life. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of depression in schizophrenia and associated factors, including quality of life. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 150 outpatients. The Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia measured depression, and the Quality of Life Scale-Brazil measured quality of life. Major depression was found in 56% of patients with schizophrenia. Patients with major depression had low quality of life according to both the global scale and the occupational subscale. Global quality of life was important for separating the decision-tree statistical analyses. In patients with low quality of life, three factors were associated with depression: presence of schizophrenic symptoms, number of medications, and lack of household activities. In patients with better quality of life scores, only duration of the illness was significant. The study shows a high prevalence of depression in schizophrenia, besides highlighting its repercussions on quality of life. When evaluating quality of life, the presence of depression should be taken into consideration.

DE assessment; quality of life; major depression; bipolar disorder
ID OUTPATIENTS; DISORDERS
AB In the present investigation, we compared the impact of illness on quality of life (QOL) in adult outpatients with unipolar (N = 89) and bipolar (N = 25) depression. While attending a university hospital in southern Brazil, patients completed the WHO's QOL Instrument-Short Version and the Beck Depression Inventory. After analyses, patients with bipolar depression reported significantly lower scores on the psychological QOL domain (p = .013) than patients with unipolar depression. There were no significant differences between the study groups in terms of social and demographic variables, in the other QOL domains assessed (i.e., physical health, social relationships, and environmental), and in the severity of depressive symptoms. In conclusion, our findings suggest that patients with bipolar and unipolar depressions have different QOL profiles, and that this difference is probably independent of the severity of the mood disturbance and might be related to the higher rates of suicide observed in the bipolar population.

ID RIGHTS; VARIETIES; SUICIDE; BRAZIL; RATES
AB Critical to sustainable agriculture, agrobiodiversity conservation provides immediate benefits and retains options for climate change adaptation. Reframing conservation as sustainable seed innovation allows for a dynamic view of farmer contributions. Sustainable seed innovation entails in situ conservation and the innovation of new plant varieties through traditional practices. Farmer interviews from regions throughout India form the empirical basis, while the concept intellectual property-broad, integrated with evolutionary economics, informs theory. Sustainable seed innovation within India receives support primarily from nonprofit groups favoring open-source systems. Conserving natural and financial capital motivated farmers to adopt sustainable techniques, but farmers believed attracting additional innovators required development of new markets. India's Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act recognizes farmers as plant breeders but does not provide incentive to innovate sustainably. Moreover, agricultural policies reinforced by an underlying discourse where "progressive" farmers follow unsustainable practices incentivizes formal innovations, at the expense of sustainable innovations of farmers.

AB Alcohol-related injuries are an important public health issue worldwide. The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology of alcohol intake perceived by interviewers among injury victims seen at emergency departments in selected Brazilian cities. Cross-sectional data were collected from the injury surveillance system based on sentinel health services recently implemented in the country through intentional sampling in 2006 and 2007 and analyzed in Epi Info 3.5.1. Alcohol intake perception was higher in violence-related injuries than in unintentional injuries (37.9% versus 8%). For violence-related injuries, highest proportions of alcohol intake perception were observed among males (43.7%), 20 to 39 years old (45.3%), blacks (40.5%), and low schooling level victims (40.3%). Settings where these injuries occurred with the highest concerned proportions were taverns (78.2%) and public places (39.5%). Higher alcohol intake perception was observed in assaults (39.1%), suicide attempts (25.4%), transport-related injuries (16.8%), and falls victims (5.9%).

AB Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of episodes of mania and hypomania, as well as associated factors and comorbidities among adults 18 to 24 years old in the city of Pelotas, Brazil.
   Method: This is a cross-sectional population-based study. The sample was selected through conglomerates, and episodes of mania and hypomania were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric.
   Results: The sample consisted of 1560 subjects. The lifetime prevalence of manic and hypomanic episodes was 7.5% and 5.3%, respectively. Subjects with (hypo)manic episodes had a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders, substance abuse and suicidality.
   Limitation: The high rate of (hypo)mania may to some extent reflect diagnostic error.
   Conclusion: Such high prevalence of (hypo)mania may nonetheless be valid as it was associated with corresponding rates of comorbidity and suicidality. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this article was to examine the association between health risk behaviors (tobacco, alcohol, and drug use) and psychosocial distress indicators among high school students. The sample consisted of 4,210 adolescent students from public schools in Pernambuco State, Brazil. The Global School-based Student Health Survey was used to collect personal (demographic and socioeconomic) and behavioral data and to obtain measures of psychosocial distress indicators (outcome variables). Prevalence rates were observed for sadness, loneliness, suicidal ideation, sleeplessness due to worries, and suicidal planning. Self-reported prevalence rates for tobacco, alcohol, and drug use were 7.7%, 30.3%, and 6.9%. Psychosocial distress was more prevalent among girls, while health risk behaviors were more common among boys. The study concludes that drug use is directly associated with suicidal ideation and planning, and that among girls, alcohol consumption was associated with psychosocial distress.

   POLITICS; ECONOMY; BRAZIL
AB India has actively tried to shape the WTO agricultural negotiations by submitting detailed proposals, building coalitions, and even taking hard stands (veto) at critical junctures. However, this aggressive posturing presents a sharp contrast with India's domestic agricultural space, where the situation highlights policy neglect, manifesting in agrarian distress and farmer suicides. This paper analyzes contradictions between India's internationally espoused negotiating positions and its domestic policy goals. It argues that India's core focus has been to preserve status quo in the domestic food markets, driven by the political need to provide food-based consumption subsidies and manage an assured price and supply protection to its vulnerable consumers. As a result, India's interests are divergent from most of its developing country coalition partners in the G-20 as well as the G-33 groups. Our discussion has significant implications for both the domestic policy, as well as the sustainability of India's strategy in global agricultural trade negotiations.

ID SUICIDE
AB To discuss the issue of violence and abuse suffered by the elderly in Brazil and the role of Open Universities of the Third Age as a center for reflection and support for issues related to the human aging process. Methodology: literature with retrospective, descriptive and documentary research. Results: With the increase in the elderly population in Brazil arise various problems that require effective solutions in order to ensure access to this age group a better quality of life with dignity, respect, guaranteeing them even a healthier life, depriving them of any kind of violence, whether physical, moral, psychological and emotional elderly people have been victims of all kinds of violence, ranging from insults and beatings by their own families and caregivers, to the abuse suffered in public transport and public and private institutions serving this population. Seconds Secretariat data the Human Rights of the Presidency of the Republic the majority of violence against the elderly in Brazil, ranging from financial abuse and neglect to bad physical and psychological treatment, and is committed by family members of the elderly themselves. On the other hand, the Elderly Statute provides that in Brazil, no elderly will be object of any kind of negligence, discrimination, violence, cruelty or oppression. Thus, any kind of discrimination, physical or moral violence, act of cruelty and oppression, abuse should be referred to legal punishments established in current criminal law. Conclusion: education as a social practice, has an important role in the debate the issue of violence and abuse suffered by older people, as this has a character of transformation, beyond the mere idea of information transmission, and as such has the power to arouse the attention of society to the problems faced by the elderly, showing the need to ensure conditions conducive to aging with dignity, where the elderly as part of participation and social transformation agent. Therefore, should be included in the list of pedagogical and curricular practices of Open Universities of the Third Age, not just the debate on the subject, but, above all, that they join the other institutions in order to propose coping strategies to this sad reality. Only with a participative society can achieve a higher level of citizenship and considerably reduce social inequalities, giving our elderly a better quality of life, free from any kind of violence.

AB This research is based on epidemiological records of toxicological occurrences in individual records of investigation into pesticide poisoning at the Maringa Intoxication Control Center at the Regional University Hospital of Maringa. The intoxications in patients poisoned from 2002 to 2011, in towns that comprise the Central Northern Parana Geographic Mesoregion where Maringa is located, were taken into consideration in this study. As a result, it was established that approximately 67.12% of those poisoned were males, the age groups most affected are 20-29 years old and 30-39 years old. Suicide attempts appear as the main motivation for hospitalization (possibly disguising the chronic intoxication), and mainly insecticides and herbicides are involved in the poisonings, with 62.60% and 26%, respectively. Lastly, the urgent need for public health policies in to reduce this statistic immediately is self-evident, as these poisonings are the ones recorded, as those resulting from food poisoning are not being computed.

TI CHARACTERIZATION OF SELF-EXTERMINATION ATTEMPT CASES IN AN EMERGENCY

DT Article
DE Suicide attempt; Violence; Emergency Medical Services
AB Violence becomes a matter to be discussed in the health-disease process, once it reaches the collective and individual health, requiring action and articulation of services. Suicide is the third leading cause of death in Brazil, however, these self-extermination attempts are not being successfully reported (under notified) and, sometimes, not even reported at all. This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study with a quantitative approach, to characterize the cases of self-extermination attempt in the emergency department of a university hospital. One-hundred and sixty two (162) medical records were included in self-extermination attempt cases, for the period of January 2008 to September 2013. Of the 162 analyzed records, 56.17% were women; 22.22% within the age group between 24 and 38 years old, average age of 34.5 years old; 53.09% single; 94.44% coming from Uberlandia; 39.51% occurred at night; frequency of 19.14% on Mondays; 24.68% of attempts in 2012. Abusive ingestion of medications in 34.07% of cases; 51.23% were brought to the hospital by the Fire Department; 35.83% had a mental disorder; 45.67% of the cases were the patient's first attempt; 39.42% of cases occurred after relationship conflicts; 54.32% were discharged within 18 hours, on average, after care in the emergency room; 21.60% have returned because of a new attempt. The research was based on characterized attempts at self-extermination cases, with predominantly female, aged between 24 and 38, use of medication as an agent to act, with high recidivism among the female group. It is suggested research with longer periods and samples and analyzed by The National Policy for Reduction of Morbidity and Mortality by Accidents and Violence.

AB Suicide tends to occur in families, and parental psychopathology has been linked to offspring suicidal behaviors. This study explores the influence of parental mental disorders across the lifespan. Data are from the Sao Paulo Megacity Mental Health Survey, a cross-sectional household study with a representative sample of the adult population living in the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area, Brazil (N=2,942). Survival models examined bivariate and multivariate associations between a range of parental disorders and offspring suicidality. After controlling for comorbidity, number of mental disorders and offspring psychopathology, we found that parental psychopathology influences suicidal behaviors throughout most part of the life cycle, from childhood until young adult years. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and antisocial personality were associated with offspring suicidal ideation (OR 1.8 and 1.9, respectively), panic and GAD predicted suicidal attempts (OR 2.3 and 2.7, respectively), and panic was related to the transition from ideation to attempts (OR 2.7). Although noticed in many different stages of the lifespan, this influence is most evident during adolescence. In this period, depression and antisocial personality increased the odds of suicidal ideation (OR 5.1 and 3.2, respectively), and depression, panic disorder, GAD and substance abuse predicted suicidal attempts (OR varying from 1.7 to 3.8). In short, parental disorders characterized by impulsive-aggression and anxiety-agitation were the main predictors of offspring suicidality across the lifespan. This clinically relevant intergenerational transmission of suicide risk was independent of offspring mental disorders, and this underscores the need for a family approach to psychopathology.

AB This retrospective analysis of burn patients and victims of other forms of trauma from Ribeirao Preto and nearby cities admitted to hospitals in the city of Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil, was carried out to determine the frequency of injuries of all types in order to identify the extent of the problem of burns relative to other forms of trauma. Data concerning 921 patients with bums and 60,344 patients with other traumatic injuries hospitalized during the period from 1991 to 1997 are described. Bums corresponded to 1.5% of the total number of traumatic injuries. When data are reported as absolute numbers or as incidence rate of hospitalized burn patients, burns were two times more frequent among men in most age groups. The case fatality ratio due to burns was 8.4% (77 deaths among 921 patients), with a rate of 6.4% for men and 12.2% for women. The case fatality ratio was higher among women than men regardless of the city of residence. The case fatality ratio was 3.2 and 4.4 times greater for men and women burn victims from other towns than for burn victims from Ribeirao Preto, indicating the need for additional equipment and training of medical and paramedical personnel in the initial measures to be taken with burn patients.

AB Background and aimsMost studies reporting alcohol use among fatally injured victims are subject to bias, particularly those related to sample selection and to absence of injury context data. We developed a research method to estimate the prevalence of alcohol consumption and test correlates of alcohol use prior to fatal injuries.
   Design, Setting and ParticipantsCross-sectional study based on a probability sample of fatally injured adult victims (n=365) autopsied in SAo Paulo, Brazil. Victims were sampled within systematically selected 8-hour sampling blocks, generating a representative sample of fatal injuries occurring during all hours of the day for each day of the week between June 2014 and December 2015.
   MeasurementsThe presence of alcohol and blood alcohol concentration (BAC) were the primary outcomes evaluated according to victims' socio-demographic, injury context data (type, day, time and injury place) and criminal history characteristics.
   FindingsAlcohol was detected in 30.1% [95% confidence interval (CI)=25.6-35.1)] of the victims, with a mean blood alcohol level (BAC) level of 0.11%w/v (95% CI=0.09-0.13) among alcohol-positive cases. Black and mixed race victims presented a higher mean BAC than white victims (P=0.03). Fewer than one in every six suicides tested positive for alcohol, while almost half of traffic-related casualties were alcohol-positive. Having suffered traffic-related injuries, particularly those involving vehicle crashes, and injuries occurring during weekends and at night were associated significantly with alcohol use before injury (P<0.05).
   ConclusionsNearly one-third of fatal injuries in SAo Paulo between June 2014 and December 2015 were alcohol-related, with traffic accidents showing a greater association with alcohol use than other injuries. The sampling methodology tested here, including the possibility of adding injury context data to improve population-based estimates of alcohol use before fatal injury, appears to be a reliable and lower-cost strategy for avoiding biases common in death investigations.

AB Background and purpose: The aim was to evaluate the relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders in general hospital inpatients.
   Patients and methods: Information about insomnia was collected using a structured and codified questionnaire adapted from a previously validated one in Brazil. For Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV) psychiatric diagnosis, the Portuguese version of the International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used.
   Results: Out of the 200 patients interviewed, 56.5% complained of insomnia, and 50.0% Suffered from at least one psychiatric disorder. Major depressive episode (MDE) (P < 0.001), generalized anxiety disorder (P = 0.025) and suicide risk (P = 0.034) were associated with insomnia (univariate analysis). The results of the multivariate analysis showed that only MDE had a statistically significant association with insomnia (OR=3.6; 95% CI = 1.9-6.9).
   Conclusions: This study found a high prevalence of psychiatric disorders and insomnia in a general hospital population and found that insomnia can be a marker for MDE. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Foods contaminated with a granulated material similar to Temik (a commercial pesticide formulation containing the carbamate insecticide aldicarb) are often involved in accidental ingestion, suicides, and homicides in Brazil. We developed a simple technique to detect aldicarb. This technique is based on the inhibition of a stable preparation of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, and it is specially adapted for forensic purposes. It comprises an initial extraction step with the solvent methylene chloride followed by a colorimetric acetylcholinesterase assay. We propose that results of testing contaminated forensic samples be expressed in aldicarb equivalents because, even though all other carbamates are also potent enzyme inhibitors, aldicarb is the contaminant most frequently found in forensic samples. This method is rapid (several samples can be run in a period of 2 h) and low cost. This method also proved to be precise and accurate, detecting concentrations as low as 40 mu g/kg of aldicarb in meat samples.

AB Violence is a dreadful phenomenon spread throughout the world, resulting in unfortunate events that can ultimately cause death. It is known that some countries play a much worrying role in this scenario than others. Brazil is one of them. The present work has focused on identifying the use of cocaine in 105 postmortem cases arriving at the Institute of Legal Medicine of Sao Paulo (IML-SP), the largest Brazilian city. Both blood and hair samples have been analyzed through ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS) in order to distinguish between recent or chronic cocaine use. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the proportion of cocaine use amongst violent individuals whose violence has ultimately led to their death. In order to do so, two previous methods, validated in-house, based on methanolic extraction for hair and protein precipitation for blood, have been used for this purpose and the final residue was analyzed through UPLC-ESI-MS/MS system. When looking at the demographics from the 105 postmortem cases analyzed, the results have shown the most critical age range to be between 18 and 25 years old and the least frequent between 37 and 45 years old. Gender wise, a rather extreme difference was found as 97 of the individuals were men and finally, considering the manner of death, the four-category criteria established appear to be fairly similar with 34 cases related to general violence and risk behavior, 26 to drug abuse suspicion, 23 to homicide resulting from opposition to police intervention and 22 to possible suicide.

AB Sexual violence against women is a form of gender violence and both a severe human rights violation and public health problem. This ecological, descriptive, and temporal series study aims to analyze sexual violence against pre-adolescent, adolescent, and adult females in Santa Catarina State, Brazil, based on data from the Information System for Notifiable Diseases, in order to describe the characteristics of cases of sexual violence perpetrated against women, reported by health professionals from 2008 a 2013. A total of 15,508 cases of violence were reported, including 2,010 cases of sexual violence (12.9%). Cases of violence totaled 950 reports in the 10 to 14 year bracket (47.3%), 450 in the 15 to 19 year bracket (22.4%), and 610 (30.3%) in women 20 years or older (adults). Adolescent females suffered violence by a single aggressor, at home, at night, with vaginal penetration, and with greater tendency to repeated assault and pregnancy as a result. For females 10 to 14 and 15 to 19 years of age, the aggressors were un-known in 32.9% and 33.1% of the reports, respectively. Adult women were sexually assaulted either at home or on public byways, at night or in the early morning hours, by a single aggressor, with vaginal penetration in more than half of the cases, with more physical injuries, and with more sub-sequent suicide attempts. The information should contribute to awareness-raising of policymakers, health professionals, researchers, and health field professors concerning the importance of reporting violence in order to help develop interventions to prevent such violence against women.

ID STATISTICS; MORTALITY; QUALITY
AB OBJECTIVE To determine reliability of data encoding for death due to violence; to assess the agreement between cause of death in the Mortality Information System and cause selected from the Forensic Medicine Institute database; and to assess the impact of adding information of non-specified injuries and undetermined death events subsequently obtained from Forensic Medicine Institute in the mortality statistics due to violence.
   METHODS: A random sample of 411 death certificates due to violence was obtained in Belo Horizonte, Southeastern Brazil, between 1998 and 2000. Based on data from death certificates and Forensic Medicine Institute database, causes of death were coded and the agreement between this information and that from Mortality Information System was assessed. Also, in all certificates including "non-specified injury" and "undetermined death events," the impact of adding information from Forensic Medicine Institute was assessed in the classification of cause of death.
   RESULTS: Coding agreement was significant (Kappa=0.782; 95% CI:0.744; 0.819) and of the underlying cause was moderate to significant (Kappa=0.602; 95% CI:0.563; 0.641). There were 12.9% and 5.7% misclassification of suicides and murders, respectively, for those causes classified as "non-specified injury" and "undetermined death events," which were overall reduced to 47.3% and 59.8% respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for further improving the process of underlying cause coding and selection. Also medical examiners need to provide more complete death certificates and medical and police information provided with bodies for Forensic Medicine Institute autopsy should be more complete, especially in those cases of road traffic injuries and falls.

AB The article discusses daily subjectivities that may undermine or (re)affirm masculinity and thus alienate rural men from taking care of their health. Through a qualitative approach, the research was conducted within a rural community in a municipality in the south of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) and involved twelve male participants who experienced chronic heart disease. The findings illustrate different actions which were elected by the respondents as threats to their masculinity and that, therefore, should he avoided or denied, leading to an affirmation of gender stereotypes. The analyses made clear that certain prescriptions associated with masculinity, such as the belief in invulnerability, the role of the provider and the link between self care and femininity, may cause physical, mental, and social harm to men, especially during old age, when the boundaries between goals and possibilities become further apart. Focusing on the rural aspect, the study provides ideas for the development of actions towards men's health promotion, taking into consideration their life context plurality and bringing the farmer's life sphere and all its productive particularities, which shape health scenarios, to the discussion.

AB This review article aims to perform analysis and critical discussion about the literature on methods correcting mortality from accidents and violence reported to the Brazilian Mortality Information System. We consulted Medline and SciELO databases, as well as the Global Burden of Disease site, using time filter for the 1996-2015 interval. Of the 77 studies identified, we selected 29, and 14 met the corrections production criteria for cases of underreporting: underreporting of deaths in the Mortality Information System, deaths declared as ill-defined causes or deaths from external causes declared with nonspecific codes. We found that the underreporting of external causes was not significantly different from what occurs in total deaths and sometimes was higher in small and medium-sized municipalities. The reclassification of ill-defined causes of death corrected external causes to non-negligible values. The selected studies differ on proposals for correction of unspecified external causes. Evidence supports interventions to improve the quality of data, and the availability of correction procedure of external causes that bring together application conditions.

AB More than 85% of the world's population lives in 153 low-income and middle-income countries (LAMICs). Although country-level information on mental health systems has recently become available, it still has substantial gaps and inconsistencies. Most of these countries allocate very scarce financial resources and have grossly inadequate manpower and infrastructure for mental health. Many LAMICs also lack mental health policy and legislation to direct their mental health programmes and services, which is of particular concern in Africa and South East Asia. Different components of mental health systems seem to vary greatly, even in the same-income categories, with some countries having developed their mental health system despite their low-income levels. These examples need careful scrutiny to derive useful lessons. Furthermore, mental health resources in countries seem to be related as much to measures of general health as to economic and developmental indicators, arguing for improved prioritisation for mental health even in low-resource settings. Increased emphasis on mental health, improved resources, and enhanced monitoring of the situation in countries is called for to advance global mental health.

AB ObjectiveTo assess the prospective associations of mood disorders and suicidality in a community sample of young adults from south Brazil.
   MethodProspective population-based cohort study. Young adults (18-24 years old) were recruited and followed up on 5 years later; people were interviewed at their homes. Suicidality, as well as mood and anxiety disorders, was assessed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. The impact of mood episodes on suicidality was both evaluated when they occurred in the same wave (a current episode) and when suicidality occurred prospectively, with suicidality measured at follow-up (a past episode).
   ResultsThe sample included 1560 young adults at baseline, with 1244 reassessed at follow-up (80.6%). Depressive episodes, both current and past, had a significant impact on suicidality in the final multivariable model. Manic episodes, however, were less consistently associated with suicidality.
   ConclusionDepressive episodes have a strong, independent, and robust association with prospective suicidality. The association between manic episodes and suicidality, on the other hand, was dependent on the analysis and deserves further exploration.

ID SURVEILLANCE; BURDEN
AB Background With global survival increasing for children younger than 5 years of age, attention is required to reduce the approximately 1 million deaths of children aged 5-14 years occurring every year. Causes of death at these ages remain poorly documented. We aimed to explore trends in mortality by causes of death in India, China, Brazil, and Mexico, which are home to about 40% of the world's children aged 5-14 years and experience more than 200 000 deaths annually at these ages.
   Methods We examined data on 244 401 deaths in children aged 5-14 years from four nationally representative data sources that obtained direct distributions of causes of death: the Indian Million Death Study, the Chinese Disease Surveillance Points, mortality data from the Mexican Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia, and mortality data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. We present data on 12 main disease groups in all countries, with breakdown by communicable and nutritional diseases, non-communicable diseases, injuries, and ill-defined causes. To calculate age-specific and sex-specific death rates for each cause, we applied the national cause of death distribution to the UN mortality envelopes for 2005-16 for each country.
   Findings Unlike Brazil, China, and Mexico, communicable diseases still account for nearly half of deaths in India in children aged 5-14 years (73 920 [46.1%] of 160 330 estimated deaths in 2016). In 2016, India had the highest death rates in nearly every category, including from communicable diseases. Fast declines among girls in communicable disease mortality narrowed the gap by 2016 with boys in India (32.6 deaths per 100 000 girls vs 26.2 per 100 000 boys) and China (1.7 vs 1.5). In China, injuries accounted for the greatest proportions of deaths (20 970 [53.2%] of 39 430 estimated deaths, in which drowning was a leading cause). The homicide death rate at ages 10-14 years was higher for boys than for girls in Brazil, increasing annually by an average of 0.7% (0.3-1.1). In India and China, the suicide death rates were higher for girls than for boys at ages 10-14 years. By contrast, in Mexico it was higher for boys than for girls, increasing annually by an average of 2.8% (2.0-3.6). Deaths from transport injuries, drowning, and cancer are common in all four countries, with transport accidents among the top three causes of death for both sexes in all countries, except for Indian girls, and cancer in the top three causes for both sexes in Mexico, Brazil, and China.
   Interpretation Most of the deaths that occurred between 2005 and 2016 in children aged 5-14 years in India, China, Brazil, and Mexico arose from preventable or treatable conditions. This age group is important for extending some of the global disease-specific targets developed for children younger than 5 years of age. Interventions to control noncommunicable diseases and injuries and to strengthen cause of death reporting systems are also required.

TI Underreporting of fatal poisonings in Brazil - A descriptive study using
   data from four information systems
SO FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
DE Fatal poisoning; Information systems; Poison centers; Medical legal
   institute; Medications; Pesticides
AB Poisoning is a worldwide problem that involves individuals of all ages and a range of chemicals. In this study, fatal poisoning cases that occurred in the Federal District of Brazil (DF) from 2009 to 2013 were described using information from four systems, and the reasons for underreporting of each system were discussed. Data were obtained from the mortality information system (SIM), the notifiable disease information system (SINAN), the poison information center (CIT), and the forensic medicine institute (IML) of the DF. In total, 288 cases were reported to SIM, 18 to SINAN, 29 to CIT and 101 cases identified in the IML. SIM data indicated a prevalence of 2.24 cases/year/100,000 individuals in the DF, higher than the national estimation (1.36). After eliminating the 98 duplicate cases among the systems, 338 fatal unique cases were identified, from which 74.0% were reported in only one system (mainly the SIM), 23.4% in two systems, 8 cases in three systems and only 1 case was reported in the four systems. Over two thirds of the 338 fatalities involved men (67.4%), and 46.9% involved individuals aged 20-39 years. Medications were the main agent involved (49.4%), followed by pesticides (29.9%). The fatalities occurred mainly after unintentional exposure (50.8%) and suicide (47.7%, of which 53.5% involved pesticides). These results confirmed the previous hypothesis that none of the information systems could capture the whole picture of fatal poisonings in the DF. Underreporting was found in all systems, indicating the need to improve the information quality and the coordination of data reporting, so that health authorities can better understand and reduce these fatalities.

AB Molecular analysis of five Brazilian families, including eight patients presenting with nonclassic Tay-Sachs disease, was performed to identify frequent causative mutations and their correlation with clinical course. Three patients were affected by the B1 subacute variant and were shown to carry the R178H mutation (the DN allele), which is also common among Portuguese patients. Two of them were compound heterozygotes, whereas the third presented with the mutation in both alleles. Since Brazil was a Portuguese colony for over two centuries, common ancestry might be the probable explanation. The fourth patient presented with a juvenile phenotype and carries the R499H mutation, which has been reported only once worldwide and is associated with residual enzyme activity, responsible for a slower clinical course. The fifth family, of an Ashkenazi Jewish background, showed an extensive intrafamilial clinical variability among three affected sibs presenting with muscle atrophy, ataxia, and psychiatric symptoms. They were first diagnosed as having atypical spinal muscular atrophy and, subsequently, spinocerebellar ataxia, but, recently, the diagnosis of late-onset Tay-Sachs disease was confirmed based on reduced plasma hexosaminidase A activity and the G269S/InsTATC1278 genotype. It is therefore highly recommended to test patients with a similar clinical history for Tay-Sachs disease. In the same family, one first cousin committed suicide at the age of 24 years, presenting with a clinical phenotype that suggested an undiagnosed case and highlighting the effect of the intrafamilial clinical variability in delaying a prompt diagnosis. It is now recognized that his parents are, in fact, a carrier couple. Additionally, another relative had been previously identified as a heterozygote in a Tay-Sachs disease screening program, but the information was not shared among the family. Since this information might anticipate diagnosis and genetic counseling, it is advisable that heterozygote screening programs encourage families to share genetic information.

AB OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of violence among adolescents and young adults and to identify associated factors.
   METHODS: Cross-sectional study carried out in 2008 with systematic random sampling of 699 elementary and high school students enrolled in urban state schools of Barra do Garcas, Central-Western Brazil. A self-administered questionnaire was applied in the classrooms without the presence of the teacher. The outcome "violent behavior" was defined as (1) use of firearm or sharp instrument, and/or (2) aggressions against oneself and/or others, and/or (3) suicide attempt. The analyzed independent variables were age, gender, socioeconomic status, use of alcohol, use of psychoactive drugs, sexual activity, and relationship between parents. Univariate analysis was conducted, as well as multiple regression adjusted for cluster effect.
   RESULTS: Violence prevalence was of 18.6%, varying with age: 10.1% in the group aged 10 and 11 years; 20.2% for those aged 12-19 years; and 4.5% in the group aged 20-21 years. The factors associated with violent behavior were use of alcohol (RP = 2.51, 95%CI 1.22; 5.15), use of psychoactive drugs (RP = 2.10, 95%CI 1.61; 2.75), male gender (RP = 1.63, 95%CI 1.13; 2.35) and unsatisfactory relationship between parents (RP = 1.64, 95%CI 1.25; 2.15).
   CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate high prevalence of violence among adolescents in the age group 12-19 years, mainly among users of alcohol and drugs, of the male sex, from families whose parents do not have satisfactory relationships. Although without statistical significance in the final regression model, school result discrepancy and socioeconomic level should be considered in educational actions for prevention of violence behavior among students.

AB Objective To analyze the magnitude and trends of mortality due to external causes in specific age groups, from 0 to 19 years old in a population living in the city of Recife, Brazil, from 1979 to 1995.
   Methods Data from the Mortality Data System of the Ministry of Health and Health Department of Pernambuco State was used. The studied population. aged 0 to 19 years old. represented 41.8% of total city population in 1991. A time series exploratory ecological model was created to analyze trends in mortality coefficients due to external causes. Using simple linear regression these coefficients were assessed in specific age groups categorized by gender.
   Results and Conclusions In the rime series. mortality coefficients due to external causes showed an increasing trend, in particular due to homicides among adolescents,,where the coefficient increased on average 3.05 per year yielding a relative increase of 601, 3% over the study period In 1995. more than 90% of these homicides, were perpetrated with fire weapons. These data reinforce the seriousness of this problem and the need to deal with it. taking into account the difficulties in determining the causes of violence.

AB The objective of this article is to translate, to adapt and to validate the National College Health Risk Behavior Survey to apply at Brazilian college students. 208 college students from the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE) and University of Pernambuco (UPE) participated in the study. The validation was carried through in five stages: (1) translation; (2) retrotranslation; (3) correction and semantic adaptation (cultural adaptation); (4) face validation; (5) test-retest. Adaptations were done to deal with any semantic disagreements found between translation and retrotranslation. After face validation, the questionnaire was reduced from 96 to 52 questions. From the 11 items analyzed, the majority presented good and perfect Kappa: security and violence (Kappa=0.89); suicide (Kappa=1.00); use of the tobacco (Kappa=0.90); drinking consumption (Kappa=0.78); cocaine and other drugs consumption (Kappa=0.70); sexual behavior (Kappa=0,88) and corporal weight (Kappa=0.89). Only the item about feeding presented weak Inter-examiner Kappa (Kappa = 0.26) and the topic on health information presented moderate Kappa (Kappa=0.56). The average Kappa for all items was good (0.76). The instrument may be considered validated in the Portuguese language in Brazil with acceptable reproducibility.

AB This study looked into mortality due to medicinal drug poisoning by age, gender and intent among the population of the state of Sao Paulo. The adjusted time sequence of mortality due to drug poisoning was developed based on data available in the DATASUS Mortality Data System for 1996 to 2012. We checked the variables for magnitude and trends. We found an increase in adjusted mortality starting in 2005, and more so as of 2009, confirmed by a 95% CI for the average annual rate of change. (AARC) We did not find the same trend in overall mortality in the state (AARC = -0.22%, 95% CI = -1.12 -0.69) for specific, external cause mortality (AARC = -3.14%, 95% CI = -4.75 - -1.49) and for mortality due to accidental drug poisoning (AARC=+ 9,76%, 95% IC = -12.16 - 37.14). The largest increase was found in intentional self-poisoning with medicinal drugs (AARC = +10.64%, 95% CI = 6.92 - 14.40), and among the younger subjects (largest magnitude). The trend in mortality due to drug poisoning in the State of Sao Paulo, the importance of intent and mortality among the younger population reiterate the need to implement control measures.

   Method: The study was conducted with a sample of 120 leprosy patients being treated at two reference hospitals for leprosy in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. Survey participants were more than 18 years of age, had a confirmed diagnosis of leprosy and was undergoing antimicrobial treatment. Patients were evaluated face-to-face with a sociodemographic questionnaire and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI-Plus) in Portuguese. The period of data collection was between October 2009 and June 2012.
   Results: The assessment using the MINI-Plus showed that 34 (28.3%) patients did not receive any psychiatric diagnosis and 86 (71.7%) met the criteria for at least one. Of these 86 patients, 25 (20.8%) had one diagnosis, 26 (21.7%) had two diagnoses and the rest, 35 (29.2%), had three or more psychiatric diagnoses. All patients with a moderate or high risk of suicide had one or more psychiatric comorbidities.
   Conclusion: Leprosy patients have a high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities. Furthermore, most of them had no previous psychiatric diagnosis and the majority was not undergoing treatment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The relationship between religiosity and mental health has been a perennial source of controversy. This paper reviews the scientific evidence available for the relationship between religion and mental health. Method: The authors present the main studies and conclusions of a larger systematic review of 850 studies on the religion-mental health relationship published during the 20(th) Century identified through several databases. The present paper also includes an update on the papers published since 2000, including researches performed in Brazil and a brief historical and methodological background. Discussion: The majority of well-conducted studies found that higher levels of religious involvement are positively associated with indicators of psychological well-being (life satisfaction, happiness, positive affect, and higher morale) and with less depression, suicidal thoughts and behavior, drug/alcohol use/abuse. Usually the positive impact of religious involvement on mental health is more robust among people under stressful circumstances (the elderly, and those with disability and medical illness). Theoretical pathways of the religiousness-mental health connection and clinical implications of these findings are also discussed. Conclusions: There is evidence that religious involvement is usually associated with better mental health. We need to improve our understanding of the mediating factors of this association and its use in clinical practice.

AB Background: This study aims to compare allele and genotype frequencies of a 30-bp variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism of the DAT1 gene, located at intron 8, between adult crack cocaine users and nonaddicted individuals. Due to its involvement in drug addiction, this gene is a good candidate for molecular studies. Methods: A cross-sectional sample of 239 current adult crack abusers or dependents from in-and outpatient clinics and 211 control individuals was collected in Brazil. They were evaluated using ASRS, ASI-6, WAIS-III, and MINI assessments. DNA samples extracted from whole blood were genotyped for the intron 8 VNTR in DAT1. Results: Logistic regression analysis was performed and controlled for gender, age, ethnicity, educational level, and comorbidities of clinical interest (generalized anxiety disorder, suicide risk, major depressive episode, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder). This analysis showed that the 6R6R genotype was associated with crack cocaine addiction (OR = 1.844; CI = 1.101-3.089; p = 0.020). Conclusions: Our results are consistent with the role of DAT1 in the neurobiology of drug addiction. Nevertheless, the study of other genes, environmental factors, and their interactions is also important to gain a broader understanding of this condition. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Objective: We aimed to assess the presence of suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms and symptoms of hopelessness in three healthcare training programs. Method: The study's population comprised all students enrolled at the Medical School of the Fundacao do ABC, Brazil, from 2006 to 2007 compared to students enrolled in nursing and pharmacy programs. We applied the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, the Beck Depression Inventory and the Beck Hopeless Scale to assess psychiatric symptomatology. The general response rates of the medical, nursing, and pharmacy students were 56%, 56% and 61%, respectively. Results: There was no difference regarding the presence of suicidal ideation among medical, nursing and pharmacy students. There was also no difference regarding the presence of either depression or hopelessness in medical students in comparison to nursing and pharmacy students. In comparison to nursing and pharmacy students, significantly higher severity rates of hopelessness were observed among medical students. Conclusion: Although we did not observe significant differences regarding suicidal ideation and depression among the three healthcare programs students, our findings suggest that the presence of suicidal ideation is indeed a source of concern. Early identification of these symptoms is crucial in order to offer appropriate support and treatment and prevent deaths by suicide.

AB Objectives: Late-life depression (LLD) is the most common mental disorder among the elderly, but its clinical features remain unclear, especially among older adults. We sought to investigate if age, sex and education could influence the severity or frequency of LLD symptoms. Methods: We evaluated 639 community-dwelling individuals aged 75+ years in Caete (MG), Brazil. We used the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview to diagnose major depression according to DSM-IV criteria and the GDS-15 to measure depression severity. Results: Excluding 174 individuals diagnosed with dementia, 54 (11.6%) of the remaining 457 individuals were diagnosed with LLD; 77.8% of which were female. On average, these participants were aged 81.0 +/- 4.8 years and had 2.7 +/- 3.3 years of schooling. Symptom severity was not influenced by sociodemographic variables. Death/suicidal ideation was more frequent among men, while psychomotor disturbance was more present in women (p = 0.04 and p = 0.042). More educated individuals (>= 4 years) also reported a higher frequency of psychomotor disturbance (p = 0.039). Conclusions: Severity of depressive episode was not influenced by sociodemographic variables. Sex and educational level had a significant impact on symptom profiles.

AB The scope of this article is to analyze the epidemiological data relating to exposure to medication among women of reproductive age attended at a Toxicology Information Center. A study was conducted among women of reproductive age exposed to medication between 2007 and 2011. The variables relating to the patients, the occurrence and the medication involved were studied in a total of 777 notified cases. Data was collected from Aggravated Injury Notification System forms and processed on Epi Info for Windows software. The majority of the occurrences (90.5%) was intentional, 33.7% of theses incidents involved the intake of 2 or 3 types of drugs by the patients and the percentile of hospitalization was 35.6%. Drugs acting on the central nervous system were responsible for 59.9% of the incidents, and antidepressants (21.3%) and anti-epileptics (21.2%) were most commonly involved. The main factors associated with hospitalization were: delayed medical rescue after exposure, patients with higher education, ingestion of 2 or 3 types of drugs and exposure to anti-epileptics and antidepressants. Data from this study showed that exposure to medication is a serious health problem for women of reproductive age and it contributes to the increase in the number of hospitalizations.

AB This article analyzes the impact of firearms in the homicides of young people in Latin America today. A cross-sectional descriptive epidemiological study was carried out based on data from the Pan American Health Organization. There were 14,427 deaths due to assaults with firearms in young people, that is, a rate of 14.3 per 100,000 young people for the year 2014 in Latin America. Thus, 80% of all homicides in young people between 10 to 19 years of age in the region were committed with firearms. This especially affects young males, with a rate of 26.5 per 100,000 deaths due to assault with firearms, although it should not be overlooked that the deaths among women are largely femicides. In addition, 1,828 deaths of undetermined intent with firearms (especially in Argentina and Venezuela) and 284 deaths with firearms in legal interventions (showing higher policy lethality among young people) were registered. The corrected rate is therefore 16.4 young people killed by others with firearms per 100,000 youth in Latin America. The need for gun control and disarmament policies, de-stigmatization campaigns and youth development programs is discussed, in order to reduce the current conditions that foster and invisibilize the so-called "armed juvenicide" in Latin America.

AB This research aims at investigating family farming workers' of Ituporanga microregion mental health problems and sociodemographical feature and work process association. The sample corresponded to 447 family farming workers in Ituporanga, i.e., part of the overall population lives in the 1.578 rural properties of the city (IBGE, 2007). A questionnaire with socio-demographic and work process variables was used for data collection concerning mental health problems along with the Self Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20). Inference descriptive statistics with central trend measures and variability was used for data analysis. By means of binary logistic regression the probability of an event, i.e. the presence of mental health problems occur as a result of predicting variables. Level of significance 5% was adopted in all statistical procedures. The investigation revealed the prevalence of 33,8% of mental health problems. It was observed that women prevailed with 39,7% (n=91), in contrast with men with 26,1% (n=46), being such association statistically significant (X-2=8,225, df=1, p=0,004, phi=-0,143). Socio-demographical and work process variables showed predictors of mental health problems, such as: (sex, age, use of agro-chemicals, working hours outside and during harvest time, being family intoxication the most important. Mental health problems showed mostly associated to the use of agro-chemicals and farmers being intoxicated.

AB Objectives: to evaluate and indicate the procedure to be followed in the health unit, both for diagnosis and the treatment of acute exogenous intoxications by carbamates or organophosphates.
   Methods: a descriptive study based on retrospective analysis of the clinical history of patients diagnosed with intoxication by carbamates or organophosphates admitted at the emergency unit of the Hospital de Urgencias de Sergipe Governador Joao Alves (HUSE) between January and December of 2012. Some criteria were evaluated, such as: intoxicating agent; patient's age and gender; place of event, cause, circumstances and severity of the intoxication; as well as signs and symptoms of the muscarinic, nicotinic and neurological effects.
   Results: seventy patients (average age: 25 +/- 19.97) formed the study's population. It was observed that 77.14% of them suffered carbamate intoxication. However, organophosphate intoxications were more severe, with 68.75% of patients presenting moderate to severe forms. Suicide attempt was the leading cause of poisoning, with 62 cases (88.57% of total). Atropine administration was an effective therapeutic approach for treating signs and symptoms, which included sialorrhea (p=0.0006), nausea (p=0. 0029) and emesis (p < 0.0001). The use of activated charcoal was shown effective, both in combating the signs and symptoms presented by both patient groups (p < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: it is concluded that the use of atropine and activated charcoal is highly effective to treat the signs and symptoms developed by patients presenting acute exogenous intoxication by carbamates or organophosphates.

AB A descriptive study of a time series seeking to assess mortality due to external causes in males in the State of Minas Gerais was conducted in the period from 1999 to 2008, duly identifying the behavior of this group of causes throughout the time series. Data were obtained about the male population resident in the State of Minas Gerais recorded in the Unified Health System (SUS). Mortality rates per 100,000 inhabitants, divided by age group and specific cause were calculated. A simple linear regression model was used to check the trends of male deaths during the study period. An increase in male mortality in all years of the study period was found, rising from 82.7 deaths per 100,000 in 1999 to 95.7 deaths per 100,000 in 2008, representing a 15.7% increase in the risk of death due to external causes. Young male adults (20-39 years) accounted for the majority of deaths due to external causes. In relation to traffic accidents, there was an increase in mortality rates, especially between 2000 and 2007. The rates of suicide and homicide also rose in the period. In conclusion, it is necessary to adopt preventive measures, since men are prone to death due to external causes, in order to contribute to the inclusion of specific aspects into educational programs geared to reverse this trend.

AB Background: It has been proposed that all forms of bipolar disorder-perhaps all primary affective disorders-are best conceptualized as a spectrum of related illness, clinically overlapping but not necessarily genetically uniform illnesses. We aim to describe with retrospective methodology the demographic, clinical, and therapeutic response in a group of social anxiety disorder (SA) patients who improves while taking antidepressants and compare them with bipolar II (B-II) patients.
   Methods: 57 SA outpatients (DSM-IV) were diagnosed and naturalistic efficacious treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Their demographic, clinical features and therapeutic response were compared with 41 DSM-IV bipolar II patients in their starting evaluations in our outpatient clinic in the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
   Results: There is a sub-group of SA patients who improves while taking antidepressants and presents a clear hypomanic phase. Their improvement is identical to a mild/moderate hypomaniac state. Without the antidepressant, the symptoms of SA return. The SA and B-II patients have a similar number of previous depressive episodes, alcohol abuse, suicide attempts, and family history for mood disorder.
   Limitations: It is a retrospective data description based on a naturalist follow-up.
   Conclusion: Some SA patients have demographic, clinical and therapeutic features similar to B-II patients and they might just be a Bipolar-III sub-group with a higher level of complains to social situations and without spontaneous hypomania during lifetime.

AB Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness affecting around 1% of adults with a high degree of morbidity and mortality. Affected individuals are at increased risk for unemployment, handicap, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hearth attack and suicide. Antipsychotic drugs are the best treatment for this disease, but about 20% of patients display drug resistance, or refractoriness, and may receive a special neuroleptic named Clozapine. Despite its superiority from other neuroleptics, only 30-60% of drug-resistant patients are responsive to clozapine. Clozapine's action results from interactions between dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmitter systems and since clozapine appears to exert its effect strongly through the serotonergic systems, alterations in serotonin synaptic levels may influence antipsychotic response. The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) is responsible for pre-synaptic re-uptake of serotonin, making this transporter a logical candidate gene for prediction of clozapine response and to increase understanding about mechanisms of refractoriness. Therefore, we investigated the influence of two polymorphisms in the 5-HTT gene (HTTLPR/rs25531 and VNTR Stin2) in clozapine response in a sample of 116 schizophrenic individuals of European descent from South-Brazil. Significant differences between responders and non-responders to clozapine were observed for the HTTLPR/rs25531 polymorphism. Nonresponders to clozapine showed a higher frequency of S'-allele (P = 0.01) and also were more likely to be S'/S' homozygous or S'/L' heterozygous than those who did respond (P = 0.04). After controlling for confounding variables, logistic regression analyses confirmed this association (OR = 3.15; 95% CI; 1.13-.80). The observed association suggests that increased availability of extracellular serotonin concentrations at all synapses may reduce clozapine effect. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: In Brazil, there is no valid instrument to measure subjective cognitive dysfunction in bipolar disorder. The present study analyzed the psychometric properties of the Cognitive Complaints in Bipolar Disorder Rating Assessment (COBRA) in Brazilian bipolar patients. We further investigated the relationship between the COBRA, objective cognitive measures, and illness course variables.
   Methods: The total sample (N=150) included 85 bipolar disorder patients and 65 healthy controls. The psychometric properties of the COBRA (e.g., internal consistency, concurrent validity, discriminative validity, factor analyses, ROC curve, and feasibility) were analyzed.
   Results: The COBRA showed a one-factor structure with very high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.890). Concurrent validity was indicated by a strong correlation with the cognitive domain of the FAST (r=0.811, p<0.001). Bipolar patients experienced greater cognitive complaints (mean=14.69; standard deviation [SD]=10.03) than healthy controls (mean=6.78; SD=5.49; p<0.001), suggesting discriminative validity of the instrument. No significant correlations were found between the COBRA and objective cognitive measures. Furthermore, higher COBRA scores were associated with residual depressive (r=0.448; p<0.001) and manic (r=0.376; p<0.001) symptoms, number of depressive episodes (r=0.306; p=0.011), number of total episodes (r=0.256; p=0.038), and suicide attempts (r=0.356; p=0.003).
   Conclusion: The COBRA is a valid instrument to assess cognitive complaints, and the combined use of subjective-objective cognitive measures enables the correct identification of cognitive dysfunctions in bipolar disorder.

AB Background: Medical education and training can contribute to the development of depressive symptoms that might lead to possible academic and professional consequences. We aimed to investigate the characteristics of depressive symptoms among 481 medical students (79.8% of the total who matriculated).
   Methods: The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and cluster analyses were used in order to better describe the characteristics of depressive symptoms. Medical education and training in Brazil is divided into basic (1(st) and 2(nd) years), intermediate (3(rd) and 4(th) years), and internship (5(th) and 6(th) years) periods. The study organized each item from the BDI into the following three clusters: affective, cognitive, and somatic. Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc Tukey corrected for multiple comparisons.
   Results: There were 184 (38.2%) students with depressive symptoms (BDI > 9). The internship period resulted in the highest BDI scores in comparison to both the basic (p < .001) and intermediate (p < .001) periods. Affective, cognitive, and somatic clusters were significantly higher in the internship period. An exploratory analysis of possible risk factors showed that females (p = .020) not having a parent who practiced medicine (p = .016), and the internship period (p = .001) were factors for the development of depressive symptoms.
   Conclusion: There is a high prevalence towards depressive symptoms among medical students, particularly females, in the internship level, mainly involving the somatic and affective clusters, and not having a parent who practiced medicine. The active assessment of these students in evaluating their depressive symptoms is important in order to prevent the development of co-morbidities and suicide risk.

AB Introduction The objective of this study was to explore the acceptability of rapid HIV self-testing (RHST) among men who have sex with men (MSM).
   Methods During 2006-2009, a sample of 500 MSM was recruited through Respondent Driven Sampling for an HIV prevalence/incidence study. Attitude toward RHST was explored among HIV negative MSM. Data were weighted prior to analyses.
   Results Participants reported they were likely to buy RHST (74%), test themselves more frequently than they currently do (77%), and that the procedure would simplify testing (70%). Furthermore, 71% reported they would probably use it alone, 66% would use it with a steady partner, and 56% with a friend/partner. While a majority acknowledged that RHST use would deprive them of receiving counseling (61%), 74% declared they would go for help if they tested positive; 57% would use an RHST in order to avoid condoms. Probability of use surpassed 70% among gay and non-gay identified MSM as well as those with and without a previous HIV test. Those likely to buy RHST were older (p = 0.025) and more likely to identify as gay (p = 0.036). A total of 17% said they would think about killing themselves and 9% would attempt suicide if they tested positive. These MSM were more likely to be younger (p<0.001), with lower mood level (p<0.001) and greater feelings of loneliness (p = 0.026).
   Conclusions The high acceptability of RHST found among MSM should encourage the authorities to consider the possibility of offering it for self-testing, as it can improve early diagnosis and prevention of future transmissions. However, further research is needed to understand how to

AB Self-sacrificial behavior represents an extreme and relatively uncommon form of altruism in worker insects. It can occur, however, when inclusive fitness benefits are high, such as when defending the nest. We studied nest defense behaviors in stingless bees, which live in eusocial colonies subject to predation. We introduced a target flag to nest entrances to elicit defensive responses and quantified four measures of defensivity in 12 stingless bee species in So Paulo State, Brazil. These included three Trigona species, which are locally known for their aggression. Species varied significantly in their attack probability (cross species range = 0-1, P < 0.001), attack latency (7.0-23.5 s, P = 0.002), biting duration of individual bees (3.5-508.7 s, P < 0.001), and number of attackers (1.0-10.8, P < 0.001). A "suicide" bioassay on the six most aggressive species determined the proportion of workers willing to suffer fatal damage rather than disengage from an intruder. All six species had at least some suicidal individuals (7-83 %, P < 0.001), reaching 83 % in Trigona hyalinata. Biting pain was positively correlated with an index of overall aggression (P = 0.002). Microscopic examination revealed that all three Trigona species had five sharp teeth per mandible, a possible defensive adaptation and cause of increased pain. Suicidal defense via biting is a new example of self-sacrificial altruism and has both parallels and differences with other self-sacrificial worker insects, such as the honey bee. Our results indicate that suicidal biting may be a widespread defense strategy in stingless bees, but it is not universal.

DT Article
AB Background In the World Health Organization book by Murray and Lopez (The Global Burden of Disease), the authors make the point that there are major regional differences across the world for death from injury. In the European market economies, injuries accounted for 6% of all deaths, of which the majority were the result of road traffic accidents. In stark contrast, in Latin America and the Caribbean, injuries account for 12-13% of all deaths, and most of these are the result of violence. An estimated 30% of all male deaths are from external causes, and road traffic accidents are the number two cause of death. Within South American countries, trauma is the second most common cause of death in Columbia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Brazil. In other South American countries, it is the third or fourth most common cause of death. If one examines the Disability Adjusted Life Years, South America is the third highest in the world. Death from injury primarily affects people in the middle- and low-income group. Traffic accidents and suicide are the main causes of trauma in the high-income population. South America is made up of developing and poor countries that have trauma as a very important cause of death and disability.
   Methods The author has reviewed information on injury from the World Health Organization, Pan American Health Organization, and Brazilian Health Ministry. In addition, a search of injury was performed through MEDLINE.
   Results and Conclusions The results of this review show that trauma is a major public health problem in South America. At the present time, there is a lack of statewide system development. In addition, there are difficulties in training surgeons to cope with these problems.

AB Background
   Poor nutrition and growth during fetal life and childhood might be associated with depression in adulthood; however, studies evaluating these associations present controversial results, especially when comparing studies using different proxies for fetal growth. We evaluated the association of fetal and childhood growth/nutrition with depression, in adulthood, using different approaches and measurement methods.
   Method
   In 1982, hospital births (n = 5914) in Pelotas, southern Brazil, were examined and have been prospectively followed. At 30 years, the presence of major depression and depressive symptoms severity was evaluated using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). The present study assessed their association with birth weight, premature birth, small for gestational age (SGA), stunting and conditional growth during childhood.
   Results
   At 30 years, 3576 individuals were evaluated and 7.9% had major depression. Low birth weight (PR = 1.01 95% CI [0.64-1.60]), having been born SGA (PR = 0.87 95% CI [0.64-1.19]) and premature birth (PR = 1.22 95% CI [0.72-2.07]) were not associated with major depression inmultivariable models. However, those born SGA who were also stunted in childhood had a higher prevalence of major depression (PR = 1.87 95% CI [1.06-3.29]) and greater odds of scoring a higher level of depression in the BDI-II (OR = 2.18 95% CI [1.34-3.53]).
   Conclusion
   In this Brazilian cohort of young adults, those born SGA who were also stunted during childhood had a higher risk of depression in adulthood. Our results show that the effect of growth impairment on depression is cumulative.

AB Background: Many men's health outcomes are poor at the global level. Men have lower life and healthy life expectancies than women. They are more likely to die from cancer, cardiovascular disease, suicide, road traffic accidents and other major causes of death. They are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol excessively and eat a poor diet. In many countries and for many diseases, men use primary care services less effectively than women.
   Objectives: The purpose of this article was to review the key data on men's health at the global level and explore explanations for men's outcomes, including health practices, use of services and health literacy and masculinities. The response of health organisations, the evidence of the impact of gender-sensitive interventions and the case for action on men's health were also considered.
   Major findings: Despite the problems with men's health, it has been largely overlooked by national and global health organisations. When organisations do focus on gender, action is usually targeted at women and girls rather than both sexes. There is an increasing body of evidence that sex-specific initiatives can also be effective.
   Conclusions: If population health is to be improved, and if good health is a universal right, steps must be taken to improve men's health as well as women's. There is a role for male-targeted health policies (building on the lessons of national men's health policies in Ireland, Brazil and Australia) as well as changes to service delivery. There is not a choice to be made between men's health and women's health: this need not be a zero sum game. Action is needed for both sexes and improving the health of men will also improve the health of women.

AB Background: Clinical assessment of depression is an important part of pre-surgical assessment among individuals with morbid obesity. However, there is no agreed-upon instrument to identify mood psychopathology in this population. We examined the reliability and criterion validity of the clinician-administered Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Sca (MADRS) and the utility of a short version for bariatric surgery candidates.
   Methods: The sample was 374 patients with obesity, consecutively recruited from the waiting list of a bariatric surgery clinic of University Hospital, Brazil: women 80 %, mean BMI 47 kg/m(2), mean age 43.0 years. The 10-item MADRS was analyzed against the SCID-I. Items that showed small relevance to sample's characteristics and contribution to data variability were removed to develop the short 5-item version of scale. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of cutoff points of both versions MADRS, and values were plotted as a receiver operating characteristic curve.
   Results: For the 10-item MADRS, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.93. When compared against SCID-I, the best cut-off threshold was 13/14, yielding sensitivity of 0.81 and specificity 0.85. Following items were removed: reduced appetite, reduced sleep, concentration difficulties, suicide thought and lassitude. The 5-item version showed an alpha coefficient of 0.94 and a best cut-off threshold of 10/11, yielding sensitivity of 0.81 and specificity 0.87. Similar overall ability to discriminate depression of almost 90 % was found for both 10-item and 5-item MADRS.
   Conclusion: The MADRS is a reliable and valid instrument to assess depressive symptoms among treatment-seeking bariatric patients. Systematic application of the abbreviated version of the MADRS can be recommended for enhancing the clinical detection of depression during perioperative period.

AB Objective: This multicenter study estimated the prevalence of bipolar disorder (BPD) among emergency department (ED) patients in Latin America. Methods: To identify patients with BPD, a combination of DSM IV-criteria interview and the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) was used. Data from 1,505 patients from hospitals in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico was analyzed. Results: The prevalence of BPD in this sample was 5.2% (95% CI = 4.5% to 6.9%). Themean age was 37 years (response rate of 83.0%). Compared to non-BPD patients, BPD patients were more likely to report asthma (16.7% vs. 9%), thyroid problems (12.8% vs. 5.8%), seizures (23.1% vs. 3.0%), obesity (39.7% vs. 26.9%), alcohol abuse (30.8% vs. 10.0%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (50.0% vs. 12.0%), depression (81.6% vs. 45.7%), obsessive compulsive disorder (20.1% vs. 3.0%), panic disorders (23.1% vs. 12.3%), phobic disorders (11.2% vs. 3.1%), and any anxiety disorder (82.1% vs. 41.8%; all p <= 0.05). Suicidal plans and attempts were also significant higher in the bipolar group (11.5% vs. 2.8% and 10.3% vs. 1.8% respectively). Multivariate analysis identified ADHD, depression, alcohol abuse, anxiety disorder, and last month suicide plans and attempts to be independently associated with BPD. Conclusion: Our study supports that BPD is prevalent in ED in Latin-American countries and that comorbidity is the rule, not the exception. Patients presenting at ED with irritability, anxiety, pressure speech, euphoria, with suicidal tendencies, involved in risky behaviors, alcohol abuse, dependence or those with history of mental health hospitalization in the past 12 months must be assessed for comorbid BPD.

AB Introduction: Exposure to pesticides has been associated with psychiatric problems among farm workers, although there is still controversy as to chemical types, intensity and forms of exposure that represent risk factors for neuropsychological problems. Furthermore, tobacco workers are exposed to dermal absorption of nicotine, although its effect on mental health has not yet been studied.
   Objectives: To identify the prevalence of minor psychiatric disorders (MPD) among tobacco farmers and associated factors, paying special attention to pesticide and nicotine exposure.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional study with a representative sample of tobacco growers, characterizing economic indicators of the farms, socio-demographic factors, lifestyle habits and occupational exposures. Multivariate analysis was performed using a hierarchical Poisson regression model.
   Results: A total of 2400 tobacco farmers were assessed and MPD prevalence was 12%. MPD was higher among women (PR 1.4), workers aged 40 or over, tenants/employees (PR 1.8) and those who reported having difficulty in paying debts (PR 2.0). Low socioeconomic status was inversely associated with MPD prevalence. Tasks involving dermal exposure to pesticides showed risk varying between 35% and 71%, whereas tobacco growers on farms using organophosphates had 50% more risk of MPD than those not exposed to this kind of pesticide. The number of pesticide poisoning and green tobacco sickness episodes showed linear association with MPD.
   Conclusions: The study reinforces the evidence of the association between pesticide poisoning and mental health disorders. It also points to increased risk of MPD from low socioeconomic status, dermal pesticide exposure as well as from exposure to organophosphates. Furthermore, the study reveals intense nicotine exposure as a risk for tobacco farmers' mental health. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Aims and objectives This study aimed to analyse the prevalence and factors associated with suicidal ideation among family caregivers of people with mental disorders. Background Studies conducted with family caregivers of people with dementia and cancer point out a high prevalence of suicidal ideation among these subjects; however, this aspect has not yet been investigated among family caregivers of people with mental disorders. Design This is a cross-sectional study, conducted with 537 family caregivers of patients from 16 Psychosocial Care Centers (CAPS) of the 21st Health Region of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Methods Question 17 of the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) was used for suicidal ideation screening. The prevalence of suicidal ideation was calculated according to sociodemographic and care variables, with confidence interval estimate (95% CI). Crude and adjusted odds ratios were calculated by logistic regression. The Guidelines to Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE Statement) was adhered in this study (See File S1). Results The prevalence of suicidal ideation found in this study for the 30 days preceding the interview was 12.5% (95% CI: 10-15). The factors associated with the outcome were lower age, lower schooling, feeling of burden, self-report of stress problem and dissatisfaction with family relationships. Conclusion The prevalence of suicidal ideation among the studied family caregivers was high and strongly associated with issues regarding care, showing the need for interventions that provide support. Relevance for clinical practice Nurses are a large part of the workforce of the community mental health services. The careful characterisation of the subjects who show suicidal ideation, as performed in this study, may reveal specificities capable of refining the diagnostic potential for establishment of action plans in a timely manner, avoiding possible attempts or even the consummation of suicide.

AB OBJECTIVE: To validate the instrument of the World Health Organization Violence Against Women (WHO VAW) study on psychological, physical and sexual violence against women perpetrated by intimate partners.
   METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in several countries between 2000 and 2003, including Brazil. Representative random samples of women aged 15-49 years with intimate partners were selected, living in the city of Sao Paulo (n = 940) and in the Zona da Mata. Pernambuco (n = 1,188),southeastern and northeastern regions, respectively. Exploratory factor analysis on questions relating to violence was performed (four psychological, six physical and three sexual questions), with varimax rotation and creation of three factors. Cronbach's alpha was calculated to analyze the internal consistency. To validate through extreme groups, mean scores (0 to 13 points) for violence were tested in relation to the following outcomes: self-rated health, daily activities, presence of discomfort or pain, suicidal ideation or attempts, heavy alcohol consumption and presence of common mental disorders.
   RESULTS: Three factors were defined, with similar accumulated variance (0.6092 in Sao Paulo and 0.6350 in the Zona (la Mata). For Sao Paulo, the first factor was determined by physical violence, the second by sexual violence and the third by psychological violence. For the Zona da Mata, the first factor was formed by psychological violence, the second by physical violence and the third by sexual violence. Cronbach's alpha coefficients were 0.88 in Sao Paulo and 0.89 in the Zona da Mata. The mean scores or violence were significantly higher for less favorable outcomes, with the exception of suicide attempts in Silo Paulo.
   CONCLUSIONS: The instrument was shown to he adequate for estimating gender-based violence against women perpetrated by intimate partners and can be used in studies on this subject. It has high internal consistency and a capacity to discriminate between different forms of violence (psychological, physical and sexual) perpetrated in different social contexts. The instrument also characterizes the female victim and her relationship with the aggressor, thereby facilitating gender analysis.

AB Purpose. (a) detect possible demographic and behavioral differences among young episodic heavy drinkers and other young drinkers; (b) investigate the association of youth drinking patterns with other health-compromising behaviors. Methods. The data presented are part of a health behavior survey, which used a modified version of the Youth Health Risk Behavior Survey (YHRBS) questionnaire. Students from public (n = 993) and private schools (n = 815), from 7(th) to 11(th) grades were investigated in Sao Paulo city. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed to investigate the association among different drinking practices and the various health-compromising behaviors, controlling for age group, gender, and school system. Odds Ratios (OR) and their 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were calculated. Episodic Heavy Drinking was defined as having five or more drinks in a 2-hour interval, at least once in the last 30 days: Results. Episodic Heavy Drinkers (EHDs) tend to be older and males and prefer to drink with friends at commercial facilities instead of drinking with their relatives at home. EHDs also reported higher percentages of adverse consequences, such as physical fights, accidents, and school absenteism after drinking. EHDs are more likely to engage in other high-risk behaviors. In the public schools, they were more likely to carry guns (OR = 17.0; CI = 3.9-74.8), get involved in physical fights (OR=8.9; CI=4.4-18.0), attempt suicide (OR=4.2; CI= 2.0-8.7), and use inhalants (OR= 2.7; CI = 1.3-5.7) than abstainers. They are also more likely to use marijuana (OR = 4.7; CI = 2.2-9.9) and smoke cigarettes (OR = 5.3; CI = 2.7-10.4) than moderate drinkers. The results were similar for private schools, with even higher ratios of inhalant use (OR = 15.2; CI = 6.2-37.1), when EHDs were compared with abstainers and cigarette (OR = 64.5; CI = 8.6-481.0) and marijuana use (OR=6.5; CI = 43-9.7), when EHDs were compared with moderate drinkers. Conclusions. EHDs display different drinking habits than other adolescents who drink. Also, they are at increased risk for a range of health-compromising behaviors, when compared with both abstainers and moderate drinkers.

AB Background: Ziprasidone has been used to treat schizophrenia since 2000. It is unknown whether its modest QTc-prolonging effect increases cardiovascular event risk.
   Purpose: To describe the study design of the Ziprasidone Observational Study of Cardiac Outcomes (ZODIAC).
   Method: The study was conducted between February 2002 and February 2006. One-year follow-up for the primary endpoint of nonsuicide death ended in April 2007. ZODIAC is an open-label, randomized, postmarketing study enrolling patients with schizophrenia in naturalistic practice in 18 countries. The primary outcome measure was the rate of nonsuicide mortality in the year after initial recommendation for therapy. Subjects were randomly assigned to either ziprasidone or olanzapine, after which follow-up was conducted by investigators aware of the assigned exposure. A physician-administered questionnaire collected baseline information on patients' demographics, medical and psychiatric history, and concomitant medication use. Data were self-reported by patients or reported by enrolling physicians.
   Results: ZODIAC enrolled 18,240 patients with schizophrenia. Most (73.0%) were from the United States or Brazil. Patients' baseline mean age was 41.6 years, 55.1% were male, and 60.0% were white. At baseline, approximately 18% had hypertension, 14.8% had hyperlipidemia, 46.5% currently smoked, 28.9% had a body mass index >= 30 kg/m(2), and 7.7% had diabetes. Mean time from schizophrenia diagnosis to study enrollment was 10.4 years and mean Clinical Global Impressions scale score was 5.2 (range: 1-8). Nearly one third of patients had ever attempted suicide. Seventy-one percent were using antipsychotics at baseline. Almost 80% were using concomitant medications, with 29.5% using antidepressants, 25.4% using anxiolytics, and 19.0% using mood stabilizers. Less than 3% were using antihypertensives or statins.
   Conclusions: ZODIAC is a uniquely designed study with an initial randomization to ziprasidone or olanzapine and follow-up largely consistent with usual practice (i.e., many characteristics of a nonexperimental study). Baseline data suggest this study population has a substantial prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. Concomitant medications were used frequently, although hyperlipidemia and hypertension may be undertreated.

AB Objectives: To collate data from multiple obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) treatment centers across seven countries and five continents, and to report findings in relation to OCD comorbidity, age of onset of OCD and comorbid disorders, and suicidality, in a large clinical and ethnically diverse sample, with the aim of investigating cultural variation and the utility of the psychiatric diagnostic classification of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.
   Methods: Researchers in the field of OCD were invited to contribute summary statistics on current and lifetime psychiatric comorbidity, age of onset of OCD and comorbid disorders and suicidality in their patients with OCD.
   Results: Data from 3711 adult patients with primary OCD came from Brazil (n = 955), India (n = 802), Italy (n = 750), South Africa (n = 565), Japan (n = 322), Australia (n = 219), and Spain (n = 98). The most common current comorbid disorders were major depressive disorder (28.4%; n = 1055), obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (24.5%, n = 478), generalized anxiety disorder (19.3%, n = 716), specific phobia (19.2%, n = 714) and social phobia (18.5%, n = 686). Major depression was also the most commonly co-occurring lifetime diagnosis, with a rate of 50.5% (n = 1874). OCD generally had an age of onset in late adolescence (mean = 17.9 years, SD = 1.9). Social phobia, specific phobia and body dysmorphic disorder also had an early age of onset. Co-occurring major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and psychotic disorders tended to have a later age of onset than OCD. Suicidal ideation within the last month was reported by 6.4% (n = 200) of patients with OCD and 9.0% (n = 314) reported a lifetime history of suicide attempt.
   Conclusions: In this large cross-continental study, comorbidity in OCD was common. The high rates of comorbid major depression and anxiety disorders emphasize the need for clinicians to assess and monitor for these disorders. Earlier ages of onset of OCD, specific phobia and social phobia may indicate some relatedness between these disorders, but this requires further study. Although there do not appear to be significant cultural variations in rates or patterns of comorbidity and suicidality, further research using similar recruitment strategies and controlling for demographic and clinical variables may help to determine whether any sociocultural factors protect against suicidal ideation or psychiatric comorbidity in patients with OCD.

TI Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Trajectories From Childhood to

   METAANALYSIS; UPDATE
AB IMPORTANCE The requirement of a childhood onset has always been a key criterion for the diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults, but recently this requirement has become surrounded by controversy.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate whether impaired young adults with ADHD symptoms always have a childhood-onset disorder in a population-based longitudinal study.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Participants belonged to the 1993 Pelotas Birth Cohort Study, including 5249 individuals born in Pelotas, Brazil, in 1993. They were followed up to 18 to 19 years of age, with 81.3% retention. The data analysis was performed between August 8, 2015, and February 5, 2016.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The ADHD status was first ascertained at 11 years of age using a screening instrument (hyperactivity subscale of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire) calibrated for a DSM-IV ADHD diagnosis based on clinical interviews with parents using the Development and Well-Being Assessment. At 18 to 19 years of age, ADHD diagnosis was derived using DSM-5 criteria, except age at onset. We estimated the overlap between these groups assessed at 11 and 18 to 19 years of age and the rates of markers of impairment in these 2 groups compared with those without ADHD.
   RESULTS At 11 years of age, childhood ADHD (C-ADHD) was present in 393 individuals (8.9%). At 18 to 19 years of age, 492 individuals (12.2%) fulfilled all DSM-5 criteria for young adult ADHD (YA-ADHD), except age at onset. After comorbidities were excluded, the prevalence of YA-ADHD without comorbidities decreased to 256 individuals (6.3%). Children with C-ADHD had a male preponderance not observed among children without ADHD (251 [63.9%] vs 1930 [47.9%] male, P < .001), whereas the YA-ADHD group had a female preponderance (192 [39.0%] vs 1786 [50.4%] male, P < .001). Both groups had increased levels of impairment in adulthood, as measured by traffic incidents, criminal behavior, incarceration, suicide attempts, and comorbidities. However, only 60 children (17.2%) with ADHD continued to have ADHD as young adults, and only 60 young adults (12.6%) with ADHD had the disorder in childhood.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings of this study do not support the assumption that adulthood ADHD is necessarily a continuation of childhood ADHD. Rather, they suggest the existence of 2 syndromes that have distinct developmental trajectories.
