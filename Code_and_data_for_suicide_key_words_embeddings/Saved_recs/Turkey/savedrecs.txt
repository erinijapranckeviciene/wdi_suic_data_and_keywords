AB In this study, we consider the suicide mortality in Turkey for the period of 2002-2011 by using both statistical and mapping analysis in order to reveal clustering of the suicide mortality in Turkey. We investigate the suicide mortality separately in males and females. For this purposes, firstly, we apply the age adjusted method to standardize the suicide mortality data. Some statistics for the suicide mortality rate are then calculated. It was found that the calculated statistics of the suicide mortality rates in Turkey are different for man and woman. Also, the spatial correlation coefficient and mapping analysis are used to investigate whether there are spatial associations between the suicide mortalities. The results of analysis show that there is spatially clustering at provincial level in Turkey.

AB Objective To analyse suicides occurring in Turkey between 1990 and 2010 according to sex, age, reason and method.
   Methods Data concerning suicides occurring in Turkey between 1990 and 2010 were obtained from annual records published by the Turkish Statistical Institute. Data were analysed according to sex, age, reason for suicide and suicide method.
   Results The crude suicide rate was 2.42 per 100 000 population in 1990 and 4.02 per 100 000 population in 2010. The highest number of suicides was seen in those aged 15-24years. In this age group, the number of suicides in females was significantly higher than in males. The most common suicide method in Turkey was hanging. Men used firearms more frequently than women. All the reasons for suicide occurred in a higher number of males than females; however, the difference between males and females was more significant for economic problems, relationship problems and educational failure. The leading reason for suicide in females was relationship problems.
   Conclusion Detecting population subgroups with a high suicide risk and obtaining regional demographic data are of great importance for future studies on suicide prevention.

AB This article examines the growing concern about female suicide in early republican Turkey. It shows that debates about modernisation intersected in various and complex ways with the scientific and more popular discourse about female suicide. Informed by the work of, amongst others, Judith Butler, Saba Mahmood and Rosi Braidotti, it argues that the women who committed suicide exerted an agency which the new regime denied them and that it was largely for this reason that female suicide became such a public issue in Turkey in the 1920s and 1930s.

AB This study compares youth (<24 years) suicide rates in Turkey and the United States; a demographic and cross-cultural comparison and exploration of possible causative factors. Publicly available data were compared for children, adolescents, and young adults for years 1992-2004. The mean general population suicide rate in Turkey (per 100,000) was, male = 3.53 and female = 2.31 (for the US, males = 18.37, females = 4.31); for ages below 15 years the rate was, males = 0.28 and females = 0.39 (for the US, males = 1.09 and females = 0.38); while for aged 15-24 years the rate was, males = 4.58 and females = 5.22 (for the US, males = 18.84 and females = 3.36).
   The patterns for Turkey are: (a) Female youth had a higher suicide rate than male youth; this was the reverse of the U. S. pattern, (b) Youth suicide increased during the time period in Turkey, whereas it was relatively stable in the US, (c) However, suicide rates in Turkey were generally lower than the US, (d) Fifty percent of all female suicide victims in Turkey were under the age of 24 years (versus 11% in the US).
   Possible psychosocial causative factors may include (a) negative social status of females (forced marriage, young marriage age, low literacy, honor killings); (b) substantial rural to urban migration which disrupts ties and exposes migrants to a less traditional cultural system; (c) shortage of mental health services; (d) and possibly, reduced religious education enrollment may be an additional factor.

AB Suicide is a significant problem in the world. Sharing the information about the national suicide rates in the international scientific area is an important issue for not only the solution of the problem, but also improving the efforts for decreasing the suicidal deaths. We aimed to add the statistical information about the rates, the risk factors, and the methods of suicides in Turkey to the literature. The suicide rates in Turkey increased in the period between 1996 and 2005 years; it was 3.8 per 100,000 populations in 2005. The average ratio of male to female was 1.58/1 between 1996 and 2005 years. The suicidal deaths increased above the age of 75, especially in male population. In females, the most dangerous period was 15 to 24 age group. The major risk factor for suicides was found to be illness (29.6%) for both genders and especially for above middle ages. Hanging was the most preferred method for both genders and for most of the age groups in Turkey. Suicides increased in the spring and summer.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the methods used and demographic data of women suicides by examining postmortem investigation and autopsy reports from the Branch of the Council of Forensic Medicine in Diyarbakir Province, Turkey, between 1996 and 2001. Fifty-eight percent (174/302) of suicides were females and 42% (128/302) were males. The suicide rates were similarly higher for females than for males (2.6 and 1.8 per 10,000 population, respectively).
   Over half of female suicides (56.3%) occurred in those under 20 years of age. The most common suicide method for women was hanging (32.2%), and for men was firearms (51.7%), but for women younger than 20 years the most frequent method was firearms. Among the female suicides, five (2.8%) were known to have attempted suicide at least once in the past. Twenty-nine women (16.7%) were documented to have any psychiatric illness. None of the women had a history of drug or alcohol abuse. A suicide note was found in only six cases (3.4%). The predominant suicide motive was family problems (in 32% or 56/174).
   The higher rate of suicide in females than in males, and the absolute female predominance in suicides in Diyarbakir, Turkey, are in contrast to most of the medical literature and statistical information about suicide rates by country, in which suicide rates are usually higher among males.

AB Objective: To investigate the rate and method of attempted suicides in a catchment area in Turkey as part of the WHO-EURO Multicentre Study on Suicidal Behaviour.
   Method: All hospitals in the catchment area were screened to identify suicide attempts for 4 years between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2001.
   Results: In the 4-year period, 737 individuals attempted suicide (514 women and 223 men). The mean annual rate per 100 000 was 46.89 for men and 112.89 for women. The parasuicide rate increased by 93.59% between 1998 and 2001. The most frequent method used by both men and women was self-poisoning.
   Conclusion: Compared with the results from other European research centres, attempted suicide rates in Turkey were relatively low. However, the increase in rates was striking. This upward trend may be related to the intense economic difficulties, increasing unemployment, and rapid social change experienced in Turkey in recent years. The risk groups appeared to be younger and female.

We aimed to research social, economic, cultural, and psychiatric reasons of suicides in Batman in a case-controlled psychological autopsy study comparing suicides with matched community controls. The female suicide rate was 9.3 per 100.000 and the female/male ratio was 1.72/1. The suicides most frequently occurred in young females, mean age 20.7. The most frequent method (45%) was hanging. The most frequent stressful life events were health problems and family disruption. High suicide rates among females may be related to negative social status of females living in the region.

AB The aim of this study was to determine whether there is a difference between men and women in terms of suicide age, suicide method and suicide reason in Turkey. This study recruited 17,327 cases that had committed suicide between 1990 and 2000. Of all the cases who committed suicide during a period of 11 years, 61. 1 % were men, 38.9% women. The highest suicide score fell into the age group 15-24 (P < 0.001). The most frequently used methods for suicide were self-hanging (48.2%) and use of firearms (19.2%) (P < 0.001). The proportion of those committing suicide taking chemicals (drugs, etc.) was higher in women than in men (P < 0.001). The most frequently seen reasons for suicide were illness and (33.8%) unsatisfactory relationships (33.0%) (P < 0.001, each one). Women committed suicide much more because of unsatisfactory relationships, whereas for men it was due to illness (20.8% and 14.6%, respectively). There were significant differences between men and women in terms of suicide age, suicide method and suicide reason in Turkey. When evaluating suicide cases it is essential that the differences between sexes be taken into consideration. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB There has been limited study of suicide in Islamic countries. This paper marks the first study of suicide notes in Turkey, an Islamic country. Using a classification scheme, 49 suicide notes (a rate of 34.5%) were studied. The results show that note writers do not differ greatly from other suicides. Further analysis of younger (<40) and older (>40) suicide note writers reveal few significant differences. Our results, together with the results of classification studies in different countries, suggest that caution is in order in transposing findings from one country to other countries. Future study of suicide notes should, in fact, focus on cross-cultural investigation.

AB Suicide is a global concern, hence, cross-cultural research ought to be central; yet, there is a paucity of cross-cultural study in suicidology. A thematic or theoretical-conceptual analysis of 60 suicide notes drawn from Turkey and the United States, matched for age and sex, was undertaken, based on Leenaars's empirical-based multidimensional model of suicide. The results suggested that there were more culturally common factors than specific differences; yet, not consistent with previous cross-cultural studies of suicide notes, differences emerged in Turkey notes expressing more indirect and veiled communications (indirect expressions). Specifically, Turkish notes expressed that there may be more reasons to the act than the person writes. It was concluded that the model may be applicable to suicide in both countries, but also much greater cross-cultural study is warranted on specific cultural risk factors. A question raised is whether the findings are related to collectivism versus individualism.

AB Suicide is one of the most important public health problems. There was an association between suicide and several factors such as psychiatric diseases and psychological characteristics, somatic illness, cultural, socioeconomic, familial, occupational and individual risk factors. Also, high altitude and climatic factors including high temperature, cloudiness, more sunshine and low rainfalls were defined as some of these risk factors in the literature.
   In this study, we aimed to investigate correlation between suicide rates and altitudes of all cities in Turkey and between suicide rates and climatic factors including Rainfall Activity Index, Winter Mean Temperatures, Summer Mean Temperatures and Temperature Difference between January and July previously defined by several authors in the broad series in Turkey.
   In Turkey, 29865 suicidal deaths occurred in 10 years period between 2006 and 2015. Of them, 21020 (70.4%) were males and 8845 (29.6%) were females. In this study, we found that high altitude above 1500 m, winter median temperature lower than - 10 degrees C and hard temperature changes above 25 degrees C between winter and summer of settlements were important factors that affected on female suicide rates appropriate to knowledge which defined in previous studies.
   In conclusion, we suggested that the associations among suicide rates with altitudes and climate should be studied in wider series obtained from different countries for reaching more reliable results.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate some features of suicide cases in Trakya region, Turkey. During the 21-year period from January 1984 to September 2004, there were 137 suicide cases autopsied by the Department of Forensic Medicine, Trakya University. Suicides comprised 16.1% of all forensic autopsies. Twenty-seven per cent of the cases were aged between 21 and 30 years and the mean age was 39.7 years. Males constituted 78.1% of the cases. The most frequent method of suicide was hanging (40.1%), followed by firearms, and poisoning. Overall, suicide rates in males showed an increase in the last five years. Most of the suicides occurred in the winter months.
   In conclusion, since suicides present a major public health problem, detection and prevention methods must be developed for high-risk groups.

AB Objective: To determine the gender differences between in terms of the method and reason of suicide.
   Methodology: The suicidal proportions in seven regions of Turkey by sexes were compared according to three different age groups. The data were evaluated by Loglinear analysis.
   Results: Suicide rates were higher in women in the region East Anatolia (P<0.01). It was found that suicide by hanging was the most commonly used method in all the regions (P<0.001). Committing suicide by hanging (P<0.01) and using firearms (P<0.001) were higher in men, whereas, committing suicide by taking chemical was higher in women (P<0.001).
   Conclusion: Gender differences in suicidal behavior in this study clearly merit further research to generate information that can guide clinical practice and prevention strategies.

DE Suicide; Geriatrics; Forensic medicine
AB Introduction: Suicide is defined as an individual taking action towards themselves with the intention of terminating their own life. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 800,000 deaths per year worldwide are due to suicide. In 2012, suicide cases constituted 1.4% of all the deaths worldwide. In most countries throughout the world, the suicide rates of the elderly are higher than those of other age groups. Epidemiological studies have concluded that suicide rates increase with advancing age in all societies, this increase accelerates after the age of 65 years and the highest rates are reached after the age of 75 years. The aim of this study was to evaluate the demographic features, suicide methods and reasons for suicide in geriatric suicide cases between 2009 and 2013 using the data of the Turkish Statistics Institute (TUIK).
   Material and methods: A retrospective evaluation was made of the TUIK data related to proven suicide cases aged 65 years and older in the 5-year period of 2009-2013.
   Results: A total of 1723 geriatric suicides were determined in Turkey between 2009 and 2013. These comprised 1284 (74.5%) males and 439 (25.5%) females, showing a rate of males approximately 3 times higher than that of females. An increase of approximately 10% was seen in the deaths by suicide in 2013 compared to 2009. The highest rate of geriatric suicides within total geriatric deaths was observed to be in 2012 (15.2%) and the lowest rate was in 2010 (12.4%). The most common method of suicide in both genders was hanging. In the majority of cases of geriatric suicide of both genders, the reason could not be determined. In those cases where the reason was known, the most common reason was illness.
   Conclusion: It has been reported that the most significant factors in suicide prevention are friends and family. As there continues to be an extensive family structure and family connections are strong in Turkey, this can be considered to be one of the reasons for lower rates of geriatric suicide compared to other countries. As there is a strong adherence to Islam in Turkey, another significant reason for the low rate could be the effect of the belief that suicide is a sin in the Islamic religion.

AB Two kinds of investigations can be done about the reasons of the completed suicides: epidemiologic and psychological autopsy. Psychological autopsy is a method that judicial records, psychiatric and other health attainments, information gathered during talking with person's family and other people related, are joined to find out people's personal profiles. The sufficiency of content of sources that will be examined and the reaching people from whom the information will be gotten, are the most important methodical problems in studies of psychological autopsy. The present psychological autopsy studies in Turkey will be examined with psychological autopsy studies in the literature. (Anatolian Journal of Psychiatry 2009; 10:332-335)

ID RISK-FACTORS; PSYCHOLOGICAL AUTOPSY
AB Background: Psychological autopsy studies have been widely used to identify the cause of suicide. However, gender is one of the most frequently replicated predictors for suicide. To identify further the significant risk factors for suicide among males and females separately.
   Method: Data were obtained from The Turkish-Istanbul Forensic Medicine Institute Morgue Department for all suicides deaths from April to August 2002 in Istanbul. 124 completed suicides were included in the study.
   Results: This study findings suggest that unemployed, not married or in a de facto relationship, previous suicide attempt, and alcohol or substance abuse were common amongst those who died by suicide. Most of the victims were male; the most frequent suicide methods were hanging and jumping down a high building followed by firearms. Both males and females were most frequently affected by psychiatric disorders. It was found that 108 cases that did not receive psychiatric care attempted suicide for the first time and committed suicide.
   Conclusion: This finding suggests that suicides should be investigated by an expert team and not by the police and victims' relatives only to determine whether they are really suicides or not. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The aim of this study was to determine the demographic and sociocultural characteristics of suicide attempts by using data from the Turkish Statistical Institute. It is our intent that the work data may contribute to the national suicide data and the development of suicide prevention policies.
   Material/Methods: We obtained our data, which cover the years 2007 to 2012, from the database accessible at the official website of the Turkish Statistical Institute, which permits the use of its data for research purposes. The data were evaluated by using the SPSS 10.0 program. The chi-square test was used for statistical analysis, and the percentage distribution and odds ratios were calculated.
   Results: According to data from the Turkish Statistical Institute, the total number of suicide deaths in Turkey between 2007 and 2012 changed yearly (x(2)=42,035-59,209; P<0.001). While suicide deaths in 2007 made up 0.00396% of the total deaths for that year, that figure increased to 0.00426% in 2013. According to the data from the Turkish Statistical Institute, over 1.9 million people died due to all causes between 2007 and 2012 in Turkey. Over 17,000 deaths (0.9%) were due to suicide.
   Conclusions: Suicide is an important public health problem and is multidimensional in nature. Examining this subject from etiological, epidemiological, biological, psychological, sociological, and anthropological perspectives is important to improve the prevention of suicides.

AB The Prevalence of Death Ideation and Attempted Suicide and the Associated Risk Factors in Isparta, Turkey
   Objective: Suicide is a complex process from the initiation of ideation to planning, and finally to an attempt. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of death ideation, attempted suicide, and the associated risk factors in Isparta, Turkey.
   Materials and Methods: The study included 600 participants aged 18-65 years representative of the population of central Isparta that were selected via the stratified simple randomized sampling method. The participants were administered a questionnaire for collecting demographic data, and the participant's experiences of death ideations and suicide attempts, and the clinical version of SCID were used.
   Results: The lifetime prevalence of attempted suicide and death ideations was 4.3% and 27.5%, respectively. Death ideas and attempted suicide were both more prevalent among women and younger adults. All those that attempted suicide were exposed to a stress factor prior to the attempt. The rates of death ideation and attempted suicide were lower among the participants that had children. A family history of attempted suicide was associated with an increase in the frequency of death ideations and attempted suicide. Attempted suicide and death ideas were more common among those with major depressive disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder was observed significantly more frequently among those that had attempted suicide. Panic disorder and a specific phobia were also significantly associated with death ideation.
   Conclusion: The present study's findings indicate that there were common risk factors for attempted suicide and death ideations in the study group. Determination of the prevalence of attempted suicide and death ideation in a population, identification of the associated risk factors and assessment of their relationship to mental disorders can facilitate a better understanding of suicidal behaviour.

AB Background: Suicide is among the top 20 leading causes of death globally in all age groups and it is still a significant social and public health problem.
   Methods: Data on suicide deaths in 1987-2011 were extracted from the Turkish Statistical Institute mortality dataset based on ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. The temporal trend in age-standardized suicide rates was tested for age, gender and methods Using Joinpoint Regression Analysis.
   Results: The average of age-standardized suicide rates of the period 1987-2011 were 3.08 per 100,000 people, 3.95 for male and 2.21 for female. Significant increases were observed in males in all age groups, but no significant changes were observed in females over the age of 45. The most common methods of suicide among people who live in Turkey were hanging, poisoning, firearms and jumping.
   Conclusion: High-risk groups could benefit from targeted strategies of suicide prevention. To understand the important influences on suicide risk in different age groups, future studies must investigate the experiences of older and younger individuals separately.

AB Objective: To determine suicide rates, socio-demographic risk factors, and reasons for suicide attempts.
   Methods: This hospital based, retrospective study consisted of 1613 suicide attempts brought to the emergency services of 8 state hospitals in Hatay, Turkey from January 2007 to December 2009. We obtained the data by retrospective analysis of patient record forms including information on age, gender, education level, marital status, occupation, reason for suicide, method of suicide, presence of previous psychiatric disease in the patient or family, previous suicidal behavior in the patient or family. We obtained current population data of the province from the Turkish State Institute of Statistics. Chi-Square test, and percentage distribution was used for the statistical analysis.
   Results: The mean age of females (23.9 +/- 7.9) was lower than males (26.6 +/- 0.7). The mean annual rate of attempted suicides per 100,000 was 38.14 (16.11 in males, 60.42 in females). The rate decreased as the age increased, and was highest in the 15-24 age group, in women, in non-married patients, and in the individuals with high school education. Self-poisoning with a drug overdose was the most common method, and domestic conflicts were the most common reason. Psychiatric disease history in the family or patient, and suicide attempt in the family were risk factors associated with repeated suicide attempts.
   Conclusion: The suicide attempt rate was lower than in many western countries, and similar to previous studies in Turkey. The risk of recurrence in suicide attempts is high, and is associated with psychosocial factors.

AB Background: Different psychosocial factors might have an impact on suicidal behaviour and evidence shows that there may be an association between monthly, diurnal and circadian changes and suicidal behaviours.
   Methods: In the present study we analysed retrospectively records of 2232 youth, who were treated in emergency units of state hospitals in Istanbul/Turkey after attempting suicide.
   Results: The majority of the suicide attempters were females (81.6%). In both sexes, suicide attempts most frequently occurred at the beginning of the calendar week and between evening and midnight.
   Conclusions: This study shows that suicide attempts in youth follow diurnal and circadian changes. As suicide attempts of youth most frequently occurred at the beginning of the calendar week and between evening and midnight, health services such as specialized counselling for youth should especially be available during this time.

AB Terror aims to disrupt peace and security of countries. Suicide attack is a form of terrorism is carried out in many parts of the world today. These attacks aiming at destroying countries and citizens, and targeting civilians or state institutions, have been the current agenda in Turkey with cases such as Suruc Attack and Ankara Railway Station Attack following the June 7, 2015, elections and the Syrian Civil War. These attacks, which deeply affect the citizens and harm the country, can also have an impact on political behaviors such as social practices. Individuals, as voters, may vote under the influence of political and social events. In this study, effects of suicide attacks in Turkey on voting behavior were demonstrated by means of a reception analysis on the example of the Ankara Train Station Attack (October 10, 2015). In this regard, this study analyzes the effects of suicide attacks in Turkey on voting behavior for the November 1, 2015, early elections by carrying out an ethnographic research methodology. As the conclusion of the study, the individuals were observed to be aware of the fact that the real purpose of terrorism was to scare and harm. The participants supported the government in case of the suicide attacks and other terrorist attacks. The majority of the participants believed that the suicide attack, which took place in the train station intersection in Ankara, would have no effect on the behaviors of the voters for the Early Elections of November 1, 2015.

AB This study investigated the prevalence of suicidal behavior and psychological distress in university students across 12 nations. A total of 5,572 university students from 12 countries were surveyed about suicide ideation, suicide attempts, and psychological distress by means of a self-administered questionnaire. Almost 29% of the samples reported having contemplated suicide and 7% reported attempting suicide. Of the total sample, 51.1% scored above the General Health Questionnaire-123 cut-off points, 41.6% above the GHQ-124 cut-off points, and 33.8% scored above the GHQ-125 cut-off points. While odds of suicide ideation were elevated in Austria and the UK, reduced ORs were detected for China, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Turkey. Similarly, while odds of suicide attempt were high in Jordan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, and to some extent in Turkey, reduced ORs were observed for Austria, China, Italy, Japan and the United States. Elevated ORs for psychological distress were seen in Japan, Jordan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Turkey but reduced ORs were noted in Austria, China, Iran, Italy, and the United States. Psychological distress was strongly associated with reports of suicide ideation and attempts. Suicide ideation, suicide attempt, and psychological distress are common in university students but their rates vary depending on the sociocultural context. Due attention should be devoted to the mental health needs of young adults enrolled in higher educational institutions and more cross-cultural research is warranted to better understand the etiology of the observed intersocietal variations in suicidal behavior and psychological distress.

AB Objective. Seasonality is one of the most interesting but still elusive issue in suicide research. Linkages of seasonality in suicides to possible contributors such as gender, type of method used, and climatic factors have received attention in different cultures. We aimed at evaluating seasonal trends in suicidal behaviour according to demographic characteristics, reasons for self-destructive behaviour and means preferred in suicide. Methods. Our aim was to assess the seasonal variation in self-destructive behaviour in terms of completed and attempted suicides in a 3-year time period from 2008 to 2010 in Van, Turkey. A total of 1448 cases were registered over a 3-year time period in the city. Seasonal deviations in demographic characteristics, reasons for suicide, and methods of suicide were evaluated. Results. Seasonal distribution of both completed and attempted suicides by gender did not significantly deviate. On the other hand, we found a significant decline in self-destructive behaviours among those who were single and student in the spring. We found a peak in self-destructive behaviours in the autumn among Individuals who suffer from psychological problems. Conclusions. Subjects with psychological difficulties were more prone to commit suicide in autumn. Seasonal differences in methods of suicide used by suicidal subjects were not significant.

AB Objectives: Suicide is one of the most important public health problems worldwide. The aim of this study was to determine differences between completed and attempted suicide groups in terms of gender, age groups and methods of suicide.
   Design: Retrospective study
   Setting: Antakya State Hospital, Hatay, Turkey
   Subjects: Three hundred and eighty-five completed and attempted suicide cases during the 3-year period between 2007 and 2009
   Main Outcome Measures: Completed and attempted suicide rates by age, gender, methods of suicide, during the study years
   Results: Attempted suicide rate per 100,000 was 27.25, and completed suicide rate was 2.64 per 100,000. Overall case fatality rate was 8.83. There was a male predominance in completed suicides, and contrarily, a female predominance in attempted suicides (p<0.001). Suicide attempt rate was higher among the young, and case fatality rate was higher in elderly (p<0.001). Self-poisoning with drug overdose was the most common method in attempted suicides, and hanging was the most common method in completed suicides (p<0.001). The decrease in the attempted suicide rate was significant, and it accounted for the significant decrease in the overall suicide rate over the study period (p<0.001). However, there was no significant change in the completed suicide rates over the years (p>0.05).
   Conclusions: Suicide rate was lower than the rate in western societies. Age and gender were significant factors for suicides The annual suicide attempt rates have decreased while the completed suicide rates have not changed over the years.

AB A Turkish patient with AIDS attempted to commit suicide. Turkey is one of the countries where AIDS education in society and for health personnel has started rather late. This article documents what this patient, his sister and his friends, who helped him to survive for a short while, experienced in the hospital environment. This is a real case history and should be considered from various aspects because suicide was attempted by a person with AIDS who was near the terminal stage. The patient's friends made a remarkable effort to help him to survive. They were unsure about what to do because they had not respected his wishes and they experienced deep alienation because of the extremely negative attitude of the medical staff.

AB In this study a questionnaire was used to investigate the predictors of therapeutic versus nontherapeutic reactions to patients hospitalized for attempting suicide in a group of doctors (n = 158) and in a group of nurses (n = 206) working in the health care system of a small city in the Western part of Turkey. Doctors said that they would react therapeutically towards patients hospitalized for attempting suicide to a greater extent than did nurses, while nurses said that they would engage in nontherapeutic reactions to a greater extent than doctors did. Believing that suicidal problems should be communicated, feeling sympathy for a suicidal patient and not feeling anxiety/fear for a suicidal patient were found to be the independent predictors of therapeutic reactions, while feeling anger about a suicidal patient emerged as an independent predictor of nontherapeutic reactions in both doctors and nurses. The attitudes of nurses towards suicide were more traditional than the attitudes of doctors. Nurses believed to a greater extent than doctors that suicidal people would be punished after death and that suicide in one's family was to be hidden. Doctors, on the other hand, believed to a greater extent than nurses that suicide attempts resulted from illness/biological reasons. Men were found to be more prejudiced about suicide and suicidal individuals than were women.

AB Our objective was to elucidate potential causes of higher rates of suicide attempts in females compared to males in southeastern Turkey through a I-year survey. Gender-related differences observed in 96 subjects who attempted suicide by poisoning for the first time were as follows: in comparison to male, females were predominantly within the age interval of 15-24 years, experienced more stressful events in the previous week before suicide attempt, had lower education level, and had a lower rate of employment. One year after the suicide attempt, unfavorable attitude of family, lack of support, persisting unfavorable lifestyle comparable with that prior to the first attempt, and higher rates of domestic violence were more pronounced in females compared to males. These findings might be contributing factors to the higher suicide attempt rates observed in females compared to the males.

AB Objective: The objective in this prospective study is to evaluate the frequency, mortality and demographic properties of suicides in our province (Batman City, Turkey). Material and Methods: All cases of suicides who admitted to the emergency department of the Batman State Hospital between April 2005 and November 2007 were included in the study. Patients' gender, age, history, educational and martial status, time and method preferred for suicide, suicide causes and mortality rate were reported. The results were discussed with similar studies in literature. Results: There were 328 (0.2%) suicide cases among 146.000 patients who admitted to our emergency department. Of the suicide cases, 75.9% were females and 24.1% were males. The mean age of cases was 23.5 +/- 7.4 years. The suicide made a peak between the ages of 15 and 24. The majority of cases attempted suicide by taking drugs orally (93.0%). Antidepressants were the most common agents (74.4%) among the drugs incriminated in suicide. The majority of cases attempted suicide due to family problems (39.2%). Nineteen patients were taken to intensive care unit (ICU). Organophosphates and hanging for suicide attempts were the main cause of suicide in the patients who admitted to ICU. The majority of deaths occurred clue to hanging (91.7%). The mortality rate for all patients was 3.7%. Conclusion: In our study the the most common method for suicide attempt was drugs. Martality was most frequent with hanging. Females attempted suicide more frequently. The suicide made a peak between the ages of 15 and 24. The majority of cases attempted suicide due to family problems

AB This study investigated the experience with and attitudes toward suicide and suicidality in 70 consenting imams serving in mosques in the province of Aydin which is located at the southwest part of Turkey. A self-report questionnaire was used to collect the data. Attitudes of imams to suicide and suicidality were compared with attitudes of male university students. Only 4 imams (5.7 %) reported having had suicidal thoughts in past, and none reported having attempted suicide. Almost 50 % said that someone in communities they serve has commited suicide and nearly 40 % reported leading funeral ceremony for someone who committed suicide. Majority of imams (64.3 %) were of the opinion that a funeral ceremony should be arranged for people who suicide and 87.1 % were of the opinion that people who suicide can be buried in a common cemetery, but only 21.4 % said that someone who attempted suicide can be appointed as imam. Compared to male medical students, imams saw suicide as an unacceptable option and those engaging in suicidal behavior to be punished after death. But they displayed socially accepting and helping reactions to an imagined close friend who attempted suicide. Therefore, it was concluded that imams might exhibit preventive reactions to suicide when they offer counseling for persons from their congregations during times of suicidal crises.

AB Introduction: Suicide is a major public health issue internationally, and the impact of positive or negative attitudes amongst the mental health professional workforce warrants scrutiny. The study aimed to examine English and Turkish nursing students' attitudes towards people with suicidal behaviour.
   Method: This cross-cultural study reports on attitudes of 240 nursing students towards suicide in Turkey and 82 nursing students in the UK. A reliable and valid 24 item "Attitudes towards Suicide Scale" and "Social Reactions to Suicidal Persons Scale" were used to measure attitudes.
   Results: The UK nursing students were found to display more accepting attitudes to suicide, and scored higher on acceptability of suicide, seeing suicide as a solution and open reporting and discussion of suicide subscales than their Turkish counterparts. Turkish nursing students scored higher on punishment after death and hiding suicidal behaviour subscales than the UK students. Turkish nursing students scored significantly higher on deterring subscale of reactions to a suicidal peer scale than the UK nursing students.
   Implications for practice: It is vital for nurse students to develop positive acceptance of suicide through education, reflection and clinical supervision to be more therapeutic towards suicidal patients.

AB Background: Different methods are used to understand the suicidal mind. Suicide note analysis may be most direct way to do this. Aims: To study the content of suicide letters under forensic evaluation in terms of psychological and cognitive aspects. Methods: A total of 51 letters were referred to The Council of Forensic Medicine from different cities of Turkey and analyzed by a research group with ten members including forensic medicine specialists and psychiatrists. The Questionnaire of Content Analysis of Suicide Letters (The Q-CAS), developed by researchers, was used to analyze the cognitive and cultural themes of suicide letters. The cognitive distortions about the self, the world, and the future as well as cultural phenomena were evaluated including sociodemographic features. Results: Financial problems in males and relationship problems in females were the most frequent life events related to suicide. Hopelessness, weakness, loneliness - in decreasing order - were the most predominant cognitions and emotions. The total score of females were higher than that of males (p = .002). Conclusions: These negative cognitions should be taken into consideration when therapeutic interventions are planned on individuals with suicidal thoughts.

AB Aim: We studied the patterns of suicide in forensic autopsies performed in Bursa province of Turkey to determine gender differences, incidence of suicide, subgroups of the population most vulnerable to,such deaths, and suicide methods used.
   Materials and methods: Nine hundred fifty-five death cases due to suicide underwent forensic autopsy between 1996 and 2005 in Bursa were included into the study. All of the cases were analyzed in terms of age, gender, and method of suicide, time of year, and alcohol use. Results were subjected to discriminant analyses using SPSS 11.0.
   Results: There were 955 cases, with 682 males (12-95 years; mean, 41.2 years) and 273 females (10101 years; mean, 33.1 years). For both genders, the most common method was hanging, accounted for 51.6% of the cases. Firearm injuries were more frequent in males than in females while insecticide poisoning, falling from height, and drug poisoning were more commonly used methods in females compared to males (P < 0.001), following hanging.
   Conclusion: In our study there was a significant difference between men and women in terms of suicide age and suicide method. More research studies are needed on gender differences in suicidal behavior to develop prevention strategies.

AB Aim Studies have shown that the causes and methods of suicides differ among young and old individuals; consequently, it is important to identify the subgroups that are at high risk for suicide to aid in suicide prevention. The present study compared the causes and methods of suicides between 2002 and 2013 among older adults aged 65-69 years, 70-74 years and >= 75 years by completed crude suicide rate and sex. Methods Data detailing sex, the causes and methods of completed suicides in older adults aged 65-69 years, 70-74 years and >= 75 years that occurred between 2002 and 2013 were drawn from the Turkish Statistical Institute. Results In all age groups, crude suicide rates were threefold more frequent among men than among women. In both sexes, the most frequent suicide cause was mental illness. In the group aged 65-69 years, the most common cause of suicide was financial difficulty for men and marital conflict for women. The most frequent suicide method among older adults of both sexes was hanging. In all age groups, firearms use was more common among men and jumping from a high place was more common among women. Conclusion The present findings suggest that the most common suicide cause in both sexes and in all age groups was mental illness in Turkey. To prevent suicidal behavior in older adults,; it is important to diagnose mental disorders, such as mood disorders and substance abuse, and to treat them quickly.

TI Suicides in adolescence: A twelve-year study from Eastern Turkey

DE Suicide; Suicide attempts; Adolescent
ID CHILDREN
AB Suicide is a form of behavior brought about by a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors and the adverse effects of those factors on individuals, their surroundings, society, and subsequent generations. In this study, attention is focused on the increase in adolescent suicides in Elazig and the surrounding province.
   The probable suicide cases among adolescent deaths that occurred in Eastern Turkey between 2001 and 2012 were examined retrospectively. A total of 67 cases were evaluated in terms of age, sex, method of death, death location, and the time of the year at which death occurred.
   Of the 67 study cases, 40 were female (59.70%) and 27 were male (40.29%). When the methods of suicide were analyzed, it was found that hanging came in first place with 34 cases (50.74%), followed by death using a firearm with 27 cases (40.29%). Other types of death were self-poisoning in four cases (5.97%) and jumping from a height in two cases (2.98%).
   According to this study, there are common risk factors both for suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts. Defining the prevalence of suicidal thoughts leading to suicide attempts, determining the risk factors, and evaluating the relationship between those factors and mental disorders will enable society to develop new approaches to suicidal behavior.

DE Elder; Suicide; Eskisehir
ID PREVENTION; BEHAVIOR; RISK
AB Old age should be examined separately from other stages of life in terms of ratio, method and motives for suicide. With some variation, epidemiological studies suggest suicides increase with age in virtually every society. This study examines demographic data (age, sex and marital status), and other factors related to 20-years (1997-2016) of completed elder suicides in Eskisehir, Turkey. The 74 cases of those 65 and over were evaluated with regard to method, tool and location of the suicide. Annual distributions illustrate gradual increases in this fatal self-harm over time. The vast majority of cases were male (74.3%), compared to female (25.6%). Elders in the 80-84 age range were most likely to kill themselves. Deaths were frequently caused by hanging, followed by other methods and took place in the home. Reasons associated with suicidal behavior included despair as a result of bereavement, mental illnesses, chronic physical conditions and living alone. The researchers cite potential prevention strategies through the use of early mental health treatment for elders, along with inclusion in social services and activities.

AB Despite well-documented increases in completed suicides among children, accurate knowledge of the characteristics of these suicides is very limited. The aim of this study was to investigate general characteristics of suicide among children and adolescents in the province of Istanbul and to evaluate obtained results in the light of the literature. Data were collected from autopsy records of the Morgue Department of Institute of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul. General characteristics of completed suicides among children and adolescents between 2001 and 2005 were retrospectively reviewed. The study included 176 suicides aged 9-19 years. The overwhelming majority of the suicides (92%) were aged 15-19 years. More than half of the suicides (60%) were male. The most frequent means of suicide was hanging (55%) followed by firearms (20%) and jump or descent from height (15%).

SO CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH

DT Article
DE age-period-cohort effect; suicide; mortality
ID MODELS
AB Objective: This study is designed to evaluate the potential effects of age, period and cohort (APC) on trends in suicide between 1983 and 2013 in Turkey.
   Methods: Mortality data were obtained from the Turkish Statistical Institute. The data were grouped into seven age groups, four periods and ten birth cohorts. A nonlinear regression model was estimated for both sexes. The effects of age, period and cohort were parameterized using natural spline smoothing functions.
   Results: There were 61,795 deaths recorded as suicides during the investigated time period, where 64.5% occurred in males (n = 39,862) and 35.5% in females (n=21,933). There is an upward trend in mortality by age until the end of the study period for males and females. Age effect is decreased until the forties, kept decreasing during the middle ages, and sharply increased after the sixties. The death rates for females declined from 1999 until the end of the study period. For males, the death rates increased until the end of the study period.
   Conclusion: If the current trends continue, it can be expected that these effects will continue to reduce female mortality and increase male mortality. Future studies on suicide, strongly focused on specific factors attributed to period effects, are needed in Turkey.

AB Background/Aims: Turkish migrants have been shown to have an increased rate of suicide attempts as compared to native local populations and also to people in Turkey. In this study we conducted in-depth interviews with patients regarding their reasons for the attempt. Subjects and Methods: Seventy Turkish immigrants admitted to the emergency unit of the Basel University Hospital after a suicide attempt were interviewed. Seventy Swiss suicide attempters, matched for age and sex, served as a comparator (case-control study). Results: Turkish immigrants showed high rates of suicide attempts. The gender ratio (women/men) was 2.2; 38.6% of all Turkish suicide attempters were women aged between 15 and 25 years. Most patients mentioned problems in their partnerships as the main reason for the suicide attempt (63% of Swiss and 54% of Turkish patients); 14% of the Swiss but none of the Turkish suicide attempters named social isolation as a cause; 9% of the Turkish patients reported 'threat of loss/rejection of status as refugee' as the main reason. Immigrants used analgesics more often, whilst Swiss patients tended to favour benzodiazepines. Conclusions: Our study suggests that cultural and immigration-specific issues play a role in the suicidal behaviour of immigrants. Turkish women aged between 15 and 25 years seem to be at an especially high risk. Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Fifty years ago adolescents mostly died of natural causes, whereas they now die from more preventable causes. Part of this change has been a worldwide rise in adolescent suicide rates in both developed and developing countries. Suicides are probably under reported due to cultural and religious stigma attached to self-destruction. Objectives of this study were to collect data about suicidal thoughts, plans and attempts and related sociodemographic details in high school students. The population comprised 2,480 randomly selected students among 46,271 students from 72 high schools in 1999-2000 in Adana and 2,352 (94.8%) students from 10 schools were reached and given a questionnaire modified using Youth Risk Behavior Survey Questionnaire (YRBSQ). chi(2) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were used. Mean age was 16.5 +/- 1 (14-21) year, 1, 187 (50.5%) students reported severe desperation, 526 students (22.4%) had suicidal thoughts, 332 (14. 1 %) planned committing suicide, 145 (6.2%) attempted suicide. The occurrence rate of desperation, suicidal thoughts, plans, attempts and the mean number of attempts were significantly higher in females than males. Adolescent suicide is a tragedy affecting individual, family, peers, and community. Families, teachers, and physicians should be aware of risk factors for suicide.

AB It is known that violence against women is an important health problem both in the world and in Turkey (World Health Organization 2005; General Directorate on the Status of Women 2008). Religion is an important factor in preventing suicide and mental disorders by increasing one's ability to cope with events, channeling his/her perspective on life and the future toward a more positive path satisfying people about topics such as the need to be safe, the need for meaning and the reason for creation (Altuntop 2005). Hence, the objective of our study was to determine the effects of religious belief on the mental health status and suicide probabilities of women exposed to violence in Turkey. The study used a descriptive design. The study sample consisted of 135 women who have suffered violence who were consecutively admitted to the Department of Emergency of a State Hospital due to exposed to violence. They entered the study based on their acceptance to the questionnaire. The belief levels of women are based on their own statements and they are all Muslims. The data were collected using a questionnaire form, the Suicide Probability Scale and Brief Symptom Inventory. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 18.0. Statistical analyses were used percentage calculation, chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis test. In conclusion, a negative relationship was determined between the religious belief levels of women exposed to violence in Turkey and their moods and suicide probabilities. Hence, nurses who can stay alone with women for long periods of time can provide advancement in the determination and prevention of suicides decreasing depression via specific methods and overcoming hopelessness.

AB Background: Suicide is an important health problem in Turkey as it is in all regions of the world. Suicidal behavior has multiple causes, which are broadly divided into those related to proximal stressors and those due to predisposition. Suicide statistics may be associated with mental health disorders, which are among the foremost predictors of suicide attempts. More than 90% of patients who commit suicide have a diagnosable psychiatric disorder, usually a major depressive disorder. Other major risk factors for suicide attempts are history of suicide attempts in the family, stressful life events, sleep disturbances, poor income, unemployment, severity of symptoms of depression, and anxiety. Sleep is a complex phenomenon. Sleep disturbances can therefore be contributed to the emergence of suicidal behavior allowing for the possibility of predicting future suicides.
   Methods: We evaluated 106 patients who were admitted after suicide attempts to the Department of Psychiatry at Dicle University Faculty of Medicine. The recruited subjects were assessed by Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders, and the intensity of symptoms was evaluated using the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The mean values of the subjects attempting multiple and single suicides were compared using appropriate inferential statistical tests.
   Results: Most suicide attempts are believed to be preventable. Our results revealed that a great variety of risk factors are associated with an increased risk for multiple suicide attempts. Most of these attempts appeared to be spontaneous and impulsive rather than planned. In particular, this study highlights the importance of previous suicide attempts, history of suicide in the family, history of stressful life events in the previous 6 months, poor income, unemployment, sleep disturbances, severe hopelessness with depression, and coexisting symptoms of anxiety as risk factors.
   Conclusion: The first step in prevention of suicides is doubtlessly strong and reliable communication, due to the fact that the majority of subjects who commit suicide have had contact with a health professional during the month before the suicide.

AB Despite the well-documented increases in the rate of completed suicide among children, accurate knowledge of the characteristics of these suicides. is limited. We examined all suicides by children and adolescents in Diyarbakir during 1999 and 2001. All of the cases were analyzed regarding the age, sex, method and location of suicide, time of year, and predictive factors. There were 56 children aged I I through 19 years. Adolescents between 15 and 19 years of age constituted the overwhelming number (87%) of all the childhood suicides. Female children and adolescents predominated among the suicide victims (71%). The most frequent means of suicide were firearms (43%), hanging (28%), and jumping (16%), respectively. The majority of suicides occurred at the decedent's home (88%). Reasons identified were mainly psychiatric disorders, followed by troubles within the family. A prior suicide attempt or a note that was left by the decedent and elucidated the reason for the suicide was rare. There was no seasonal difference in rates of suicides.

AB To examine the characteristics of suicide attempters among first and second generation immigrants from Turkey living in Basel-City, Switzerland. All immigrants living in Basel City and admitted to the University Hospital of Basel-City, Switzerland, after a suicide attempt, were consecutively examined during a 7-year period (n=70). 35,7% of the suicide attempters were first generation and 64,3% second generation immigrants. Among the first generation the sex ratio female to male was 1,3 and among second generation 3,1. 36,9% of those concerned were at immigration 15 to 19 years of age. 24,1 % of females from first generation and 14,7% of females from second generation mentioned violence in family and partnership as the main problem. Conclusions: Female migrants of 2. generation seem to be at risk with regard to suicidal behavior. Violence seems to be a significant problem in suicidal female immigrants of both generations.

AB This study was conducted with the aim of gaining an integrated and comprehensive psychosocial understanding of the behaviours of young adults, who were brought to the emergency service unit of a hospital after they had attempted suicide. Semi-structured interviews were used to gather data from 21 individuals. Most studies conducted earlier have attributed suicide attempts to problems encountered in relationships with the opposite sex. However, the findings of this study indicate that suicide attempts are largely a result of the individual's inability to face or cope with difficult situations and the ability to solve his/her problems.

AB Background: Suicide attempt is a universally observed human behavior related to bio-psychological, social and cultural factors. While some studies have suggested that specific demographic/cultural and clinical variables are associated with suicide attempts in schizophrenia, these associations are often inconsistent. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the possible association between socio-demographic and clinical variables and suicidal behavior in a sample of patients diagnosed as having schizophrenia in Turkey. Methods: Three hundred patients with a SCID-I diagnosis of schizophrenia were studied. The sample was subdivided into two groups based on the presence or absence of lifetime suicide attempts. The main demographic and clinical variables retrospectively collected were analyzed and compared between the two groups. Results: The results of present study revealed that the subjects who had and had not attempted suicide did not differ with respect to demographic variables. The suicide attempters tend to have younger age at onset of disorder, longer duration of psychosis, more hospitalizations, are more likely to have lifetime major depressive episodes, and a significantly higher rate of alcohol abuse or dependence than patients without a lifetime history of suicide attempts. Conclusions: Consistent with the results of previous studies, it has been found that demographic variables may be less valuable predictors of suicidal behavior than clinical variables. These results lead to the idea that socio-cultural variations may not be a critical determinant for suicide attempt among patients with schizophrenia.

AB Objective: In this study, we aimed to assess the epidemiology of suicide attempts, especially focusing on rates and trends in Northeastern Turkey.
   Materials and Methods: This is a cross-sectional study including 893 pa rasuicide events recorded prospectively in 17 emergency rooms of state hospitals in two neighboring counties over three years. Information on each case was recorded on a standardized monitoring form that covered a series of sociodemographic and psychosocial features.
   Results: In 2007, parasuicide rates per 100,000 inhabitants were 47.7 for females, 17.7 for males, and 32.5 for both genders. Suicide attempts were more common in women in all age groups except. years. The most common methods of deliberate self-harm were as follows: medical drug/toxic substance ingestion (93.3%), hanging (1.7%), and cutting or stabbing (3.6%). Housewives (53.8%) formed the largest group among women. Physical domestic violence was a common reason for suicide attempts in women aged 15-34 years. The only cited reason for suicide attempts that was predominant in males was financial difficulties. A previous psychiatric diagnosis was present in 19.5% of parasuicide cases, and the rate of seeing a doctor for psychiatric reasons in the last 6 months prior to the suicide attempt was 15.8%.
   Conclusion: Self-poisoning is the most common method for attempted suicide. The risk groups in our region appeared to be younger and married females. The epidemiology of suicide attempt cases in our region resembles a mixture of both European and Asian communities' parasuicide patterns.

A total of 205 doctors and 206 nurses working in several hospitals in Istanbul participated. Data were collected by questionnaire and analysed using SPSS v. 12.0. Significantly higher percentages of doctors (35.3%) and nurses (26.6%) working in intensive care units encountered euthanasia requests than those working in other units. Doctors and nurses caring for terminally ill patients in intensive care units differed considerably in their attitudes to euthanasia and patient rights from other health care staff. Euthanasia should be investigated and put on the agenda for discussion in Turkey.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: It is estimated that every year 1 million people die all around the world due to suicide. The average rate of suicide in the world is reported as 16/100 000. In this study, we aimed to evaluate and discuss the suicide cases in our city Eskisehir that is located in western Anatolia.
   DESIGN AND SETTINGS: This is a retrospective study covering the period 1997-2011.
   METHODS: All deaths in Eskisehir caused due to the consumption of forensic medicines in a 15-year period between 1997 and 2011 were evaluated retrospectively. A total of 553 cases were determined to be suicidal following both forensic and criminal investigations, and were included in the study. Furthermore, death examination and autopsy reports were investigated, and judicial investigation records were also taken into account.
   RESULTS: In this period, the average rate of suicide in our city was determined as 5.1/100 000 of which 71.4% of the cases were male. It was determined that the suicides most commonly occurred between the ages of 19 and 29 (32.4%, n=179). The most commonly encountered suicide method was hanging (60.9%, n=337).
   CONCLUSION: It was ascertained that the suicide rate in our city was lower than the average rate in the world, but it was higher than the average rate in Turkey. Unemployment was determined as the most common risk factor in our study. A follow-up should be provided for people with a history of attempting to commit suicide or with a tendency to committing suicide due to a psychological disorder.

The research was designed as a complementary study and conducted with 334 students from several faculties and colleges at Ege University, Turkey. The study findings indicated that suicide probability could be affected by the students' age, their problems at school, their troubled relations with friends, and a psychiatric disorder history within the last year. Moreover, it was concluded that the students with healthy life behaviors had significantly lower scores on the Suicide Probability Scale and its subscales. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Worldwide, suicide ranks among the three leading causes of death among those aged 15-44 years. An estimated 800000 people die by committing suicide annually.
   Objectives: To better understand the association between aggressive suicidal attempt and non-aggressive suicidal attempt in patients with suicide attempt in the emergency department.
   Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted on suicide attempters of eastern region of Turkey between May 2008 and January 2012. Information of all adult suicide attempts was collected prospectively on a form. Suicide attempts were grouped as aggressive and non-aggressive attempts on a specially designed data-collection form. The aggressive suicide attempts contained violent suicide methods such as firearm, hanging, jumping, car exhaust or drowning.
   Results: A total of 533 patients were included. Sixty-four of these patients admitted to ED with aggressive suicide attempt (12%). Non-aggressive suicide attempts were consulted to psychiatry more compared to aggressive ones (%73.6, n = 345 vs. % 32.8, n = 21, P < 0.0001). Agitation in ED and being male increased aggressive suicide attempt risk by 3.5 (% 95 CI: 1.6-7.6) and 3.2 times (% 95 CI: 1.8-5.5), agitated patients in ED group and male group respectively. Patients with aggressive suicide attempt were statistically more frequent among these patients; patients with agitation, those hospitalized in intensive care or surgical services and those whose length of stay in the emergency department was less than one day (P < 0.05 for all). Patients with non-aggressive suicide attempt were statistically more frequent in these patients; patients complained of nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, fatigue, those with confusion, those tending to sleep, those hospitalized in internal services or emergency ward and finally those whose length of stay in the emergency department was more than one day (P < 0.05 for all).
   Conclusions: Patients with aggressive suicide attempt who have high risk of dying should be recognized and requested psychiatric consultation even if not in the emergency department.

ID TERRORISM
AB The authors examine the effect of educational attainment and income on support for suicide bombing among Muslim publics in six predominantly Muslim countries that have experienced suicide bombings: Indonesia, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Pakistan, and Turkey. The authors make two contributions. First, they present a conceptual model, which has been lacking in the literature. Second, they consider attitudes toward two different targets of suicide bombings: civilians within the respondent's country and Western military and political personnel in Iraq. The authors find that the effect of educational attainment and income on support for suicide bombings varies across countries and targets.The findings therefore draw attention to the difficulties of making generalizations about Muslim countries and the importance of distinguishing between targets of suicide bombings.

AB Background: Female suicide is an important problem not only for women but for public health in general.
   Methods: Autopsy reports from the Van Chief Public Prosecutor's Office from 2005 to 2011 were reviewed retrospectively in order to analyse female deaths from suicide.
   Results: Sixty-six female suicide cases were recorded during 2005-2011. The mean age of the cases was 22.64 (sd = 10.09) years, and nine were below the age of 15. The most common method of suicide was hanging (44 cases, 66.7 %). Five (7.6 %) of the cases were under treatment for depression, and 12 (18.2 %) cases had a previous suicide attempt.
   Conclusions: Cultural suppression of females and prevention of their socialization in enclave societies are risk factors for female suicides. The number of female suicide attempts, especially recurring attempts, should be reduced via psychiatric scanning, follow-up sessions and therapy for high-risk individuals.

AB Firearm suicides are frequent and well described in the forensic literature, particularly in Europe and the United States. However, the use of homemade and improvised firearms is less well described. The present case reports a suicide with an original improvised gun created using an air-compressed pellet gun and a dumbbell pipe. The aims of this study were to describe the scene, the external examination of the corpse, the body scan, and the autopsy; to understand the mechanism of death; and to compare the results with a review of the forensic literature to highlight the epidemiology of homemade firearm use, the tools used for homemade and improvised firearms in suicides versus homicides, and the manners in which homemade firearms are used (homicide or suicide, particularly in complex suicide cases).

AB Homicide followed by the suicide of the murderer is a relatively rare lethal incident in which an individual kills another person and subsequently dies by suicide. Cases involving a homicide and a suicide in which death examinations and autopsies were performed at The Konya Branch of the Forensic Medicine Council between 2000 and 2007 were retrospectively investigated. During the studied time period, there were 10 homicide-suicide cases identified with 10 perpetrators killing 12 victims. Nine of the perpetrators were men and eight of the victims were women. The precipitating motive was an impending divorce in four of the cases. Two perpetrators were described as severely depressed, one had a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, and one was a pedophile who had reactive depression. Firearms were used in eight of the homicide cases and seven of the suicides. Constricting the use of firearms may reduce/prevent future homicide-suicide cases, as it is the most commonly used method to carry out homicide-suicides.

AB Objective: Suicidal behavior of young people is a topic of utmost importance because suicide is irreversible, and should be prevented. Knowing about the psychosocial background and the triggering events could help in preventing suicidal behavior. We therefore aimed at identifying psychosocial factors that may trigger suicidal behavior in youth.Methods: We analyzed retrospectively the standardized records of 2232 youths aged 25years, who were treated after a suicide attempt at emergency units of public hospitals in Istanbul, Turkey during a period of 1year. We describe this population according to sex and socio-economic conditions, like educational, occupational, relationship status and link them with their reported reasons for suicide attempts.Results: The majority of patients were female (81.6%, N=1822 females, 18.4%, N=410 males). Independent of their educational and occupational background, patients indicated most frequently intra-familial problems (females 45.8%, males 30.5%), intrapersonal problems (females 19.9%, males 18.5%), and relationship problems (females 11.3%, males 23.9%) as triggering reasons.Conclusions: Because intra-familial problems were the most frequently reported triggers of suicide attempts, preventive measures should focus on handling intra-familial conflicts. As sex differences were observed for the second-most common trigger-reasons, prevention should also focus on differentially handling intrapersonal and relationship conflicts better.

AB The objective of this study is to address the question: are those who leave suicide notes representative of the larger population of those who commit suicide? The method involves an analysis of a full population of suicides by residents of Queensland, Australia for the full year of 2004, with the information drawn from Coronial files. Our overall results suggest that, and in support of previous research, the population who leaves suicide notes are remarkably similar to those who do not. Differences are identified in four areas: first, and in contrast to prior research, females are less likely to leave a suicide note; second, and in support of previous research, Aboriginal Australians are less likely to leave suicide notes; third, and in support of some previous research, those who use gas as a method of suicide are more likely to leave notes, while those who use a vehicle or a train are less likely to leave notes; finally, our findings lend support to research which finds that those with a diagnosed mental illness are less likely to leave notes. The discussion addresses some of the reasons these disparities may have occurred, and continues the debate over the degree to which suicide notes give insight into the larger suicide population.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the general properties of suicide among children and adolescents in our region, and to evaluate the results in the light of the literature. The autopsy records of the morgue of the Adana branch of the Turkish Forensic Medicine Council were investigated retrospectively. Focus of the study was shaped by suicide cases in children and adolescents (under 18) between the years of 1997-2005. All of the cases were analyzed with regard to age, sex, method of suicide, and year. The childhood and adolescent (0-18 years) deaths comprised 24.4% (n: 1390) of all medico-legal autopsy cases (n: 6808). The origin of death in 186 (13.4%) cases involving victims younger than 18 years of age was suicide. The majority of suicide cases (62.9% n: 117) were females. Adolescents of 16-18 years of age constituted the overwhelming majority (70.43% n: 131) of all childhood suicides. Mean age was 16.13. The most frequent method of suicide was shooting in males, and poisoning in females. However, hanging was the most frequent method (34.41% n: 64) overall.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate suicide trends among individuals a parts per thousand currency sign 24 years of age in the region of Epirus, northwestern Greece, from January 1998 to December 2008. Twenty-one cases were classified as suicides out of 242 total deaths (8.7%). The male to female suicide ratio was 4.25 (17 males and 4 females). The preferred suicide method for those aged a parts per thousand yen 19 years involved firearms, and for those aged < 19 years was hanging. Alcohol was implicated in more than 50% of the suicides and was consumed exclusively by those aged > 16 years. Suicides by self-shooting were more often related to drinking than suicides by other methods. Children and adolescents (aged up to 15 years), older adolescents (15-18 years) and young adults (19-24 years) had suicide rates of 0.05/100,000, 0.10/100,000 and 0.39/100,000 inhabitants per year, respectively. These suicide rates are the lowest reported so far in Europe. The main reason for this may be the traditional lifestyle of the local population and the strong family ties that protect against suicide, especially for the young.

AB Objective: To investigate the relationship between suicide probability and psychological symptoms and coping strategies in hospitalized patients with physical illness.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from April to June 2014 in Bandirma State Hospital, Balikesir, Turkey. The sample of the study consisted of 470 inpatients who met the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate in the study. The data were collected with the Personal Information Form, Suicide Probability Scale, Brief Symptom Inventory and Ways of Coping with Stress Inventory.
   Results: In the study, 74.7% were at moderate risk for suicide, whereas 20.4% were at high risk for suicide. According to the stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, sub-dimensions of the Ways of Coping with Stress Inventory and Brief Symptom Inventory were the significant predictors of suicide probability.
   Conclusions: The majority of the patients with physical illness were at risk for suicide probability. Individuals who had psychological symptoms and used maladaptive coping ways obtained significantly higher suicide probability scores.

AB Background: Seasonal changes and climatic factors like ambient temperature, sunlight duration and rainfall can influence suicidal behavior.
   Methods: This study analyses the relationship between seasonal changes and climatic variations and suicide attempts in 2131 young patients in Istanbul, Turkey.
   Results: In our study sample, there was an association between suicide attempts in youths and seasonal changes, as suicide attempts occurred most frequently during summer in females as well as in males. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the mean temperature over the past 10 days and temperature at the index day and suicide attempts in females. After seasonality effects were mathematically removed, the mean temperature 10 days before a suicide attempt remained significant in males only, indicating a possible short-term influence of temperature on suicide attempts.
   Conclusions: This study shows an association between suicide attempts of young people and climatic changes, in particular temperature changes as well as seasonal changes. Therefore, the influence of seasonal changes and climatic factors on young suicide attempters should get more attention in research to understand the biopsychosocial mechanisms playing a role in suicide attempts of young people. As suicide attempts most frequently occur in young people, further research is of considerable clinical importance.

AB Objectives: To investigate the relationship between suicide attempts and demographic-clinical variables and to assess the methods used in suicide attempts by comparing schizophrenia patients with and without suicide attempts.
   Methods: A retrospective study with a total of 223 schizophrenia patients aged 18-65 years that were admitted to the Department of Psychiatry, Selcuk University and the Beyhekim Psychiatric Clinic Konya Training and Research Hospital, Konya, Turkey, between January 2014 and January 2018 The data collection forms created by researchers were completed using hospital medical records.
   Results: It was determined that 40.8% of schizophrenia patients attempted suicide at least once and that 39.6% of schizophrenia patients who attempted suicide had recurrent suicide attempts. Those with suicide attempts had a significantly longer mean duration of untreated psychosis and a higher total number of hospitalizations compared to those without suicide attempts. In addition, the use of depot antipsychotic drugs was significantly lower in those with suicide attempts. There was a statistically significant difference in the presence of traumatic life events between those with and without suicide attempts.
   Conclusion: Suicidal behavior is an important problem in schizophrenia. Identifying risk factors and high-risk individuals will guide us in the development of preventive interventions.

AB Introduction: The aim of this study was to determine whether adolescence of transgender individuals is characterized by a high risk of suicide.
   Methods: In total, 141 participants with transgenderism were questioned using a semi-structured interview to determine whether participants had current suicidal thoughts, had a lifetime history of such thoughts, or had attempted suicide. These findings were cross-referenced to the participants' sociodemographic characteristics, and information about their families' general attitudes toward sexuality, gender identity, and commitment to religious views. In total, 101 participants attended group psychotherapy sessions for at least problems, financial problems, medical issues, and religious concerns were discussed.
   Results: The incidence of suicide attempts, current suicidal thoughts, and lifetime suicidal thoughts were 29.8%, 9.2%, and 55.3%, respectively. In total, 76.7% of the suicide attempts occurred before the age of 21.
   Conclusion: Transsexual individuals present a high risk of suicide, particularly during adolescence. This finding may be considered a sign for taking action to prevent suicide when working with transgender individuals, particularly during adolescence.

AB Introduction: Homicide, the most unacceptable way of abuse, is increasing especially among elderly who have insufficient self-defense. Besides, elderly who have no family or social support, commit suicide. Since they are preventable, homicide and suicide are very important for people above 65 years old.
   Materials and Method: The autopsy records between 01.01.2003-31.12.2007 of the cases above 65 years old were reviewed and findings of the 148 homicide-suicide cases were assessed.
   Results: During five-year-period, 10.9% (148) of the total 1347 autopsies were elderly. Among total, suicide rate was 11.5% and homicide rate was 7.4%. The death cause of the half of the homicide-originated elderly women was suffocation. The common features of these cases were; living alone, unknown perpetrator and found decayed. Of suicide cases, 13 were under drug therapy. Two of the cases under psychiatric therapy had previous suicide attempt. Among suicide cases, two of three female cases and six of 14 male cases used hanging method. Of the total homicide-suicide-originated cases, 64.3% were found dead at home. Conclusion: Lack of social and psychological support, which can lead to homicide and suicide, is increasing day by day.

AB Although suicide is a preventable public health problem, objective assays for suicide risk are limited. In this study, it was aimed to determine levels of S100B protein and serotonin as a marker for risk of suicide. S100B protein and serotonin levels were investigated with ELISA method in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in medicolegal autopsy cases, including those of suicide cases (n = 32) and nonsuicide cases (n = 56). The CSF S100B levels were higher (9.3 +/- 2.9 ng/mL vs. 5.4 +/- 2.0 ng/mL), and serotonin levels were lower (10.4 +/- 4.9 ng/mL vs. 19.0 +/- 5.7 ng/mL) in suicide group than nonsuicide group (p < 0.05). There was no correlation between S100B protein and serotonin levels with gender, age groups, postmortem interval, and cause of death. It is concluded that both S100B protein and serotonin in CSF may be useful for determination of suicide risk.

AB Hanging is the most common method of suicide in the world, and many public places offer a means or opportunity to carry out the activity. Of 4,452 death examinations and autopsies, there were 378 (8.5%) suicides and suicide method was hanging in 185 (48.9%) cases. In 20 of these (10.8%), the suspension point was the branch of a tree. The incident location was the garden of the victim's house in nine cases, the woodlands in seven cases. The suicides were attributed to psychiatric disorders in nine cases, economic problems in six cases, and family problems in five cases. It is concluded that hanging on a tree as a suicide method is often committed by males and the underlying motive may be different in suicidal hangings on trees occurring at daytime and night. For preventional purposes, the reporting of such suicides in public places by the media may be restricted by local authorities.

This hypothesis suggests that the suicide rate of a society could never be zero even if both the economic and the social conditions were made ideal from the point of view of suicide (Yang and Lester, 1991). This research relates the suicide rates to harmonized unemployment and divorce rates to test the natural hypothesis statistically. We also address methodological flaws by earlier suicide studies by employing autoregressive-distributed lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration advocated by Pesaran et al. (2001). In majority of regression equations, the constant term was positive and statistically significant, indicating a non-zero natural suicide rate. In particular, we find evidence that at aggregate level. Turkey has the lowest (3.64) and Japan has the highest (13.98) natural rate of suicides. In terms of the male natural suicide rates, the United Kingdom ranks the lowest (4.73) and Belgium ranks the top (15.44). As for the female natural suicide rates, japan takes the lead (16.76) and Italy has the lowest (5.60). The results are also compared and contrasted to each other with a view to drawing plausible policy conclusions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study presents the characteristics of child and adolescent suicides which occurred in Kairouan, Tunisia. Data were collected from autopsy records of the Forensic Department of the University Hospital Ibn El Jazzar of Kairouan. General characteristics of suicides among children and adolescents (under the age of 18) between 2009 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 49 cases, with a female predominance (61.2%) and a mean age of 15.4 +/- 2.1, were registered. Most of the victims were from rural areas (93.1%). In most cases, suicide occurred in the victim's home or the surrounding area (73.4%). The identified precipitating factors were family problems in 55.1%, and school issues in 12.2%. The most common suicide method was hanging (69.38%) for both genders, followed by self-immolation for males and poisoning for females, the majority using pesticides. This study offers useful information to understand the risk factors in Tunisian child and adolescent suicides and provides a basis for the development of urgently needed preventive strategies.

AB Objective: Age, gender, race, cultural and ethnic structure are important factors in suicide epidemiology. Factors effecting suicide behaviour are important to establish effective prevention programs, so it is important to evaluate them in detail. The aim of this study was to determine the regional differences and to get detailed data for guiding the suicide prevention programs by reviewing all suicides in Samsun. Material and Methods: The judicial files of all suicides were evaluated that occurred in Samsun, between 1999-2003. Some information such as age, gender, marital status, occupation status, suicide place and time and, suicide methods used by the cases were obtained. In addition, the probable risk factors for suicide from the official statements of the parents in the judicial files were determined. Results: In five years period, 169 people committed suicide in Samsun. Most of them were at the age of 10-29 years and 58.6% of were males. They most commonly used a firearm (28.4%) as the suicide method, self poisoning (27.8%) and hanging (26.0%) were following it. While most of the males committed suicide by firearm, females preferred self poisoning. Leading risk factors were unemployment and economic problems followed by family problems, diagnosed psychiatric illnesses, alcohol abuse, emotional problems and undiagnosed psychiatric illnesses. Conclusion: Suicide is a multi-faceted problem that needs both social and individual approaches. This study shows that higher ratio of firearm suicides needs more attention, and detailed studies especially for determination risk groups for prevention programs are necessary.

AB Aim: The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between domestic violence against women and suicide risk.
   Methods: The population of the study consisted of married women aged 18 years and over in 10 Family Health Centers located within the boundaries of Yesilyurt Municipality of Malatya Province. The study was completed with 1025 women. In the data collection, a 6-question questionnaire prepared by the researcher upon the literature review, Domestic Violence Scale, and Suicide Probability Scale were used. Percentage distribution, arithmetic mean, independent samples t test, and correlation were used to assess the data.
   Results: In the study, it was found that domestic violence levels of the women were high and their suicide risks were moderate. A statistically positive correlation was determined between DVS subscale and total mean scores of the women and their suicide risk subscale and total mean scores (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: In the study, it was determined that as the women's exposure to domestic violence increased, their suicide risks also increased. It can be recommended to establish centers for women and organize trainings in order to prevent domestic violence and suicide risk in women.

AB Background: Concerns about increased suicide risk among immigrants to European countries have been raised. We review the scientific literature on differences in suicide among immigrants compared with the majority populations in Europe's major immigration countries. Methods: We searched the databases PubMed and PsycINFO for peer-reviewed epidemiological studies published in 1990-2011, which compared suicide risks of adult immigrant groups with the risks of the majority population in European countries. Hits were screened by two researchers. Results: We included 24 studies in the review. No generalizable pattern of suicide among immigrants was found. Immigrants from countries in which suicide risks are particularly high, i.e. countries in Northern and Eastern Europe, experienced higher suicide rates relative to groups without migration background. Gender and age differences were observed. Young female immigrants from Turkey, East Africa and South Asia are a risk group. Conclusion: Immigrants 'bring along' their suicide risk, at least for the initial period they spend in the immigration country. Health-care planners and providers need to be aware of this 'imported risks'. However, most immigrant groups do not have an increased suicide risk relative to the local-born population; some may even experience substantially lower risks.

AB This study was undertaken to examine the effect of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan on the number of suicides in order to assess whether religious faith is associated with a decreased number of suicides during that period. In this retrospective study, a total number of 82,871 autopsies have been performed in the Morgue Department of the Council of Forensic Medicine (Istanbul) of the Ministry of Justice between 1978 and 2012, 33years. For the study purposes, the earlier start of Islamic calendar months (i.e. 10 or 11days earlier each year) compared with the Gregorian calendar was taken into account and file details such as crime scene investigation reports, information obtained from the police, and autopsy results were assessed. Of the 4315 suicide cases, 267 were reported during Ramadan, while 4048 were recorded during other months. Of the 33years examined, only five Ramadan months exhibited a suicide rate above the annual average and there was a significantly lower (p = 0.042) incidence of suicides during Ramadan. Suicide by hanging is less frequent during Ramadan compared with non-Ramadan months, probably reflecting a positive spiritual influence of this period on Muslims.

AB This study was conducted to evaluate the demographic, causative, and biologic characteristics of patients with organophosphate (OP) poisoning who were admitted to tertiary teaching and research hospitals at 2 different universities. All patients admitted to the emergency departments of Cukurova University Hospital in Adana, Turkey, between 2001 and 2003 and the Hospital of Mustafa Kemal University in Hatay, Turkey, between 2004 and 2006 were included. The study group consisted of subjects with a mean age of 28.5 +/- 14.1 y (range, 14-80 y), and the maximum number of cases in the second decade of life; the female-to-male ratio was 2.2:1. In all, 27 of 43 females and 16 of 20 males were married. Most subjects (n=55) had graduated from primary school; 3 were illiterate and 5 were highly educated. A total of 36 (57.1%) subjects belonged to lower socioeconomic groups. Fifty-three patients intended to commit suicide, and 10 cases were accidental. Mean arrival time of subjects to the hospital after poisoning was 9.9 +/- 16.1 h (range, 1-96 h); mean Glasgow Coma Scale score was 10.2 +/- 2.9 (range, 3-15). A total of 19 subjects were intubated, and 4 died. A total of 59 patients recovered completely. The mortality rate (6.3%) depended on various factors such as OP compound consumed, amount ingested, time interval before hospitalization, and patients' general health. Chances for recovery were greater when the patient was hospitalized at the earliest indication. In conclusion, ON especially affected young single females, and most cases were due to attempted suicide. Because OP poisoning is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, therapy should be started immediately to avoid undesirable consequences.

AB Background: Whether differences exist between those who do leave a suicide note and those who do not has not yet been comprehensively answered. Leaving a suicide note is not a random phenomenon: A minority, varying between 3-42%, of all suicide victims leave a note. Aims: To compare the group of suicide victims who leave notes with the ones who do not, using data from the Athens Department of Forensic Medicine, the largest in Greece. Methods: We examined sex, age, nationality, religious beliefs, marital and residential status, history of prior psychiatric disorder and psychiatric attempt(s), suicide method, physical disease, recent hospitalization, and existence of suicide notes. We completed psychological autopsy questionnaires after phone interviews with relatives of the suicide victims of a 2-year period (November 2007-October 2009). Results: Note writers, 26.1% of our sample, differed in the following: they died by hanging or shooting (p = .007), had no history of psychiatric illness (p < .001) or recent (i.e., within 12 months of the suicide) psychiatric hospitalization (p = .005). Conclusions: Our study showed that there are indeed differences between suicide victims who leave a note and those who do not. We also suggest some explanations for these differences, which could represent a valuable starting point for future research on this topic.

   Conclusion: The greater the Suicide Probability Scale score, the higher the probability of suicide and the lower the problem-solving capability It is possible that having had a previous suicide attempt is the most Important risk factor for a future suicide attempt Cooperation among family, school, and psychological professionals may help reduce the attempted suicide rate, especially among female adolescents.

AB Objective: This study aimed to investigate the suicide risk among the elderly hospitalized and treated because of physical illnesses, and the factors affecting the risk.
   Methods: The study has a cross-sectional design. It was conducted with 459 elderly people hospitalized and treated in a public hospital between May 25, 2015 and December 4, 2015. Data were collected with the Personal Information Form, Suicide Probability Scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. For the analysis, descriptive statistics, the chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and logistic regression analysis were used.
   Results: In the study, 24.0% of the elderly were at high risk for suicide. Suicide risk was even higher among the elderly in the 60-74 age group, living alone, drinking alcohol, perceiving his/her religious beliefs as weak, being treated for cancer, having the diagnosis 11 years or over, having a history of admission to a psychiatry clinic, and being at risk for anxiety and depression.
   Conclusion: In the study, approximately one out of every four elderly people was at high risk for suicide. Therefore, older people should be assessed for suicide risk and programs targeting to prevent the elderly from committing suicide should be organized. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To identify clinical predictors of suicide attempts in patients with bipolar disorder.
   Methods: This study included bipolar patients who were treated in the Psychiatry Department, Haseki Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey, between 2013 and 2014; an informed consent was obtained from the participants. Two hundred and eighteen bipolar patients were assessed by using the structured clinical interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) Axis-I ( SCID-I) in order to detect all possible psychiatric comorbid diagnoses. Clinical predictors of suicide attempts were examined in attempters and non-attempters. The study design was retrospective.
   Results: The lifetime suicide attempt rate for the entire sample was 19.2%. Suicide attempters with bipolar disorder had more lifetime comorbidity of eating disorder. Female gender and family history of mood disorder were significant predictors for suicide attempts. There was no difference between groups in terms of bipolar disorder subtype, onset age of bipolar disorder, total number of episodes, first and predominant episode type, suicide history in first degree relatives, severity of episodes, and hospitalization and being psychotic.
   Conclusion: Our study revealed that female gender, family history of mood disorder, and eating disorder are more frequent in bipolar patients with at least one suicide attempt.

AB Background/aim: This study aimed to determine the relationship between nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior (NSSIB) and manners of death.
   Materials and methods: This study retrospectively evaluated 6604 autopsy cases evaluated at forensic medicine institutes of six major cities of Turkey. The study group consisted of all cases with NSSIB findings. The control group was created from cases without signs of NSSIB.
   Results: We found that the numbers of possible suicide and homicide cases in the NSSIB (+) group were significantly higher than in the NSSIB (-) group. The possibility of death due to suicide was 3.213 times and homicide was 2.004 times higher than natural deaths in the NSSIB (+) group compared with the NSSIB (-) group.
   Conclusion: The presence of NSSIB might increase the risk of death due to suicide and homicide, especially in adolescence.

AB Objective: We aimed to investigate the sociodemographic and clinical properties of suicide attempters and the risk factors associated with future attempts in this study. Methods: Total of 55 patients was recruited to current study. Forty three patients completed the follow-up period. Patients were contacted by phone and they were evaluated by a semi structured phone interview checking major depression criteria according to DSM-IV and they were asked whether they have attempted suicide and whether they are taking medication and psychiatric care. Results: The mean age and education of the sample was 29 +/- 11 years and 9 +/- 4 years respectively. Seventy five percent of suicide attempts were occurred after a life stress. Ninety eight percent of suicide attempts were self-poisoning. Eight patients (16.8%) repeated suicide attempt at least one more time during the six month follow-up period. The risk factor associated with repeated suicide attempts was presence of depression at the sixth month evaluation (p=0.01, odd's ratio: 12.39; 95% CI: 1.83-83.5). Discussion: The most important finding of this study is that depression is found to be associated with repeated suicide attempts at the end of six month follow-up period. To investigate risk factors associated with repeated suicide attempts with epidemiological studies is important for the development of both treatment and preventive health care services in Turkey.

A new fashion of viral games which were claimed to have encouraged self-harm among children and adolescents are frightening families. We will discuss two adolescent cases who evaluated in outpatient service for online challenge related self-harm behavior. Psychiatric evaluation revealed that both children were suffering from psychiatric disorders, had peer problems and were socially isolated. This is the first paper from Turkey which reported that viral games might prod children and adolescents for self-harm.

AB Pesticide poisoning is still a significant health problem in Turkey. We conducted a retrospective study of autopsy cases at Izmir Branch of the Council of Forensic Medicine to describe the characteristics of deaths caused by pesticide poisoning between 2006 and 2009. The distributions of the cases according to gender and age were as follows: men 74.1% (n = 40, mean [+/- SD] age, 44.7 +/- 14.1), women 25.9% (n = 14, mean [+/- SD] age, 39.2 +/- 18.9). The majority of pesticide-poisoning deaths were suicides (n = 43, 80%) followed by accidents (n = 4, 8%) and homicide (n = 1, 2%). The manner of death could not be determined in six cases (11%). Suicides mostly occurred at home (n = 26, 63%) (p < 0.05). Methomyl was the most frequent pesticide (n = 9, 17%) among the all cases. This study reported that most of the pesticides found in poisoning cases were highly hazardous types. Combined efforts of medical professionals and law makers are needed for enacting strict laws against highly hazardous pesticides.

AB Suicide is a significant public health problem in youth. This study comparatively investigated the prevalence of suicidal thoughts, attempts and attitudes in high school and university students. A total of 3.031 (high school = 1.630, university = 1.401) Turkish students participated in the study. Self-administered measuring tools were used to collect the data. More high school than university students reported suicide ideation (high school = 36.1%, university = 29.0%) and attempts (high school = 9.4%, university = 7.2%). Participants reporting suicidal behavior saw suicide as an acceptable but to be a hidden behavior. They also displayed more negative reactions to a suicidal close friend than participants without suicidal behavior. High school students saw suicide as an acceptable option but displayed negative reactions to a suicidal close friend. In a similar fashion, men saw suicide as an acceptable option but displayed negative reactions to a suicidal close friend to a greater extent than women. Low suicide acceptance and a belief in communicating psychological problems to others were found to be associated with positive reactions to a suicidal close friend. In conclusion, suicidal thoughts and attempts are frequent among young people in Turkey. Participants with a suicidal behavior, high school students and men see suicide as an acceptable behavior but exhibit negative reactions to a suicidal close friend.

AB The aims of this study were to determine both the rate of possible PTSD in individuals who were exposed to a suicide attack in Ankara, Turkey, and the factors that relate to the elevated risk for PTSD in individuals who survived that suicide attack. The researchers carried out the study with 93 participants who had attended a meeting held in Ankara on October 10, 2015. Participants completed a sociodemographic information form, the Traumatic Stress Symptom Checklist (TSSC), the Post-Traumatic Cognitions Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Influence of Perceived Societal Attitudes Questionnaire (IPSAQ). Twenty-three of participants were determined to have possible PTSD (24.7%). Participants who were exposed previously to a suicide attack, who witnessed a life-threatening injury, who had the need for psychological help, and who had suicidal thoughts had significantly higher rates of possible PTSD. The IPSAQ, BDI, and TSSC scores were significantly higher in the participants with possible PTSD. The IPSAQ score was found to be related to the development of possible PTSD. This study demonstrated that in participants who had been exposed to a terrorist attack, the negative impact of perceived societal attitudes toward the victims was related to the possible development of PTSD.

AB Objective: Suicides among children and adolescents occur very seldom and only a few case reports and even fewer comprehensive studies are available in the forensic literature. We attempted to investigate socio-demographic characteristics like suicide age, sex, suicide method and cause of suicidal deaths among children and adolescents in Ankara, and to determine the causes of suicides which were preventable. Material and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the autopsy records of the Institute of Forensic Medicine, Ankara, where all autopsies requested from the health centres in Ankara and surrounding 17 cities were performed, and the database of the judicial records from 2001 to 2006. The suicide cases were divided into three age groups: 7-10 years, 11-15 years and 16-18 years. Results: There were 114 suicides involving 60 females (52.6%) and 54 males (47.3%) aged between seven and 18 years with a median age of 16.0 years (SD=2.21). The most frequently used suicide method was hanging, followed by firearm injuries with handguns, firearm injuries with rifles, drug intoxication and jumping from a high place. Eighty one point two per cent of intoxication cases aged between 16 and 18 years. However, there was no significant difference in the toxic substance use between the genders. Of all suicide cases, 28 (24.6%) had ethanol in blood. Conclusion: In this study, the number of female suicides was higher than that of male suicides and there were differences in suicide methods, causes of suicides and suicide age, consistent with the results of several other studies from Turkey. Children and adolescents should be prevented from accessing firearms and toxic substances, which will play an important role in prevention of suicides.

AB Objectives: To investigate the demographic and socio-cultural properties, as well as the etiological factors in suicide attempters in Turkey.
   Methodology: A standard questionnaire form was used to collect information on gender, age, education level, employment status, marital status, method and reason of the suicidal attempt, prior suicidal attempts, psychiatric diagnosis, family history of psychiatric disorders and the season. Eleven hundred twenty (1120) suicide attempters who were admitted to the Emergency Department of Kayseri Training and Research Hospital, between 1 June 2006 and 31 December 2006, were enrolled in this study.
   Results: Suicide attempts were mostly observed in females (81%, p<0.005), and in the age range of 15-24 years (64.6%, p=0.300). The highest rate of suicide attempts were observed in patients with primary school education (59.8%, p=0.424), in housewifes (p<0.001), and in married women (p=0.001). The most common method used to attempt suicide was intoxication (99.1%, p=0.345) and the most common cause of suicide attempts was family problems (43.5%, p=0.001). The most important risk factors for suicidal ideation were the presence of a previous psychiatric disorders (p<0.003) and a family history of psychiatric disorders (p<0.001).
   Conclusion: Suicidal attempts must be carefully evaluated in subjects with previous psychiatric disorders, and a family history of psychiatric disorders.

AB Over the last 25 years, suicide attacks have become an alarming threat. They are a political tool which has been adopted by several organizations in Sri Lanka, Palestine and the Occupied Territories, Turkey, Chechnya, Afghanistan, Pakistan and, in particular, by the Al-Qaeda-led insurgency in Iraq in its struggle against the US and its allies. Recent analyses have traced back the use of suicide terrorism to its 'strategic logic': organizations and their militants resort to suicide attacks mainly because they view this form of violence as an efficient weapon for their revolutionary and nationalist campaigns. An explanation based on the paradigm of rational choice theory or instrumental rationality alone is, however, insufficient. This article suggests the importance of combining the paradigm of instrumental rationality with that of axiological rationality. Only this kind of explanation is able to clarify the crucial role played by those cultural and symbolic elements which justify and encourage the martyrdom of suicide attackers. Moreover, by adopting a multi-causal analysis of the armed organizations, their constituencies and the attackers, as well as of their interaction, the article outlines a theoretical model of the most important social mechanisms underlying the use of suicide tactics.

DE Internet; suicide; suicidal ideation
ID INTERNET SEARCHES; CYBERSUICIDE; INFORMATION; PREVENTION
AB Objective: The Internet is increasingly being used to acquire information about personal experiences and health, but the credibility of this information is debatable. It has been reported that methods of suicide and access to suicidal means are explicitly discussed in some of the websites, with users being encouraged to attempt suicidal acts in some cases. Access to web content with pro-suicidal features is monitored in many countries. In Turkey, the frequency of people visiting these websites is unknown. Moreover, a program has not been established that targets online users. This study aims to provide information about the information that a person may come across after searching online for suicide and suicide methods in Turkish language.
   Method: After searching for particular suicidal phrases (i.e., "suicide methods," "painless suicide," "guaranteed suicide," "killing yourself" and "how can I die") in the Google search engine, three psychiatrists evaluated the results independently, according to the content.
   Results: 42 of the 100 websites (42%) were found to have properties that are pro-suicidal, whereas 13 of them (13%) were found to have content that may be considered protective against suicidal thoughts and actions. Among the websites that were reported to be protective, none had any kind of supervision or guidance from mental health professionals.
   Conclusion: Suicidal content, as well as the possibility of content generated on the Internet, should be taken into account while planning suicide prevention programs. Further studies are needed to determine which risk factors and protective features of the Internet affect suicidal behavior among individuals.

AB The sociodemographic features of organophosphate poisonings (OPPs) in the east Anatolian region of Turkey were investigated in this study. All OPPs admitted to the Emergency Department of Yuzuncu Yil University Medical Faculty Hospital in Turkey from 1 April 1999 to 31 August 2001 were prospectively studied. Data collected included age, gender, education, employment and marital status, socioeconomic levels, time and route of exposure of the toxic agents, treatment before admission, duration of hospitalization and complications.
   The proportion of OPPs was 15.1% among 564 poisonings. Fifty-seven (67.1%) patients were female, 28 (32.9%) were male. Fifty-six (65.9%) cases were attempted suicides and 29 cases (34.1%) were due to accidental events. Mean age was 22.1 +/- 9.2 years in the suicidal cases and 43 (76.8%) of them were less than 24 years ( P = 0.001). Among the suicide attempts, 29 (51.8%) patients were unmarried and 43 ( 76.8%) patients were female. The attempted suicide proportion was 46.4% in men and 75.4% in women ( P = 0.008). Eighty per cent of cases had a primary education level or were illiterate and 78.8% of the patients were in the lower socioeconomic status. The patients' mean arrival time to the hospital after poisoning was 4.4 +/- 3.7 (1-15) hours and mean hospitalization duration was 4.9 +/- 4.1 (1-32) days. Exposure routes were gastrointestinal in 75 (88.2%), respiratory in five (5.9%), dermal in four (4.7%) and both dermal and respiratory in one case (1.2%). Seventeen patients (23.5%) were admitted to the ICU and four ( 4.7%) of them died.
   In conclusion, OPPs especially affected young unmarried females, and most of them were due to attempted suicide. As OPP is the important cause of morbidity and mortality in the region, therapy should be started as early as possible so undesirable consequences can be avoided.

AB Turkey's snap parliamentary election in November 2015 took place in an environment of growing political violence and terrorism resulting from the renewal of the Kurdish conflict in the southeast and two major suicide bombings carried out by Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Presenting the coalition arithmetic, the article first examines the failure to form a government after the previous election five months earlier. It then examines the campaign for the November election, including party strategies, key issues and the role of the media, before analysing the results and the election winners and losers. In restoring a parliamentary majority for the Adalet ve Kalknma Partisi (Justice and Development Party - AKP) that has governed Turkey continuously for the past 13years, the November election marked the basic continuity of Turkey's predominant party system.

AB Purpose: This cross-cultural study investigated the prevalence of suicidal behavior and attitudes towards suicide and reactions to suicidal individuals in 320 Austrian and 326 Turkish medical students.
   Methods: Data were collected using a self-report questionnaire consisting of sections on demographic information, suicidal behavior, current mood, religiosity, attitudes towards suicide, and reactions to suicidal individuals.
   Results: More Austrian (37.8%) than Turkish (27.3%) students reported life-time, past 12-month, or current suicidal ideation, while more Turkish (6.4%) than Austrian (2.2%) students reported life-time or past 12-month suicide attempts. Austrian students had more permissive and liberal attitudes towards suicide, while those of Turkish students were more rejecting. Conversely, attitudes of Turkish medical students towards an imagined suicidal close friend were more accepting than those of Austrian medical students. Comparisons of suicidal versus nonsuicidal students showed that those reporting suicidal ideation or suicide attempts generally were more accepting of suicide and viewed suicide as a solution to a greater extent than the nonsuicidal group.
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that cultural factors play a role in observed country differences in suicidal ideation and behavior and in attitudes towards suicide and reactions to suicidality among Austrian and Turkish medical students.

AB Objective: Aim of this study was an evaluation of the completed suicide rate as well as exploring what associated psychological and social factors might have increased the risk of death from suicide.
   Method: The study examines all adult suicide cases in the Province of Denizli that occurred between January 2009 and December 2010. In addition to examining the judicial files, interviews were conducted with the suicide victims' relatives to elaborate the cases and evaluate the risk factors for suicide. For 19 of 53 suicide victims (35.9%), no interviews were conducted; telephone interviews were carried out with relatives of 27 of the victims (50.9%), and face-to-face interviews were held with relatives of 7 of the subjects (13.2%). Healthy controls were randomly chosen from the registers of 14 Denizli primary healthcare centers. The 31 control individuals were from a similar geographic area and social backgrounds as the case group.
   Results: Of the cases, 13.2% (n=7) were female, while 86.8% (n=46) were male. The mean age was 41.57+15.33 years. The total mean age of the control group was 42.84+16.98 years (p=0.725). The results of this study showed that a history of psychiatric disorder, prior suicide attempts, a history of alcohol abuse, stressful life events, and lack of social support/interaction were associated with suicide.
   Conclusion: Clinical and psychosocial factors such as a history of psychiatric disorder, unemployment, and financial or relationship problems increase the risk of suicide.

AB Background Religion is associated with lower rates of self-killing, but the mechanism underlying religion-suicide association is not clear. To better understand this relationship, the present study investigated the impact of religious versus secular education on suicidal ideation and attitudes towards suicide and a suicidal close friend in Turkish adolescents. Deduced from religious commitment, social integration, networking and stigma perspectives, the study tested five specific predictions. Method A questionnaire was used to collect the data in a group of adolescents (n = 206) undergoing religious education and a group of adolescents (n = 214) undergoing secular education (N = 420). Results Suicide ideation was more frequent in adolescents undergoing secular education than in those undergoing religious education. The secular group was more accepting of suicide than the religious group. Those from the religious group, however, were more accepting of a suicidal close friend than their secular counterparts. Conclusion It seems that self-killing finds accepting attitudes in secular segments of societies and, hence, people consider self-killing as an option during times of personal crises. People from religious communities, however, seem not to accept self-killing as an option, but they are more positive toward persons who have considered suicide for one reason or another.

TI Ghost Martyrs in Iraq: An assessment of the applicability of rationalist
   models to explain suicide attacks in Iraq
SO STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM
LA English
DT Article
ID TERRORISM
AB Scholars have developed several rationalist explanations for the use of suicide attacks by terrorist organizations. Using evidence from Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Sri Lanka, Chechnya, and Turkey, these authors have created plausible and rational models for attacks, which many consider to be irrational. Although the conflict in Iraq has, by most accounts, experienced more suicide bombings than any other struggle, its contemporary nature has made research and analysis on the subject difficult. This article analyzes four of these models and their implications with respect to the events in Iraq. Although the evidence is not conclusive, the data suggests that organizations are not using suicide attacks to (1) gain nationalist objectives, (2) signal strength to a foreign government, or (3)outbid rival organizations, as many scholars suggest. Instead, the evidence suggests that these attacks are used for (1) tactical advantages and (2) to aid the global recruiting effort of Al Qaeda-linked organizations.

AB Background: Non-suicidal self-harm behavior (SHB), which is a pervasive and dangerous problem, is frequent among adolescents and it is important to evaluate the associated psychological and social factors to better understand its nature and to plan treatment programs. Aims: Aim of the present study is to determine the prevalence of SHB and the associated variables such as substance use, psychological, behavioral and social factors among 10th-grade students in Istanbul/Turkey. Methods: Cross-sectional online self-report survey conducted in 45 schools from the 15 districts in Istanbul/Turkey. A representative sample of 4957 10th-grade students was studied between October 2012 and December 2012. Results: SHB within the previous year were reported by 14.4% of the students (n = 713). Lifetime suicidal thoughts or behavior, tobacco, alcohol and/or drug use, symptoms of depression, anxiety and impulsive, delinquent and aggressive behaviors were also associated with SHB in Turkish 10th-grade students. Conclusions: The findings of the present study may be relevant in prevention and management of SHB as well as important problems among students, such as substance use, impulsive, delinquent, aggressive and suicidal behavior.

AB Background: It is of the utmost importance to determine the views of nurses about patients with suicidal behavior and who attempt suicide so that they can help such individuals.
   Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the feelings, thoughts and experiences of nurses working in a mental health clinic regarding individuals with suicidal behaviors and suicide attempts.
   Methods: A qualitative study design was employed. Data in this research study were collected through individual in-depth interviews. The study population included 121 nurses working at a Mental Health and Diseases Hospital in Turkey. The study sample consisted of 33 nurses who had been working at the hospital for at least one year, had experience working with patients who attempted suicide, and agreed to participate in the study.
   Results: The nurses understood the patients; they experienced sadness, worry, anxiety, stress, unrest and fear; they were blamed by the hospital administration when a patient committed suicide; they blamed themselves and doctors for patient suicides; and they had developed proposals to prevent suicide among hospitalized or discharged patients. The nurses also stated that patients committed suicide in the evening or in the early hours of the morning by strangling or hanging themselves or by shocking and unforeseen methods, although the nurses performed the necessary emergency intervention procedures.
   Conclusion: It is recommended that planned group meetings for nurses be arranged and that follow-up guidelines/protocols for patients with suicidal tendencies who are residing in mental health clinics be prepared by a committee of healthcare professionals.

DE bridge; death; suicide; jumping
ID RIVER BRIDGES; WATER
AB Suicide methods may differ widely. One of these methods is jumping from a height. The people who choose a high bridge for jumping may be considered as a special group. In this study, we evaluated the demographic data, mortality rates and postmortem findings of individuals who jumped from the 64 m high Bosphorus Bridge of Istanbul. For this purpose, we reviewed registration forms of two police centers on both sides of the bridge, court archives, and postmortem examination reports of the deceased for a period of 10 years between 1986 and 1995.
   During this period, 65 people had jumped from the Bosphorus Bridge of Istanbul. The mortality rate was 96.9%, as two individuals survived their suicide attempt. The male/female ratio for attempts was 15:1 (61 males, four females) in this study in contrast to the male/female ratio of 1.6:1 for all suicidal cases in Turkey. The average age of subjects was 29.2 (median: 26, range: 16-54). The frequency was highest in the 15-24 age group with a rate of 38.4%. People who jumped from the bridge were younger than other reported cases of suicide. For all methods of suicide in Turkey 53.5% of subjects are under the age of 35. However, in our study, 75.8% of individuals who committed suicide from the Bosphorus Bridge were under the age of 35. Unmarried people accounted for 56% of the individuals whose marital status was known. 20.8% of the individuals whose employment status was known were unemployed. 59% of the cases whose education was known were high school graduates. The highest rate of suicide by jumping was in 1990, and occurred during the fall and winter months, primarily between the hours of 24.00 and 06.00. The Bosphorus Bridge is forbidden to pedestrians. Arrival method to the bridge was by a taxicab in 53.3% of the cases. 91% of the recovered bodies had been discovered during the first 2 days of jumping. Positions on impact with the water were estimated according to external and internal injuries. Among the cases in which the position of impact could be assessed by external and internal injury patterns, combined lateral and horizontal positions were most common.

AB The number of the suicides is increasing all around the world. In this study, the cases autopsied between 2000 and 2007 in The Konya Branch of Forensic Medicine Council were retrospectively investigated. Fifty-seven shotgun suicides were determined. The cases were evaluated in terms of their demographic characters, site of entrance wound, the type of the cartridge used, shooting distance, the place of incident, the place of death, motive for suicide, and the presence of previous suicide attempts. The most preferred site of entrance wound was the head with 34 cases (59.7%). Of 34 cases in which the entrance wound was on the head, there was indirect mandibular fracture in 16 cases (47.1%). In 11 cases (19.3%), there observed small ecchymosed abrasions on the finger surfaces, which are thought to have resulted from the trigger kicking back during triggering or the finger having been stuck between the trigger and the trigger guard. It is concluded that there is a need for a legal regulation that makes obtaining of shotguns more difficult and the people who have them are to be educated not to keep them in easily accessible places.

AB A retrospective study was carried out on 4549 which is the total number of hanging cases autopsied at Forensic Medicine Institute in Istanbul, Turkey. 4502 hanging cases of suicidal origin were detected and evaluated in terms of demographic features, the type of hanging material used for ligature, internal findings in neck organs, toxicological findings and microscopic findings. Of these suicides, 3295 (73.2%) were males and 1207 (26.8%) were females. The average age of the victims was 37.8 (SD 1.6). Crude suicidal hanging rate is approximately two-fold increase in women, while it is about five-to six-fold increase in men during 33 years. 1424 of the victims committed suicide by hanging themselves at home, and 441 of them in prison and indoor areas. The alcohol in the blood of all autopsy victims was tested and results were positive for 687 people. A drug active agent was detected in 108 (2.4%) victims: 70 (1.5%) of them were antidepressants, 20 (0.5%) of them were analgesic/anti-inflammatory/anti-histaminic and 18 (0.4%) of them were antipsychotic. In the examination of the psychoactive substances in blood and urine, any of such substances was not detected in 4146 of the victims. However, victims' blood and urine contained a sedative-hypnotic-anxiolytic with 74 (1.6%), a cannabinoid with 16 (0.4%) and an opioid with 12 (0.3%). Psychoactive substance examination was not carried out for 243 victims. Of these cases, 4060 (90.2%), ecchymosis in soft tissues and 2800 (62.1%) fracture in neck organs was found.

TI The strategic logic of suicide terrorism
SO AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID WORK
AB Suicide terrorism is rising around the world, but the most common explanations do not help us understand why. Religious fanaticism does not explain why the world leader in suicide terrorism is the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, a group that adheres to a Marxist/Leninist ideology, while existing psychological explanations have been contradicted by the widening range of socio-economic backgrounds of suicide terrorists. To advance our understanding of this growing phenomenon, this study collects the universe of suicide terrorist attacks worldwide from 1980 to 2001, 188 in all. In contrast to the existing explanations, this study shows that suicide terrorism follows a strategic logic, one specifically designed to coerce modern liberal democracies to make significant territorial concessions. Moreover, over the past two decades, suicide terrorism has been rising largely because terrorists have learned that it pays. Suicide terrorists sought to compel American and French military forces to abandon Lebanon in 1983, Israeli forces to leave Lebanon in 1985, Israeli forces to quit the Gaza Strip and the West Bank in 1994 and 1995, the Sri Lankan government to create an independent Tamil state from 1990 on, and the Turkish government to grant autonomy to the Kurds in the late 1990s. In all but the case of Turkey, the terrorist political cause made more gains after the resort to suicide operations than it had before. Thus, Western democracies should pursue policies that teach terrorists that the lesson of the 1980s and 1990s no longer holds, policies which in practice may have more to do with improving homeland security than with offensive military action.

AB Background: Agricultural pesticide poisoning is a major contributor to the global burden of suicide. Over the last decade there has been a marked decrease in the incidence of suicide worldwide. It is unclear whether pesticide poisoning still plays a significant role in the global incidence of suicide.
   Methods: WHO method-specific suicide data were supplemented by a systematic review of the literature between 2006 and 2015, including searches of thirteen electronic databases and Google, citation searching and a review of reference lists and personal collections. Our primary outcome was the proportion of total suicides due to pesticide poisoning. Weighted estimates were calculated for seven WHO regional and income strata.
   Results: We identified data from 108 countries (102 from WHO data, 6 from the literature). A conservative estimate based on these data indicates that there were approximately 110,000 pesticide self-poisoning deaths each year from 2010 to 2014, comprising 13.7% of all global suicides. A sensitivity analysis accounting for under-reporting of suicides in India resulted in an increased estimate of 168,000 pesticide self-poisoning deaths annually, that is, 19.7% of global suicides. The proportion of suicides due to pesticide self-poisoning varies considerably between regions, from 0.9% in low-and middle-income countries in the European region to 48.3% in low-and middle-income countries in the Western Pacific region.
   Limitations: High quality method-specific suicide data were unavailable for a number of the most populous countries, particularly in the African and Eastern Mediterranean regions. It is likely we have underestimated incidence in these regions.
   Conclusion: There appears to have been a substantial decline in fatal pesticide self-poisoning in recent years, largely driven by a reduction in overall suicide rates in China. Nonetheless, pesticide self-poisoning remains a major public health challenge, accounting for at least one-in-seven suicides globally.

AB Ramadan is a holy month for Muslim people and includes long fasting periods. During Ramadan, practicing Muslims not only fast, but they also abstain from any kind of medication, smoking, sexual intercourse, and alcohol from sunrise to sunset. In the 10-year period between 2000 and 2009, it was determined that a total of 4881 death examinations and autopsies were performed at the Konya Branch of the Forensic Medicine Council (Turkey). All of the reports were retrospectively evaluated for demographic features of the cases and the manner of death. In the studied time period, a total of 491 deaths (10.1%) occurred in Ramadan. The manner of death was accident in 369 (75.2%) of the cases in Ramadan, 3107 (70.8%) of the other cases; suicide in 27 (5.5%) of the cases in Ramadan, 367 (8.4%) of the other cases; and homicide in 28 (5.7%) of the cases in Ramadan, 375 (8.5%) of the other cases. There was a significant statistical difference in terms of the manner of death between the deaths in Ramadan and in the remaining part of the year (P < 0.05). Our study suggested that there was an increase in accidental and natural deaths and a decrease in suicide and homicides in Ramadan.

AB The purpose of this study was to retrospectively investigate cases of death due to carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning in the province of Aydn in western Turkey. The study investigated the cases of death due to CO poisoning that were autopsied at the Adnan Menderes University Department of Forensic Medicine from 2002 to 2012. The mean age of the 33 autopsied cases of fatal CO poisoning was 60.30 +/- 4.082 years, and 75.8% of the cases were men. The highest level of CO in blood was 79.7%. It was found that most of the CO poisoning deaths were related to accidents.

AB We aimed to examine association between disordered eating attitudes (DEAs), alexithymia and suicide probability among adolescent females and to explore potential link between alexithymia and suicide probability in subjects with DEAs. 381 female students completed Eating Attitude Test (EAT-26), Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and Suicide Probability Scale (SPS). It was found that 13.2% (n=52) of the subjects have DEAs. Results indicated that total TAS-20 score and scores of Difficulty in Identifying Feelings (DIF) and Difficulty in Describing Feelings (DDF) subscales were significantly higher in DEAs group than in those non DEAs group (p<0.05). Additionally, total SPS score (p<0.001), Hopelessness (p=0.001), Suicide Ideation (p<0.001) and Hostility (p=0.003) subscales scores of SPS were significantly higher in the alexithymic DEAs than the non-alexithymic DEAs group. In order to control potential effect of depression, SPS subscales were used as covariate factors in ANCOVA. Negative Self-Evaluation subscale yielded a statistically significant difference between groups, other subscales did not. Results point out these; DEAs are relatively frequent phenomenon among female students in Turkey and presence of alexithymia was associated with an increased suicide probability in adolescents with DEAs. The results should be evaluated taking into account that depressive symptomatology was not assessed using a depression scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB News items reporting self-immolation by Tibetans have been on the increase in recent years. After examining the corpse of a Swiss man who had committed suicide by deliberate self-burning, we wondered how often this occurs in Switzerland. The Federal Statistics Office (FSO) does not register self-burning specifically so no official national data on this form of suicide are available. However, we had access to the data from a Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) project Suicides in Switzerland between 2000 and 2010, which collected information on all (4885) cases of suicide investigated by the various institutes of forensic medicine. From this data pool we extracted 50 cases (1.02%) of suicide by self-burning, in order to determine the details and to identify the possible reasons for choosing this method. To look at our results in the light of studies from other countries, we searched the literature for studies that had also retrospectively examined suicide by self-immolation based on forensic records. Our results showed that, on the whole, personal aspects of self-burning in Switzerland do not differ from those in other industrialised nations. Some data, including religious and sociocultural background, were unfortunately missing - not only from our study but also from the similar ones. In our opinion, the most important prevention strategy is to make healthcare professionals more aware of this rare method of suicide. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

AB Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the injury spectrum and characteristics of people who committed suicide by jumping into water from the July 15th Martyrs Bridge and Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridges in Istanbul, Turkey.
   Methods: This study included all of the jumpers from the July 15th Martyrs Bridge and Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge who were autopsied by the Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul Morgue Department, between 2000 and 2013. All of the data were collected from archived case files. Trauma scores were calculated from the traumatic findings of the autopsy reports using the New Injury Severity Score (NISS).
   Results: A total of 80 jumping suicides were identified. The male-to-female ratio was 9: 1, and the mean age was 34.06 +/- 9.6 years. Most suicides occurred in 2009. The suicide rates were higher in the winter, particularly in December. The most frequent injuries were skin lesions, rib fractures, and lung lacerations. In 12% of the cases, the trauma was minor (NISS range, 0-14; mean, 7 +/- 5.67), and in 88% of the cases, it was major (NISS range, 17-66; mean NISS, 44.5 +/- 12.46).
   Conclusion: The sociodemographic features of the jumpers who committed suicide were quite similar to those reported in previous studies. Preventative measures (installation of barriers or banning pedestrian access to bridges) reduced the suicide rate but were not completely effective. Establishing early warning systems and rescue strategies could save the lives of jumpers who have minor trauma.

AB Objective: The aim of our study was to investigate the suicide attempters with the results of their clinical observations, to compare the suicide methods and first time/multiple attempts that resulted in admission to a university hospital emergency department in Turkey. Methods: The records of 640 patients admitted to a university hospital emergency department after a suicide attempt was reviewed retrospectively in a five year period. Following variables were included in the study: the demographic parameters, the date of admission, the number of attempts, features of the suicide attempts (methods, impulsive or planned attempts, stress factors before the attempts, the results of the clinical observations and the diagnosed mental disorders before the attempts). Non-violent and violent attempters according to the method and first time/multiple suicide were compared seperately. Chi-square test was used for comparing nominal variables. Differences were considered as statistically significant for p values under 0.05. Results: The majority of the suicide attempters were women (66.3%) and mostly between the age groups of 15-24 and 25-34. The most common method was self-poisining with drugs (84.5%). Most common suicide behaviour was impulsive (82.5%) and was likely to be the first-time attempters. First-time attempters were mostly (71.9%) discharged from the emergency department after a follow-up. According to the suicide method, non-violent suicide methods were more common in 15-24 age group and singles. Violent methods were frequently preferred in summer. Of all suicide attempters 6.4% were recorded as treatment refuse to the follow-up in the emergency unit. Treatment refusals were more common in multiple attempters who mostly have a mental disorder Conclusion: Our findings about the sociodemographic features of suicide attempters were consistent with the literature except the marital status. However treatment refuses in the common hospital emergency services seem to be serious problems that further preventive strategies should be reassessed in emergency units.

AB In this study, the relationship between mental disorders, childhood trauma and sociodemographic characteristics was evaulated in women staying in shelters due to domestic violence. The study comprised 59 volunteers, staying in women's shelters in Istanbul due to domestic violence. The structured clinical interview for DSM-IV TR axis 1 disorders (SCID-I), Domestic Violence Data Form, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Beck Anxiety Inventory and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire were applied by a psychiatric expert in face-to-face interviews. Of the cases 76.3% were diagnosed with at least one psychiatric disorder. Post traumatic stress disorder was the most common diagnosis (50.8%). In our study 59% of women had attempted suicide at least once, and 66% of these were found to have attempted suicide after violence started. Previous psychiatric diagnosis and exposure to childhood abuse were observed to be risk factors for suicide attempts. Psychiatric disease comorbidities and suicide attempt were identified at high rates in women exposed to domestic violence.

DT Article
ID ASSISTED SUICIDE
AB Euthanasia and assisted suicide are subject to an ongoing debate and discussed with various aspects. Because physicians are in a profession closely related to euthanasia, their attitudes toward this subject are significant. Thus, research intending to explore their opinions is carried out in many countries. In this study, opinions of the physicians regarding euthanasia's definition, contents, legal aspects, and acceptable conditions for its application are addressed. The questionnaire was given to 949 physicians, more than 1% of the total working in Turkey. Of the physicians who participated in the study, 49.9% agreed with the opinion that euthanasia should be legal in certain circumstances. In addition, 19% had come across a euthanasia request and the majority of physicians (55.9%) believed that euthanasia is applied secretly in the country despite the prohibitory legislation. In conclusion, the authors infer from the study itself and believe that euthanasia should be legal in certain circumstances and that the subject, which is not in the agenda of the Turkish population, should continue to be examined.

AB Objectives: To evaluate demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with poisoning at a community hospital.
   Methods: The retrospective study comprised records of patients who were admitted to the emergency department of Konya Numune Hospital, Turkey, because of poisoning between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2011. Data was evaluated for age, gender, educational status, occupation, arrival time, mechanism of intoxication, body temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, Glasgow Coma Scale score, treatment applied, duration of hospital stay, duration of follow-up, test results, final diagnosis, clinical disposition, and outcome. Agents causing the poisoning were also determined.
   Results: Records of 1036 patients were evaluated. Of them, 764(74%) were female and 272(26%) were male. The predominant age range was 15-24 years in 617(60%) patients. The median time from substance exposure to admission to the emergency department was 2 hours. The most common cause of poisoning was attempted suicide in 955 [92%] patients and drug intoxication was the agent involved in 932 (90%). In the 15-24 year age range, there were 469(76%) female patients. Of the total female population in the study, 716(94%) attempted suicide. The median hospital stay was 24 hours. There were 908(88%) patients who were advised to seek further evaluation at the psychiatry clinic, and 9 (0.9%) patients were admitted to the psychiatry inpatient units after medical treatment. In patients who were hospitalized and followed up, 1 (0.1%) died because of multiple drug poisoning.
   Conclusion: Most admissions to the emergency department for poisoning related to young women had used drugs during a suicide attempt.

ID RELIABILITY; VALIDITY; ABUSE
AB Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between childhood trauma and aggression-suicidal behavior in patients with bipolar disorder. Material and Methods: A total of 112 outpatients diagnosed with bipolar disorder in remission in the province of Siirt on the east coast of Turkey were included in this study carried out between January and June 2018. Personal Information Form, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Buss-Perry Aggression Scale (BPAS) and Suicide Probability Scale (SPS) were used for data acquisition. Results: It was determined that patients with bipolar disorder have 89.3% of physical neglect, 74.1% of emotional neglect, 75.9% of physical abuse, 79.5% of emotional abuse and 40.2% of sexual abuse. The mean score of CTQ was 66.8 +/- 19.2, the total score of BPAS was 94.6 +/- 28.8 and the total score of SPS was 85.3 +/- 17.9. A statistically significant and positive correlation was determined between CTQ, BPAS and SPS (p < 0.05). There was a weak and positive relationship between BPAS, CTQ (r = 0.325**; p < 0.05) and subscales of CTQ which are emotional abuse (r = 0.350**; p < 0.05), physical abuse (r = 0.354**; p < 0.01), physical neglect (r = 0.313**; p < 0.01) and emotional neglect (r = 0.316**; p < 0.01). A statistically significant difference was observed between the regular use of drugs, violence against others and total score of CTQ, BPAS and SPS (p < 0.05). Conclusion: It is suggested that patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder should be evaluated with regards to childhood trauma history by taking into consideration sociodemographic characteristics and psychiatric support in order to prevent their aggression and suicide attempts.

AB Although many studies have examined the neurobiological aspects of suicide, the molecular mechanisms and pathophysiologic mechanisms associated with suicide remain unclear. In this study, it is aimed to investigate whether there is a difference in serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) levels among suicide attempters without a major psychiatric disorder, compared to major depressive disorder patients and healthy subjects. It was undertaken with the hypothesis that suicide per se lowers serum BDNF levels, since it is a source of stress. The study was carried out in Celal Bayar University Hospital, Manisa, Turkey. Ten suicide attempters, 24 patients with major depressive disorder and 26 subjects without any psychiatric diagnosis and any psychiatric treatment were included in the study. All subjects were asked to give their written consent. Blood samples were collected at the baseline. Serum BDNF was kept at - 70 degrees C before testing, and assayed with an ELISA kit ( Promega; Madison, Wisc., USA) after dilution with the block and sample solution provided with the kit. The data were subjected to the Kruskal-Wallis test for nonparametric analysis of variance. Mean serum BDNF levels were significantly lower in the suicide group (21.2 +/- 12.4 ng/ml) and the major depressive disorder group (21.2 +/- 11.3 ng/ml) than the control group (31.4 +/- 8.8 ng/ml; p = 0.004). These results suggest that BDNF may play an important role in the neurobiology of suicidal behavior. BDNF levels may be a biological marker for suicidal behavior. To investigate the role of BDNF in suicide, further studies with a wider sample size and a variety of psychiatric diagnoses accompanying suicide attempt are needed. Copyright (c) 2007 S.

AB This study investigated the possible role of depression, self-esteem, problem solving, assertiveness, social support, and some socioeconomic factors on adolescent suicidal behavior in youth in a small city located in the southwestern part of Turkey. Participants in the study were 805 (367 girls) first-year high school students between the ages of 13-18 years. Some 23% of participants reported having thought of killing themselves during the past 12 months or their lifetime. The percentage of students who said that they had attempted to kill themselves was 2.5. Suicidal ideation during one's lifetime or during the past 12 months was more frequent among girls than among boys but suicidal attempts were equally common in girls and boys. Girls scored significantly higher on depression and the Suicide Probability Scale (SPS) but also on assertiveness and perceived social support from friends than boys. Boys tended to score higher on self-esteem than girls. Depression and low self-esteem were the most consistent and independent predictors of suicidal thoughts, attempts, and SPS scores in both girls and boys. The results are discussed in terms of relevant literature with special reference to developmental and sociocultural issues. The implications of findings for the assessment and treatment of suicidal youths are highlighted.

AB Introduction: In this study student suicides are classified as a distinct group in Eskisehir-a city located in the western part of our country and famous as a student city. The study aims at describing demographic and suicide specification of cases and compare some important issues between males and females.
   Method: All the judicially deaths in Eskisehir in a 12 year period between 2004 and 2015 have been evaluated. 75 cases that were deemed as suicide cases as a result of criminal investigation have been included in the study.
   Results: It was determined that hanging method was the most frequently used method and the number of male was more. It was determined that the majority of them were the students living away from their families. Definite or possible psychiatric disorder was identified as the most important risk factor. It was observed that there were significant differences in terms of risk factors between male and female students. Males have been found as more prominent in case of definite or possible psychiatric disorders, alcohol and substance abuse, love and romantic tangles; females have been found as more prominent in case of family problems and social pressure, and repeated suicide attempts.
   Discussion: Compared to the general population love and romantic problems are more prevalent in this group. It is observed that university students left suicide notes more than the general population. Sharing this study with the university administrations could be helpful in undertaking the necessary precautions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine.

AB Introduction: The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiological characteristics of suicide attempt cases who were admitted to the emergency departments and to determine their level of social support and related factors by using multidimensional scale of perceived social support (MSPSS). Methods: This study was conducted simultaneously in two different centres between February 23 and June 31, 2009. Totally 260 suicidal cases who were admitted to the emergency departments were included in the study after obtaining the consents. Related derived data were collected with a questionnaire. The questionnaire determined epidemiological characteristics of suicide attempters by using MSPSS derived data. The data were analysed with percentage, mean, t test, ANOVA, and Scheffe test. Results: About 70% of all cases were female and 63.1% of them were between 16 and 25 years of age. The main causes leading to suicide attempts were family problems (41.9%), financial problems (11.2%), and peer suicide attempts (5.4%). Drug use was the most common suicide method both in males and females. The MSPSS score was 52.47 +/- 17.81 (mean +/- SD, range=12-84). While being a member of a broken family, being widow/divorced, previously diagnosed mental disorder affected social support scores negatively, being a student or having a high level of education affected scores positively. Conclusion: Family problems, financial problems, 16-25 age group, female sex, being divorced/widowed, being a member of broken family, chronic physical and psychological problems, and lower level of perceived social support are main characteristics associated with suicide attempts.

AB The main purpose of this study was to examine the ethical beliefs of Turkish senior counseling students who are eligible to be counselors, and to compare these beliefs with those of Turkish freshmen counseling students based on Turkish counseling ethical codes. Gibson and Pope's (1993) ethical beliefs and practice survey was used to collect data from 251 Turkish counseling students. The Cronbach's alpha value for the instrument was .89 in this study. Data was analyzed and discussed using a chi-square test and Cramer's V. Statistically significant differences were found on subjects related to dual relationships, multicultural counseling, competency, confidentiality, suicide prevention, fees and advertisements, and test administration. Only 48% of participants considered the Turkish ethical codes as a primary source for ethics information. Suggestions are shared to increase counseling ethical standards in Turkey.

AB Objective The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale is a semistructured, interview-based assessment tool, which is increasingly being used for clinical and research purposes across the globe, despite its limited psychometric evaluation outside of English-speaking populations. The aim of this study was to linguistically adapt the measure and investigate reliability, validity, and factor structure of the Turkish version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale in a heterogeneous sample of psychiatric and nonpsychiatric outpatient adolescents. Method The study included four clinical groups: two psychiatric, nonsuicidal outpatient groups (depression group (N = 50) and nondepression group (N = 50)), suicidal group (N = 43), and nonpsychiatric general practitioners' group (N = 70). All participants were interviewed with the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale and suicidality module of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for children and adolescents. They also completed the Suicide Probability Scale, Child Depression Inventory, Beck Hopelessness Scale, and their parents filled in the Child Behavior Checklist. Results The scale was found to be a solidly reliable measure with good internal consistency and agreement among interviewers. It correlated in the expected direction with self- and parent-report measures of associated constructs (e.g., depression) as well as suicidality. Consistent with the developers' intent of theoretical subscales, a three-factor solution (i.e., the severity of suicidal ideation, the intensity of suicidal ideation, and suicidal behavior) fit the data well, and it fit the data significantly better than the alternative models. Last, the Turkish Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale successfully discriminated the adolescents with a recent history of suicide attempts from other clinical groups. Conclusion The Turkish version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale is a reliable and valid instrument to assess suicide risk among adolescents.

AB Objective: The present study was conducted to determine the frequency of lifetime suicide attempts and suicidal ideations and to determine related risk factors on patients admitted to psychiatry outpatient clinic of Erzincan State Hospital.
   Material and Method: All the patients were asked for their suicidal ideations and behaviors in their lifetime. The sociodemographic data, number of application to outpatient clinics, the presence of a psychiatric disorder and a history of a suicide attempt within the family were questioned and recorded. The diagnosis based on DSM-IV-TR was determined after the psychiatric interview by the same psychiatrist. Among 1378 invited, 1073 participate in the study (77.9%).
   Results: Suicidal ideations were 28.3% (n=303) and attempts were 18.5% (n=198) during lifetime. Rate of suicidal attempts was 65.3% (198/303). Patients who considered or attempted suicide were more common among women than men. The most frequently diagnosed psychiatric condition was mood disorders followed by anxiety disorders for the patients with suicidal ideations and suicide attempts. For the group with suicidal attempts, the third most frequent diagnosis was somatoform disorders. Undiagnosed cases ranked third for the group with suicidal ideations.
   Conclusion: It is crucial to examine suicidal ideations and suicide attempts in all psychiatric patients. Following mood and anxiety disorders, the third most common diagnosis was somatoform disorders in patients living in rural areas of Eastern Turkey Suicide attempts may be used as a non-verbal language as part of somatization.

AB The prevalence of suicidal behavior and the nature of attitudes toward suicide differ in Austria and Turkey. To see if there were differences in disclosure, 351 Turkish and 310 Austrian students answered questions about disclosing suicidal thoughts. More Austrian than Turkish students reported suicidal ideation and believed that suicidal people disclose their plans, but suicidal disclosures were equally common in the two groups. Compared to Austria, suicidal disclosures in Turkey met with more positive social reactions that may facilitate a successful social support process. These findings imply that prevention efforts should reduce the stigma around suicidal disclosures.

AB Background: The objective of this prospective hospital-based study was to evaluate the rate and characteristics of acute human poisoning in our province (Gaziantep City, Turkey). Methods: All cases of acute human poisonings admitted to the emergency department of the Gaziantep University Hospital, Gaziantep, Turkey, between January 2000 and December 2001, were included in the study. The rate and causes of mortality from poisoning as well as demographic data of the patients were investigated. Results: There were 179 (0.7%) poisoning cases among 25,605 patients who admitted to the emergency department. Of the poisoning cases, 64.3% were female and 35.6% were male patients. The poisoning made a peak between the ages of 16 and 25. The majority of poisonings resulted from oral ingestion with deliberate intake accounting for 78.7% of the cases. Most of the suicide attempt cases were also females. Analgesics were the most common agents (42.4%) among the drugs incriminated in poisoning. Twenty-four patients (13.7%) were admitted to intensive care unit, of whom 42% were female and 58% were male patients. Drugs for suicide attempts were the main cause of poisoning in the patients who admitted to intensive care unit. Five patients (2.8% of all cases) died in the intensive care unit.
   Conclusions: These data provide important preliminary information on the pattern of symptomatic poisonings in this south-east part of our country.

AB Background: Numerous studies in youth and adults suggest strong association between substance use disorders and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal behaviors. There is paucity of studies exploring the association of substance use with history of suicide attempts (HSA) and NSSI in children and adolescents in Turkey. Objective: We aimed to examine the prevalence of NSSI and HSA and their relationship with substance use and family characteristics among youth seeking treatment for substance use in Turkey. Method: Participants were children and adolescents who were admitted to the Bakirkoy Trainee and Research Hospital for Psychiatric and Neurologic Disorders in Istanbul between January 2011 and December 2013. Two thousand five hundred eighteen participants were included. Questionnaires were applied to all patients. The association of NSSI and HSA with substance use, family characteristics, and subject characteristics were analyzed. Results: The prevalence of NSSI and HSA behaviors among substance using youth in our sample were 52% and 21% respectively. Cannabis and cocaine use was found to be a significant risk factor for HSA, and polysubstance use was associated with both NSSI and HSA. Parental separation/divorce, parental mental disorders, alcohol and drug use, and crime were the risk factors for HSA. A positive history of physical and sexual abuse increased the risk of HAS, and a history of neglect increased the risk of NSSI. Conclusions/importance: We suggest that results showing relationship between substance use and associated social features with NSSI and HSA may contribute to elaborating effective and targeted preventive and intervention programs for these high-risk youth groups in Turkey.

Amlodipine, which is both cost-effective and taken once daily, is one of the most commonly prescribed agents. Although peripheral edema is a well-known side effect of amlodipine, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema associated with amlodipine is very rare. Herein, we describe a 24-year-old female case of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema after ingestion of 300 milligram of amlodipine orally for a suicide attempt. The patient was successfully treated with fluid replacement, inotropic drugs, and mechanically ventilation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reported in Turkey.

AB Organophosphate insecticides (OP) are used widely in Turkey and are the most common agent employed for suicidal poisoning. At present there are limited data available on the distribution of OP in humans, and the aim of the study was to report insecticide concentrations in human autopsy tissues. With the use of gas chromatography-nitrogen phosphorous detector, the levels of fat, liver, and blood OP were determined from 32 suicide victims. In all cases OP were present and usually more than one OP was found. The concentration of OP was highest in fat and least in blood. Even 20 d postmortem OP could be detected in human autopsy tissues, but the correlation to fat content and mortality needs to be addressed.

Given this finding, the present study investigated whether or not more adolescents in Turkey than in Sweden disclose their own suicidal thoughts to someone, to whom adolescents disclose their suicidal thoughts, what reactions such disclosures produce, and reasons for not disclosing suicidal feelings among 966 Swedish and 956 Turkish high school students. A questionnaire was used to collect information about different aspects of suicidal disclosures. More Turkish than Swedish adolescent suicide ideators disclosed their thoughts. More Turkish than Swedish students believed also that young people thinking about and planning suicide tell others of their plans and thereby ask for help. All overwhelming majority of adolescents in both groups revealed their thoughts to peers. The social reactions to suicidal disclosures in both samples were mainly positive. The two most common reasons for not disclosing in both groups involved interpersonal hopelessness. Adolescents who disclosed their past suicidal thoughts to someone reported having lower current suicidal ideation than those who had not. In line with favorable social attitudes towards suicidal disclosures and lower suicidal mortality rates in Turkey compared with Sweden, more Turkish than Swedish adolescents reported having disclosed their own suicidal thoughts to someone in their social milieu.

AB This study aimed to examine which values predicted depressive symptoms and hopelessness in Turkey. While it was hypothesized that values emphasizing universalism, benevolence, conformity, security, tradition, spirituality, self-direction, and achievement would predict lower levels of depressive symptoms and hopelessness, those values emphasizing power, stimulation, and hedonism would predict higher levels of depressive symptoms and hopelessness. Participants were 712 university students in Turkey. The Schwartz Values Survey Revised Turkish Version, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Beck Hopelessness Scale were administered. Spirituality was observed as a distinct value category in Turkish culture. Higher levels of universalism predicted lower levels of depressive symptoms. While higher levels of self-direction and benevolence predicted lower levels of hopelessness, higher levels of achievement predicted higher levels of hopelessness. The findings partially fit Sagiv and Schwartz's value theory regarding the relationship between mental health and the growth and deficiency aspects of values. The findings suggested having congruent values with the environment (i.e. achievement) were not uniformly associated with positive affective states.

AB Objective: Suicide is a complex behavior concerning a number of psychological, biological, social and cultural factors. It is also an important public issue, as well as one of the leading causes of death. We aimed to examine the relationship between suicide attempt and thyroid hormones in suicide attempters and healthy controls and aimed to clarify whether any of the thyroid hormone levels may have predicted current or future suicide attempts.
   Method: This study comprised 358 participants (115 suicide attempters, 243 controls). Thyroid hormone levels including free T3, free T4, and TSH of all participants were explored. For predicting future suicide attempts using our hospital database and the database of the Republic of Turkey Social Security Institution, via International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnostic codes related to suicide data of future suicide attempts of the study participants were collected. Participants were people without previous history of any thyroid disorder or chronic disease (endocrinological, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, neurological, infectious and neoplastic diseases, hepatic, renal or cardiac failure) that may affect thyroid hormone levels. The participants who were on any thyroid hormone or drug that may affect thyroid hormone levels (e.g., lithium, carbamazepine, oral contraceptives etc.) alcoholism or drug abuse other than nicotine, pregnancy, detected possible thyroid disease during procedure, intellectual disability, rejection of blood tests, missing data on topics mentioned above, were all excluded.
   Results: Thyroid hormone levels of both groups were within normal range. Groups differed with regard to FT4 (thyroxin), TSH and FT3/FT4 levels. A logistic regression model indicated that suicide attempters were 32.7 times more likely to have higher FT4 levels (OR: 32.7; 95% CI: 5.3-202.9; p<0.0001), 1.7 times more likely to have higher TSH levels (OR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.2-2.3; p=0.002), 2.5 times more likely to have lower FT3/FT4 levels (OR: 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2-0.8; p=0.008) than controls. Diagnostic validity of FT4 was found to be good in differentiating patients with both groups (ROC area under the curve=0.821; 95% CI: 0.77-0.87; p<0.0001). The cut-off point for FT4 of 1.15 ng/dl gave a high sensitivity (85%) and specificity (70%).
   Conclusion: Thyroid function test measurement may be used as discriminative cut-offs between suicide attempters and healthy subjects. None of the thyroid hormones indicated future suicide attempts. Higher FT4, TSH, and lower FT3/FT4 levels are independently associated with suicide attempt. FT4 may be a useful marker to predict current suicide attempt.

AB Patients with epilepsy experience stigmatization quite often. Studies investigating stigmatization perceived by patients with epilepsy in Turkey are limited in number. In this study, we aimed to understand the relationship between stigmatization and psychopathology and also to identify the effects of stigmatization on the quality of life in epilepsy. Patients completed a socio-demographical data form and epilepsy information form. They were evaluated in terms of psychiatric diagnosis using SCID I and they were asked to complete SCL-90 R, Epilepsy Stigmatization Scale and SF 36. The percentages of patients who did and did not report perception of stigmatization were similar in the study group.
   Depression was the most common diagnosis followed by anxiety disorder. In comparison to patients who did not feel stigmatized, patients who reported perceived stigmatization had a higher frequency of generalized tonic clonic seizures and injuries during seizures and more frequently missed taking their medication. They also showed higher rates of both suicide attempts and psychopathology as evidenced by a higher rate of psychiatric diagnosis and higher score in all the subscales of SCL 90. With regard to their quality of life they were observed to be more disabled in the physical functioning, general health perception, vitality, social role functioning and mental health dimensions. A logistic regression analysis revealed that stigmatization was best predicted by three variables: history of suicide attempts, receiving a psychiatric diagnosis and higher score in SCL90PST. Our study has shown that psychopathology is a more significant predictor of stigmatization than the other variables related with seizure control. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB On 17 February 2016, a suicide bomber blew himself up, killing 28 people and injuring another 61 in the heart of Turkey's capital Ankara. A few hours after the attack, the Turkish government blamed Salih Neccar from the (mostly) Kurdish-Syrian People's protection Unit (YPG). Two days later, the Kurdistan Freedom Hawks (TAK) claimed responsibility and named the bomber as Abdulbaki Somer a Turkish citizen. The bombing is part of a resumption of violence in Turkey between Turkish government authorities and Kurdish groups. In this paper, we examine how on-line news stories recontextualise the bombing. We assert that news sources multimodally recontextualise the bombing in ways which are advantageous to the news organisations' owners, political alliances and supporters. By each news source representing their political interests unquestionably positive and opposition unconditionally negative, polarisation in Turkish politics is articulated. This does nothing to solve problems and heal wounds in a time of national crisis.

Data were collected with the UCLA Loneliness Scale (Russell, Peplau, & Cutrona, 1980), the Beck Hopelessness Inventory (Beck, Weissman, Lester, & Trexler, 1971), and a questionnaire developed by the researcher. One hundred and ninety-six people took part in the study. Results showed that the male participants suffered from loneliness and hopelessness more frequently. They liked the university environment, but the limited number of friends and parental attitudes contributed considerably to hopelessness. In addition, there was a strong correlation between the severity of loneliness and the severity of hopelessness.

AB Citizens of the United States own more firearms than those in any other country, and the majority of the firearms owned are handguns. Given such prevalence, surprisingly few studies have been published describing the characteristics of deaths due to handguns. To address this gap, nonaccidental handgun deaths examined at the Bexar County Medical Examiner's Office between 2000 and 2010 were reviewed. A total of 1450 cases were identified, including 797 suicides and 653 homicides. Age, range of fire, location of wound, and manner of death were analyzed. The average age of suicide victims (46.7 years) was found to be greater than that of homicides (34.3 years). Suicidal wounds tended to be contact wounds to the head; abdominal, extremity, back, and multiple wound locations were more common in homicides as were distant and intermediate wounds. Handgun wounds to the forehead, side of head, submental, and intraoral locations were significantly more common in suicide, whereas those to the face, apex of the head, and back of the head were more common in homicides. Where possible, likelihood ratios were calculated to determine relative likelihood of suicide or homicide for specific wound locations and ranges. While each death should be analyzed based on its unique circumstances and not solely its statistical probability, these data may help inform the pathologist's conclusions.

ID RISK-FACTORS; POPULATION
AB Objective: Suicide attempt is one of the most important risk factors for completed suicide, and generally, the first intervention is performed in the emergency department. The attitudes of health professionals towards suicide attempt cases affect their treatment and medical care. There is no related attitude assessment scale for health professionals in Turkey. The aim of this study was to develop a scale for assessing the attitudes of emergency medical teams towards cases of attempted suicide.
   Methods: In this methodological, epidemiological study, a pool of 140 items was compiled using a previously developed similar scale available in the literature, as well as, testimonies of health professionals. Two hundred and fifty-one doctors, nurses and emergency medical technicians from 14 local hospitals in Sanhurfa were included in this study. Surface validity was determined using the Lawshe content validity index and ratio. Factor analysis (principal components) was used to evaluate structural validity and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha), and test-retest reliability was analyzed.
   Results: The mean age of the study cohort was 27.9 +/- 5.15 years, and 50% of the participants were female. A 28-entry attitude scale, which explained 58.5% of the total variance, was developed, including subscales for prevention and protection, individual help, institutional help, triggers and psychopathology casual attributions, and medical help. The Cronbach's alpha parameter of the scale was 0.84. In test-retest analysis; there is no significant difference between point averages of the first and last application of the scale.
   Conclusion: The psychometric features of the developed scale were determined to be acceptable.

AB The present study examined hope as a potential mediator of the association between intimate partner violence (IPV) and suicidal risk, namely, depression and suicide ideation, in a sample of 149 Turkish female college students. Results from conducting bootstrapped mediation analyses indicated that hope agency, but not hope pathways, mediated the link between IPV and suicidal risk in Turkish women. Importantly, the associations of IPV with both depression and suicide ideation became nonsignificant once hope was included in the prediction model.

ID DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS; ATTEMPTED-SUICIDE; TRENDS
AB Objective: To evaluate the etiologic and demographic characteristics of acute adult poisoning cases and to obtain up-to-date information on acute poisonings.
   Methods: A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate 1254 adults who presented with acute poisoning to the Emergency Department of our tertiary care university hospital in central Turkey from January 2007 to December 2009. The data extracted from each chart related to age, gender, marital status, agent involved in the poisoning, season of event, route of poisoning, time between ingestion or exposure and arrival at the casualty ward, mechanism of toxic exposure (unintentional or intentional), level of consciousness, length of stay in the ward, and outcome.
   Results: Acute poisonings comprised 1.40% of Emergency Department patients; 65% were female, while 47% were between the ages of 16 and 25 years. Medicinal drugs were the most common cause of poisonings (68%), followed by gases (9.5%). Antidepressants were the most frequent drug ingested (18%), followed by analgesics (16%). Intentional poisonings constituted the majority of cases (78%). Most suicide attempts were made by women (68%) and majority of the patients were married (57%). Twenty patients (1.6%) died during their hospital stay, with organophosphate pesticides being the most common agent (n=8) involved in fatal poisonings.
   Conclusion: Pharmaceutical agents, carbon monoxide and pesticides are the three most common poisoning agents. Deliberate self-poisoning is common in adults in the area of the study; the risk being highest in females and younger adults. These up-to-date data provide important information on the characteristics of acute poisonings and can guide activities such as professional training, preventive measures, community education and new research.

AB Introduction: Clinical and forensic autopsies are the best methods for determining cause of death. The aim of this study was to determine demographic and etiologic characteristics in geriatric forensic cases analyzed in Erzurum, Turkey.
   Materials and methods: Autopsy reports and prosecution documents of decedents aged 65 and older autopsied in the Morgue Specialization Department of the Forensic Medicine Institute, Erzurum Division between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2015 were screened retrospectively.
   Results: The study included 399 subjects with a mean age of 74.38 +/- 7.28 years. A large proportion of the subjects were in the young and middle old age group (n = 218, 54.63%) and male (n = 286, 71.68%). Autopsy was performed on 198 (49.62%) of the subjects, cause of death was determined by post-mortem external examination in 199 (49.87%), and documents were unavailable for 2 subjects. Cause of death was determined as natural in 130 (32.58%) of the decedents and unnatural in 269 (67.42%). The most common natural cause of death was cardiovascular disease (n = 94, 76.4%). Unnatural causes of death included accident in 223 (82.90%), suicide in 25 (9.30%) and homicide in 21 (7.80%) of the decedents. A large proportion of the accidents were traffic accidents (n = 120, 53.80%). The most common method of committing suicide was hanging (n = 15, 60%), whereas homicides were most often committed by blunt force trauma (n = 9, 42.86%).
   Conclusion: Our data are consistent with the literature, allowing for some variation based on regional sociocultural characteristics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB This study determined the spectrum of deaths due to acute agrochernical poisoning in Turkey. Data was obtained from all autopsy reports performed between 1997 and 2001, compiled by the Institute of Forensic Medicine (which is a department of the Ministry of justice), and evaluated retrospectively. There were 3990 deaths by intoxication of one form or another. Acute agrochemical/pesticide poisoning caused 843 deaths. Almost half were under 30 yo: 55% were female and 45%were male. Of 205 deaths whose manner of death was determined, 153 (75%) were suicide; the most common substance used was insecticide followed by sulfur, rodenticides, and herbicides. The pattern appeared consistent from 1997 to 2001 with no decline in the number of cases, despite the government having taken measures to educate the public and reduce pesticide use by offering alternates to control pests and insects.

AB Objective: Some evidence suggests that suicidal behaviour of Turkish migrants differs from the native population's suicidal behaviour. In most studies on this topic, however, analyses have not been based on representative populations; moreover, they partly suffer from methodical shortcomings. We have therefore analysed the suicidal behaviour of Turkish migrants in comparison to that of native Swiss citizens of Basel, Switzerland, using sound methodology; Materials and methods: In 2003 and 2004 in the framework of the WHO/EURO-Multicentre study we investigated all inhabitants of the canton Basel City over 15 years of age who got medical help subsequent to an attempt of suicide. Data of Swiss and Turkish patients were compared. Results: The suicide attempt rate among Turkish migrants was on average more than 2.7 times higher in all age groups than in Swiss citizens. The rate of women was twice as high as that of men. Young females showed the highest rates. Migrants suffered more often from disorders of the ICD-10-category F4 and more often used medication overdoses. Conclusions: Preventative efforts should concentrate especially on young Turkish females and migrants suffering from stress-related disorders. Clinical relevance: When prescribing medication, especially analgesics, lowest toxicity and smallest packaged quantity should be aimed at.

AB In general, hanging cases are the result of suicide, and accidental and homicidal hanging cases are rarely seen. This study retrospectively investigated 4571 death examinations and autopsies that were performed at The Konya Branch of the Forensic Medicine Council (Turkey) between 1998 and 2007; hanging was involved in 201 (6.5%) of the cases. There were a total of 13 accidental hanging cases, where 12 of these involved children. In seven of the cases, the accidental hanging involved a scarf that wraps around swing-like cradles and is intended to prevent infants from falling down. It was concluded that accidental hanging deaths can be reduced by replacing swing-like cradles with cribs that are designed for children, removing ropes in and around the house, and preventing children from reaching and/or playing with rope-like objects.

AB The present research focused on the development of a brief measure of suicidal ideation frequency, namely, the Frequency of Suicidal Ideation Inventory (FSII). Study 1 examined the latent structure of the FSII in a sample of 399 US college students. Results of exploratory factor analysis indicated a one-factor solution accounting for 86.96 % of the variance. Study 2 provided support for the internal reliability of the FSII across four different international samples (viz., US, Turkey, Hungary, and China). Within the US sample, the FSII was found to possess good 6-week test-retest reliability. Moreover, an examination of the associations between the FSII and important measures of suicide risk factors (e.g., suicidal behaviors) and suicide protective factors (e.g., flourishing) provided support for the construct validity of our new measure in an independent sample of 143 US college students. In addition, we found preliminary evidence supporting the FSII as a useful measure of the likelihood of making a future suicide attempt and evidence for the utility of the FSII over established measures of suicide risk in predicting depressive symptoms. Overall, the present findings provide promising evidence for the validity and reliability of the FSII as a brief measure of SI frequency in adults.

AB BACKGROUND: Firearm injuries (FI) are the most common cause of death among military personnel. In this study, postmortem examination and autopsy records of deaths resulting from firearm injuries recorded in the Department of Forensic Medicine of Gulhane Military Medical Academy between 1993-2010 were examined retrospectively.
   METHODS: We evaluated the characteristics of 153 firearm deaths accounting for 36.6% of all medical-legal autopsies. The cases included 152 men (99.3%) and 1 woman (0.7%).
   RESULTS: The mean age of the cases was 23.1 years (+/- 4.7; range, 20-43 years). The manner of death was determined in all cases with 41.8% of cases identified as suicide and 39.9% as homicide. The most common sites of firearm entrance wounds were the head and neck region (n=109, 71.2%), the chest (n=26, 17%), or the abdomen (n=14, 9.2%). The type of firearm was not clear in most cases.
   CONCLUSION: In conclusion, complete forensic and medical records will facilitate the rapid and accurate conclusion of the legal process and will enhance future retrospective studies.

AB Self-burning and self-immolation are forms of self-harm found across the Eastern Mediterranean region and South and Central Asia. The majority of those choosing these methods of self-harm are young women. Using data from 100 young female survivors of suicidal attempts in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, this article analyses the phenomenon in the context of a life-course progression arguing that the period around first marriage is a time of particular trauma to women. We suggest that self-burning should be understood as a communicative act with an indigenous semiology which functions as an expression of subordinated agency within a male-dominated society, in which marriage is a major source of conflict between generations and genders.

AB The aim of this study was to present the characteristics of medicolegal autopsies of fatal poisonings in Trabzon (Turkey), performed from 1998 to 2008, to contribute to the available data on this topic. A retrospective study of the forensic records and the toxicological data of all autopsies performed over that period revealed that 285 cases (6.34%) of the 4492 total autopsies performed were attributed to fatal poisoning. Major toxic substances were classified in five categories as follows: carbon monoxide (CO), insecticides, prescription medications, narcotic drugs, and alcohol (methyl and ethyl). CO was the most frequent cause of death (63.2%), followed by insecticides (17.2%), prescription medications and narcotic drugs (9.8%), alcohol (7.7%), and others (mushroom, rodenticide, and botulism) (2.1%). Ages of the patients ranged from 1 to 86 years (21.55 +/- 36.56).

In total, 58 assailants were convicted of 50 femicides during this period. There were no so-called 'honour killings' in Tekirdag, while 16 (37.2%) of the homicides were honour killings in Diyarbakir. Policies to prevent violence against women, extending the means of access to post-violence services and reinforcing the law, policies and action plans to end this type of violence could be effective in decreasing cases of domestic femicide.

Data were gathered from 2001-2013 autopsy reports retrospectively. A total of 34 cases were reviewed in terms of age and gender, scene and time of event, number of lesions and their locations, organ injuries, origin of electricity, and degree of burns. In all cases, electrical death was accidental. Electrical shock fatalities were most common in the 30 to 39 age group. Fourteen cases (41.2%) involved workers: 7 cases (2.6%) were agricultural workers, 4 cases (11.8%) were housewives, 2 (5.9%) were electrical workers, and 7 (20.6%) were unemployed or in other occupations. The authors are addressing this public health problem to minimize the number of electrical deaths.

AB This study analyzed Turkish female adolescent-family relations, which is believed to be one of the significant factors in female adolescents' suicide attempts, from a multidimensional perspective. The Parent-Adolescent Relationship Inventory, a multidimensional evaluation tool based on the behavioral family-system approach was used as a research tool. The inventory consists of the concepts and techniques of behavioral theory, family system theory, and cognitive theory in parent-adolescent' problems and conflicts. Based on these theories, the parent-adolescent relations inventory (PARQ), involves three main dimensions: problem solving and communication skills, cognitive/internalized beliefs, and functions and structures in family systems. There are two forms of the inventory, the adolescent form and the parent form. Only the adolescent form of PARQ, including 284 items, was used in this research. The inventory also consists of 16 subscales. It was adapted into Turkish by Eryuksel (1996). The subjects of the study were 52 female adolescents who had attempted suicide and were taken to the Emergency Department of The Faculty of Medicine in Cukurova University, and 52 normal female adolescents from two different secondary schools at the southern province in Turkey. The age range of the clinical and normal groups were 14-18 ((x) over bar = 16). The results of the study revealed that the general stress level of female adolescents who attempted suicide is higher than those of normal groups. The examination of family structures of these female adolescents made it clear that mothers were the mediator between fathers and adolescents. It was also observed that both mothers and fathers shared many somatic concerns.

AB Patients presented with poisoning-related suicide attempts is one of the most problematic cases of the emergency services. The most important reason for this being the failure to decide the department of the hospital in which these patients should be admitted to, following consultation. The objective of this study is to emphasize the cost-lowering effect of treatment and follow-up of such suicide cases in Emergency Departments (ED) instead of intensive care units. A total of 791 adult patients with suicidal attempts were retrospectively examined and their clinical and demographic data were included. In addition, the costs of their treatment in the ED, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and Psychiatric Clinic between 01/01/2007 and 31/12/2011were compared. When patients were classified by their month of birth it was found that patients who born in January had the maximum tendency to commit suicide (n:227, 28.7%), while those born in December were the least to do so (n: 30, 3.8%). Of all the patients, 122 (15.4%) were followed-up in Anesthesia Intensive Care (AIC), 639 (80.8%) in the Emergency Department Observation Unit and 30 (3.8%) in the Psychiatric Clinic. When costs of the patients who could receive the same medical treatment in case of necessity were compared; mean cost of the patients were found to be $ 665.44 for the patients treated in AIC, $ 204.09 for patients treated in EDs and $ 186.85 for those received treatments in the psychiatric clinic. We defined that it would be profitable if the intoxication cases were followed-up in the ED observation units and that ED's could be used more effectively than ICUs.

The aim of the present study was to describe the characteristics of substances investigated and detected in poisoning deaths by Adana Group Authority of the Council of Forensic Medicine, Department of Forensic Chemistry, Cukurova, Turkey, between 2007 and 2011 retrospectively. A total of 7681 examinations were performed, of which, 7% (n = 564) determined positive for at least one compound investigated. Ages of the cases ranged from 1 to 97 years (mean +/- SD: 36.10 +/- 19.16). Carbon monoxide (CO) poisonings were found most frequently with an incidence of 27.0%, followed by prescription medications with 25.0%. Illegal drug poisonings were present in 20.0% of blood and urine samples analyzed. Pesticides, mostly endosulfan, were found in 13.0% of the 564 cases investigated. In the blood samples analyzed, methyl and ethyl alcohol were detected in 14.0% and volatile substances in 1.0%. Overall, this study has managed to contribute substantial additional information regarding the epidemiology of poisoning in Cukurova region, Southern Turkey. The results confirm other epidemiological data that indicate CO as the major cause of poisoning deaths in Turkey.

TI Is Daily Shaving of Axillary and Pubic Hair a Feature of Suicide in the

DT Article
DE axilla; pubis; shaving; suicide; forensic medicine
AB In the Islamic context, "fitrah" refers to humanity's innate disposition toward virtue and the ability to differentiate between right and wrong. A common quote regarding fitrah, from the Prophet is, The fitrah consists of 5 things: circumcision, trimming the moustache, cutting the nails, Plucking the armpit hairs, and shaving the pubic hairs."
   In this study, our aim was to determine the status of axillary and pubic shaving in medicolegal death cases that took place in the Konya Province of Turkey and to evaluate the relationship with the origin of suicide. Of 2850 medicolegal death cases, 206 (7.2%) were of suicidal origin. It was observed that the average age in the cases of suicidal origin was 36.76 +/- 17.72 years, and 146 of 206 cases (70.9%) were men. As a method Of Suicide, hanging was the chosen method in 100 cases (48.5%), whereas firearm injuries occurred in 54 cases (26.2%), and intoxication was involved in 37 cases (18.0%). Daily axillary and pubic shaving was observed in 26 of 2644 (1.0%) death cases that Occurred with nonsuicidal reasons, but in 65 of 206 were (31.6%) suicidal cases. Because suicidal notes were present in 25 (12.1%) of all of the suicidal cases, the ratio of daily axillary and pubic shaving was significantly higher than that of the suicidal notes.
   In investigating the cases of suicidal origin for medicolegal purposes, evidence showing that this action was committed by the victim, the presence of a suicide note at the death scene and, a history of a previous suicidal attempt, it was thought that the presence of daily axillary and pubic shaving oil external examination of the victim's body, when of Muslim faith, could also be considered a feature of suicide.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the data on acute adult poisoning over a six-year period at a university emergency department in Turkey and identify the risk factors of mortality.
   Material and Methods: In this survey, data were collected from 2,229 adult patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of Cukurova Medical Faculty, Adana, from January 1, 1997 to December 31, 2002.
   Results: Of all emergency admissions during the six years, 1.6% were poisoned. Of the total poisoning; cases, 725 (32.5%) were males and 1,504 were females. Mean age was 29.3 +/- 13.2 for males and 23.8 +/- 9.6 for females (p=0.001). A majority of the cases (76.4%) were attempted suicides. The attempted suicide ratio is higher for women (gender ratio: 2.4/1) and youths. Drugs were the most frequent cause of poisoning (59.0%) and pesticides were the second (26.4%). Psychoactive drugs were the most common agent (33.5%) among drugs, with their rate increasing each year. Eighty-seven patients died (3.9%): alcohol (methanol) was the most frequent cause of death (20.6%), followed by mushrooms (11.5%), carbon monoxide (10.3%) and pesticides (8.3%). More men than women died by poisoning (OR: 1.8 CI: 1.1-3.1). Gender, age, season, clinical status, initial emergency care and type of substance were significant risk factors for mortality.
   Conclusion: Poisoning by psychoactive drugs was increasing each year of the study, but many drugs are not a serious risk factor for mortality. However, organic phosphorus is a serious risk factor for poisoning and mortality in this area. Providing satisfactory public and emergency staff assistance and education on the subject may reduce the mortality rate.

AB Aims: Pharmaceutical poisonings may result in severe morbidity and mortality. Analysis of patients with pharmaceutical poisoning is important for a better medical management. This study aimed at the epidemiological analysis of the patients diagnosed with pharmaceutical poisonings over 18 years old.
   Materials and methods: Total 1507 patients who admitted to Emergency Department of Adana Numune Education and Research Hospital in Southern Turkey, which is working as regional poisoning centre hospital, between December, I 2009 and December 31 2010 with pharmaceutical poisoning were included in this study.
   Results: Most of the patients were women between the ages of 18-30, committed suicide, by multiple drug ingestion. Antidepressant drug intake in female patients, and caustic substances, rodenticide, organophosphate, narcotic drugs in male patients were statistically significantly higher than the other gender of drugs. We determined that 12.7% of the patients who were referred from other medical institutions did not have the basic important treatments, such as early gastric lavage and administration of activated charcoal. Most of the patients were discharged in good general conditions after treatment. There was no mortality in our emergency department.
   Discussion and conclusion: In order to minimize the poisonings, patients and society should be educated, pharmaceuticals should not be sold without a prescription and the presence of the agricultural insecticide and chemicals at home should be avoided. Also standard treatment approach protocols should be applied in all hospitals to reduce mortality and morbidity.

AB Falls from high places, such as from a building, are frequently encountered in suicides, in some accidents, and sometimes in homicides. In this study, we evaluated the demographic data, mortality rates, fall causes, and post-mortem findings of individuals who fell from heights.
   Our cases were collected retrospectively from the files of the Branch of the Council of Forensic Medicine in Diyarbakir between 1996 and 2001.
   There were 431 accidental and 53 suicidal deaths due to blunt injury resulting from falls. Of the victims, 188 were female and 296 were male. The average age of the 484 victims was 27.05 years (range: 4 months-100 years). For buildings, the height ranged from 3 to 8 storeys for suicides and from 1 to 8 storeys for accidents. We proceeded to analyse the characteristics of accidental falls as follows. The majority of falls were from balconies or rooftops due to the tendency of people to sit and sleep on these places during the hotter months of the year. Some 54.5% of all falls occurred in May-August. The 53 suicidal jumps all occurred off buildings. The victims ranged in age from 15 to 70 years, and comprised 29 women and 24 men. One of the deceased jumped from the roof of a school in which he was boarding, and another from the seventh storey of a hospital in which he was receiving treatment. The remaining 51 jumped from heights ranging from 3 to 8 storeys. Psychiatric illness was reported in 18 (33.9%) of the suicide deaths, while 10 (18.8%) of the 53 suicides were single women.
   The results of this study were at variance with literature data with respect to the following: falls from heights were most common in the 0-5 year age group, females had a higher suicide rate than males, and the majority of accidental falls occurred at home rather than in the workplace.

AB Blank cartridge guns are generally regarded as being harmless and are not considered to be firearms in the legal sense in most countries. To show the danger of these guns upon simple modifications, we report 59 fatalities resulting from these simply modified blank cartridge guns in Istanbul, Turkey. The great majority of the victims were males and the age of those ranged from 11 to 61 years. In 55.9% of these cases, homicide was the origin followed by suicide (39%). The right temporal region was detected to be the preferred region in suicidal shots by blank cartridge guns with a frequency of 56.5%. In trial shots, all these guns were detected to discharge steel or lead spherical objects, generally 4 or 5 mm in diameter, successfully. Our findings strongly suggest that these guns should also be considered as handguns in the legal sense.

AB Filicide occurs in every socioeconomic stratum around the world. This study was conducted to evaluate motives, psychopathological aspects, and socio-demographic factors of 74 filicide cases of women in Turkey. Mean age of mothers, most of whom committed infanticide, was 26years, and breakdown of criminal offenses are as follows: to get rid of unwanted babies (24.3%), acute psychotic-type filicide (21.6%), fatal child abuse and neglect (17.6%), to get revenge (12.2%), protect the lonely child from the harm and badness after suicide (10.8%), and pity (9.5%) motives. Results showed that maternal filicide cannot be reduced to only mental instability or environmental factors and indicates deficiencies in the capacity of the mothers' role in connecting with their child and with parenting skills. Finally, with regard to defendants' motives, similar factors that contribute to committing maternal filicide should be considered while making an assessment of the data and determining employee risk groups.

It was performed among 111 final year students at the College of Health Sciences, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey. These students train to become paramedical professionals and health technicians. Fifteen hours of educational training concerning ethical values and euthanasia was planned and the students' opinions about euthanasia were sought before and after the course. Statistical analyses of the data were performed with the related samples t-test by means of the Epi-Info program. Significant changes were shown in the students' opinions on people's right to decide about their own life, euthanasia in unconscious patients, and reasons for their objection to euthanasia after completing the course. The results of this study suggest that education can significantly change a person's approach to euthanasia.

AB Unemployment has risen as an effect of globalization in the country of Turkey. To date, no studies have examined the association between the duration of unemployment and perceived mental health. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the association between the duration of unemployment and the incidenence of depression among citizens in the southwest region of Turkey. A questionnaire was developed and distributed to 908 unemployed individuals. The questionnaire gathered sociodemographic characteristics and employment-related circumstances. To measure mental health, a depression inventory was administered and group-wise t-tests and logistic regressions were conducted. The findings show that long-term unemployed persons had more episodes of depressive moods in the past 12 months when compared with the group of the short-term unemployed. In addition, depression levels were higher among the long-term unemployed compared with the short-term unemployed. It was estimated that the duration of unemployment and the measurement of depression had a positive correlation. Risk factors that increased depression in the short-term unemployed were gender (female), older age, and greater periods of unemployment. However, higher education, income, and having social insurance significantly decreased the risk of developing depression for both the short-term and the long-term unemployed. Future recommendations include supportive counseling to increase motivation levels and developing strategies to handle periods of unemployment.

AB This study aims to investigate the psychological effects of the earthquake. We investigated the psychological conditions of 3,609 students survived from the Marmara Earthquake, which occurred on 17 August 1999. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was employed to assess the levels of depression and other psycho-pathological states. The BDI was classified as mild depression if the score was :<= 13, moderate depression (14-24) and serious depression (>= 25). Depression level was estimated as mild in 71.5% of the students, and serious depression in 9.6% of the students. The prevalence of suicidal tendency/thought was 16.7% in this study. The prospect of suicidal thought was 1.76-time (95% Confidence interval [Cl]: 1.40-2.22) higher in the students who were injured or whose relatives were injured seriously enough to require medical treatment. Suicidal thought was higher by 1.57 times (95% CI: 1.28-1.92) in students who lost their relatives and by 1.35 times (95% CI: 1.13-1.63) in those who saw extensive damage or destruction occurred in their home or property. According to logistic regression analyses, the gender influenced the thought of suicide; suicide thought was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.60-0.85) time lower in females than males. The present study indicates that injury to the self or to the loved ones, damage to home or property, or the loss of family members as a result of the earthquake enhances the suicidal tendencies.

AB Decapitation of bodies is a rare event in the civilian setting and is reported to account for approximately 0.1 % of medico-legal autopsies. Suicidal decapitation is a very rare method of self-destruction. In suicidal decapitation, the favored method is the one involving trains. Other encountered methods are decapitation in suicidal hanging, vehicle-assisted ligature suicide. Though being encountered rarely decapitation by guillotine was also reported. In this retrospective study, in order to depict characteristic features of deaths with decapitation, we presented the findings of fatalities with decapitation over a 10-year period in a medico-legal autopsy series in Istanbul, Turkey. A total of 36270 forensic autopsies were performed over the period of the study and in 19 cases, the bodies were found to be decapitated (0.05 %). The age range of decapitated bodies was 18 to 71 years (average 39,1 years), with a male to female ratio of 13/6. There was only one case of suicide and the way used for suicide was a mechanism like guillotine. In this case, a guillotine-like device designed by male victim had been used for deliberately decapitating the body. The age of the suicide case was 41 years. There was no female suicide case. There were 13 deaths of accidental origin. 6 vehicle crashes and 7 train-pedestrian accidents. The age range of individuals died in accidents was 26 to 68 years (average 36.8 years) with a male to female ratio of 11/2. During the study period the number of the homicide cases with decapitation was 5. The age range of homicide cases was 18 to 71 years (average, 45.2 years), with a male to female ratio of 1/4. There were multiple traumas in other body parts of the bodies of homicide cases together with decapitation. In majority of homicide cases, multiple stab wounds were detected. Decapitation level of vertebrae was at the level of 3-4 cervical vertebrae in 9 cases and different levels at cervical region in other cases.

AB Background: Most published data on the characteristics and direct hospital costs of deliberate self-poisoning (DSP) were collected front developed countries. This study was conducted to investigate hospital costs of DSP cases and relevant factors in a university-based emergency department (ED) in Turkey.
   Material/Methods: All patients referred to the ED due to DSP in the one-year period between October 1, 2005, and September 30, 2006, were investigated prospectively. Clinical and demographic features were analyzed.
   Results: The female-to-male ratio was 6.3 (189/30). Mean age of the patients was 24.5 +/- 5.7 years. Medical drugs comprised 93.6% (n=205) of the substances ingested in admissions due to DSP. The mean cost of patients with DSP was calculated to be $144.06 +/- 90.83. Treatment costs constituted 36.2% of the. total figure ($52.27). Total costs showed statistically significant differences with respect to sex, type of intoxicants, and location of treatment. Venipuncture, monitoring, nasogastric tube insertion, and gastric lavage were the procedures most commonly applied. Activated charcoal was administered to 66.9% (n=146) of the study sample.
   Conclusions: The study sample had many differences in demographic and clinical outcomes of patients with DSP as well as hospital costs compared with global reports. Gender, ingestion of non-medical substances, and treatment location affected the total hospital costs of these patients. Strategies focusing on high-risk subgroups and conditions may help to reduce unnecessary expenses.

AB Question I have a patient who discontinued her selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor in pregnancy against my advice owing to fears it might affect the baby. She eventually attempted suicide. How can we deal effectively with this situation?
   Answer The "cold turkey" discontinuation of needed antidepressants is a serious public health issue strengthened by fears and misinformation. It is very important for physicians to ensure that evidence-based information is given to women in a way that is easy to understand. The risks of untreated moderate to severe depression far outweigh the theoretical risks of taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

AB Objective: To investigate risk factors for non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), and present the relationship between NSSI and depression in children and adolescents who appeared for forensic examination.
   Methods: This study consisted of 295 children and adolescents who were brought for judicial examination in the TR Ministry of Justice Forensic Science Department, Council of Forensic Medicine, Ankara, Turkey between May and October 2013. Sociodemographic factors, alcohol and substance abuse, and history of sexual abuse and suicide attempts were assessed using a semi-structured questionnaire. During forensic medical examinations, NSSI was evaluated. Depression was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory.
   Results: The frequency of NSSI was 20.2% among boys, and 30.6% among girls. Statistical differences were found between subjects with and without NSSI in terms of number of children in their families, whether or not their parents were divorced, whether they held part-time jobs, or had a history of sexual abuse, substance abuse, or suicide attempts, and the number of criminal involvements. Those with NSSI had higher depressive scores than others (p<0.001).
   Conclusion: Children and adolescents with NSSI have wide-ranging problems in their lives. In a forensic adolescent population, depressive symptoms are more common in individuals with NSSI behaviors, and the specific characteristics of these behaviors need further investigation.

DE Cut throat injury; Homicide; Honor killings; Suicide; Hesitation marks;
   Manner of death
ID SHARP FORCE FATALITIES; STAB WOUNDS; HOMICIDE; SUICIDE; PATTERNS
AB Throat cuts could be of homicidal, suicidal or accidental origin. In the cases of death from cut throat, suicide can be distinguished from homicide based on the type and location of the wound and crime scene investigation. The purpose of the current study is to attract attention to the instructive findings for origin determination in deaths by cut throat according to the number and characteristics of the wounds and crime scene investigation. We have reviewed the files of autopsies performed between the years of 2000 and 2010, and compared with previously published case reports; all results were summarized in the current study. The results showed that 60% of cases were male, 40% were female, with 27.9 years of average age. The mean number of wounds was calculated to be 34.3 per case for honor homicides, 7.4 per case for other homicides, and 2.0 per case for suicides. Numbers of wounds were approximately 5 times higher in the honor homicides compared to other homicides. If the number of wounds were excessive, possibility of honor killings should be taken into account. When the killer was a parent not in psychosis, hesitation cuts were detected. Additional lesions were present in 46.7% of the cases, and they were assessed as homicide. Presence of vertebral notch and spinal cord cuts, which require a substantial amount of force and pressure via sharp tools, indicates homicide.

TI Deaths as a result of hanging
SO BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH-INDIA
LA English
DT Article
DE Autopsy; Capital punishment; Suicide
ID SUICIDE; PRISONERS; AUSTRALIA; IRELAND; TRENDS
AB Background: Death by hanging occurs as a result of the tightening of a cord around the neck with the effect of body weight. Although generally seen, it is not always necessary for hanging to be in a completely perpendicular position with the feet off the ground. With the exception of judicial cases, most hangings are suicides and in some cases may be the result of accident or murder.
   Material and method: In this study an evaluation was made of the autopsies of 48 cases of death by hanging in the province of Tokat, Turkey between 2009 and 2013. Through a retrospective evaluation of autopsy data, the cases were examined in respect of age, gender, location, type of hanging, instrument of hanging, fractures of the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage and level of alcohol and other substances in the blood. In the evaluation of the data, the SPSS 11.0 software was used.
   Results: The cases were 35 (73%) males and 13 (27%) females with a mean age of 34.56 years; males, mean 35.37 years and females, mean 32.38 years. Typical hanging was determined in 42 (87.5%) cases. Fracture of the hyoid bone was seen in 14 (29.2%) cases and fracture of the thyroid cartilage in 13 (27%) cases. With the exception of 2 cases, ecchymosis was found in the fracture region of all the other cases. Ethanol was determined in the blood of 8 (16.6%) cases and other substances in the blood of 2 (6.2%) cases.
   Conclusions: In every case of hanging, the autopsy and toxicology and histopathology examinations made following autopsy are extremely important in respect of differential diagnosis and determining whether or not it is a case of suicide or whether the hanging occurred after death.

AB Hopelessness prevents abused women from participating in social life and increases the risk of suicide. The aim of this study was to determine the level of hopelessness and psychological distress among abused women admitted to shelter in a conservative country. The sample included 40 abused women. A questionnaire, Beck Hopelessness Scale and the General Health Questionnaire were used to collect data. Chi-square, the Pearson correlation analysis test, and variance analysis were performed. Half of the women experienced moderate and severe hopelessness. Higher levels of hopelessness were found to be associated with higher psychological distress. Women had problems with decision-making, concentrating on a job, felt unhappiness, and depression. The results of the study would be useful in designing training programs for nurses, social workers and counselors as well as policy makers who assist women facing domestic violence to provide better physiological and psychological care for sheltered women in conservative countries.

AB Aim To explore relations between socioeconomic factors and health risk behaviors in university students in Turkey.
   Methods A total of 650 students currently enrolled at the university in Ankara were selected for the study by means of a circular sampling method. They answered a questionnaire on health risk behaviors. We used multivariate analysis to analyze the relations between socioeconomic variables and each of the following participants' behaviors in the last year: use of cigarettes, alcohol, or drugs; driving under the influence of alcohol; unprotected sex; attempted suicide; self-mutilation; physical fighting; carrying firearms or edged weapon; not wearing a safety belt in motor vehicles; or riding a motorcycle without a helmet.
   Results Health risk behaviors in university students were in general related to low socioeconomic status, except for alcohol use, which was related to high socioeconomic status. Among female students whose mothers had completed high school, 81.9% used alcohol, compared with less than 68% of female students whose mothers had not completed high school or had completed university (P < 0.001). Also, 4.0% of female students whose mothers had completed high school had attempted suicide, compared with less than 1.5% of female students whose mothers had not completed high school or had completed university (P = 0.026). In male students, important variables were parental education level and paternal employment status. Among male students who had unemployed fathers, 66.7% used cigarettes (P = 0.015),26.7% engaged in substance use (P < 0.010), and 4.4% attempted suicide (P < 0.050) in comparison with 11.9 and 0.7%, respectively, of male students whose fathers were employed. Logistic regression showed male gender to be associated with an increase in all risk behaviors (odds ratio 1.114, 95% confidence interval 1.652-5.622, P < 0.001).
   Conclusion This study confirms the findings of similar studies in western developed countries, suggesting that relations between socioeconomic variables and health risk behaviors in young people reflect a basic phenomenon not greatly influenced by culture.

DE Adult poisoning; Emergency Department; Turkey
AB Objective: To investigate the etiological and demographical characteristics of acute adult poisoning cases in eastern Turkey.
   Methods: The retrospective study was conducted at the Emergency Department of Yuzuncu Yil University, School of Medicine, and comprised data related to the period between 2007 and 2009. The data obtained included age, gender, referrals, manner of poisoning, manner of application, the department which followed up on the patients, duration of hospital stay. All data was noted on proforma. SPSS 15 was used for statistical analysis.
   Results: Of the total cases visiting the Emergency Department, 1207 (1.1%) related to poisoning. Of them, 880 (72.9%) had attempted suicide; 858 (71.1%) were female; 349 (29%) were male. The average age of the females was 25.4 +/- 8.5 years, and that of the males 28.3 +/- 14.3 years. Single-medicine was noted in poisoning 544(45.1%) patients. Other poisoning types were multidrugs 373 (30.9%); rat poisoning, insecticide and pesticides, 145 (12%); corrosives 38 (3.1%); and weed, mushroomang; food 47 (3.8%). Oral poisoning was noted in 1141(94.5%) cases. A total of 1019 (84.4%) patients received treatment and were followed up in the Emergency Department. Six (0.6%) patients died.
   Conclusion: There is a need to generate more awareness about the hazards of domestic cleaning products and to keep it away at some distinct place to minimised chances of confusion.

AB In the last decade, some online social networks such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Linkedln and Jhoos have been accessed by a large number of internet users. Because of these networks, most users spend their spare time surfing the internet. Although social networks provide a number of benefits in terms of developing and sharing knowledge, there are some disadvantages that can make a person's life really miserable on occasion. Within the last few years in Turkey, some secret videos and voice recordings have been broadcast on these social networks without the permission of the people involved. Therefore, some people commit suicide because of the public revelation of their private lives. More than a year ago, some people were arrested and put into jail because they had been broadcasting private recordings on social network sites. Social networks can be used as free advertising environments; even these pages can be used as a place where links can be posted to pornographic websites. Terrorist groups can use social networks not only as tools for propaganda, but also as a communication environment with their members. Because of Turkey's anti-propaganda campaign and Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who is the founder of the Turkish Republic, access to YouTube in Turkey has been forbidden. In this study, a survey was conducted using a number of people in Turkey via the internet in order to measure and evaluate the role of social networks on human behavior. There were more than 20 statements presented to the social network users, where the number of respondents was just over 1000. They were also asked to comment on the social network situation. The survey was evaluated using SPSS software. The relationship between age, gender, income level, the person's social life etc. was investigated and critiqued. The advantages and disadvantages of social networks were discussed. At the end of this paper, some recommendations will be given.

DE hymen examination; midwives; nurses; Turkey; violence; virginity
AB Premarital sexual relations are unacceptable for women within Turkish society's understanding and perception of honour. If there is any suspicion about virginity, young girls are forced to undergo hymen examination against their will, which frequently results in attemped suicide. The most frequent cause of suicide in young Turkish girls is hymen examination. Nurses and midwives are always involve in this procedure. The purpose of this study was to determine the views of and approaches to hymen examination by nurses and midwives. Of those who participated in this study, 80.2% had been present during a hymen examination, 40.4% indicated that virginity had a special significance in the society owing to social pressures, and 37.5% indicated that they agreed with the view that the idea of virginity puts restraints on a woman's sexual life, whereas sexual activity is a physiological need. They also indicated their opposition to hymen examination imposed without the individual's consent. They agreed that stopping this practice depended more on the social structural changes required than on legal measures.

AB The new technologies have changed the rituals related to death: Creation of memorial webpages and of virtual tombs, celebration of death anniversaries are now common currency on the Internet. In spite of their disappearance among the living, the deceased continue to exist on the Web. They still receive messages from their relatives but also from strangers and are at the heart of discussions, prolonging their presence. New technologies have led to a new concept of time and of "where life ends." Through the analysis of Facebook's accounts devoted to Turkish martyrs, this article aimed to describe the new funeral rituals seen on the Internet.

AB The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the characteristics of cases of acute poisoning in adults who were admitted to emergency service over a 3-year period. Clinical charts were analyzed retrospectively for etiologic and demographic patient characteristics. A total of 810 adults were admitted to the emergency center with acute poisoning. The female-to-male ratio was 2:1. Mean ages of female and male patients were 28.8 +/- 12.9 years and 35.1 +/- 15.4 years, respectively, and many patients (46.9%) were between the ages of 16 and 25 years. Medicinal drugs were found to be the primary cause (60.5%) of poisoning, and tricyclic antidepressants were the most frequent causative agents (36.3%). Seasonal distribution of poisoning cases suggested a peak in the summer months (35.4%). Overall, 68.6% of acute poisonings were suicide attempts, and of these patients, 84.9%, 14%, and 1.1% were attempting suicide for the first, second, and third times, respectively. Among 810 cases of acute poisoning, 15 were fatal. The following conclusions were reached by investigators: (1) in the test region, younger females, especially single females, were at greater risk for poisoning than other patient groups, (2) self-poisoning cases constituted the majority of all poisonings, and (3) the main agents of self-poisoning were medicinal drugs, with antidepressants used most frequently. It was also found that unintentional poisoning commonly resulted from intake of foods, especially mushrooms.

AB Death is the most severe consequence of violence against women. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of violence-related deaths among women and the general characteristics of fatal violence cases against women in Istanbul, Turkey.
   A total of 20,486 forensic autopsies performed between 2006 and 2010, in Istanbul, were retrospectively analyzed. Of these, 537 violence-related deaths among women were included in the study. The victims were investigated in terms of sociodemographic characteristics, exposed type of violence, and autopsy findings.
   Out of all female deaths (n = 4165), 12.9% were due to violence against women, which comprised 2.6% of all autopsies (n = 20,456) performed during the study period in Istanbul. The median age of the victims was 43 years, and a significant proportion of victims (49.7%) were between the ages of 21 and 40 years. The deaths occurred most commonly in private residences (51.2%, n = 275), whereas the street was the crime scene for 14.5% (n = 78) of cases. Firearm injuries (50.1%, n = 269) were the most common cause of death, followed by stab wounds (28.3%, n = 152) and strangulation (8.4%, n = 45). Among the identified perpetrators, 52.3% were victims' spouses or boyfriends. The perpetrators were female in 4.4% (n = 16) of cases.
   Istanbul is the most important and cosmopolitan city of Turkey, representing the country's cultural characteristics. Therefore, the data obtained in this study may be strong indicators of violence against women in Turkey. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Our objective was to compare sociodemographic conditions and risky/health behaviors affecting Turkish or Middle Eastern versus ethnic Swedes and Finnish immigrant adolescents, respectively.
   All eligible adolescents 13-18 years old (3,216 pupils) in a medium-sized town in Sweden completed a validated in-depth questionnaire (Q90), with 165 questions.
   One hundred and one adolescents were Turkish or Middle Eastern immigrants, while 73 were immigrants from Finland, a neighboring country to Sweden. Turkish/Middle Eastern immigrants were more likely to attend a theoretical program in school, were rarely bullied, as compared to ethnic Swedes and Finns. Turkish/Middle Eastern girls used alcohol at a lower frequency, and reported less depression and sexual experiences than ethnic Swedish girls and Finns. A higher frequency of Finnish adolescents had been bullied and had vandalized, and Finnish adolescents were also determined to have used tobacco and cannabis and to be heavy drinkers more frequently than boys from Turkey/the Middle East.
   We concluded that adolescent immigrants from Turkey and the Middle East seem to be well adapted to Sweden and also have ambitions for a higher education. Differences in risky behaviors were particularly pronounced in comparisons with immigrants from Finland for both boys and girls.

AB The objective of this study is to define the etiological and demographical characteristics of the patients applying to the emergency department in Faculty of Medicine, Cukurova University because of poisoning. This retrospective study was carried out by examining the records of 491 people who applied to the main emergency department in Faculty of Medicine, Cukurova University, with the complaint of poisoning between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2004. It was determined that the reason why 491 of 20 817 persons (2.4%) applied during this term was because of poisoning: 159 (32.4%) of such patients were male and 332 of them (67.6%) were female. It was found that the average age of men was 27.1 +/- 10.5 years and that of women was 24.4 +/- 9.5 years (P = 0.005); 427 of poisoning cases (87.0%) happened intentionally as suicide attempts and 64 of them (13.0%) were accidental. The rate of suicide-purposed poisoning was higher in women and the rate of unintentional poisoning was higher in men (P +/- 0.001). The drugs were accountable for 71.1% of all poisoning cases and the pesticides were accountable for 18.9% of such cases. Poisonings increase during summers. The mortality rate in poisonings was found as 0.8%. The drugs and pesticides in Cukurova region constitute 90.0% of all poisoning cases. The mortality rate in poisoning will be decreased by training the physicians employed in the emergency department about poisoning by drugs and pesticides.

DE organophosphate; poisoning; injection, percutaneous; insecticides;
   suicide
AB Organophosphates are the most common group of chemicals in the southern part of Turkey. Although organophosphate poisoning (OPP) may occur due to skin exposure or inhalation, severe poisoning is usually the result of ingestion to attempt suicide. Despite the fact that there have been a lot of experimental studies using intravenous or percutaneous injection of organophosphates, reports of human poisoning due to percutaneous injection are rare. The systemic signs of OPP have not been described in these reported patients. We report 2 cases having systemic signs of OPP due to percutaneous injection. In our first case, we noticed a 17-day muscle weakness and a 12-day muscarinic syndrome, which required prolonged atropinization. In the second patient, atropine infusion had to be continued for 2 days. Both cases also had severe swelling of the affected limb and wound infection. In conclusion, in cases of percutaneous injection of organophosphates systemic toxicity may develop in addition to local findings such as necrosis and abscesses. Close observation for evidence of systemic involvement is required, and the patient should be carefully monitored for secondary abscess formation and any delayed impairment of neurologic function.

   Results: Between 2000 and 2005, 13823 legal cases (3.66% of all ED patients) were examined. and 58.23% of them were male. The mean age was 28.03 +/- 16.42 years. The main injury patterns were motor vehicle trauma (43.84%). physical assault (19.04%), suicide attempts (17.10%). and carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning (6.62%). Most of the cases were in the 20-29 years of age group (30.01%). Suicide attempts, CO poisoning and sexual assault victims were mostly female. 46.47% of the cases were admitted to the ED between 16:00 and 23:59. Forensic cases were mostly reported in May (9.92%). Two hundred and forty-two forensic cases died in the ED and 42 died outside the ED previously; 71.53% of them were male. The main cause of death was motor vehicle trauma (62.50%).
   Conclusions: Emergency physicians will face the challenges of addressing both medical and forensic needs of ED patients.

AB There is an ongoing debate on the definition of euthanasia and attempts to change laws about euthanasia and its practice in many countries. It is the medical doctors and the other health professionals who will elucidate the issue. Therefore, we performed this study to reveal attitude of Turkish health professionals toward euthanasia. This is an observational and cross-sectional study and data were collected with a questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed to 545 health professionals in Samsun, a city in the Black Sea Region in Turkey. Data were analyzed with SPSS package programs. Of all health professionals included in the study, 43.5% were medical doctors and 45.5% auxiliary health professionals. Of all participants, 33.6% did not object to euthanasia and 7.9% were asked to perform euthanasia. Eighty point seven percent of the participants noted that euthanasia could be abused even if a euthanasia law were passed. It can be concluded that the health professionals should have a chance to discuss euthanasia and that their attitude toward and their expectations and worries about euthanasia should be taken into account when a euthanasia law is drafted.

AB Women of Turkish descent in Germany show higher rates of suicidal behavior compared to their host populations and men of Turkish descent. This indicates a demand for a better understanding of suicidality in this group. Nine focus groups (N = 61) were conducted to assess explanatory models including patterns of distress, perceived causes, course/consequences of and reactions towards a suicidal crisis, help-seeking behavior, and potential intervention and prevention strategies. All participants were of Turkish descent living in Berlin, Germany. The focus groups included two with professionals such as psychiatrists or psychotherapists, two with Community Mothers, three with women from the community (ages: 18 -34, 35 -49, 50+), and of three suicide attempters (ages: 18 -33, 38 -66). Data were analyzed using the methodology of thematic analysis. Results show that suicide-related behaviors, attitudes, and help-seeking behavior have gender and culture-specific characteristics. Two central themes were identified: the impact of family and community and the impact of German society. Participants stated that they believe that family and community pressures as well as discrimination and lack of acceptance cause social isolation. Fear of stigmatization and dishonoring themselves or their family, as well as shame and self-stigma decrease the likelihood of reaching out for help. Recommended strategies are community and family interventions, promotion of integration and social inclusion, awareness campaigns to destigmatize suicidality and the use of mental health services, empowerment of women, as well as the improvement of cultural sensitivity and competency of services.

AB Introduction: With the legalization of active euthanasia in the Netherlands and Belgium in recent years, euthanasia has become a subject of discussion again. It is important that physicians, particularly oncologists express their opinion about euthanasia. The aim of this study was to reveal what pneumologists who worked in oncology clinics thought about euthanasia.
   Materials and Method: A questionnaire was distributed to 110 pneumologists and obtained data were analysed with SPSS.
   Results: The mean age of the pneumologists included in the study was 32.90 +/- 7.01 years. Of the pneumologists, 40.8% were against euthanasia and 46.7% believed that euthanasia was performed in Turkey although it was illegal. Thirty-one point five percent of the pneumologists working in oncology clinics and 14.3% of the pneumologists working in clinics other than oncology clinics faced euthanasia requests.
   Conclusion: The opinions of physicians taking care of terminally ill patients on euthanasia and patient rights are very important. Frequent requests for euthanasia and the physicians' belief that euthanasia is performed secretly in Turkey demonstrate that euthanasia should be discussed openly and attitude and approach towards euthanasia should be investigated.

AB Aim: This study was conducted to determine the biological effects of acute poisoning, the nature of agents involved and the pattern of poisoning in Diyarbakir City, in the Southeast Anatolian region of Turkey, during 2000. Method: Hospital records of all admissions to the Emergency Department (ED) of Dicle University Hospital following acute poisoning were revised and all data from January to December 2000 were analysed. The present study included 44 (25.9%) male (M) and 126 (74.1%) female (F), a total of 170 patients. The M/F ratio was 1.0/3.5. Results: The mean age of patients was 23.3 +/- 6.3 years; 63 (37.1%) of them were under 20 years of age and 147 (86.5%) were under 30 years of age. Most intoxication cases occurred during the summer season (93 of 170 patients). On a monthly basis, admissions during April, May and July were most common (24, 26 and 30 patients, respectively). Sixty-two (36.5%) cases involved accidental poisoning while 108 (63.5%) involved deliberate poisoning. In suicide attempts, intoxications were more common in females (77 cases, 71.3%, P < 0.05), and in unmarried persons (74 cases, 68.5%, P < 0.05). There were only two deaths (1.2%) among the 170 admissions of acute poisonings. One of the deaths was due to pesticide poisoning and the other was due to medical drug abuse. Tachycardia (59, 34.7%), vomiting (55, 32.4%) and loss of consciousness (42, 24.7%) were frequently observed, whereas hypersecretion (15, 8.8%), bradycardia (5, 2.9%), convulsion (8, 4.7%) and hypertension (2, 1.2%) were less frequent. Among pesticide poisoning cases the incidence of convulsion (6, 10.2%), miosis (6, 10.2%), and hypersecretion (12, 20.3%) were significantly higher when compared to other cases (P = 0.018, P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Conclusion: In the Southeast Anatolian region of Turkey, pesticide intoxication is common especially among young, unmarried females and most of these intoxications are intentional self-poisonings. The annual rate of poisoning-related ED visits and mortality were found to be within expected ranges; psychoactive agents being the most common cause.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of childhood abuse and neglect (CAN) in Turkish substance dependents and to investigate the relationship between CAN with axis I disorders, personality disorders and severity of depression and anxiety symptoms.
   Among 132 substance dependents, 56.1% met dichotomous criteria for some form of CAN. Current age was lower, whereas rate of suicide attempt, self-destructive behavior, divorce of parents, major depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), lifetime specific phobia and personality disorders were higher in patients with history of CAN. Severity of depression and anxiety symptoms were also higher in group with CAN and number of abuse type was correlated with depression and anxiety scores. Lifetime major depression, lifetime PTSD, suicide attempt, self-destructive behavior and divorce of parents predicted CAN.
   The high rate of CAN found among Turkish substance dependents suggests that special attention must be given to identify CAN in this group. Findings of this study showed that there is a relationship between history of CAN and some axis I disorders, personality disorders and severity of depression and anxiety symptoms.

ID SUICIDE; METABOLISM; BORN
AB Introduction: An increased incidence of suicides and suicidal behaviour among immigrants has been described in other countries. In Denmark, misuse of paracetamol is suspected in some foreign-born minority groups, although no data have been produced to substantiate this suspicion.
   Methodology. A retrospective study of the incidence of paracetamol poisoning in patients admitted to a specialised department of hepatology from 1994 to 1999 was carried our.
   Results: Of a total of 580 patients, 56 (9.7%; 95%-conridrnce interval 7.2-12.1%)were immigrants, among whom a significant overrepresentation was found of immigrants from Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, and Lebanon (Observed/ Expected-ratios of 1.95, 4.14, 2.67, and 2.45 respectively: p <0.05). The immigrants differed from the Danish-born patients being younger(21 vs 35 years of age; p<0.05), having a lower level of alcohol consumption (3% vs 30% with regular alcohol abuse; p<less than>0.05), and in general being less severely intoxicated (3% vs 22% developing hepatic encephalopathy; p<0.05). Compared to the Danish-born patients, the immigrants more frequently stated socio-economic problems as the reason for their self-poisoning (29% vs 10%; p<less than>0.05).
   Conclusions: The study demonstrates an overrepresentation of immigrants among patients admitted with paracetamol poisoning in Denmark.

ID RISK
AB Objective: Although several self-report tools measuring suicidal ideation are used in Turkey, the validity and reliability of the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSSI), an important tool administered clinically, has not yet been examined. We hope that establishing the validity and reliability of the BSSI can improve the detection of suicidal ideation.
   Methods: The sample for this study consisted of 120 individuals who participated voluntarily. One hundred of the 120 participants were administered related relevant instruments, the Beck Depression Inventory [BM], Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI], Beck Hopelessness Scale [BHS], and Suicidal Ideation Scale [SIS], to determine concurrent validity. Separately, two clinicians interviewed twenty different participants to assess inter-rater reliability. To assess internal consistency, Cronbach's alpha coefficients were computed. In addition, a principal component analysis with a Varimax rotation was performed to examine the test's factor structure.
   Results: Cronbach's alpha value was 0.84 and every item was positively correlated to the total scores on the BSSI. Inter-rater correlation was very strong and significant (r=0.94, p<0.01). Correlation coefficients for similar measures showed significant results [i.e., SIS (r=0.40) and BHS (r=0.58)]. There was a mild correlation between the BSSI and BDI (r=0.40) but no correlations were found with the BAI.
   Conclusion: The BSSI is a valid and reliable measure that has good potential to detect suicidal ideation and behavior in clinical settings when compared to other self-rating measures. These results suggest that measuring suicidal ideation and behaviors using the BSSI across different diagnoses may provide valuable information for clinical research.

AB Objective: Bullying, which has negative effects on teaching and learning environment in schools, may be associated with some psychiatric disorders causatively or consequentially. The purpose of this study was to examine the suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, and self-esteem in high school students with respect to their involvement in the cycle of bullying. Methods: The study was conducted in students of five secondary schools in a city in Turkey, who were selected with simple random sampling method. Peer Bullying Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, Coopersmith Self-Esteem Scale were applied. Results: The data obtained from students in 1173, which were fully completed, were analyzed. Bullying victims, bullies, and people in the bullying cycle have higher depressive symptoms, lower self-esteem, and higher suicide tendencies than non-victims, non-bullies and people not involved in the bullying cycle, respectively. Being bullied increases the suicide ideation risk with an odds ratio of 1.447 and bullying increases the suicide ideation risk with an odds ratio of 1.663. Age, female sex, low self-esteem, victimization, and bullying are factors that increase the score of depressive symptoms. Discussion: The individuals who are not involved in the bullying cycle have a lower rate of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, and a higher self-esteem. Although no causal connection can be established, the bullying, being a victim of bullying and involvement in the cycle of bullying are all associated with depression, suicidal ideation, and low self-esteem, which may indicate an impaired mental health status of these students. Therefore, this study reveals that there is a possible relationship between psychiatric disorders, suicidal ideation and bullying behavior.

AB Objective: The aim of this research was to assess the characteristics of the consultations required in a psychiatric department of a university hospital, and the distribution of psychiatric disorders in hospitalized patients and patients admitted to the emergency room. Method: In the study, the data of 539 patients 18 years or older (48.67 +/- 20.91 years) (46.8% women) who were hospitalized and who presented to the emergency room between 01/01/2015 and 31/12/2015, and for whom a psychiatric consultation was requested were recorded onto a structured form. Patients' electronic databases were reviewed retrospectively for the specified date range. Descriptive statistical analyzes (frequency of data, distribution, mean, standard deviation) were performed for the data examined in the study. Results: Medical departments (42.9%), surgical departments (31.7%) and the emergency medicine department (25.4%) were the most frequently psychiatric consultation requesting departments. The most frequent requests for consultation were agitation (15.4%), depressive symptoms and signs (14.7%) and suicide attempts (12.2%). The most frequent psychiatric diagnoses were depressive disorders (19.5%), delirium (18.2%) and schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders (7.4%). Musculoskeletal diseases (17.4%), mental disorders (15.0%), oncologic diseases (14.1%) and suicide attempts (12.2%) were the primary diagnoses of patients. Discussion: Consultation and liaison psychiatry services have an important role in our relationship with other departments in medicine. Priority to training of depressive disorders, delirium and suicide attempts should be offered to healthcare providers working in these departments.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze the predictive role of depressive symptoms and childhood psychological trauma on impulsive, self-injuring, and suicidal behaviors in groups diagnosed and not diagnosed (control group) with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Methods: The study sample included a diagnosis group (n1=72) that was followed by the psychiatry clinics of a university hospital and a public hospital in Istanbul, Turkey, along with a control group (n2=71) that included healthy volunteers who participated in the study. All study participants were evaluated using the Sociodemographic Information Form, Borderline Personality Inventory (BPI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Inventory of Statements about Self-injury (ISAS), and Suicide Behavior Questionnaire (SBQ). The study results were analyzed statistically. Findings: First, the hierarchical regression analysis revealed that the BDI and emotional abuse scores in the diagnosis group and the HAM-D in the control group were significant predictors based on the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. Secondly, the emotional abuse score in the diagnosis group and physical neglect and HAM-D score in the control group were significant predictors of self-injury behavior inventory scores. Thirdly, BDI and sexual abuse scores in the diagnosis group and the emotional and physical abuse scores in the control group were found to be the significant predictors of suicide behavior. Conclusion: Emotional and sexual abuse during childhood and depressive symptoms (BDI) were found to be significant risk factors in terms of impulsive, self-injury and suicidal behaviors in BPD.

AB In this study, the patients appealed to Emergency Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, University of Inonu, Malatya, Turkey because the acute drug poisoning in the period from 01/01/2008 to 31/12/2009 were evaluated retrospectively. Demographic features of the patients, the agent responsible for poisoning and hospitalization rates were assessed. In this aim, we evaluated 178 patients, ages ranged from 18 to 77.79 (44.4%) were men and 99 (55.6%) patients were women. The mean ages of male and female were found to be 32.2 +/- 12.2 and 31.3 +/- 12.0, respectively. 91(51.1%) patients were living in rural areas and 87 patients (48.9%) were living in urban centers. It was found that 156 (87.6%) of these patients had first poisoning whilst 19 (10.7%) patients experienced second poisoning event and 3 (1.7%) patients had third poisoning event. The type of the poisoning was ingestion of drugs for suicidal intent in 146 (82%) cases and accidental ingestion in 32 (18%) cases. Poisoning most commonly occurred as ingestion of multiple drugs. Seven patients (3.9%) were discharged from the emergency service (ED), while 132 patients (74.2%) were hospitalized in intensive care unit of anesthesiology and 39 patients (21.9%) in the department of internal medicine. Average duration of hospitalization of all patients was 3.46 +/- 2.22 days. Drugs poisoning occur most frequently as ingestion of multiple drugs in young individuals and female.

AB Background: Elderly persons with acute poisoning in the emergency department (ED) and prognostic factors of outcomes have not been well addressed in previous research. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of elderly patients with acute poisoning visiting the ED, and to identify the possible predictive factors of mortality.
   Methods: Patients aged 65 years with acute poisoning who visited the ED in Taipei Veterans General Hospital from January 1, 2006 through to September 30, 2008 were enrolled in the study. We collected demographic information on underlying diseases, initial presentations, causes and toxic substances, complications, dispositions, and outcomes. Analyses were conducted among different groups categorized according to age, suicide attempt, and outcome. Multiple logistic regression was applied to identify possible predictive clinical factors influencing mortality in the elderly with acute poisoning.
   Results: A total of 250 patients were enrolled in the study, with a mean age of 77 years and male predominance. The most common cause of intoxication was unintentional poisoning. Medication accounted for 57.6% of poisonous substances, of which benzodiazepine was the most common drug, followed by warfarin. The overall mortality rate was 9.6%. The average length of stay in the ED increased significantly in the old (65-74 years), very old (75-84 years) and extremely old (>= 85 years) groups. Suicide attempt patients experienced more complications including respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, hypotension and mortality. Three clinical predictive factors of mortality were identified: herbicide poisoning, hypotension and respiratory failure upon presentation.
   Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that elderly patients with acute poisoning had a mortality rate of 9.6%. Suicide attempts resulted in more serious complications. The risk factors for mortality were herbicide intoxication, hypotension and respiratory failure. [J Chin Med Assoc 2010;73(2):78-87]

AB This article evaluates the effects of terrorism on interventions into civil wars. Considering civil wars from 1970-1999, this study analyzes how the use of terrorism as a tactic affects external interventions on behalf of opposition groups, interventions on behalf of governments, and diplomatic interventions. While some authors would suggest that groups might utilize terrorism as a tactic to gain external support, this study finds little evidence that groups are actually successful in gaining such support. In fact, terrorism that targets civilians appears to actually decrease the likelihood of military interventions on behalf of opposition groups. Furthermore, in civil wars with high numbers of terrorist attacks there is a greater likelihood of economic intervention on behalf of governments, further weakening the potential benefit for groups in utilizing terrorism as a tactic. While this is certainly a welcome finding, a consideration of five case studies of suicide terrorism (Lebanon, Sri Lanka, Iraq, India, and Turkey) provides evidence that the use of suicide terrorism within civil wars may have decreased the likelihood of external interventions on behalf of the government and of diplomatic interventions. These results are more troubling and suggest potentially grave consequences for mediating many of these conflicts.

AB Background: Firearm related injuries continue to increase throughout the world and they become the first or second cause of mortality in worldwide. The present study aimed to determine the factors that affect mortality in firearm injuries.
   Methods: The patients which were admitted to emergency service between January 2011 and December 2015 due to firearm injuries, were reviewed from hospital records. The patients were evaluated in terms of their age, sex, event time, admission time, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Injury Severity Score (ISS), the reason of event, type of weapon, the region of the body that injured, department in which they were hospitalized, hospitalization duration and the relation between these parameters and mortality.
   Results: A total of 174 patients (86.8% male, 13.2% female) were identified. The mean age of patients was 35.2 years and 30 patients (17.2%) died. Among the cases, 137 were attempted homicide (78.7%), 23 were accidents and the remaining 14 were suicides. The suicidal cases had significantly higher mortality rate than other causes (P = 0.003). The most frequently used weapon was pistols (73.6%) and the events took place between 18.00 and 24.00 (36.2%) hours mainly. The injuries were mostly on extremities, however many of deaths were seen after head-neck injuries and the mortality rate of head and neck injuries was significantly higher than other regions (P < 0.001). The mean of hospitalization duration was 9.1 days and it was 10.2 +/- 11.7 days for survivors, 4 +/- 7.3 days for died subjects. The hospitalization duration of died patients was significantly shorter than survivors (P = 0.042). The GCS of died patients (4.4 +/- 1.7) was significantly lower than those of survivors (13.3 +/- 2.8) (P < 0.001). The ISS score of died patients (49.7 +/- 24.1) was significantly higher than those of survivors (13.6 +/- 10.6) (P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: It was determined that GCS, ISS, length of hospitalization, injuries due to suicide attempt, the department of hospitalization, injuries to head-neck regions affected mortality significantly.

AB BACKGROUND Electrical energy has gained wide acceptance since the middle of 20th century. Rapid progress of industrialization and widespread utilization of electrical appliances lead to many electrical accidents and deaths. Aim of our study was to analyze such injuries with a forensic perspective and to draw conclusions.
   METHODS
   Sixty-three death cases (59 males, 4 females; mean age 32.5 +/- 12.7; range 5 to 62 years) due to electrical current injury that underwent forensic autopsy between the years of 19962003 in Bursa city of Turkey were included into the study. Demographic features, origin of death, scene of the injury, localization of entry and exit lesions were examined.
   RESULTS
   The cases were most common in between 30-39 years of age and 93.7% were male. Sixty-three point five percent of the deaths were occupational accidents. Deaths occured usually in summer. Although homicidal and suicidal cases were rare in the literature, all of our cases were accidental in origin.
   CONCLUSION
   The physician who performs autopsy should be thoroughly informed about the place of death due to electrocution. It is necessary to solve infra-structural problems, increase security measures and provide training about prevention of electrical injuries.

Data has been extracted from a variety of sources, covering data from agencies from every step of the criminal justice process: Cause of death data, police, prosecution and adjudication data, and prison data. Time period covered included the last 20 years, however due to the lack of availability the time range was different for different types of data. It was found that all those types of data suffer from some limitations, and that it is very difficult to compare data from different sources. In particular, it was found that changes in what is counted and how, made it hard to identify trends over longer periods of time. Further, it was found that administrative decisions that determine how data are collected complicate interpretation and reduce the validity of data. Counting units are inconsistent across different sources making cross-checking problematic. Finally human error in data entry was found to reduce data reliability. Despite these drawbacks, an attempt is made to identify potential trends.

AB Aim. This study aimed at evaluating depression and suicidal ideation and coping strategies with stress in patients receiving haemodialysis replacement therapy.
   Background. Patients undergoing haemodialysis treatment may often experience depression and accompanying suicidal ideation. Coping strategies with depression-related suicidal ideation may require regular evaluation of the patient and the support of nurses.
   Design. A cross-sectional descriptive study.
   Method. The sample consisted of 92 adults with an age range of 19-65 who had chronic renal failure and consecutively admitted to the Dialysis Center of Kadikoy and Dialysis Center of Kahraman in Turkey. Four instruments were used: Socio-demographic Form, Beck Depression Inventory, Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire and Coping Strategies with Stress Inventory.
   Results. The points obtained from Beck Depression Inventory were above 17 (the cut-off point) in 40.2% of the patients. There were positive correlations between depression and Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire (r = 0.469, p = 0.001), between patients' age and depression (r = 0.43, p = 0.00) and suicidal ideation (r = 0.27, p = 0.01). Depression and behavioural disengagement had a positive correlation (p = 0.001, r = 0.410). Depression and suicidal ideation increased with lower education status (F = 7.42, p = 0.001; F = 4.51, p = 0.014).
   Conclusion. Haemodialysis patients frequently experience depression. This study demonstrated that suicidal ideation increased as the severity of depression increased. Depression and suicidal ideation were increasing with age in patients with chronic renal failure. Therefore, it is considered necessary for dialysis patients to be under regular psychiatric evaluation with risk assessment.
   Relevance to clinical practice. It is vitally important that nurses in dialysis centres evaluate the psychosocial conditions of patients with renal failure undergoing haemodialysis treatment so as to enhance the quality of nursing care. It is also fundamental for the success of holistic care that nurses properly assess the possibility of depression and suicide as well as coping strategies. This study sheds light on the holistic evaluations of dialysis patients.

AB Identifying risk factors is important in intervening in suicide, which is a preventable cause of death in adolescents. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of suicidal ideation and risk factors for suicidal thought in high school students aged 15-18 years.
   The data were obtained from questionnaire forms administered to 2438 high school students aged 15-18 years. Risk factors that might be associated with suicidal thought were identified using logistic regression analysis.
   The prevalence of suicidal ideation in adolescents in the last 12 months was 17.9%. Being female [OR 1.95, (CI 95% 1.47-2.59)], use of alcohol [OR 2.44, (CI 95% 1.63-3.68)] and addictive drugs [OR 1.78, (CI 95% 1.07-2.97)], being in physical fights [OR 1.76, (CI 95% 1.34-2.32)], having no close friends [OR 2.17, (CI 95% 1.34-3.52)], bullying(victimization) [OR 1.99, (CI 95% 1.43-2.77)], and other psychosocial distress were significant risk factors in the development of suicidal ideation.
   Solutions for decreasing risky behaviors for health, particularly the use of alcohol and addictive drugs, prevention of violence between peers, and strengthening of social relationships, must be developed.

AB Aim: Data on child maltreatment in Turkey would appear to be scarce. This manuscript aims to address the prevalence and severity of child maltreatment in Turkey.
   Materials and methods: We report on 215 cases at the Ministry of Health's Ankara Training and Research Hospital that were followed-up by the multidisciplinary Child Protection Team (CPT) between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2005. The data collected on subjects included characteristics of the victims and the perpetrators, family demographics, maltreatment types, medical findings, mortality rate, and outcomes for the victim and the perpetrator.
   Results: Age and gender distribution Of the victims were 6.8 +/- 5.8 years and 58.1% girls. The perpetrators in 53.0% of the cases were the fathers, in 18.6% the mothers, and others in 28.4%. The categories of maltreatment were neglect in 39.5% of cases, physical abuse in 29.8%, psychological abuse in 21.4%, and sexual abuse in 9.3%. One hundred twenty cases (55.3%) were efficiently followed-up by the regional Social Service Agency (SSA). Re-abuse was reported in 8.3% of them. Following initial investigation of the 84 perpetrators, who were reported to the Forensic Medicine Institution by the Police Department, 17.8% were acquitted, 11.9% were convicted, and no legal action was taken for the rest.
   Conclusion: The knowledge and experience of the physician are extremely important for the diagnosis of child abuse and neglect. This Study shows that a team approach to suspected cases of child abuse and neglect improves recognition and the reporting process.

We investigated the association among psychological symptoms, suicidal thoughts, perceptions of physical and mental health in university students. 4330 students at Onsekiz Mart University completed an internet-based questionnaire. 15.1% of the students reported suicidal thoughts at least once in their lifetime. The severity of mental symptoms was found to increase with a decrease in perceived physical and mental health. 28.2% of the students had depression, 33.1% had anxiety. This research aims to contribute to the extensive body of work done regarding the mental health, suicidal thoughts and hopelessness among university students.

AB This study presents 17 cases of hanging with some preventative measures, when compared with usual hanging fatalities, between 2002 and 2006 in the province of Konya, Turkey. We observed in 4 cases that the victim had only tied together their hands, whereas in I case both the hands (with a clothesline) and mouth (with a plastic bag) had been fastened. In a further case, the oral orifice had been closed using a scarf and in the remaining I I cases, soft materials such as a scarf, hood, the collar of a coat or shirt had been used as padding against the ligature loop. At first glance, the cases where the victim's hands and/or mouth were found tied were thought to be homicides. However, an investigation of the death scene, together with the autopsy findings and inquiry data, showed the cause of death was from suicide.
   Thus, in suicidal hanging cases certain precautions and preventative measures were observed. For example, tying the hands together was regarded as a means to make self-release impossible; closure of the oral orifice as a means to prevent the victim from calling out for help, and placing soft material against the ligature loop was thought to be an attempt to lessen the feeling of pain.

AB Cardiovascular medications (CVMs) are frequently prescribed for cardiovascular diseases. The unconscious use of cardiovascular drugs may lead to severe clinical manifestations, even to death, especially when in overdose. The objective of this study is to clarify the profile of CVM exposures admitted to Department of Emergency Medicine in Dokuz Eylul University Hospital (EMDEU) between 1993 and 2006. Case demographics, type of the medication, route and reason for exposure, clinical effects and outcome were recorded. Related to the CVM exposures, 105 poisoning cases were admitted. Mean age of children and adults were 12.8 +/- 1.0 and 30.1 +/- 1.8, respectively. Females were dominating (77.1%). Poisoning by accident occurred mainly among children in the 0-6 age group (64.3%) and suicide attempt was predominant in the 19-29 age group (47.8%). The most common ingested CVMs admitted to EMDEU were calcium channel blockers (19.7%), beta-blockers (17.3%), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics (11.8%). Most of the patients were asymptomatic (59.1%). Frequently observed symptom was altered consciousness (18.6%). Antihypertensive drugs are responsible for the most of the CVM exposures. Prospectively designed multi-centered studies are needed to reflect the epidemiological properties of cardiovascular drug exposures throughout our country and would be very valuable for the determination of preventive measures.

AB Corpses found in wells or lime pits must be identified and the cause and manner of death must be determined. There are several circumstances that may lead to the presence of corpses in wells. In this study, 3940 death examinations and autopsies, performed at the Konya Branch of Forensic Medicine Council (Turkey) between 2000 and 2007, were retrospectively investigated, and it was found that 18 (0.46%) of the bodies had been recovered from wells. The cases were evaluated in terms of their demographic features, manner of death (accidental, suicidal, or homicidal), autopsy findings, cause of death, and the characteristics of the wells in which they were found. The ages of the victims ranged from 4 to 74 years, and the average age was 40. 4 +/- 20.6 years. Of total, 16 cases were males and 2 were females. The manner of death was determined to be accidental in 10 of the cases, suicide in 6 of the cases, and homicide in the remaining 2 cases. In 7 of the cases, death had occurred as a result of drowning in water. A comprehensive scene investigation and autopsy must be performed for corpses recovered from wells and pits for both identification and determination of the cause and manner of death. Wells should be covered and kept closed at all times to reduce the number of accidental deaths resulting from falls into wells.

AB In this study, sociodemographic, laboratory, and clinical features of cases of organic phosphorus (OP) intoxication in the Southeast Anatolian region of Turkey were investigated. Patients with OP intoxication admitted to the Emergency Service of Dicle University Hospital in Diyarbakyir City between May and August 1998 were evaluated. This prospective cohort study included five male (M) and 19 female (F) consecutive patients. Five cases were accidental intoxication; however, 19 cases were suicide attempts. Mean age of cases was 24 11 years; 54.2% of them were under the age of 20 years and 83.3% of them were under the age of 30 years. The M/F ratio was 1.0/3.8. The cases of suicidal purposeful intoxications were mostly determined in singles (58.3%, P<0.05). Most of the cases had a primary education level (16, 66.7%) and a lower socioeconomic status (14,58.3%); 79.2% of cases admitted to our emergency service received atropine in primary health care centers. In emergency service, pralidoxime (PAM) was administered to only 29.2% of cases. According to ECG examination, tachycardia (14, 58.3%), ST changes (13, 54.2%), and T changes (3, 12.5%) were mostly seen; bradycardia and serious ventricular arrhythmias were not seen in any case. Patients who received atropine plus PAM had higher rates of arrhythmias, but this was not statistically significant (P>0.05). The most observed biochemical features of cases were leukocytosis (21 cases), hypokalemia (18 cases), and hyponatremia (4 cases). Other biochemical features were not evidently altered. In present cases, the most frequently seen symptoms and findings were vomiting (18, 75%), feeling faint (17, 70.8%), and tachycardia and dozing off (14, 58.3%). Serious ventricular arrhythmias were not observed, and in our region, OP intoxication especially affected young unmarried females, and most of them resulted from a suicidal purpose.

AB Objective: The aim of this prospective study was to analyze the rate and characteristics of acute poisoning cases admitted to adult intensive care unit (ICU).
   Methods: All cases of acute poisoning admitted to ICU of the Harran University Hospital, Turkey, between July 2002 and May 2005, were included in this study. Clinical, laboratory, and demographic characteristics, type of poison and patient's outcomes were recorded.
   Results: There were 86 poisoning cases among 844 patients admitted to the ICU. The mean age was 26 9 years and the majority of the patients (56.9%) were 1524 years of ages. Eighty percent of acute poisonings were self-inflicted and 65.2% of these patients were singles. Medical drugs overdose were the major cause (51.2%) of intoxication followed by agricultural chemicals (37.2%). The most frequently involved medicinal drugs were benzodiazepines, antidepressants and analgesics. Eleven patients in. pesticides-rodenticides and 9 patients in other medical drugs poisoning have required mechanical ventilation between 1-12 days. The duration of the intensive care stay was 6.4 +/- 4.3 days. Five cases (5.8%) with acute poisonings were fatal.
   Conclusion: There was a high rate of suicides attempt in young singles, predominantly female population. These data were the highest agricultural activity of the country that provide important information about the characteristics of poisoning at the city.

AB The term 'mobbing' is defined as antagonistic behaviors with unethical communication directed systematically at one individual by one or more individuals in the workplace. This cross-sectional and descriptive study was conducted for the purpose of determining the mobbing behaviors encountered by nursing school teaching staff in Turkey, its effect on them, and their responses to them. A large percentage (91%) of the nursing school employees who participated in this study reported that they had encountered mobbing behaviors in the institution where they work and 17% that they had been directly exposed to mobbing in the workplace. The academic staff who had been exposed to mobbing behaviors experienced various physiological, emotional and social reactions. They frequently 'worked harder and [were] more organized' and 'worked very carefully to avoid criticism' to escape from mobbing. In addition, 9% of the participants stated that they 'thought about suicide occasionally'.

AB Postpartum depression has been described as a thief that steals motherhood. It can result in tragedy and sometimes in headline-gripping maternal suicide or infanticide. Because one of the highest priorities for nursing is to continually advance the knowledge the underlies nursing practice, it is essential that we understand what nurse researchers have done to advance the knowledge base of postpartum depression. This integrative review is a two-part series for MCN that summarizes 141 postpartum depression studies conducted by nurse researchers from around the globe, including United States, Australia, Canada, China (Hong Kong, Taiwan), Finland, Iceland Sweden, Turkey, and Malaysia. Specific areas of postpartum depression to which nurse researchers have devoted their primary attention include epidemiology, risk factors, transcultural perspectives, instrument development, screening, interventions and mother-infant interactions.

AB Hopelessness can be defined as negative expectations for the future. In other words, it is the level of pessimism for future (Yenilmez, 2010: 307). One of the most important reasons for the failure at school (Yenilmez, 2010: 1), hopelessness causes many mental health problems as well. In particular, it is among the main reasons of suicide, which has been shown as a public health issue throughout the history. In our country, suicide's being dense especially between the ages of 15-24 and 25-34 (Ucan, 2005: 19) led the different disciplines to perform some research on the subject. The fact that participation in artistic activities is effective for socialization of the person, dismissing stress, expressing himself gave birth to the idea that studying the effect of need of receiving art education informally on the level of hopelessness is important for future findings. This study was conducted to determine the status of receiving informally art education needs of high school students, to determine whether there is a significant relationship between the levels of hopelessness and needs of receiving art education informally, and to detect whether their levels of hopelessness contain significant differences according to the needs of receiving art education informally. This study, conducted through relational scanning method, was carried out with high school students in a medium-sized city in eastern Turkey. The study population is composed of 6883 students attending general high school in the academic year 2011-2012. The study group is composed of 115 girls and 65 boys a total of 182 students attending general high school in the academic year 2011-2012. In order to measure the students' need of receiving art education informally, "Need of Receiving Art Education Informally Scale", developed by the researcher Taskesen, was used and in order to measure the levels of hopelessness, "Beck Hopelessness Scale" developed by Beck, Lester, Trexter (1974) and adapted to Turkey by Seber (1991), Durak (1993). For The data analysis, to compare the scores of the dependent variable of the sample, one-way ANOVA was used, which is one of the parametric tests. Personn correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationships between two variables. At the end of the ANOVA test, there was no significant difference in highs school students' level of hopelessness and also despite the negative correlation between the scores of receiving art education informally and level of hopelessness, there was significant association.

AB Current detailed information about the causes, management, and clinical course of acute childhood poisonings in Turkey is scarce. Therefore, we have conducted a descriptive study of children presenting with acute poisoning to the pediatric emergency department of Dicle University Hospital throughout an 8-month period. Two hundred unselected children with poisoning were evaluated in terms of clinical, epidemiological and socioeconomic aspects. The mean age of patients was 5.7 +/- 4.0 years. The majority of the patients (n = 108, 54%) were aged from 13 months to 4 years (P < 0.05). In majority of patients (66.5%, n = 133), poisonings were accidental. Intentional poisonings accounted for 3.5% (n = 7) and food poisoning accounted for 30% (n = 60) of all cases. The families had more than three children in 129 (97%) of accidentally poisoned and in seven (100%) of intentionally poisoned patients, six were girls and one was a boy. The parents of most patients were uneducated. Furthermore, more than two third of families had low level of income. In all, 171 patients (85.5%) were discharged after an observation period of 24 h. Four patients died. In conclusion, factors such as low educational level of parents, presence of more than three children in the family, and low income increase the incidence of childhood poisonings. The low educational level of girls increases the incidence of intentional poisoning.

AB Purpose: Child sexual abuse and sexual dating violence victimization are common problems that are known to have long-term negative consequences. This study aimed to compare the sociodemographic, abuse-related, and clinical features of female adolescents who were sexually abused by different perpetrators, and identify the factors associated with suicidality and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) in these cases.
   Patients and methods: Data of 254 sexually abused female adolescents between the ages of 12-18 years were evaluated. The cases were classified into three groups, namely "sexual dating violence", "incest", and "other child sexual abuse", according to the identity of the perpetrator. The three groups were compared in terms of sociodemographic, abuse-related, and clinical features.
   Results: Major depressive disorder was the most common psychiatric diagnosis, which was present in 44.9% of the cases. Among all victims, 25.6% had attempted suicide, 52.0% had suicidal ideation, and 23.6% had NSSI during the postabuse period. A logistic regression analysis revealed that attempted suicide was predicted by dating violence victimization (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.053; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.473, 6.330) and depression (AOR = 2.238; 95% CI = 1.226, 4.086). Dating violence victimization was also the strongest predictor of subsequent suicidal ideation (AOR = 3.500; 95% CI = 1.817, 6.741). In addition, revictimization was determined to be an important risk factor for both suicidal ideation (AOR = 2.897; 95% CI = 1.276, 6.574) and NSSI (AOR = 3.847; 95% CI = 1.899, 7.794).
   Conclusion: Perpetrator identity and revictimization are associated with negative mental health outcomes in sexually victimized female adolescents. Increased risk of suicidality and NSSI should be borne in mind while assessing cases with dating violence and revictimization histories, in particular.

Patient demographics, type of the pesticide, distribution according to month and year, route and reason for exposure, clinical effects and outcome were analyzed from 25,572 poisoning calls. Pesticide intoxications accounted for 8.8% of the poisonings. with 80.3% insecticides and 19.7% rodenticides. The majority of poisonings ranged from 0 to 6y (28.2%) and 19-29y (23.2%). Half the accidental exposures (57.7%) were in the 0-6-y group; the attempted suicide was predominant in the 19-29y group (39.8%). Most were intoxicated with organophosphates (47.6%); 54.1% did not develop signs and symptoms of toxicity. Fatality due to pesticide poisoning was 0.4%. Preventive education against pesticide poisoning is needed.

AB Electrical burns are responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality, and are usually preventable with simple safety measures. We conducted a retrospective Study of non-lightening electrocution deaths in Diyarbakir, Turkey between 1996 and 2002. All 123 deaths investigated were accidental. The age range was 2 to 63 years with a mean age of 20.7 +/- 15.3 years. Eighty-six victims (69.9%) were male. The Upper extremity was the most frequently involved contact site in 96 deaths (48%). No electrical burn mark was present in 14 (11.4%) cases. Home accidents were responsible for 56 cases deaths (45.5%). Deaths were caused most frequently by touching an electrical wire (52 cases, 42.3%). There was an increase in electrocution deaths in the summer (47 cases, 38.2%). One hundred one cases (82.1%) were dead oil arrival at hospital. The unique findings of our Study include younger age (0-10 years) of victims (39 cases, 31.7%) and a means of electrocution (electrical water heaters in bathroom) in 23 cases (18.7%). Rate of deaths due to electrocution among all medicolegal deaths was found higher in Out,Study than in previous Studies. The public Should be educated to prevent children to play near electrical appliances and to avoid electrical heaters in the bathroom.

AB Background: Organophosphate (OP) compounds are used as insecticides. Given the widespread availability and use of these chemicals, OP poisoning is quite common following either accidental or intentional exposures. Immediate intensive care management can save lives in these patients. We aimed to investigate intensive care management provided to OP poisoning patients in a tertiary care hospital in Turkey. Subjects and Methods: This was a retrospective chart review of 62 patients, admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with OP poisoning between 2000 and 2012. Results: Of the 62 patients studied, 40 (65%) were male, 45 (73%) were suicide attempts, 59 (95%) ingested the OP compounds, and three patients (5%) (two patients with suicide and 1 with accidental exposure) died in the ICU. There were statistically significant differences between survivors and nonsurvivors for Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission (P = 0.034), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score (P = 0.003), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (P = 0.024), time to initiation of treatment (P = 0.034) and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (P = 0.007). Conclusions: Organophosphate poisoning is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate diagnosis and management. GCS, APACHE II score, SOFA score, and time to admission to the emergency department and LDH levels can provide prognostic information and predict outcomes.

AB Injuries are the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in adolescents and can be grouped as unintentional (such as motor vehicle crashes and fires) and intentional (violence and suicide). The aim of this study was to find the prevalence of high risk behaviors related to violence in high school students. The population comprised 2,480 randomly selected students from 10 schools among 46,271 students front 72 high schools in 1999-2000 in Adana and 2,352 (94.8%) were reached. They completed a Youth Risk Behavior Survey Questionnaire (YRBSQ). The mean age was 16.5 +/- 1 (14-21) years. 275 (11.7%) students stated that they carried a knife Or a sharp weapon during the last 30 days, 151 (6.4%) carried a gun, 710 (30.2%)participated in a physical fight, 68 (2.9%) were threatened or injured by a weapon, 73 (3.1%) could not attend school because of threats from other students, 96 (4.1%) were forced into sexual intercourse. Male students were significantly more likely than female students to report all types of high risk behaviors except forced sexual intercourse. The rate of risky behaviors increased with higher grade. Violence towards and by adolescents is a severe problem. Families, teachers, and health care professionals should be aware of risk factors and be active in prevention of high risk behaviors in youth.

AB Terror attacks have been progressively increasing worldwide through the present era. The management of the consequences of terrorism events is under debate in almost every scientific area. The organization and advancement of health services constitute important components of the crisis management. Similar to other specialty areas in medicine, the medical management of terrorist attacks is becoming important in terms of plastic and reconstructive surgery. Ankara, the capital of Turkey, has been subject to 2 terrorist events in public places within a year. The total number of patients involved in both cases was 434. Ankara Numune Training and Research Hospital is a tertiary health care institution and one of the most important trauma centers in the region. A total of 178 Patients exposed to these events referred to our hospital. Of the total, 34 patients were completely or partially treated in the plastic and reconstructive surgery clinic. In this study, we tried to discuss the difficulties encountered in the classification of patients and plastic surgery during the treatment period of patients who experienced these attacks. Data were obtained from The National News Agency, hospital, and our own clinic registries. Patient classification was based on the injured parts of the body. Statistical analysis was performed for all data. In conclusion, the role and the importance of plastic surgery department especially in trauma management have been emphasized in the light of our findings.

AB Since they are available in open markets and pharmacies, pesticides have been widely used all over the country. (Un) intentional poisoning with these compounds is one of the most common causes of chemical poisoning, especially in rural agricultural areas. Pesticide poisonings reported by various countries showed that it is a worldwide health problem with 250 000-370 000 associated deaths each year.
   In this study, medico-legal deaths between the years 2001 and 2011 in Ankara and nearby cities in Turkey were investigated retrospectively. The autopsies were partly carried out by Ankara Branch of Council of Forensic Medicine. Data were collected from reports of the Morgue Department whose toxicological analyses were performed in the Chemistry Department. The data revealed that 70 cases out of 10 720 autopsied ones had been attributed to fatal pesticide poisoning. The age range was 1-80 years (mean +/- SD, 41.33 +/- 17.42 years). Most of the cases (60%) were reported from Ankara. Insecticides were the most common (94%) cause of fatal pesticide poisonings, most of them (63%) being organophosphate insecticides. The percentages of pesticide-induced deaths are quite high in our society and should therefore not be underestimated. Accordingly, intensive efforts to reduce occupational and intentional pesticide poisonings are urgently needed in Ankara and nearby cities.

AB Background: The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of gender and childhood abuse on non-suicidal self-injurious (NSSI) behaviors among university students in Turkey.
   Subjects and methods: In this study convenience sampling technique was used, the sample consisted of 1000 young adults who were from the eight universities in two big cities; Istanbul and Ankara. Besides with demographic questionnaire, Inventory of Statements about Self-Injury and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire were used.
   Results: The prevalence of NSSI was 28.5% and the most prevalent three self-injurious behaviors were wound picking, banging/hitting and pinching self. There was not a gender difference in NSSI behavior frequency but in the type of behavior; males had significantly higher percentages of hitting and burning behavior. Examining the intrapsychic and interpersonal functions of NSSI, "affect regulation" and "toughness" functions were the most used ones among the participants. In terms of gender differences, "revenge" function was used by females more than males. Self-injurers had higher childhood abuse scores on sexual, physical, and emotional abuse and neglect subscales than non self-injurers, and males were significantly more abused than females.
   Conclusions: Accepting childhood abuse as an important predictor of NSSI behavior, screening and assessment of abused children and adolescents can help to prevent the onset of the behavior.

AB Poisoning is a major problem worldwide among children. Nonetheless, the offending agent, the associated morbidity and mortality vary from place to place and show changes over a period of time. The aim of this study was to investigate the medico-legal paediatric autopsies of childhood poisonings in the Eastern Black Sea Region of Turkey. Reports of autopsies performed between 2009 and 2013 in the Morgue Department of the Council of Forensic Medicine. All medico-legal paediatric autopsies in Trabzon (n:1049) were retrospectively examined. The study comprised an investigation into 62 deaths from poisoning in children aged 0-18 years. The parameters of age, sex, toxic substance category and origin were evaluated. Poisoning accounted for 5.9% of the deaths of children aged 0-18 years. Of the 62 cases, 32 (51.6%) were male and 30 (48.4%) were female, giving a female to male ratio of 1/1.1. The primary causes of fatal poisoning in children were carbon monoxide (64.5%, n = 40), followed by drugs (16.1%, n = 10), insecticides (9.7%, n = 6), mushrooms (6.5%, n = 4), and snake venom (3.2%, n = 2). The results of this study implicated carbon monoxide poisoning as a serious risk factor for mortality in our region. Childhood poisoning may be prevented by public education and simple precautions in general. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Criminal death incidence of women varies between developed and developing countries, and it has become a common public problem in almost every country. We do not have any data about femicide cases published in Turkey until today. In our study, we tried to call attention to femicide cases. In our study, we evaluated 141 cases of female homicides with an interval of 10 years between January 1996 and May 2005, retrospectively. Data retrieved were statistically evaluated using chi-square test. Most of the cases were between 21 and 35 years of age. Spouse murders are usually witnessed during the process of divorce. Establishment of institutions which will ensure the security of women during this period is of paramount importance. If we protect women during divorce and separation proceedings, we can prevent femicide cases. We also think that laws may be strengthened for protecting women who are vulnerable at such times.

AB One of the major purposes of palliative sedation is to reduce demand for euthanasia. The present paper analyzes a grievous case which demonstrates the killing of a 23-year-old son by his father due to the son's unbearable pain resulting from metastatic colorectal cancer. The article aimed to elaborate the case to figure out whether palliative sedation can be an alternative to euthanasia in a Muslim country. Nevertheless, the analysis of these two end-of-life issues revealed that the limitation of palliative sedation to an expected lifespan of less than 2 weeks as well as the Islamic view on the importance of protecting consciousness preclude reaching a conclusion that palliative sedation can be an alternative to euthanasia in this particular case. Furthermore, in such cases, the primary problem may be the lack of adequate and appropriate palliative care services, rather than the need for euthanasia or palliative sedation.

AB The current study is based on a retrospective investigation of firearm deaths in Diyarbakir, which were autopsied by the Diyarbakir Branch of the Council of Forensic Medicine during the 6- year period. Four hundred-forty four deaths were investigated from January 1996 through December 2001, including homicide (296 cases, 66.7%), suicide (120 cases, 27%) and accidental shootings (28 cases, 6.3%). The age range of all firearm deaths in the study period was 5 to 75 years with a median age of 29.8 years. The majority were in the groups aged 16-25 years (38.7%). In the homicide group, 248 subjects (83.8%) were male, and 48 (16.2%) were female. The 31.1% of the homicide victims were in the group aged at 20-30 years. Of the 120 suicide victims, 56 (46.7%) were in the group aged 1620 years. The head was by far the favoured site, accounting for 82 (68.3%) deaths: entry wounds in the right temple accounted for 72 of these. Twenty-eight cases were accidental shootings and 18 of them were male (64.3%). Twelve of the 28 accidental victims (42.9%) were in the group aged 0-10 years. The eight cases were due to their own accidental shootings, and the remaining 20 cases were shot by others. Our findings show that the contributing factors for increasing death by firearm are terrorists' activities, traditional habits of obtaining and using guns and blood feuds.

AB According to World Health Organization, the life expectancy at birth is increasing. An increase in life expectancy might result in increased morbidity and mortality in elderly. The increase in the elderly population also leads to an increase in medico-legal problems, as well. Autopsy is of high importance for determination of cause of death in clinical and forensic cases. The purpose of this study was to find out general characteristics elderly deaths by examining forensic autopsy records.
   Out of 7033 forensic autopsies performed between years of 2007 and 2011, 1324 were elderly deaths and were included in the scope of the study. The records of public prosecutor office, crime scene investigation and autopsy findings were examined.
   The majority of victims (70.6%) were male, while 29.4% were female, with a male to female ratio of 2.4/1. Victims' ages ranged between 65 and 96 years, and the mean age was 74.8 years. A great number of presented elderly deaths were due to unnatural causes, followed by natural deaths cases. Out of unnatural deaths, 63.2% were related to accidents, 23.7% were suicides, and remaining 13.1% were homicides. More than half (56.6%) of all suicidal deaths were due to hanging. Of natural deaths, the majority (82.7%) were due to cardiovascular system disease.
   In the presented series the cause of death was determined in 90.9% of all elderly deaths, which validates the need for a forensic autopsy. Data obtained through autopsy procedures is of high importance for death statistics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the trends in acute adult poisoning data during ten years in university emergency department and determine the factors of hazardous outcome such as severe clinical status, prolonged hospital stay and mortality.
   Material and methods: Medical records of 4569 poisoned patients admitted to Emergency Department (ED) of Cukurova University, School of Medicine in Adana.
   Results: The mean age of 2988 females (65.4% of the patients) was 24.5 +/- 10.1 years, whilst the mean age of 1581 male patients (34.6%) was 29.5 +/- 13.2 years (p=0.001). Of the poisonings 80.0% were suicidal; 69.4% of the women and 30.6% of the men committed suicide. The most common types of poisonings were ingestion of drugs (58.4%), organophosphates (23.9%) corrosives (3.4%), mushrooms (1.7%), methanol (2.4%), carbon monoxide (2.1%) and unknown (8.1%). Of the total 96.0% were discharged from emergency department, 1.4% transferred to IC and 2.6% died.
   Conclusions: Young people and women are high-risk groups for acute poisoning and drug poisoning was found to be the most common type of poisoning. The poisoning by psychoactive drugs is increasinging in the recent years and organophosphates poisoning seems to be still a serious problem in such an agricultural area. However, while the ratios of prolonged hospitalization and mortality are decreasing, suicidal poisoning is seriously increasing (Tab. 4, Fig. 2, Ref. 34). Full Text (Free, PDF) www.bmj.sk.

ID EMERGENCY VISITS; CHILDREN; PATTERN
AB Background: We aimed to define the epidemiological characteristics of poisoning cases in children that have occurred in Antalya, a major city in the Mediterranean.
   Methods: The hospital records of children between the ages of 0 to 17 yr admitted to the Pediatric Emergency Department of Antalya Training and Research Hospital, Antalya, Turkey due to poisoning in a 6-year period from 2012-2017 were evaluated.
   Results: Overall, 1507 poisoning cases were included in the study, of which 56% were female and 44% were male. Of them, 55% were between the ages of 0 and 5 yr, 10% were between 6 and 12, and 35% were between 13 and 17 year. In the 0-5 yr group, the poisonings were mostly in boys (55.1%) and were all accidental, while in children above 13, the poisonings were mostly in girls (77.8%) and suicide-related (97.1%). The poisonings were due to medication (64.5%) and chemical substances (35.5%). Among medication poisonings, the most common agents were paracetamol (18.0%), NSAID (15.2%) and antibiotics (8.0%). The most frequent chemical substances leading to poisoning were caustic/corrosive chemicals (22.8%) pesticides (8.0%). Interventions most commonly administered were activated charcoal (60.9%), gastric lavage (38.6%) and naso-gastric catheter (36.6%). Mortality was observed in 2 cases during six years.
   Conclusion: Knowledge on epidemiological and clinical features of poisoning in children according to age groups, establishing drug and chemical substance safety for children, and widespread parent education shall help decreasing childhood poisoning.

AB This paper provides a database representing injury mortality in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, with the aim of establishing a system which will record information about the incidence of such deaths, identify new trends and give priority to violence prevention. The retrospective study was carried out on 64 fatalities from gunfire injuries at the Forensic Medicine Centre in Dammam, Saudi Arabia during the period from January 2002 - December 2006. The deaths included 55 cases of homicide, seven cases of suicide and two accidental shootings. Twenty-six victims were aged between 16-30 years and 24 victims were between 31-45 years. Fifty-nine of the cases were male.
   A handgun was the weapon used in 49 cases. The most common sites for the firearm entrance wounds were the head (45 cases) and the chest (35 cases). In the majority of cases (56.3%) a single shot was fired while in 15.6% of cases there were two shots. In 51.5% of cases no bullet was recovered from the body while a single bullet was recovered in 31.5% and two bullets in 6.2% of the cases.
   Distant range fire was observed in 65.6% of cases. Exit wounds were found on the head in 36.7% and on the chest in 28.7% of cases.
   The majority of victims were young males living in urban areas. This result should help in forming a strategy to improve the livelihoods of this group. The low incidence of alcohol abuse (one case, 1.56%) and only three cases (4.68%) of amphetamine abuse is significant.

In this article, all research publications related to psychological and traumatic consequences of earthquakes on affected population samples in the cities of Athens, Thessaloniki, Kalamata, and Aegion over the last 40 years are reviewed. Significant magnitudes of prevalence in anxiety and depressive symptomatology levels were recorded in the studies under review. The majority of individuals were found also to have developed acute stress reactions and posttraumatic stress disorder. These subjects were more vulnerable due to previous psychopathology or because they have been exposed to serious material losses. A decrease in suicide attempts following the Athens earthquake of 1981 and an increase in the incidence of fatal health attack mortality were also observed. Some methodological and ethical issues were noted, such as the time pressure for the completion of surveys during the acute social disruption followed by limited psychological support.

AB Objectives: This study aimed to determine the epidemiological differences between children and adult oral exposures in patients admitted to the busiest emergency department (ED) in the Eastern Anatolia region of Turkey.
   Methods: The characteristics of 1950 patients were investigated retrospectively and in a cross-sectional manner in a two-year period.
   Results: The ratio of poisoning exposures among all emergency admissions was 0.6 %. Of these, 44.5 % were children, and 54.4% were unintentional. The mortality rate was 0.1 % and the rate of hospitalization was 14.9%. Among the children and adults, 50.3 % and 29.5 % were male, respectively. While the first two causes of exposures in both children and adults were licit drugs and foods, there were differences in other causes. Among causes, licit drugs and corrosive materials constituted the forefront in the 0-1 and 1-5-year age groups. In parasuicidal causes, the most common exposure was found to be licit drugs, followed by organophosphates. The most common cause of hospitalization was plants (60.5 %). The hospitalization rate was found to be significantly high in males and unintentional exposures. The rate of admissions to the psychiatry polyclinic following exposure was 15 %.
   Conclusion: This study hereby presents the original findings as to predict the problems in exposures. The distribution of etiological agents and suicidal intent rate may differ among pediatric and adult population (Tab. 4, Fig. 1, Ref. 50). Full Text in free PDF www.bmj.sk.

DE Organophosphates; Poisoning; Intensive care unit; Mortality; Toxicity
AB Background: Organophosphates (OP) are frequently used as pesticides around the world in agriculture. Exposures to OP cause a significant number of poisonings each year and lead to deaths. Acute toxicity manifests as cholinergic crisis with glandular secretions, myasthenic-like syndrome, peripheral neuropathies, neuropsychiatric abnormalities, extrapyramidal disorders, altered mental status, and weakness. Summary: After Institutional Review Board approval, this retrospective study was performed by evaluating the hospital records of patients admitted to an intensive care unit with acute OP poisonings. Data regarding age, gender, duration of hospitalization, severity, complications, and outcome of the patients were recorded. The data were presented as mean +/- standard deviation, analyzed with SPSS software. A total of 47 patients were included in the study of whom 70.2% were female and 29.8% were male. Mean age of the patients was 25.8 years. The reason for poisoning was suicide in 80.9% and accident in 19.1%. Mean intensive care unit stay was 5.9 days. The mortality rate was 12.8%. Key Messages: Our study contributes substantial information regarding the epidemiology and outcomes of acute OP poisonings in a tertiary care training hospital in a rural area; its relatively small sample size and its being a retrospective record-based study are limitations of the study. There is a need for future studies to reveal the underlying factors responsible for acute OP poisonings in Turkey and accordingly to solve these problems and thereby reduce the incidence of acute OP cases.

AB Objective: Borderline personality disorder is a psychiatric condition, which is characterized by unstable interpersonal relationships, fear of abandonment, difficulties in regulating emotions, feeling of emptiness, chronic dysphoria and depression, and impulsivity and increased risk-taking behaviors. In this present study, we aimed to translate and establish psychometric properties and factorial validity of the Borderline Personality Questionnaire (BPQ) in a representative Turkish university students sample and obtain normative data for future epidemiological and clinical studies in Turkey.
   Methods: Participants were 306 (201 females, 105 males) college students at the Hasan Kalyoncu University in Gaziantep, Turkey. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hasan Kalyoncu University. Sociodemographic information of the participants was collected and Turkish BEST, Turkish BPQ, BDI, PBQ, and State-Trait Anxiety scales were administered. All variables were screened for the accuracy of data entry, missing values, and homoscedasticity using SPSS version 23 for Windows.
   Results: The Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the Turkish BPQ were ranging from 0.46 to 0.81. The lowest alpha coefficient was observed for the Abandonment (0.46). For the whole scale, Cronbach's alpha coefficient was found to be 0.89. The test-retest (at after 1 month) correlation coefficients for Impulsivity, Affective Instability, Abandonment, Relationships, Self-Image, Suicide/Self-Mutilation, Emptiness, Intense Anger, and Quasi-Psychotic States were found to be 0.50, 0.77, 0.40, 0.68, 0.72, 0.48, 0.73, 0.74, and 0.62, respectively. A positive and statistically significant correlation was found between the Turkish BPQ and BEST (r = 0.337, p < .01), BDI (r = 0.375, p < .01), PBQ (r = 0. 322, r < 0.01), State Anxiety (r = 0.299, p < .01), and Trait Anxiety (r = 0.306, p < .01) scales. Principal axis factor analyzes with Promax rotation were performed and two-factor solution that accounted for 50.03% of the variance observed.
   Conclusions: Our results suggested that Turkish BPQ was a valid and reliable tool with a robust factorial structure to use in clinical population in Turkey.

AB The aim of our study was to investigate the etiological and demographical characteristics of acute adult poisoning cases admitted to a university hospital in Tabriz, Iran. This retrospective study was performed on 1342 poisoning admissions to a university hospital from 2003 to 2005, by data collection from the medical records of patients. Poisonings were 5.40% of the total admissions. There was a predominance of female patients (55.7%) compared to male patients (44.3%) with a female-to-male ratio of 1.2:1. Most poisonings occurred in the age range of 11-20 years (38.9%). Drugs were the most common cause of poisonings (60.8%). Among the drug poisonings, benzodiazepines (40.31%) were the most frequent agents, followed by antidepressants (31.98%). The seasonal distribution in poisoning patients suggested a peak in spring (28%) and summer (27.5%). In 9.8% of cases accidental and in 90.2% intentional poisonings were evident. Most suicide attempts were made by women (58.51%) and unmarried people (51.4%). The mean duration of hospitalization was 3.02 +/- 2.8 days. There were 28 (2.3%) deaths; the majority (13 cases) was due to pesticides. This was a university hospital-based study, so these results may not be representative of the general population. Despite this drawback, these data still provide important information on the characteristics of the poisoning in this part of Iran. To prevent such poisonings, the community education about the danger of central nervous system-acting drugs and reducing the exposure period of people to pesticides are recommended.

AB Objective: We aimed to evaluate demographic, etiological, clinical features, and prognosis of poisoning cases applied to a tertiary emergency department retrospectively. Materials and Methods: The recordings of poisoning cases aged 18 years old and over which applied to the department of emergency medicine between the dates of 2010-2015 were examined. Age, gender, admission date, amount of time passed since exposure to the poisonous substance, application method, cause of poisoning, laboratory findings at arrival, vital signs, type of poisonous substance, the way of taking, treatment method in urgent care, consultation need, and the outcome of cases were recorded. Results: Of the poisoning cases, 437 (52.1%) were female, and 402 (47.9%) were male. The mean age was calculated as 33.50. When the cause of poisonings are examined; 456 patients were found to be poisoned by a suicide attempt, 350 were accidentally poisoned, and 33 were poisoned by treatment complication. As the causing substance of poisoning, medicinal drugs were found in 465 cases (55.4%), carbon monoxide in 205 cases (24.4%), and narcotics in 119 cases (14.2%). Of medicinal drug poisonings, 221 (46.8%) were multiple drug intake. It was seen that 46.6% of the patients were kept under observation with only symptomatic treatment while nasogastric lavage and activated charcoal were applied in 40.2% of them. Conclusion: It can be suggested that poisonings are encountered more commonly in young people, especially in women, with medicinal drugs and for suicidal purposes. Drugs detected at high rates in poisonings, such as painkillers and antidepressants, should be used more cautiously.

AB Objective To evaluate the association between adverse childhood experiences e.g. abuse, neglect, domestic violence and parental separation, substance use, mental illness or incarceration and the health of young adults in eight eastern European countries.
   Methods Between 2010 and 2013, adverse childhood experience surveys were undertaken in Albania, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, Romania, the Russian Federation, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey. There were 10 696 respondents 59.7% female - aged 18-25 years. Multivariate modelling was used to investigate the relationships between adverse childhood experiences and health-harming behaviours in early adulthood including substance use, physical inactivity and attempted suicide.
   Findings Over half of the respondents reported at least one adverse childhdod experience. Having one adverse childhood experience increased the probability of having other adverse childhood experiences. The number of adverse childhood experiences was positively correlated with subsequent reports of health-harming behaviours. Compared with those Who reported no adverse experiences, respondents who reported at least four adverse childhood experiences were at significantly increased risk of many health-harming behaviours, with odds ratios varying from 1.68 (95% confidence interval, Cl: 1.32-2.15) - for physical inactivity - to 48.53 (95% CI: 31.98-76.65) - for attempted suicide. Modelling indicated that prevention of adverse childhood experiences would substantially reduce the occurrence of many health-harming behaviours within the study population.
   Conclusion Our results indicate that individuals who do not develop health-harming behaviours are more likely to have experienced safe, nurturing childhoods. Evidence-based programmes to improve parenting and support child development need large-scale deployment in eastern European.

AB Objective: To determine the prevalence of dissociative disorders among inpatients with alcohol or drug dependency.
   Method: The Dissociative Experiences Scale. was used to screen 215 consecutive inpatients admitted to the dependency treatment center of a large mental hospital over a 1-year period (March 1, 2003, to March 31, 2004). Patients who had scores of 30.0 or above were compared with patients who scored below 10.0 on the scale. The patients in both groups were then evaluated using the Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders. The interviewers were blind to the Dissociative Experiences Scale scores.
   Results: Of the patients, 36.7% had a Dissociative Experiences Scale score of 30.0 or above. The prevalence of DSM-IV dissociative disorders was 17.2% (N = 37). On average, 64.9% of these patients' dissociative experiences had started 3.6 years (SD = 2.9; range, 1.0- 11.0 years) before onset of the substance use. Patients with dissociative disorders were younger, and the mean duration of their remission periods was shorter. Dissociative disorder patients tended to use more than I substance, and drugs were used more frequently than alcohol in this group. The frequency of borderline personality disorder, somatization disorder, history of suicide attempt, and childhood abuse and neglect occurred more frequently in the dissociative disorder group than in the nondissociative disorder group. History of suicide attempt (p = .005), female sex (p = .050), and childhood emotional abuse (p = .010) were significant predictors of a dissociative disorder diagnosis. Significantly more patients with dissociative disorders stopped their treatment prematurely (p < .001).
   Conclusion: Impact of dissociative disorders on development and treatment of substance dependency requires further study.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of lifetime anxiety disorders in bipolar I patients in Sanliurfa, Turkey, and to assess the association between comorbidity and several demographic and clinical variables. Seventy bipolar I patients in remission were assessed by means of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV axis I Disorders-Clinician Version (SCID-I-CV), Anxiety Disorder Module in order to detect lifetime comorbid anxiety disorders. Nineteen (27.1%) bipolar I patients were diagnosed with at least one lifetime comorbid anxiety disorder. The most common anxiety disorders in this sample were obsessive compulsive disorder (12.8%) and specific phobia (12.8%), followed by panic disorder (5.7%). Anxiety disorder comorbidity appears to be associated with greater number of hospitalizations, psychotic symptoms and suicide attempts in patients with bipolar I disorder. As comorbidity has a clear impact on the course of bipolar patients, special attention to this issue should be paid when interviewing bipolar patients.

AB This research aimed to reveal the relationship between self-harm behaviour, body image, and self-esteem, and examined whether there was a difference between the body image and self-esteem of the adolescents who exhibited self-harm behaviour and those who did not. The study was conducted with the participation of 263 high school students 143 females (54.3%) and 120 males (45.6%) who studied in various high schools in the Trabzon province, Turkey. The students' ages ranged from 15 to 18; the mean age was 17.02 (SD = 1.59). The research was conducted using the Inventory of Statements about Self-Injury, the Body Perception Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and a personal information form. The research concluded that there was a significant relationship between body image and self-esteem of the adolescents, and that body image and self-esteem were the significant regressors of self-harm behaviour.

AB Although religiosity fosters some antisocial behaviors (e.g., support for suicide attacks), it is well-known that it also enhances in-group cooperation and prosociality (e.g., donating to charity). Supernatural punishment hypothesis suggests that the fear of punishment from an invisible, potent, and powerful supernatural agent can keep everyone in line, and encourage prosociality. We first investigated this relationship in a predominantly Muslim country and then tested a model suggesting that attachment to God can lead people to think God as authoritarian, which in turn leads them to report more prosocial intentions. The results demonstrate that (1) there are some findings suggesting that Attachment to God Inventory is a reliable measure in Turkey, (2) seeing God as authoritarian is positively correlated with prosociality, and (3) our abovementioned model was supported by the data. Results generally support the supernatural punishment hypothesis and additionally show the utility of attachment theory in explaining the religiosity-prosociality link.

AB The present cross-cultural study compared self-reported assertiveness in 652 Swedish and 654 Turkish high school students by using a multidimensional measure called the Scale for Interpersonal Behavior (SIB). Four hypotheses were tested in the study. First, the hypothesis that Swedish adolescents would be more assertive than their Turkish counterparts was supported by the data. Second, the expectation that Turkish boys would be more assertive than Turkish girls, while there would be no differences between Swedish girls and boys, was not confirmed. In general, girls were found to be more skilled than boys in expressing and dealing with personal limitations. Third, as expected, more assertive adolescents in both Sweden and Turkey reported having more friends and receiving more social support than their less assertive peers. Finally, the data supported the expectation that older adolescents would be more assertive than younger ones. The results are discussed in terms of cultural and gender differences.

AB Background To our knowledge, the early effect of the fear caused by terrorism on human health, especially its effect on the number of visits to medical emergency departments (EDs), has not yet been studied. Objectives To observe the effect of fear from terrorist alerts on the use of EDs and on the rate of cardiovascular (CV) and/or cerebrovascular events. Setting In Istanbul, Turkey, there was a terror alert on the weekend of 19 and 20 March 2016. In this multicenter retrospective study, we compared the data of patients from that weekend with those from the preceding and following weekends. Patients A total of 12 324 adult patients' records were included in this study: 4562 patients in the first weekend, 3627 patients in the second, terror alert weekend, and 4135 patients in the third weekend. Measurements The ED, CV, and cerebrovascular incidence rates of the above three groups were compared. Results The rate of ED use was the least in the weekend of the terror alert; the highest rate occurred during the weekend prior to it (female applications decreased more [P = 0.03]). The medical center that was the farthest from the crowded central places of the city and from the place where suicide bombing occurred was less affected by the decrease in use. Conclusions Fear associated with terrorism may affect human health indirectly by preventing patients from reaching the necessary emergency healthcare facilities. This finding may be a pathfinder to decision-makers in such extraordinary emergency conditions. Further studies are needed in this field.

AB The occurred death of a convict in prison, police custody cell or in a hospital always attracts public attention and can be considered as a complex phenomenon. The aim of this study is to evaluate the data obtained from autopsies performed to the custody and prison deaths in Istanbul and to discuss the possible solutions by comparing with the literature. It is also aimed to discuss the postponement of the sentence and presidential amnesty facts in Turkey. Deaths of inmates, which occurred in hospitals, prisons, prison medical rooms, police vans and police custody cells between 2010 and 2012 in Istanbul, Turkey were included in the study. Totally 125 cases were found and 98.4% of them were male. Natural deaths accounted for a great majority of deaths (83.2%). The most common natural cause was cardiovascular diseases. Unnatural deaths accounted for 15.2% of the deaths. Death reason cannot be determined for 1.6% of the cases. More than half of the cases (56%) were died at the hospital, 34.4% were died at the prison, 4% of them at the police van, 3.2% were died under police custody and 2.4% were died at the prison medical room. Moreover, twelve of these cases had applied to Third Specialization Board previously for postponement of the sentence or Presidential amnesty. Totally five of these cases found suitable for postponement of the sentence. Prison conditions should be improved, prisoners with chronic diseases should be examined periodically and if appropriate their sentences should be postponed until they heal.

AB Objective. PTSD and major depression occur frequently following traumatic exposure, both as separate disorders and concurrently. Although much of Turkey is under threat of severe earthquakes, risk factors for developing psychiatric disorders among Turkish children have not yet been studied. The aim of the study was to examine risk factors for PTSD and depression develpoment in children. Method. A total of 160 survivors ( 102 girls and 58 boys) severely impacted by Turkey's 7.4-magnitude quake participated in a psychiatric interview 6-20 weeks after the disaster. The mean age was 14.43. Logistic regression was used to test effects of pre-disaster, disaster-related and post-disaster factors on diagnoses, yielding odds ratios ( OR). Results. CAPS indicated that 96 (60%) had PTSD, and psychiatric interview found 49 (31%) with depression. Children diagnosed with PTSD were more likely to have witnessed death ( OR = 2.47) and experienced an extreme parental reaction ( OR = 3.45). Children with depression were more likely to be male ( OR = 4.48), have a higher trait anxiety score ( OR = 1.12 for every additional point), sustain injury ( OR = 4.29), and have lost a family member in the quake ( OR = 10.96). Focusing on the 96 children with PTSD, those with comorbid depression were more likely male, have a higher trait anxiety score, and have lost of family member. Conclusions. Mental health professionals should offer support to children witnessing death or losing a family member in a disaster. The ability of the family to remain calm and reassuring also may be a key factor in preventing PTSD.

AB In this retrospective autopsy study fire-related deaths whose autopsies were carried out in the Council of Forensic Medicine in Istanbul, Turkey were analyzed in order to evaluate the relationship between the mode of the death and the laboratory and autopsy findings. There were 320 fire-related fatalities constituting the 2.07% of all autopsy cases of that period. Of the 320 cases 228 (71.3%) were males and 91 (28.4%) were females, average age in age-determined group was 36.6 (SD: 21.98) ranging from 8 months to 98 years.
   Carbon monoxide intoxication played role in death of 104 cases (32.5%) either directly or together with other factors such as burning and lack of oxygen. In 32 cases (10.0%) burning was the only cause of death and in 90 cases (28.1%) burning and related complications during treatment period caused death. In 35 cases (10.9%) traumatic factors other than those related to fire were responsible for death. There were 31 cases of homicide (9.7%) and 20 cases of suicide (6.3%). Accidents constituted the majority of the cases in our autopsy population with a frequency of 51.9%.
   The relationship between the presence of soot in trachea or esophagus and the mode of death and that of CO-Hb and the mode of death was statistically significant. The internal findings and laboratory data of the study population were discussed particularly on the basis of the decision of vitality in burned cases.

AB BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate characteristics, outcomes and clinical features of acute intoxications among children in Van region of Turkey.
   METHODS: All cases with a diagnosis of acute intoxication admitted to the Pediatric Emergency Department of the Yuzuncu Yil University of Van from June 1, 2010 to November 30, 2011 were evaluated. We retrospectively examined the medical records for demographical and etiological characteristics of patients below 17 years of age.
   RESULTS: A total of 239 intoxications were recorded. The majority of patients were under 5 years of age. Pharmaceutical agents were identified in 137 (57.3%) patients. Antidepressants with a majority of tricyclic antidepressants were the most common drugs (29.9%). Non-pharmaceutical agents were identified in 102 (42.6%) patients, 38.2% of which were insecticides-pesticides following by plants (25.4%) and carbon monoxide (17.6%). The majority (93.8%) of cases were accidental poisonings. Fourteen cases of intoxications occurred as suicide attempts and 85.7% (N.=12) of those patients were girls. Of all cases, gastric lavage was performed in 36.4% and activated charcoal administration in 53%. After hospitalization, only 23 (9.6%) of all patients received specific treatment besides symptomatic treatment. Specific treatments involved hemodialysis and antidotes such as biperiden, ethanol, atropine, neostigmine and pralidoxime. During the study period, one patient died due to acute intoxication of pesticide. The mortality rate was 0.4%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that pharmaceuticals were the most common cause of acute intoxications. While, insecticides-pesticides and plants were the leading non-pharmaceutic agents. Our data is important because it is one of few original reports on children with intoxication in Eastern Turkey.

AB This study included 45 patients with intentional insecticide intoxication and 21 with accidental intoxication who were treated at the First-Aid and Emergency Department of Balcali Hospital at the Faculty of Medicine in the Cukurova University, Adana, Turkey, while the control group consisted of 25 people selected from university personnel known to be healthy. Patients with a history of X-ray exposure in the last 6 months or of any virus disease as well as continuous drug users and smokers were excluded, leaving a total of 49 patients. Acetylcholine esterase (Pseudocholinesterase) enzyme (AchE), sister-chromatid exchanges (SCE), the mitotic index (MI), and the replication index (RI) were evaluated. Blood samples were cultured for SCE evaluation and sera separated for AchE levels. Insecticide exposure was generally intentional for suicide in adolescents and at older ages, but accidental for children. AchE levels were found to be significantly lower in organophosphorus (OP) and carbamated (CB) insecticide poisoning groups in comparison with the control group (p < 0.001), while the pyrethroid (PY) group was not statistically different for the AchE effect (p > 0.05). SCE was found to be significantly higher in OP and CB groups (p < 0.001), while the PY and control groups were statistically similar for SCE levels (p > 0.05). This study showed an increase in SCE in response to orally ingested insecticides. These findings indicate that insecticide exposure results in cell abnormalities, with resulting impediments to the division and replication of cells, as suggested by MI decreases and RI increases, while the speed of the division cycles of stimulated cells increases.

AB Objective: Schizophrenia is a highly heritable complex disease. The genetic interactions underlying this heritability is still needs to be understood. Linkage studies pointed out the D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) and D-amino acid oxidase activator (DAOA-G72) genes as candidate genes in susceptibility to schizophrenia. The association studies of interaction partners D-amino acid oxidase and D-amino acid oxidase activator gene polymorphisms and schizophrenia has been performed in different studies with different ethnic origins. However these studies showed conflicting results. In this study, it is aimed to examine the effects of several DAO and DAOA polymorphisms in Turkish schizophrenia patients. Methods: In the present study two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within DAO gene (rs2111902 and rs3741775) and one in DAOA gene (rs2391191) were genotyped in individuals with Turkish origin from Malatya region on eastern part of Turkey. 96 schizophrenia patients and 100 mentally healthy individuals are the subjects of this study. Results: No significant difference was found in between the controls and schizophrenia sample for the SNPs rs2111902 and rs3741775 of DAO gene but a significant association was found on the allelic level of rs2391191 of DAOA gene. The relationship between aggressive behaviour, suicide attempts and genotypes were also evaluated in the patient group. Discussion: A significant association for the G allele of rs2391191 at the allelic level (p=0.036) was found, on the other hand no association could be shown between the examined rs2111902 and rs3741775 polymorphisms and the pathology of the disorder in the group of Turkish schizophrenia patients included in this study.

AB AD increasing death rate as a result of violence constitutes a large group in medicolegal autopsies. Specially, deaths due to asphyxia are one of the most important causes in violence deaths.
   During the 21-year period from January 1984 to October 2004, there were 134 asphyxial deaths autopsied by the Department of Forensic Medicine, Trakya University, Edirne, Turkey. Asphyxial deaths comprise 15.7% of all forensic autopsies; 20.8% of the cases are aged between 30 and 39 years, and the average age was 41.9 years. Males constitute 79.8% of all the cases.
   The most frequent method of asphyxiation death is hanging (56 cases, 41.8%), followed by drowning (30.5%) and carbon monoxide poisoning (8.2%). More violent methods, such as ligature or manual strangulations, constitute 2.9% and 2.3% of all asphyxial deaths, respectively. Although it was varying according to the methods of asphyxiation, suicide was found to be the manner of death in the majority of the cases.

AB Cyberbullying is one of the important negative issues among adolescents and youngsters. Victims of cyberbullying perpetration have been reported to suffer many psychological and emotional problems that can lead them as far to suicide. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the associations of cyberbullying perpetration with gender, personality traits, chronotype, and sleep quality. Three hundred and fifty-three freshman and sophomore university students from Turkey (45.9% (n=162) female and 54.1% (n=191) male) completed a questionnaire that included Cyberbullying Scale, Big-5 Inventory, Composite Scale of Morningness, and Sleep Quality Scale. The most conspicuous result of the study was that chronotype and sleep quality were significant predictors of cyberbullying perpetration. Evening-type students had significantly higher scores on cyberbullying scale than neither-type students and morning-type students, and also neither-type students had higher scores on cyberbullying scale than morning-type students. Further, poorer sleep quality, being male, higher extraversion, higher neuroticism, and lower conscientiousness were related to higher cyberbullying perpetration.

AB Due to rapid industrialization and urbanization, social economy develops in an unparalleled speed, while it certainly fosters the consumption of natural resources and the pressure to protect the ecological environment. Hence, there is a two-way relationship between the well-being of humans and the natural environment. In this study, link analysis techniques along with multivariate statistical analysis were employed to discover the effects of environmental risk factors on city life cycle, where suicides, immigration, and emigration were considered as the fundamental indicators of how cities evolve. Association rules, classification trees, MANOVA, and linear discriminant analysis were applied to data on air quality, socioeconomic development, and demographical factors belonging to the cities of Turkey. The results indicate that socioeconomic development levels of cities differ along attraction and life satisfaction dimensions. People tend to choose a city with better development level and better air quality in order to increase their life satisfaction. Additionally, developed cities are less likely to have issues with air quality and citizens who live in a poorly developed city are least satisfied with their lives.

AB Objectives: Evaluation of the substances used, macroscopic and microscopic autopsy findings, and the manner of corrosive ingestion deaths in Istanbul are aimed in this study. Methods: The autopsy records of the corrosive ingestion cases in Istanbul, Turkey, between 1992 and 2001 are investigated in our retrospective descriptive study. Results: The cause of death was determined as "corrosive injury" in 23 (0.089%) cases among 25,763 autopsy cases. Among these cases one was in the child age group and the corrosive substance ingestion was accidental, whereas all the other cases were adults and the ingestion was for suicidal intent. Sixteen (69.6%) of the cases were female. Nitric acid was the most frequent agent with 13 cases (56.5%). Necrosis of esophagus was determined in 19 cases (82.6%) and perforation of stomach in 11 cases (47.8%). Conclusion: Guidance and education are important tools for prevention from corrosive injuries, but we believe that the best weapon is to restrict easy access to corrosive agents by prohibiting the free commercialization of these most potent agents.

AB The global problem of acute poisoning has steadily increased over the past few years. It is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Better preventive and management strategies can be developed if the incidence and pattern of acute poisoning is known. The study aims at analyzing the pattern, cause and mortality rate of poisoning.
   The study was conducted in a rural area in South India. This retrospective study was conducted from January 2003-December 2003. The data was analysed using descriptive statistics.
   Out of the 225 cases 139 were males and 86 females. Poisoning was common in the age group of 2130 years which was 84 cases and 11-20 years was 73 cases. The poisons consumed were as follows: Organophosphorous 135 cases, aluminum and zinc phosphide 50 cases, phenobarbitone 18 cases, benzodiazepines 7 cases, paracetamol 2 cases, miscellaneous 13 cases. 94% were suicides and 6% accidental. Mortality rate was 12.8%.
   Establishment of strict policies against the sale and availability of pesticides and over the counter drugs is an effective way to control organophosphorous and drug poisoning. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In total 2850 medicolegal death cases, 161 (5.65%) were resulted from asphyxia and 20(12.4%) of the deaths due to asphyxia were cases of ligature strangulation. Male:female ratio of the victims was 1:1 with ages ranging from 1.5 to 70 years and a mean age of 37.22 +/- 19.28 years. 17 cases (85%) were of homicidal and 3 cases (15%) of suicidal origin. The most widely used ligature material was clothesline in 6 cases (30%). On the examination of neck structures, thyroid cartilage fracture was present in 7(35%) cases, fracture of the hyoid bone in 3 cases (15%), fracture both of the thyroid cartilage and hyoid bone in 1 case (5%), only ecchymosis in soft tissues in 7 cases (35%). In the paper, the findings determined in our cases are discussed in the light of the literature on the subject. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine. All rights reserved.

   Methods: In this study, 28359 death records of the Council of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey between 1 January 2000 and 1 January 2008 were analyzed retrospectively and 76 cases of deaths identified in hotels were included. Data about these cases were evaluated regarding age, sex, marital status, occupation, nationality, history, scene investigation and autopsy findings and cause of death.
   Results: The mean age of the cases was 39.69 +/- 4.32 (range between 1 and 78 years). Sixty (78.9%) males and 16 (21.1%) females with a male/female ratio of 3.75 were recorded. Nationality was Turkish in 58 (76.3%) cases and foreign in 18 (23.7%) cases. Autopsy was performed in 75 (98.7%) cases.
   Conclusion: We concluded that safety measures targeting detailed booking and health records at entry to hotels, improving security measures against firearms at airports, correcting deficiencies in basic facilities like electricity and ensuring barricades and lifeguards at the beaches and pools and implementing legal arrangements like physicians at place of work could lower death rates.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine problematic internet use in terms of self-injurious behavior and risk-taking behavior. This study was performed with 736 high school students, 328 females and 408 males studying at various high schools in Trabzon (in Turkey). The Problematic Internet Use Scale was used to measure students' problematic internet use levels, the inventory of statements about self injury to measure self-injurious behavior and the Adolescent Risk-Taking Questionnaire to measure risk-taking behavior. According to the results of the study, a positive and significant relationship was found between risk-taking behavior and problematic internet use (r = .39, p < 0.01), and it was determined that self-injurious behavior and risk-taking behavior significantly predict problematic internet use (F = 86.94, p < 0.01). Furthermore, it was found that problematic interne use displays variation according to self-injurious behavior (F-(1,F- 732) = 32.32, p < 0.01). The findings have been discussed in relation to the existing literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aimed at investigating the effects of individualistic-collectivistic value orientations on non-fatal suicidal behavior and attitudes in Turkish adolescents and young adults. A questionnaire containing measures of individualism, collectivism (INDCOL), non-fatal suicidal behaviors and suicidal attitudes was used to collect the data. The results showed that both suicidal ideation and attempts were significantly more frequent in participants classified as individualist than those who were classified as collectivist on the basis of INDCOL scale scores. Participants with individualistic tendencies displayed more permissive attitudes toward suicide than those with collectivistic tendencies but collectivists believed to a greater extent than the individualists that people should communicate suicidal problems to others. Participants with collectivistic tendencies showed more accepting and helping reactions to an imagined suicidal friend than those with individualistic tendencies. Suicidal ideation and attempts were more common among adolescents than young adults. The findings suggest that individualistic and collectivistic value orientations and developmental status specific stressors play a role in the distribution of nonfatal suicidal behavior and the nature of suicidal attitudes.

AB Drawing from Robert Agnew's General Strain Theory, the purpose of this study is to examine the effect of sexual abuse on deviant behaviors, such as suicide, smoking, drinking, drug use, violent crime, and property crime, among Turkish adolescents. The article also aims to understand the mediating role of negative emotions, including depression and anger, as well as gender differences in this relationship. Findings from a series of analyses demonstrate that the experience of sexual abuse is significantly related to the likelihood of engaging in most of the deviant behaviors. In addition, the mediating role of negative emotions, particularly anger, was highlighted in the findings. Furthermore, the effect of sexual abuse on deviant behaviors was relatively greater for Turkish males compared with Turkish females. The current study contributes to the literature on the consequences of sexual abuse by considering them within the unique Islamic-Western cultural context of Turkey. Overall, findings suggest that this particular form of strain has a substantial impact on deviant behaviors among Turkish adolescents.

AB Background. Acute poisonings are frequent causes of admission to emergency departments and these cases may have hazardous outcomes. Methods. In the present study, medical records of 1818 poisoned patients admitted to Uludag University Medical School's Emergency Department between January 1996 and December 2001 were investigated. The age, sex, outcomes of the patients, and type of poisoning are described. Results. The mean age for females (63% of the patients) was 27 years, whilst the mean age of male patients was 31 years. The major types of poisonings were ingestions of medications (59.6%), mushrooms (3.3%), corrosives (2.5%), organophosphates (3.2%), and methyl alcohol (0.4%). Carbon monoxide accounted for 6.9% of intoxications. Approximately 65% of the patients survived, while the methyl alcohol and corrosive ingestions led to the highest fatality averages (100% and 14.8%, respectively). Conclusions. The demographic and diagnostic features of acute poisoning cases treated in our hospital are similar to those reported in the literature. Adults and women are in a high-risk group for acute poisonings and medicine poisoning, which is the most common type of poisoning.

AB Objective: Psychiatrists are considered to be the least frequently sued among other medical specialties. Of the 28 medical specialties, psychiatry ranked 22nd in terms of number of malpractice claims. We aimed to investigate psychopharmacotherapeutic malpractice claims against psychiatrists in Turkey.
   Methods: Data from claim files were extracted between the years of 2003 and 2012 in which expert witness testimony of psychiatrist and forensic specialists in the Council of Forensic Medicine were requested by the court. Only, claim files about psychopharmacotherapeutic issues were included in the study.
   Results: There were eight malpractice claim files selected according to the inclusion criteria. There were 3 female and 5 male patients in the related claims; four of them had a diagnosis of depression while the remaining four had schizophrenia. Four wrong treatments, one neglect and wrong treatment, one severe adverse effect, one accountability for death, one persecutory complaint about the prescribed drugs were cited in the claims.
   Conclusion: Malpractice claims against psychiatrists have been rising and this issue might have some negative influences on interrelations between psychiatrists. Therefore, psychiatrists should improve their awareness about malpractice subjects.

AB Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between nonsuicidal self-injury and family functioning, and family characteristics. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the participants were given the sociodemographic data form and the Family Evaluation Scale. The sociodemographic data form was included questions about family characteristics like health status, marital status, educational level, smoking-alcohol-substance use of parents and parents' occupation. Family Evaluation Scale enables assessment of successes and failures of family functions in some areas like problem solving, communication, roles, emotional reaction capability, capacity of showing interest, behavior control, general functions. Scales were applied to 555 students of 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th grades from Izmit (Turkey) central county were included in this study. Results: The prevalence of nonsuicidal self-injury among young participants of this study was found 11.4%. Nonsuicidal self-injury was determined in 41 girls and 22 boys of total 63 adolescences. These rates are lower than other studies reviewed in the literature. The age at onset of nonsuicidal self-injury was 12.4 +/- 1.87 years. A significant difference was found between groups with and without nonsuicidal self-injury in family characteristics like alcohol use of father, important event experienced by the family in the last year and chronic disease in family. Also, a significant association was found between nonsuicidal self-injury and high score levels of family evaluation scale's all subscales. Conclusion: In studies reviewed in literature it was observed that most studies include high school students and very few community studies include the period of early and mid-adolescence. Considering the age of onset of behavior, findings show that determination of preventive measures or regenerative methods in terms of family functioning is important in preventing occurrence of nonsuicidal self-injury in adolescents or prevention of progression of this behavior.

AB Drowning, a major public health problem worldwide, occurs as an accident, suicide, or homicide. Deaths with an accidental origin are common in childhood in the 0-18 age group. In our study, pediatric drowning cases for whom a postmortem examination and an autopsy were conducted by Adnan Menderes University Department of Forensic Medicine were evaluated. The characteristics were determined and compared with domestic and foreign studies.
   A total of 39 cases in the 0-18 age group in AydA +/- n between 2002 and 2012 were analyzed regarding age, gender, cause of death, origin, the accident scene, and the month in which the death occurred.
   Of the drowning cases, 33 (84.6 %) were male, and 6 (15.4 %) were female. The average age was 9.08 years, and drowning is most common in the 0-4 age group (33.3 %). The scene of the accident was an irrigation channel in 43.5 % of the cases, a river in 15.3 %, a sea in 12.8 %, a pool in 10.2 %, and a lake or pond in 7.69 %.
   Drowning deaths are a serious and preventable public health problem worldwide. There are strong correlations among lack of adult supervision, lack of precautions, and neglect.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate dissociative disorder and overall psychiatric comorbidity in patients with conversion disorder.
   Method: Thirty-eight consecutive patients previously diagnosed with conversion disorder were evaluated in two follow-up interviews. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R, the Dissociation Questionnaire, the Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire, and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire were administered during the first follow-up interview. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders was conducted in a separate evaluation.
   Results: At least one psychiatric diagnosis was found in 89.5% of the patients during the follow-up evaluation. Undifferentiated somatoform disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, dysthymic disorder, simple phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, major depression, and dissociative disorder not otherwise specified were the most prevalent psychiatric disorders. A dissociative disorder was seen in 47.4% of the patients. These patients had dysthymic disorder, major depression, somatization disorder, and borderline personality disorder more frequently than the remaining subjects. They also reported childhood emotional and sexual abuse, physical neglect, self-mutilative behavior, and suicide attempts more frequently.
   Conclusions: Comorbid dissociative disorder should alert clinicians for a more chronic and severe psychopathology among patients with conversion disorder.

AB This study investigates the suicidal ideation and the possible causes for suicidal behaviour in the elderly. Subjects were 150 patients aged 65 and older who were evaluated using the sociodemographic data collection forms, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Suicidal Ideation Scale (SIS), Reasons for Living Inventory (RLI), and Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS). Of 150 patients, 72.7% were women and 27.3% were men, ages ranged from 65 to 88 years. Suicidal ideation was noted in 30.7% of patients. When the mean of BHS total score between patients with and without suicidal ideation and the mean of BHS subscale's feelings and expectations regarding the future and loss of motivation and hope in terms of subscales were evaluated between the groups with and without suicidal ideation, the scores had a significant difference. When RLI was evaluated in terms of total scores, the suicidal ideation mean score was 243.74 +/- 32.28, while the non-suicidal ideation mean score was 267.27 +/- 24.36. There was a significant relationship between the two groups. We found low level of education, low level of reasons for living and higher psychiatric morbidity (generalized anxiety disorder and comorbid depressive disorder) in with suicidal ideation in the elderly.

AB Objective: Alexithymia is a thinking style that emphasizes external stimuli rather than internal emotional experiences, it is characterized by externally oriented thinking (EOT). Alexithymia is associated with depression and many psychiatric disorders. It directly affects mental health but is rarely emphasized in clinical practice. Physicians are at risk of psychiatric disorders. Alexithymia and EOT may contribute to their psychiatric problems. Our aim was to examine alexithymia levels and their sociodemographic correlates in a physician population. Meth-ods: Participants were 83 physicians employed in five hospitals (three education and research hospitals, one state hospital and one university hospital) in Ankara. Participants completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and a sociodemographic questionnaire. Results: The mean TAS-20 score was 44.1 +/- 6.3 and 13.25% of the participants were found to be alexithymic. Participants with a psychiatric patient in their family were statistically more likely to have difficulty describing their feelings. EOT was associated with female gender, greater age, seniority in the medical profession, being married, and being born and mostly living in the western region of Turkey. Discussion: EOT may be associated with depression, cultural values and stigmatization. Physicians must be encouraged to discuss and be aware of their EOT to maintain their mental health.

TI Accidental Deaths by Hanging Among Children in Istanbul, Turkey

ID CHILDHOOD; ASPHYXIA
AB Hanging is a type of strangulation by means of rope or any other similar material. This kind of ligature strangulation occurs by weight of the body dragging due to gravity and applying force to the neck. Hanging almost never occurs by accident, but occurs mostly as a way to commit suicide.
   A total number of 82,871 autopsies were performed in the Council of Forensic Medicine of the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Justice (Istanbul) between 1979 and 2012, and 4500 (5.43%) of these deaths occurred as a result of hanging. Thirteen of these reported cases have been observed and resulted in death occurring by accident. Seven of these victims were males, and 6 of them were females. Examination of their ages revealed that 3 of these victims were aged 1 year, and 3 victims were aged 6 years. The oldest victim was aged 13 years, and the youngest one was aged 1 year. It has been recorded that 8 of the deaths occurred with rope, 2 with sweater, 2 with scarf, 1 with belt, and 1 with tights. Investigation of the incidents revealed that 3 of the cases occurred by tangling in a rope swing and 2 with a head scarf. Ligature marks on the neck from aforementioned materials and ecchymosis on soft tissue were observed on all of the victims, and the thyroid cartilages and cervical vertebrae were intact. No substance was found in the toxicological analysis performed on all victims.
   In conclusion, our study showed that although accidental death by hanging took place rarely in these ages, all of the victims were between the ages of 1 and 13 years who recently started walking and entering their teenage years. It is important not to leave the children at home or in the playgrounds alone for a long time (unsupervised at home or in the playgrounds). Precautionary measures must be taken against danger, and the design of materials manufactured for this age group must be reconsidered.

AB The purpose of this study is to reveal school safety problems in Turkey reflected to the newspaper topics. In this study which is designed according to qualitative research method, document analysis technique is used. A total of 362 news related to school security problems with the keyword of "school" in the 2017-2018 academic year constitute the data of this study which is accessed from the search engines of Hurriyet and Sabah newspapers. In the analysis of the data, content analysis was performed to determine the dimensions of the events that reflect the news about school security problems. In the content analysis, in accordance with the sub-objectives of the research; Analyzes were made based on the topics related to physical, psycho-social and external threats which are reflections of school safety problems. As a result of the analysis in regard to the physical security of schools; four different categories were reached: building, transportation, hygiene factors and security related to infrastructure. Building category is divided into two sub-categories namely outdoor and indoor categories. Outdoor category involves structural problems of the buildings while the indoor category deals with the emergency situation. In the case of psycho-social security, the events in newspapers were collected in five different categories as violence, abuse, suicide, substance abuse and security events related to negligence. In the sub-dimension of psycho-social security, it is observed that most of the security incidents are seen in the category of violence and abuse in schools; It is interesting to note that in these categories, harming of others and sexual harassment are the most intense security incidents in schools. Finally, events related to external threats in the schools were collected in seven different categories as follows: school environment events, school environment structure and system, abuse, psychological attacks, terrorism, burglary and violence. It is possible to say that the school-related incidents as a result of the sale of drugs and unhealthy foods and the theft of schools' equipment are the most common external threats.

AB Unemployment has been associated with adverse mental health outcomes including depression and suicide. In the last decades, unemployment rates have increased substantially in Turkey; yet, factors and mechanisms that play a role in experiencing psychological symptoms among unemployed individuals are not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of personality characteristics on psychological symptoms among unemployed Turkish adults and to test the mediating role of rumination as a dysfunctional cognitive strategy. The sample consisted of 217 unemployed Turkish adults who completed self-report measures on neuroticism, external locus of control, rumination, and psychological symptoms. The results of the structural equation modeling indicated that rumination partially mediated the relationship between personality variables (i.e., neuroticism and external locus of control) and psychological symptoms, thus verifying the hypothesis of the study. The direct paths from trait neuroticism and external locus of control to psychological symptoms were also significant. Results revealed that a tendency to attribute future outcomes to external factors and an increased tendency to experience negative emotions are associated with engaging passively in rumination, which in turn predicts psychological symptoms. Interventions are suggested to focus on effective coping strategies along with increasing individuals' perceived control over life and future.

AB Burnout among emergency medical practitioners and personnel negatively affects career satisfaction and job performance and leads to a high prevalence of mental health issues, including anxiety, depression and suicide. This study investigates the relationship between the perceptions of burnout and job satisfaction for those working in emergency services in two public hospitals in Turkey. This study also examines the levels of burnout and job satisfaction in terms of gender, marital status, education and occupation. Participants in this study include 250 emergency service personnel. The Maslach Burnout Inventory Scale, which assesses emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and personal accomplishment, and the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire, which assesses internal satisfaction, external satisfaction and overall satisfaction, were used for data collection. The results of this study indicate that there is a significant relationship between burnout and job satisfaction. This study also shows that education, marital status and occupation affect burnout and job satisfaction. However, gender was also determined to have a significant effect on job satisfaction. Moreover, this study reveals that emotional exhaustion is a significant predictor of overall satisfaction, that emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation are significant predictors of intrinsic job satisfaction and that emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment are significant predictors of extrinsic job satisfaction. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that emotional exhaustion is the significant regressor affecting job satisfaction.

AB In the literature self-esteem is found to be lower in clinically referred adolescents compared to adolescents without any psychiatric disorder. The aim of this study is to examine self-esteem and associated socio-demographical and psychological factors in clinically referred adolescents in Turkey. Three hundred forty-nine adolescents aged between 12 and 18 years admitted to the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry with a psychiatric complaint were enrolled. Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), Parenting Style Scale (PSS) and Sense of Identity Assessment Form (SIAF) were used for the evaluation. Self-esteem was lower in: girls, adolescents without siblings, living in non-nuclear families, with a past suicide attempt, and with history of a non-suicidal self-injurious behavior (NSSI). Self-esteem was negatively correlated with identity confusion on SIAF and positively correlated with acceptance/involvement on PSS. Significant predictors of self-esteem were gender, presence of a sibling, history of a NSSI and SIAF scores. Interactions between self-esteem and gender, psychiatric symptoms, parenting and identity development are complex in clinically referred adolescents. Further elucidation of the mechanisms through which these characteristics modify self-esteem will be necessary to guide families and clinicians to help adolescents to maintain high self-esteem levels.

AB The purpose of this study is to examine self-injurious behavior

   group was composed of 329 female and 402 male high school
   students - 731 in total - who were randomly selected and
   studying in various high schools in Trabzon (in Turkey). 270 of
   731 adolescents were identified to have SIB behavior. 182 of these
   adolescents were male, 88 of them were female. The Inventory of
   Statements About Self-injury, The Adolescent Risk-Taking
   Questionnaire, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and Personal
   Information Form were used in the collection of data. The results
   indicated that there were significant differences between risk-
   taking behaviors and self-esteem levels of adolescents with and
   without SIB. It was also found that there was a significant
   relationship between SIB and risk-taking behavior of the
   adolescents with SIB. It was seen that risk-taking behavior
   significantly predicted SIB (p < 0.001) yet, self-esteem was not a
   significant predictor. Adolescence is a period to consider in terms
   of the beginning and continuation of the SIB. Observation and
   early diagnosis of SIB will help to prevent the repetition of
   behavior and decrease the level of behavior. Thus, it is important
   to introduce the SIB and raise awareness related to this behavior
   for parents, educators, and mental health professionals.

AB Background and Design: Although satisfying results with isotretinoin therapy were reported in treatment of severe or moderate but resistant acne vulgaris; the data about this treatment modality in Turkey is insufficient. Therefore we aimed to asses the clinical efficiency of isotretinoin treatment in patients with severe or moderate but resistant acne.
   Material and Method: Ninety four patients were enrolled into the study. The patients were evaluated for clinical symptoms and biochemical parameters; dosage of isotretinoin treatment; response to treatment and adverse events. Patients received 0,5-1 mg/kg/day isotretinoin for 24-32 weeks, with a 120/mg/kg total cumulative dose. The severity of the facial lesions were graded from 0 (no acne) to 12 (severe acne); and corporal lesions (back and chest) from 0 (no acne) to 8 (severe acne).
   Results: Although three of the patients (3.2%) failed to continue medication; ninety one patients (96.8%) finale the treatment period with complete recovery. The most common clinical side effect was cheilitis which was seen in all the patients and the most important biochemical side effect was the elevation of serum triglyceride concentrations.
   Conclusion: Isotretinoin can be concluded as a valuable and rather tolerable choice of treatment in patients with severe or moderate but resistant acne vulgaris. (Turkderm 2008; 42: 51-5)

AB This interventional study was undertaken to assess the impact of physiotherapy education on the knowledge and attitudes of physiotherapists (PTs) and physiotherapy students (PSs) toward euthanasia. The study, which was conducted during the period between 2004 and 2005, included a total of 494 participants (311 PTs; 183 PSs) aged 18 to 52 y from the western and central portions of Turkey, who responded to a self-report questionnaire (response rate, 96.4%) that was based on data from the literature. Results indicated that PTs (48.9%) were more likely to approve of euthanasia than PSs (38.3%) (P<.05). The legalization of euthanasia was favored by 43.7% of PTs, compared with 29.5% of PSs (P<.05). On the other hand, PTs and PSs expressed similar views regarding euthanasia, including reasons for accepting or opposing euthanasia and acceptable conditions for its use (P>.05). Overall results showed that sex and age had no effect on whether euthanasia was accepted (P>.05); religiousness was found to have the greatest effect on attitudes toward euthanasia (P<.05). The findings of the current study suggest that (1) the attitudes of PTs are different from those of PSs, and (2) the Islamic point of view has a negative impact on the attitudes of PTs and PSs toward euthanasia.

AB BACKGROUND
   We describe herein the characteristics of lethal injuries caused by low-voltage electrical current (electrocution), the most frequent injury caused by electrical current.
   METHODS
   Nine hundred forty-five cases over a period of 41 years (1965-2006) were reviewed, of which, 351 electrocution cases were identified. The descriptive statistical analyses were carried out with the application of SPSS 11.0 software.
   RESULTS
   Electrocution accounted for 37.14% of all studied electricity-caused injuries. The average age of the victims was 35.25 years. The average age of male victims was 36.19 years and of female victims was 32.55 years. The distribution by gender showed a significant prevalence of the male sex (74.07%). Among the circumstances leading to electrocution, household accidents (78.06%) prevailed over occupational accidents (13.39%). Suicides were significantly rarer (7.41%). 66.10% of all electrocution cases occurred during the summer period from June through September.
   CONCLUSION
   Household accidents prevail among the circumstances under which electrocution occurs, with an insignificant difference in the male/female proportion in this group. The majority of electrocutions occurred during the summer period (June-September). The results obtained in this research can help in the development of a differentiated strategy for the prevention of electrocution, while taking into consideration gender, age and season of the year.

AB Objective: This study aims to explore the relationships among hopelessness, cognitive flexibility, intolerance of uncertainty, and perceived stress in a non-clinical sample by proposing a multiple mediation model. It was suggested that hopeless individuals have low cognitive flexibility and high intolerance of uncertainty; consequently, they are more likely to perceive stress.
   Method: The participants of this study comprised 302 university students (46.7% female and 53.3% male) between 18 and 40 years of age who were recruited from a state university in Turkey. To collect data, Beck Hopelessness Scale, Cognitive Flexibility Inventory, Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale, and Perceived Stress Scale were applied.
   Results: The results showed that hopelessness is negatively correlated with cognitive flexibility and positively correlated with intolerance of uncertainty and perceived stress. Cognitive flexibility has been found to be negatively correlated with intolerance of uncertainty and perceived stress. There is also a positive correlation between intolerance of uncertainty and perceived stress. The mediation of cognitive flexibility and intolerance of uncertainty in the relationship between hopelessness and perceived stress is also statistically significant in the model, and all variables explain approximately 37.0% of the variance in perceived stress.
   Conclusion: The findings of the study are considered to provide a guide for mental health professionals and researchers.

AB The aim of this study was to analyse intoxications concerning sedative-hypnotic medication patients admitted to the Department of Emergency Medicine in Dokuz Eylul University Hospital (EMDEU) between 1993 and 2005. Demographics of the patients, characteristics of sedative-hypnotic exposures, performed treatment attempts and outcome of the poisoned patients were recorded on standard data forms that were later entered into a computerized database programme. Related to the sedative-hypnotic exposures, 686 poisoning cases were admitted to the EMDEU. Mean age was 10.8 +/- 6.5 years among the paediatric age group (< 17 years old, 169, 24.6%) and 30.3 +/- 12.8 years among the adult group (> 17 years old, 509, 74.2%). The most common sedative-hypnotic agents were benzodiazepines (286, 35.8%), alprazolam accounted for 41.6% of them (119). Most of the patients admitted to EMDEU were asymptomatic (61.7%). Observation alone was recommended in 53.9% of EMDEU cases. Although prescription of benzodiazepines is restricted, benzodiazepine was the most common cause of sedative-hypnotic medication exposures. As only a minority of patients (3%) had clinically serious signs and symptoms, most of the overdoses might be under toxic levels or the decontamination methods might be efficient. In this study, the clinical outcome of the patients is relatively better than previous results described in literature.

AB Objective: Substance use behavior is increasing in Turkey, as is the importance of substance use treatment and rehabilitation programs. Substance users' compliance and treatment motivation are crucial for the effectiveness of treatment and rehabilitation programs. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between psychosocial variables and treatment motivation and to determine the effects of psychosocial variables, self-efficacy, and coping strategies on treatment motivation.
   Method: The study was conducted among 336 substance users taking part in a Cigarette, Alcohol and Drug Addiction Treatment Program (SAMBA) group program.
   Results: A significant difference in treatment motivation was found according to the individual's age, educational status, and income level, duration of substance use and number of substances used, family problems, and psychiatric comorbidity. In addition, the most important predictive variables for treatment motivation are the individual's income level, the presence of children, family problems, and coping strategies.
   Conclusion: Cognitive and behavioral studies should be undertaken to strengthen social support mechanisms, to increase the supportive participation of family members, and to develop coping strategies as well as motivational techniques in order to increase the individuals' compliance and motivation.

AB Violence is a significant public health problem. Thus, so as to prevent this problem, homicide, the severest form of violence depriving a human being of his right to live, deserves a detailed examination.
   This study is a retrospective research examining the 2951 cases of medicolegal autopsies in Adana during a period of 5 years (1997-2001). Among these cases, 620, which were determined to be homicidal, were taken into the scope of this study. The cases were examined with respect to sex, age groups, the method used during the act of homicide, the number and the localization of the wounds on the body.
   A total of 620 (21%) of the medicolegal autopsies conducted within this period were homicides. Of these cases, 515 (83.06%) were male and 105 (16.94%) female, and the rate of the males to females was 4.9; 72.74% of the victims were between the ages of 21 and 50. It was seen that 54.83% of the homicides involved firearms, while 35.16% of the victims were stabbed to death with a Cutting object. It was also determined that the victims suffered a single wound in 47.35% of firearm-related Murders and 29.35% of stabbings resulted in death. Alcohol was found in the blood of 7.58% of the homicide victims. while none had any illicit drugs.

AB Introduction: The aim of this study is to measure the prevalence of suicidal ideation and thoughts of death in elementary school children in a European survey and to determine the associated socio-demographic and clinical factors.
   Methods: Data refer to children aged 6-12 (N=7062) from Italy, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Germany, and the Netherlands randomly selected in primary schools. Suicidal thoughts and death ideation were measured using a computerized pictorial diagnostic tool from the Dominic Interactive (DI) completed by the children. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was administrated to teachers and parents along with a socio-demographic questionnaire.
   Results: Suicidal ideation was present in 16.96% of the sample (from 9.9 in Italy to 26.84 in Germany), death thoughts by 21.93% (from 7.71% in Italy to 32.78 in Germany). Sl and DT were more frequent in single-parent families and large families. Externalizing disorders were strongly correlated with Sl and DT after controlling for other factors and this was true for internalizing disorders only when reported by the children.
   Conclusion: Recognizing suicidal ideation in young children may be recommended as part of preventive strategies such as screening in the context of the presence of any mental health problems whether externalizing or internalizing. (C) 2015 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

AB The World Health Organization describes geriatric age group as the population aged 65 years or older. Parallel with the development of medical and technological areas, the life expectancy gets longer and geriatric population has been dramatically increasing. In this respect, geriatric deaths are frequently encountered due to increasing risk factors and pathophysiological changes in aging process. The records of the Forensic Medicine Institution Adana Group Authority Morgue Specialty Office were used. Death certificates and autopsy records of 9007 cases autopsied between the years of 1998 and 2007 were examined retrospectively. Seven hundred and twenty-six geriatric age (>65 years) deaths were taken in the scope of the study. All of the cases were analyzed with regard to age, sex, cause of death, incident place, and the place and origin of death. Geriatric deaths comprised 8.1% (726 cases) of all the medicolegal autopsy cases (9007) during these ten years. Of all geriatric deaths, 73.8% (536) were male while 26.2% (190) were female. Ages of cases were between 65 and 96 years, and the mean age was 72.3. Majority (310 cases, 42.7%) of deaths were by natural causes, while this was followed by accidental deaths with 227 cases (31.4%). This study was aimed to discuss the general features of geriatric deaths accepted as forensic cases, in the light of the literature. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Intimate partners commit approximately one in three homicides against women worldwide. Little is known about situational factors that contribute to intimate partner homicides (IPH) and how they may differ across nations. This article provides a cross-national exploration of one situational factor, the use of firearms in the commission of homicides, and considers whether nations have laws designed specifically to keep firearms out of the hands of batterers. We conducted a systematic search of peer-reviewed research and governmental and nongovernmental reports for data on weapon use in IPH. Data were located for 15 nations and subnational areas, which varied from firearms being involved in no IPHs in Fiji to 59% in Antalya, Turkey. Seven nations have legislation that addresses gun ownership as it relates to those who have been charged with, convicted of, or show a propensity toward the commission of intimate partner violence. These laws vary in whether domestic violence is a factor considered in whether to allow firearm ownership or whether it served to disqualify ownership. Due to the small number of nations for which data on weapon use in IPH were located, we did not conduct any hypothesis testing. There is a need for detailed homicide surveillance systems among nations so that researchers can explore the epidemiology of these homicides and ultimately identify opportunities for intervention.

TI Development of a markerless gene deletion strategy using <i>rpsL</i> as

ID DUCKS; IDENTIFICATION; PATHOGENICITY; SYSTEM
AB Riemerella anatipestifer is a gram-negative bacterium that mainly infects ducks, turkeys and other birds. In a previous study, we established a markerless mutation system based on the pheS mutant as a counterselectable marker. However, the toxic effect of p-Cl-Phe on the R. anatipestifer strain expressing the pheS mutant was weak on blood agar plates. In this study, we successfully obtained streptomycin-resistant derivative of R. anatipestifer ATCC11845 using 100 mu g/mL streptomycin as a selection pressure. Then, we demonstrate that rpsL can be used as a counterselectable marker in the R. anatipestifer ATCC11845 rpsL mutant strain, namely, R. anatipestifer ATCCs. A suicide vector carrying wild-type rpsL, namely, pORS, was constructed and used for markerless deletion of the gene RA0C_1534, which encodes a putative sigma-70 family RNA polymerase sigma factor. Using rpsL as a counterselectable marker, markerless mutagenesis of RA0C_1534 was also performed based on natural transformation. R. anatipestifer ATCCs\Delta RA0C_1534 was more sensitive to H2O2-generated oxidative stress than R. anatipestifer ATCCs. Moreover, transcription of RA0C_1534 was upregulated under 10 mM H2O2 treatment and upon mutation of fur. These results suggest that RA0C_1534 is involved in oxidative stress response in R. anatipestifer. The markerless gene mutation method developed in this study provides new tools for investigation of the physiology and pathogenic mechanisms of this bacterium.

AB Objectives. - This cross-sectional randomised study involving a predominantly adolescent school population (ranging from the 6th to the 11th grades) was conducted to determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of depression in adolescents in the city of Mersin, Turkey.
   Subjects and methods. -A stratified sample of 4256 students was selected as representative of the city's adolescent school population. The students were divided into two groups according to diagnosis (Group I: depressive adolescents; Group II: adolescents without depression). The age range varied between 10 and 20 years, with a mean of 14.53 years (S.D. = 1.89), i.e. a mean of 14.73 years (S.D. = 1.79) for Group I, and 15.5 years (S.D. = 1.9) for Group II. Data was obtained via two structured questionnaires designed to determine the presence and clinical characteristics of depression both in adolescents and in their parents. In addition, the Child Beck Depression Inventory (CBDI) was administered to all students participating in the study. After quality control of data, the study sample was reduced to 4143 adolescents. The mean age of the students was 11.23 +/- 6.44 years, and the ratio of boys/girls was 1.19:1.
   Results. - The prevalence of depression according to the CBDI (cut-off point: 19) was found to be 12.55% in this study group, with a significantly higher prevalence of depression in girls than in boys. Binary regression analysis demonstrated that the most important factors involved in the onset of depression in adolescents were having problems with parents, staying down a grade, and humiliation at school, and that the most common symptoms were feelings of worthlessness/guilt, sadness, emptiness, irritability and somatic disorders.
   Conclusion. - This cross-sectional prospective randomised school-based study has examined sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of adolescents with depression in a student population. It was found that in this study group there was a relatively high level of depressive symptoms, with a clear predominance of females over males. Other clinical characteristics of adolescents with depression have been discussed in the context of previous investigations. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Aim: The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence and correlates of dissociative disorders among patients with drug dependency.
   Methods: The Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) was used to screen 104 consecutive patients at an addiction treatment center. Thirty-seven patients who had scores >= 30 were compared with 21 patients who scored < 10 on the DES. Both groups were then evaluated using the Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule and the Structured Clinical Interview for Dissociative Disorders (SCID-D). The interviewers were blind to the DES scores.
   Results: Twenty-seven patients (26.0%) had a dissociative disorder according to the SCID-D. Dissociative patients were younger than the non-dissociative group. History of suicide attempt and/or childhood emotional abuse was significant predictors of a dissociative disorder. The majority (59.3%) of dissociative drug users reported that dissociative experiences had existed prior to substance use. More patients in the dissociative disorder than in the non-dissociative group stopped their treatment prematurely.
   Conclusion: A considerable proportion of drug users have a dissociative disorder, which may also interfere with treatment process. The relatively young age of this subgroup of patients and frequent reports of childhood emotional abuse underline potential preventive benefits of early intervention among adolescents with developmental trauma history and dissociative psychopathology.

AB Murder of women generally occurs as a result of violence by their husbands and relatives. We evaluated the female victims of murder in Eskisehir, located in western Anatolia, where the education level is high in this study. Our aim was to assess and discuss data related to the victims and murderers.
   A total of 141 women's murder cases were analysed in the study. After a legal process and the results of the autopsies during 2002-2011 in Eskisehir, 715 subjects found to have died as a result of murder were chosen. Cases were evaluated in terms of their age, marital status, education level, relationship to the murderer, reasons for violence, type of action and reasons for death.
   It was determined that 48.2% (n = 68) of the victims had been killed by the husband and 7.8% (n = 11) by the ex-husband. Murderers generally stated that the reason of murder was the woman's request for divorce or breaking up (n = 40, 28.4%).
   In compliance with the literature, the women were most commonly killed by their husbands in our study. Enhancing women's status and preventing violence against women will decrease such murders. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Background: We aimed herein to assess demographic, etiological, and clinical characteristic of patients presenting to our hospital's emergency department with acute poisoning.
   Method: This study included a total of 509 (0.27%) patients diagnosed with poisoning at our emergency department within a 3-year period. This was a retrospective study.
   Results: Seventy-one point three (n = 363) percent of the patients were female. The majority of the victims were in the 18-25 years age group (P <0.001). The poisoning incident was for suicidal purposes in 83.7% of patients. Among the patients presenting will prescription drug poisoning, 92.9% were poisoned in a suicide attempt while 73.2% of patients presenting with poisoning with non-medical substances were poisoned accidentally. Suicidal poisonings were more common in young age group and females (P < 0.001). The most common poisoning agent was antidepressants (17.6%) followed by analgesics (12.8%), and other psychotropic drugs (6.1%). Antidepressant drugs were the most common prescription drugs taken for suicidal purposes (P < 0.001). Poisonings occurred with a single agent in 72.5% of cases and with two or more agents in 27.5% of cases. Analysis of duration of hospital stay revealed that 52.6% (n = 60) of patients stayed in hospital for 2 days. The mortality rate was 0.4%.
   Conclusion: The majority of poisonings were with prescription drugs, for suicidal purposes, in young age group, and in females. In our study, the three most common agents causing poisoning were antidepressants, analgesics, and other psychotropic substances.

AB Background: Poisoning is a global public health problem. Self-poisoning has potentially serious consequences. Follow-up studies have found that 3-10% of self-harm patients eventually succeed.
   Objectives: This study was designed to investigate the epidemiological, clinical and economical aspects of deliberate self-poisoning patients admitted to Yenimahalle State Hospital Intensive Care Unit.
   Patients and Methods: The study was carried out retrospectively in Ankara Yenimahalle State Hospital. It included Seventy-one patients over 16 years of age who were admitted to the hospital due to poisoning during 2012. Exposed poisons were classified into one of three categories; pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and alcohols. Cost account was based on the medical invoices at patient discharge. Data were compared using Student's T test and chi-square test. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.
   Results: The female/male ratio was 2.55. The mean age of the 71 poisoned patients was 28.92 +/- 11.51 years. Most of the poisoning agents were pharmaceuticals (68 cases). Among the pharmaceuticals, antidepressants were involved most often, followed by analgesics. There was no statistically significant difference between pharmaceutical agents in terms of hospital cost (P > 0.05). The mean length of hospital stay was 6.4 +/- 4.3 days. There was a statistically significant difference between the lengths of stay of patients in terms of hospital cost (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: The patient cost increased as the length of stay increased due to the policy of bundle pricing.

AB This study sought to determine the prevalence of dissociative disorders among women in the general population, as assessed in a representative sample of a city in central Turkey. The Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule (DDIS), the Borderline Personality Disorder section of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Personality Disorders (SCID-II), and the PTSD-Module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID) were administered to 628 women in 500 homes. The mean age of participants was 34.8 (S.D.= 11.5, range: 18-65); 18.3% of participants (n = 115) had a lifetime diagnosis of a dissociative disorder. Dissociative disorder not otherwise specified (DDNOS) was the most prevalent diagnosis (8.3%); 1.1% of the population was diagnosed as having dissociative identity disorder (DID). Participants with a dissociative disorder had borderline personality disorder, somatization disorder, major depression, PTSD, and history of suicide attempt more frequently than did participants without a dissociative disorder. Childhood sexual abuse, physical neglect, and emotional abuse were significant predictors of a dissociative disorder diagnosis. Only 28.7% of the dissociative participants had received psychiatric treatment previously. Because dissociative disorders are trauma-related, significant part of the adult clinical consequences of childhood trauma remains obscure in the minds of mental health professionals and of the overall community. Revisions in diagnostic criteria of dissociative disorders in the DSM-IV are recommended. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All tights reserved.

AB Background: Fascinating developments in big data technologies and unprecedented diffusion of social networking sites (SNSs) generate unseen opportunities for scientific fields, including psychiatry. This study focuses on the use of SNSs by adolescent psychiatric patients and the potential use of SNS-generated data to help medical practitioners diagnose and treat patients' mental health. Our objective is to understand and measure the psychiatric and individual conditions in which symptom-sharing occurs on SNSs and the frequency of these conditions. Based on literature, we hypothesized that the perceived value of social network sites positively affects adolescents' sharing of symptoms on these sites.
   Subjects and methods: An empirical test of this hypothesis was conducted with a survey of 224 adolescents admitted to a psychiatry clinic in Turkey. The hypothesis was tested using a hierarchical multiple regression analysis.
   Results: The perceived value of SNSs explained an additional 37.8% of variation in symptom sharing on SNSs above and beyond the control variables, which are gender, age, type of disorder, and amount of internet and SNS use. The findings suggested that adolescents share symptoms on SNSs only if they attribute value to the SNSs that they use. We also found that 72% of adolescents in our sample shared their symptoms on SNSs.
   Conclusions: There is an attractive opportunity for information technology companies to develop, together with health professionals; data analytics that are able to detect symptoms to support psychiatric diagnoses and pave the way for big-data enabled personalized medicine.

AB Background: Adolescents tend to have risky behaviors like aggression and self-injury due to the age period characteristics. The risk of aggression and self-injury may increase in adolescents with the addition of chronic diseases.
   Objectives: This study was conducted descriptively to determine and compare the aggression and self-injury in those with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and healthy counterparts.
   Methods: The study sample consisted of 60 adolescents with T1DM followed up in the child endocrinology polyclinic of a university hospital and 319 healthy counterparts, 15-18 aged, at 9th-12th grade at high school. In the study, the permission of the institution, Ethical Committee, the parent and adolescent consent, the data were collected using a questionnaire form, Aggression Questionnaire (AQ) and Inventory of Statements About Self injury (ISAS). The descriptive statistics, Shapiro-Wilk, Mann-Whitney U, Student t, Chi-square, Spearman correlation tests were used for analyzing data.
   Results: The mean scores of AQ all subscales and the total scale of healthy adolescents were higher than adolescents with T1DM (p < 0.05). Mean ISAS scores of adolescents with T1DM were higher than the healthy ones (p > 0.05). The mean scores of autonomic function, social function and ISAS were positively moderately correlated with the mean scores of total aggression in both healthy and diabetic adolescents (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Considering the age period characteristics, training about anger-stress management and effective communication skill to adolescents and their parents may be recommended by health professionals.

AB Objective: To present the radiological features of blast-related injuries in the victims of the 10 October 2015 Ankara bombing and emphasize the importance of imaging.
   Methods: This retrospective descriptive study included a total of 28 patients who underwent CT scan or radiographic imaging within 6 h after the bombing on 10 October 2015. CT scans and plain radiographs were evaluated regarding mechanisms of injuries. Injuries were categorized as primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary. The number of shrapnel and distribution of injuries were noted. Injury Severity Score (ISS) was used to rank the severity of the injury.
   Results: Primary blast injuries consisted of only tympanic membrane rupture. A high rate of patients (21/28 patients) in the study group suffered from secondary blast injuries. Tertiary injuries were detected in only three patients. Of the severely injured patients, five had abdominal injuries, three had thoracic injuries and six had extremity injuries. ISS was significantly higher in patients with thoracic and abdominal injuries.
   Conclusion: Our results after the suicide bomb attacks showed that the most common injury pattern was secondary blast injury. The torso was the most commonly injured body region, followed by the extremities. This specific injury pattern requires the use of immense radiological imaging. Hence, radiologists should be aware of the mechanisms and spectrums of blast-related injuries.
   Advances in knowledge: Both the unique injury pattern and the following chaos make blast-related injuries a challenge in terms of triage, diagnosis and management. Radiologists should be familiar with the wide spectrum of these unique injuries.

AB Purpose: Burn injuries require a multidisciplinary approach. Emergency Departments can play vital roles in the treatment of burns. The purpose of this study is to investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the adult burn patients admitted to our Emergency Department and to determine the frequency of the patients who were treated on an Outpatient basis and discharged front the Emergency Department.
   Procedure: A retrospective review of 314 adult burn patients who presented to the Emergency Medicine Department of Erciyes University Hospital from January 1996 to December 2000.
   Findings: Sixty-four percent of the patients were male. Mean age was 32.9 +/- 14.7. Ninety-nine patients (32%) had moderate to major burns. The highest numbers of patients were in the 21-30 age group. Flame burns comprised the majority of presentations and admissions (48 and 69%, respectively). Thirteen patients had associated injuries (4%). Eighty-seven patients (28%) were hospitalized, 21 of these died. Death occurred mostly from respiratory failure and sepsis. Domestic accidents were the leading mechanism (63%).
   Conclusion: Burns were mostly due to accidents arising from carelessness, ignorance, hazardous traditions and improperly manufactured products. These can be prevented through mass education programs countrywide. Because almost all burn patients present to Emergency Departments first and not all hospitals can employ burn specialists, the patients with minor burns can be treated on an outpatient basis and the treatment of severe burns can be effectively initiated by emergency physicians.

DT Article
DE bullying; mobbing; nurse; physiological stress reaction; work abuse;

AB Aim. This research was conducted as a descriptive and cross-sectional study with the purpose of determining the mobbing experienced by nurses who work in healthcare facilities in Turkey, its emotional, social and physiological effects on the nurses and the actions that the individuals take to escape from the mobbing.
   Background. The term 'mobbing', which includes workplace terrorizing, pressure, frightening, belittling and psycho-terror, is defined as the presence of systematic, directed, unethical communication and antagonistic behaviour by one or more individuals. These actions that occur frequently and continue for a long time are the most serious and effective causes of workplace stress. The person who is the target of the mobbing is left without help, without protection and alone in the workplace. Individuals who are exposed to psychological abuse experience physiological, psychological and social problems that are related to high levels of stress and anxiety. Design and method. The research participants were 505 nurses of whom 325 (64%) worked in public and 180 (36%) in private hospitals. All of the participants were female. A questionnaire developed by the researchers in the light of information in the literature was used for data collection and had four sections including the participants' demographic characteristics and questions asking about mobbing behaviours, reaction to mobbing incidents and actions taken to escape from the mobbing. The data were collected between October and December 2005 by giving an envelope to the participants and then collecting the responses in the closed envelope.
   Findings. The overwhelming majority (86-5%) of the nurses participating in the research reported facing mobbing behaviour in the workplace in the last 12 months. The nurses working at private hospitals faced statistically significantly more mobbing behaviours than those at public hospitals (p <= 0-02). It was determined that the nurses who faced mobbing behaviours gave various physiological, emotional and social reactions to these incidents. The most common behaviours exhibited by the participants to escape mobbing was 'to work harder and be more organized' and 'to work more carefully to avoid criticism'. In addition 10% of the participants stated that they 'consider committing suicide sometimes.'
   Relevance to clinical practice. Mobbing behaviours in the workplace need to be defined and appropriate policies and procedures need to be developed and shared with all employees to prevent the development of these behaviours. In addition, managers should adopt an open managerial approach to prevent the development of these behaviours.

AB Objective: There is limited data to demonstrate the clinical characteristics and variables of psychiatric inpatients in our country.The aim of this preliminary study is to investigate sociodemogrophic and clinical variables of inpatients, who were followed up at a mood disorders unit during a two year period. In addition, patients with depressive disorders and bipolar disorders were compared in terms of these characteristics.
   Method: A total of 36 inpatients were evaluated in the Mood disorder unit of Psychiatry Department of Adnan Menderes University between 16.09.2004 and 01.09.2006. Diagnoses were made according to DSM-IV-TR. Depressive disorders group included patients with either major depressive or recurrent depressive disorders, while bipolar disorders group consisted of patients with bipolar 1, and 11 disorders, schizoaffective disorder-bipolar type, cyclothymic disorder and antidepressant induced mania.
   Results: There were 36 inpatients in total, 26 in bipolar disorders group and 10 in depressive disorders group. Age at onset was 27.7 +/- 1.7 years in bipolar disorders group and 35.3 +/- 4.4 years in depressive disorders group. Psychosocial stress prior to the first episode was a factor in 90% of patients with depressive disorders and in 64% of patients with bipolar disorders. Family history was positive for 66.7% of patients with depressive disorders and or 57.7% of patients with bipolar disorders. History of suicide attempts was frequent in both groups; 66.7% in depressive disorders group and 70% in bipolar disorders group. Any comorbid disorder listed at axis III was present in 40% of patients in depressive disorders group and in 52% at patients in bipolar disorders group. The mean hospitalization period was 36.6 +/- 5.9 days in depressive disorders grou and 40.8 +/- 5.0 days in bipolar disorders group. The use of tricyclic antilepressants were more prevalent in the depressive group, whereas the mood stabilizers and antipsychotics were dominantly preferred in the bipolar group.
   Discussion: The importance of epidemiologic research is increasing in our country as well as other countries recently. Valid and reliable data for bipolar disorders and other psychiatric disorders are required in Turkey. Evaluating the results of studies performed in different regions of our country will contribute to obtain the specific characteristics of psychiatric disorders in Turkey. In the study, the age of onset was earlier in the bipolar group, whereas the existance of a stressor in the first episode was more frequent in the depressive group.

AB Objective: To determine the prevalence of impulse control disorders (ICDs) among medical students and evaluate the related sociodemographic and clinical features. Methods: A total of 277 students in the fourth and fifth year of medical school were included in the study. The study was conducted between September 2011 and June 2012 in Cukurova University Medical School, Adana, Turkey. A demographic data form has been completed. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I) was used to determine axis I psychiatric disorders. The prevalence rates of ICDs were investigated by using the modified version of the Minnesota Impulse Disorders Interview. All patients completed Barratt Impulsiveness Scale Version 11 (BIS-11) and Symptom Check List-90. Results: The lifetime prevalence of at least one ICD in our sample was 11.2% (n= 31). When the participants with the diagnosis of ICDs not otherwise specified were excluded the prevalence rate decreased to 7.9%. The most common ICD was intermittent explosive disorder (6.1%), followed by trichotillomania (2.5%). History of suicide attempts was significantly higher in the group with ICD. There was statistically significant difference between comorbidity of other Axis I psychiatric disorders and a significant difference was observed in terms of total impulsivity, non-planning activity, and motor impulsivity scores as determined by BIS-11 between groups with or without ICDs. Conclusion: ICDs might be underdiagnosed in young adult populations. ICDs affect the quality of life, the course and outcome of comorbid disorders so it is important to ask for these disorders in regular psychiatric interviews and treating them in an appropriate and specific way.

AB Objectives This study aimed to investigate how trauma characteristics and outcomes differ between genders in a rural hospital.
   Methods Records of trauma patients admitted to a state emergency department (ED) in eastern Turkey, between January 2006 and December 2007 were reviewed and data were analysed based on gender.
   Results In total, 5379 (87.0%) men and 806 (13.0%) women, totalling 6185 patients, were assessed. Mean age was 26.5 (1 month - 80 years) years for men and 24.7 (2 month - 81 years) years for women. Men comprised 90.2%, 81.3% and 77.3% of the patients injured by assault, motor vehicle incidents and falls, respectively. Women comprised a significantly larger share of suicide attempts (70.8%) than men. Of the men injured, 90.6% were discharged after treatment in the ED. The per cent of hospitalised women (5.8%) was increased compared with the per cent of hospitalised men (p=0.011). There was a higher frequency of transfer among women (8.6%) when compared with men (p<0.001). Women had a mortality frequency of 1.2%, which was similar to the mortality per cent calculated for men.
   Conclusions Men were at an increased risk for trauma, especially assault. The percentage of women injured and admitted to the ED due to assault was low compared with statistics reported in the literature. However, assault is the most common cause of trauma among women. The high per cent of hospitalisation and transfer among women may indicate that women are exposed to more severe trauma, and therefore experience increased morbidity compared with men.

AB Objective: Poisonings are among the major causes of emergency visits and intensive care hospitalizations. The aim of our study is to evaluate intoxicated patients at follow-up and treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in terms of demographic characteristics, type of poisonings and results of treatment. Materials and Methods: Patients at follow-up aged 17 or older admitted with intoxication to the ICU between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2011 were included in the study. Age, gender, presenting symptoms, duration of hospitalization, type of poisoning, the way of poisoning, medical history, seasons, hospitalization costs, treatment and prognosis of the patients were analyzed. Results: Totally, 153 (8.9%) out of 1375 follow-up patients in the ICU had acute intoxication. The mean age of intoxicated patients was 29.4 11, 68% of them were female, 78.4% of them were under 35 years old, and intoxication was most common in the 17u25 age group. 114 of them (94.1%) were suicidal. The most common cause of poisoning was drug-poisoning by 88.2%, and most common presenting symptoms were nausea and vomiting by 71.2%. Mean length of stay was 2.4 1.6 days, and the average cost of hospitalization was 761 884 Turkish Liras or 271 315 USD. 5 patients (3.3%) were intubated because of respiratory failure. There was no mortal case. Conclusion: Suicide attempts are prominent in acute poisoning, and the young female population is at higher risk. It was found that drugs, particularly antidepressants and antipsychotic agents were the most common cause of poisoning. The high cost of treatment of acute intoxication cases is a major cause of economic burden. Clinicians should be more careful when prescribing such drugs.

DT Article
ID PHYSICIANS ATTITUDES; HEALTH-PROFESSIONALS; ASSISTED SUICIDE; CARE;
   LEGALISATION
AB Background: In Turkey, which is a secular, democratic nation with a majority Muslim population, euthanasia is illegal and regarded as murder. Nurses and students can be faced with ethical dilemmas and a lack of a legal basis, with a conflict of religious beliefs and social and cultural values concerning euthanasia. The aim of this study was to investigate undergraduate nursing students' attitudes towards euthanasia. Method: The study, which had a descriptive design, was conducted with 600 students. The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th year nursing students at a school of nursing were contacted in May 2009, and 383 students (63.8% of the study population of a total of 600 students) gave informed consent. Two tools were used in accordance with questionnaire preparation rules. Results: The majority of students were female and single (96.9%), and their mean age was 21.3 +/- 1.5 years. A majority (78.9%) stated they had received no training course/education on the concept of euthanasia. Nearly one-third (32.4%) of the students were against euthanasia; 14.3% of the students in the study agreed that if their relatives had an irreversible, lethal condition, passive euthanasia could be performed. In addition, 24.8% of the students agreed that if they themselves had an irreversible, lethal condition, passive euthanasia could be performed. Less than half (42.5%) of the students thought that discussions about euthanasia could be useful. There was a significant relation between the study year and being against euthanasia (p < 0.05), the idea that euthanasia could be abused (p < 0.05), and the idea that euthanasia was unethical (p < 0.05). Conclusion: It was concluded that the lack of legal regulations, ethical considerations, religious beliefs, and work experience with dying patients affect nursing students' attitudes towards euthanasia.

AB Objective: Intermittent explosive disorder (IED) is defined as the failure to resist aggressive impulses resulting in repeated acts of verbal and/or physical aggression. Although it is frequently encountered in clinical psychiatric practice, there is a paucity of data concerning IED in the scientific literature both internationally and in Turkey. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of IED and associated sociodemographic and clinical features in a clinical setting.
   Methods: A total of 406 patients who were referred to our psychiatry outpatient clinic for the first time in a six-month period were included in the study. The diagnosis of IED was made using both Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition (DSM-IV) and DSM-5 criteria. Axis I disorder and personality disorder diagnoses were made according to DSM-5 criteria. Diagnoses were based on information from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID I) and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV personality disorders (SCID II), Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), Wender Utah Rating Scale, Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) DSM-IV Based Diagnostic Screening and Rating Scale, a clinical interview conducted by the researcher, and a sociodemographic data form. In addition, participants were administered the Buss-Perry Aggression Scale and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale Version 11 (BIS-11) to assess aggression and impulsivity.
   Results: Lifetime and 12-month prevalence of IED according to DSM-5 were 16.7% and 113%, respectively. Mean age at onset was 16.4 years. The prevalence of lifetime IED was 3.8 times higher in males than females (95% CI = 1.9-7.5); twice as high in individuals living in rural areas compared to those living in urban centers (95% CI = 1.1-3.7); 2.7 times higher among those with lifetime suicide attempt versus those without (95% Cl = 13-5.6); 4.5 times higher in those with lifetime self-injurious behavior compared to those without (95% CI = 2.3-8.7); and 3 times higher in individuals reporting aggression/anger problems in the family compared to those without (95% CI = 1.5-5.9). The prevalences of childhood ADHD, conduct disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder were significantly higher in the IED group.
   Conclusion: The result of the current study has revealed that approximately one-sixth of respondents experienced lifetime IED according to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Statistically significant sociodemographic correlates of IED include gender, urbanicity, history of suicide attempt, history of self -injurious behavior, and family history of aggression/anger problems.

AB Objective: Although the early marriage has decreased worldwide, considerable proportions of girls continue to marry as children. The aim of this study was to examine sociodemografic characteristics, and diagnosis of mental disorders of girls who married younger than 15 years and referred for criminal evaluation. Methods: Forty-eight girls who reported marriage prior to age 15 years, and at the time of evaluation prior to age 18 years were evaluated. Case files, and social observation reports were examined retrospectively by the researchers. The diagnoses of mental disorders were determined with clinical interview based on DSM-IV. Results: It was determined that 45.8% of cases had at least one mental disorder diagnosis and the most frequent diagnoses were major depressive disorder, and adjustment disorder. Posttraumatic stress disorder was detected in 8.2% of cases. 22.9% of cases were married without their consent. 14.6% of cases exposed to physical abuse, and 27.1% of cases had emotional violence by the person they married. 29.2% of cases reported suicidal ideation and 20.8% of cases had suicide attempts. When cases were categorized according to sociodemographic characteristics, a higher rate of mental disorder was found in the cases including marriages of those who did not want to marry, who did not know the person they married before the marriage, who lived in extended families after marriage, who married with people without jobs (unemployed, in prison, at military service), and those exposed to physical and emotional violence by the person they married. Discussion: Although the sample of our study comprises only cases were referred for criminal evaluation, our findings revealed that girls who were married at younger ages were at risk for mental disorders. Our results suggest that essential steps should be taken to protect mental health, and prevent early marriages.

AB In many European countries, the last decade has been marked by an increasing debate about the acceptability and regulation'of euthanasia and other end-of-life decisions in medical practice. Growing public sensibility to a 'right to die' for terminally ill patients has been one of the main constituents of these debates. Within this context. we sought to describe and compare acceptance of euthanasia among the general public in 33 European countries. We used the European Values Study data of 1999-2000 with a total of 41 125 respondents (63% response rate) in 33 European countries. The main outcome measure concerned the acceptance of euthanasia (defined as 'terminating the life of the incurably sick', rated on a scale from I to 10).
   Results showed that the acceptance of euthanasia tended to be high in some Countries (e.g. the Netherlands, Denmark, France, Sweden), while a markedly low acceptance was found in others (e.g. Romania. Malta and Turkey). A multivariate ordinal regression showed that weaker religious belief was the most important factor associated with a higher acceptance: however, there were also socio-demographic differences: younger cohorts. people from non-manual social classes, and people with a higher educational level tended to have a higher acceptance of euthanasia. While religious belief. sociodemographic factors, and also moral values (i.e. the belief in the right to self-determination) could largely explain the differences between countries, our findings suggest that perceptions regarding euthanasia are probably also influenced by national traditions and history (e.g. Germany). Thus, we demonstrated clear cross-national differences with regard to the acceptance of euthanasia, which can serve as an important basis for further debate and research in the specific countries.

TI Ethnicity, self reported psychiatric illness, and intake of psychotropic

AB Study objective-This study hypothesises that the presumed increased risk of self reported longstanding psychiatric illness and intake of psychotropic drugs among Iranian, Chilean, Turkish, and Kurdish adults, when these groups are compared with Polish adults, can be explained by living alone, poor acculturation, unemployment, and low sense of coherence.
   Design-Data from a national sample of immigrants/refugees, who were between the ages of 20-44 years old, upon their arrival in Sweden between 1980 and 1989. Unconditional logistic regression was used in the statistical modelling.
   Setting-Sweden.
   Participants-1059 female and 921 male migrants from Iran, Chile, Turkey, Kurdistan and Poland and a random sample of 3001 Swedes, all between the ages of 27-60 years, were interviewed in 1996 by Statistics Sweden.
   Main results-Compared with Swedes, all immigrants had an increased risk of self reported longstanding psychiatric illness and for intake of psychotropic drugs, with results for the Kurds being nonsignificant. Compared with Poles, Iranian and Chilean migrants had an increased risk of psychiatric illness, when seen in relation to a model in which adjustment was made for sex and age. The difference became non-significant for Chileans when marital status was taken into account. After including civil status and knowledge of the Swedish language, the increased risks for intake of psychotropic drugs for Chileans and Iranians disappeared. Living alone, poor knowledge of the Swedish language, non-employment, and low sense of coherence were strong risk factors for self reported longstanding psychiatric illness and for intake of psychotropic drugs. Iranian, Chilean, Turkish and Kurdish immigrants more frequently reported living in segregated neighbourhoods and having a greater desire to leave Sweden than their Polish counterparts.
   Conclusion-Evidence substantiates a strong association between ethnicity and self reported longstanding psychiatric illness, as well as intake of psychotropic drugs. This association is weakened by marital status, acculturation status, employment status, and sense of coherence.

AB Background and Objectives: Most of the previous studies investigated prevalence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among university students with self report measures. Present study investigated actual prevalence of ADHD and comorbid disorders among university students in Cumhuriyet University of Sivas in Turkey.
   Methods: In the first stage, 980 university students filled in the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale and socio-demographic form, 79 of whom were above the cut-off score of Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale, considered as possible ADHD. They were evaluated in the second stage via structured interview SCID I, SCID II, Adult ADHD Module of MINI Plus. In addition, subjects filled in the self report Adult ADD/ADHD DSM IV-Based Diagnostic Screening and Rating Scale.
   Results: The self report ADHD prevalence rate was 10.1% and the actual prevalence rate of ADHD among the university students was calculated 6.1%. The prevalence of ADHD was greater among male than female (7.0% vs. 5.5%). Among the male students inattentive subtype was 1.6%, hyperactive-impulsive 0.24%, combined 5.1%. Female students were found to be inattentive by 1.45%, hyperactive-impulsive by 0.56% and combined type by 3.48%. Most of the students with ADHD had Axis I (especially depressive disorders) and Axis II disorders (especially cluster B personality disorders). ADHD diagnosis was associated with more cigarette and alcohol use, academic failure, legal problems, somatic complaints and suicide attempts. Students with ADHD were spending more time on the Internet than students without ADHD. Only one student diagnosed with ADHD reported to have had previous ADHD diagnosis.
   Conclusions: ADHD is common among university students. Having a diagnosis of ADHD in early adulthood seems to be associated with psychological, social, and academic problems.

AB Objective To compare the drowning mortality rates and proportion of deaths of each intent among all drowning deaths in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in 2012-2014.
   Design A population-based cross-sectional study.
   Setting 32 OECD countries.
   Participants Individuals in OECD countries who died from drowning.
   Main outcome measures Drowning mortality rates (deaths per 100000 population) and proportion (%) of deaths of each intent (ie, unintentional intent, intentional self-harm, assault, undetermined intent and all intents combined) among all drowning deaths.
   Results Countries with the highest drowning mortality rates (deaths per 100000 population) were Estonia (3.53), Japan (3.49) and Greece (2.40) for unintentional intent; Ireland (0.96), Belgium (0.96) and Korea (0.89) for intentional self-harm; Austria (0.57), Korea (0.56) and Hungary (0.44) for undetermined intent and Japan (4.35), Estonia (3.70) and Korea (2.73) for all intents combined. Korea ranked 12th and 3rd for unintentional intent and all intents combined, respectively. By contrast, Belgium ranked 2nd and 15th for intentional self-harm and all intents combined, respectively. The proportion of deaths of each intent among all drowning deaths in each country varied greatly: from 26.2% in Belgium to 96.8% in Chile for unintentional intent; 0.7% in Mexico to 57.4% in Belgium for intentional self-harm; 0.0% in nine countries to 4.9% in Mexico for assault and 0.0% in Israel and Turkey to 38.3% in Austria for undetermined intent.
   Conclusions A large variation in the practice of classifying undetermined intent in drowning deaths across countries was noted and this variation hinders valid international comparisons of intent-specific (unintentional and intentional self-harm) drowning mortality rates.

AB This study aimed to examine differences in all-cause mortality and main causes of death across different migrant and local-born populations living in six European countries. We used data from population and mortality registers from Denmark, England & Wales, France, Netherlands, Scotland, and Spain. We calculated age-standardized mortality rates for men and women aged 0-69 years. Country-specific data were pooled to assess weighted mortality rate ratios (MRRs) using Poisson regression. Analyses were stratified by age group, country of destination, and main cause of death. In six countries combined, all-cause mortality was lower for men and women from East Asia (MRRs 0.66; 95 % confidence interval 0.62-0.71 and 0.76; 0.69-0.82, respectively), and Other Latin America (0.44; 0.42-0.46 and 0.56; 0.54-0.59, respectively) than local-born populations. Mortality rates were similar for those from Turkey. All-cause mortality was higher in men and women from North Africa (1.09; 1.08-1.11 and 1.19; 1.17-1.22, respectively) and Eastern Europe (1.30; 1.27-1.33 and 1.05; 1.01-1.08, respectively), and women from Sub-Saharan Africa (1.34; 1.30-1.38). The pattern differed by age group and country of destination. Most migrants had higher mortality due to infectious diseases and homicide while cancer mortality and suicide were lower. CVD mortality differed by migrant population. To conclude, mortality patterns varied across migrant populations in European countries. Future research should focus both on migrant populations with favourable and less favourable mortality pattern, in order to understand this heterogeneity and to drive policy at the European level.

TI Think globally, act locally: understanding sexual harassment from a
   cross-cultural perspective
SO MEDICAL EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID MEDICAL-SCHOOL; PERCEPTIONS; EXPERIENCES; PHYSICIANS; SUICIDE; CONTEXT
AB Objectives
   Sexual harassment in medical education has been studied in the Americas, Europe and Asia; however, little is known about sexual harassment in Middle Eastern cultures. Our initial aim was to describe the sexual harassment of female doctors-in-training by male patients and their relatives in Turkey. During our analysis of data, we expanded our objectives to include the formulation of a framework that can provide a theoretical background to enhance medical educators' understanding of sexual harassment across cultures.
   Methods
   Questionnaires were provided to female resident doctors. Respondents were asked about their experiences of sexual harassment, about their reactions and about any precautionary measures they had used. Descriptive statistics were generated using spss software. Qualitative data were analysed using content analysis.
   Results
   Forty-nine (51.0%) of 96 distributed questionnaires were completed. Thirty-three (67.3%) participants stated that they had been sexually harassed by a patient or patient's relative at some point in their career. 'Gazing at the doctor in a lewd manner', selected by 25 (51.0%) participants, was the most common form of harassment. The methods of coping selected by the highest numbers of respondents involved seeking the discharge of the patient (24.2%), avoiding contact with the patient or relatives (24.2%) and showing rejection (21.2%). Participants' comments about the prevention of sexual harassment revealed a deep sense of need for protection. The interface between quantitative and qualitative findings and a review of the literature supported the development of a value-based, cross-cultural conceptual framework linking the valuing of hierarchy and conservatism with the occurrence of sexual harassment.
   Conclusions
   We relate our findings to issues of patriarchy, power and socio-cultural influences that impact both the perpetrator and the target of sexual harassment. Medical educators are responsible for the control and prevention of sexual harassment of students. The globalisation of medical education requires that medical educators use a multi-cultural approach which considers socio-cultural influences and the diversity of female and male students' actions and perceptions of sexual harassment.

AB Background: Children's exposure to violence is a major public health issue. The Balkan epidemiological study on Child Abuse and Neglect project aimed to collect internationally comparable data on violence exposures in childhood.
   Methods: A three stage stratified random sample of 42,194 school-attending children (response rate: 66.7%) in three grades (aged 11, 13 and 16 years) was drawn from schools in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Greece, Romania, Serbia and Turkey. Children completed the ICAST-C questionnaire, which measures children's exposure to violence by any perpetrator.
   Results: Exposure rates for psychological violence were between 64.6% (FYROM) and 83.2% (Greece) for lifetime and 59.62% (Serbia) and 70.0% (Greece) for past-year prevalence. Physical violence exposure varied between 50.6% (FYROM) and 76.3% (Greece) for lifetime and 42.5% (FYROM) and 51.0% (Bosnia) for past-year prevalence. Sexual violence figures were highest for lifetime prevalence in Bosnia (18.6%) and lowest in FYROM (7.6%). Lifetime contact sexual violence was highest in Bosnia (9.8%) and lowest in Romania (3.6%). Past-year sexual violence and contact sexual violence prevalence was lowest in Romania (5.0 and 2.1%) and highest in Bosnia (13.6 and 7.7% respectively). Self-reported neglect was highest for both past-year and lifetime prevalence in Bosnia (48.0 and 20.3%) and lowest in Romania (22.6 and 16.7%). Experiences of positive parental practices were reported by most participating children in all countries.
   Conclusions: Where significant differences in violence exposure by sex were observed, males reported higher exposure to past-year and lifetime sexual violence and females higher exposure to neglect. Children in Balkan countries experience a high burden of violence victimization and national-level programming and child protection policy making is urgently needed to address this.

AB Objective: The effect of domestic violence on mental health takes a significant place among its results. In many studies performed, it was shown that anxiety, depression, drug use and suicide frequency increased in the females facing violence. In this study, it was aimed to determine potential cases of depression and its influencing factors in females, facing violence and other females, using Beck Depression Scale (BDS).
   Material and Method: The research is a cross-sectional study conducted applying a survey form and Beck Depression Scale to identify their socio-demographic and cultural attributes and exposure to violence, to the females in the age group between 15 and 49 years in Health Center Region No 2 in the town of Golbasi in the province of Ankara. The research sample constituted of 300 females selected out of 1304 comprising the population through simple random sampling method.
   Results: 40% of the females involved in the research exposed to domestic violence in the last year. 41,7% of those cases were of emotional violence, 9.2% of physical violence and 3.3% of sexual violence. According to BDS results, the rate of diagnosed depression in the females facing domestic violence, 30.8% is remarkably higher than that in the others, 8.3%. The average of depressive symptom load is high in the females whose education level is elementary school or lower and who are married, not working, a member of an extended family, and/or living in a shanty house. As the education level of their husbands gets higher, marital duration increases over five years and she has an arranged marriage that figure increases. Taking into consideration all these factors as well as domestic violence, exposure of women to violence increases depression element load independently from those factors.
   Conclusion: It was observed that domestic violence, an important and common problem in Turkey and throughout the world, is the determining factor for depression, which is one of its significant effects on woman's mental health, and the result was reached that for the women in our country, avoiding domestic violence is crucial in protecting themselves from depression.
