AB Objectives: National suicide rates fall during times of war. This fits with the notion of the population coming together against a common foe. But, what happens in the case of a war which is not fully supported, which draws the population and families apart? We consider this question by examining the Australian suicide rates during the divisive Vietnam War.
   Methods: We graphed and examined the Australian suicide figures for 1921-2010.
   Results: We found clear evidence of a decrease in the suicide rate for World War II (consistent with other studies), but a marked elevation of suicide during the Vietnam War.
   Conclusions: The elevation of the Australian suicide rate during the Vietnam War is consistent with Durkheim's social integration model - when social integration is lessened, either by individual characteristics or societal characteristics, the risk of suicide rises.

TI Relative Importance of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Depression in
   Predicting Risk of Suicide among a Cohort of Vietnam Veterans
SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR

DT Article
ID COMORBIDITY; MORTALITY; DIAGNOSES
AB Objective Research has demonstrated that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among Vietnam veterans is associated with increased risk of suicide. It is also widely reported that suicide is related to depression. This study examined the effect of PTSD and depression on risk of suicide among a cohort of Vietnam veterans. Method All study subjects were selected from the Department of Veterans Affairs Agent Orange Registry. Suicide risk associated with PTSD was first assessed by comparing the number of suicides among a cohort of 2,874 veterans with PTSD to that of 8,537 veterans not diagnosed with PTSD. Risk of suicide was approximated by hazard ratios (HRs), generated by Cox proportional hazard models, including a model that utilized competing risk analyses. Results The risk of suicide associated with PTSD and depression when examined separately was similar, HR = 7.1 (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.9, 10.3) and HR = 7.2 (95% CI: 4.8-10.8), respectively. Competing risk analysis indicated that veterans with both PTSD and depression compared to veterans with neither diagnosis had the highest risk of suicide, HR = 15.22. Conclusions This study suggests that depression as well as PTSD should be monitored as a way of reducing suicides among Vietnam veterans.

AB Background Attempted suicide is a key predictor of suicide, which is among the dominant causes of young people's deaths worldwide. Very little is known about the characteristics of suicide attempters in Asia, especially in Vietnam. Methods Medical records of 509 patients (515 attempted-suicide events) admitted to Bach Mai General Hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam from 1 January 1999 to 30 April 2001 were analysed according to the criteria of the WHO Multicentre Study of Attempted Suicide. Results The suicide attempters' mean age was 28.3+/-2.9 years. Nearly half (48.7%) were aged 15-24. The female-to-male ratio of patients living in urban areas (2.1:1) was higher than in rural areas (1.2:1). In urban areas, students (32 %) and homeworkers (28%) and, in rural areas, farmers (56 %) and students (17%) were the salient occupational categories. Acute life stressors were the main causes (73.8%) of suicide attempts. Only in some 6% of cases had a psychiatric illness been diagnosed before the suicide attempts. As a means of attempting suicide, intoxication with analgesics and antipyretics (e. g. paracetamol) with low medical lethality scores was a frequent method among the urban patients, the majority of whom (81%) consequently stayed in hospital less than 24 h. Pesticide and rat poison, more commonly (57.2%) used by attempters in rural areas, had higher medical lethality scores and also necessitated more prolonged hospital treatment. Conclusions Some suicide-preventive strategies used in the West for young people may be applicable in Vietnam. Reducing access to pesticides and rat poison is comparable to western efforts to make paracetamol or firearms less freely available. Skills in resolving family and other conflicts can be taught in schools according to WHO's suicide-prevention resources for teachers.

AB Suicide in war veterans has being a focus of researchers, administration and media since the time of Vietnam War. Over the years there has been some research in this area. However till now there is no consensus as to whether suicide rates are higher in war veterans compared to general population. However, studies have shown that veterans have many known risk factors for suicide as found in general population. In addition there is evidence to suggest that some of the risk factors like experience of combat, presence of combat guilt, severe physical trauma and higher prevalence of mental illnesses like depression and PTSD make this population more vulnerable to suicide. There is urgent need to develop suicide prevention programmes specifically for veterans.

AB Much evidence has shown that PTSD is significantly associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Suicide is an important cause of death in veterans, and the risk for intentional death continues to be high many years after service. Specific PTSD symptoms and specific psychological conditions associated with chronic stress reactions may contribute or mediate the association between PTSD and suicidal behavior. Furthermore, patients with PTSD often have comorbid disorders that may lead to a further increase of risk of suicide in these patients. Research has demonstrated that the magnitude of guilt, cluster B symptoms and comorbid depression were associated with increased suicide risk in PTSD Veterans. For the first time since the Vietnam War, the suicide rate in the military is higher than that in the general population, and so preventive strategies are extremely important to reduce suicide risk in deployed troops.

AB The objective of this paper was to investigate methods of poisoning, presence of mental problems, and the rate of psychiatric care among suicide attempters in Vietnam. Three hundred and nine suicide attempters by poisoning admitted to Bach Mai Hospital's Poison Control Center were investigated by trained nurses and qualified psychiatrists. Standardized questionnaires were used to assess methods of suicide, presence of mental problems, and psychiatric care. The most common methods were poisoning by psychotropic drugs in urban, and pesticides in rural areas. ICD-10 confirmed disorders were present in 68% of the cases and 73% rated positive on SRQ-20. Most patients were not in contact with psychiatric care. Restrictions on availability and handling of drugs and pesticides should be reinforced. Better infrastructures are needed for identification and treatment of persons with mental disorders.

TI Life time suicidal thoughts in an urban community in Hanoi, Vietnam
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID GENERAL-POPULATION; IDEATION; PREVALENCE; BEHAVIOR
AB Background: Suicidal thought is a risk factor and a stage in the suicidal process from planning to attempting and dying by suicide. To date, studies on suicidal thought in the general population, especially in Asian communities, have been limited.
   Method: The WHO SUPRE-MISS ( the multisite intervention study on suicidal behaviours) community survey questionnaire was filled in for 2,280 randomly selected residents of the DongDa district of Hanoi, Vietnam by means of face-to-face interviews. This multi-factor questionnaire includes such variables as sociodemographic information, suicidal thought and history of suicide attempts, physical health, alcohol consumption and medication.
   Results: Prevalence rates for life time suicidal thoughts, suicide plans and suicide attempts were 8.9%, 1.1% and 0.4% respectively. Suicidal thoughts are associated with multiple characteristics, such as female gender, single/widowed/separated/divorced marital status, low income, lifestyle ( use of alcohol, sedatives and pain relief medication), but not with low education or employment status. Having no religion and being a Buddhist appear to be protective factors for suicidal thought. The ratio of suicidal thoughts, suicide plans and suicide attempts on a lifetime basis is 22.3: 2.8:1.
   Conclusion: In Vietnam, as in Western and other Asian countries, suicidal thoughts are associated with similar negative psychosocial risk factors, lifestyle and emotional problems, which implies that suicide preventive measure developed elsewhere can be adjusted to Vietnamese condition. Understanding the unique and common risks in a culture may assist in prediction and control.

TI An Innovative Approach to Treating Combat Veterans with PTSD at Risk for

SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
ID VIETNAM VETERANS; CRISIS; HEALTH
AB Suicide rates among military personnel had a significant drop in 2013, but there is no evidence of a drop among veterans. The problem of suicide among combat veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remains a source of concern. The Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs are now calling for innovative treatment approaches to the problem. A short-term psychodynamic therapy presented here may be able to fill that need by dissipating the guilt from veterans' combat-related actions that leads to suicidal behavior. The treatment showed promise of success with veterans of the war in Vietnam. Preliminary work with combat veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan indicates that it may be equally successful in treating them. Basic aspects of the psychodynamic approach could be incorporated into current therapies and should improve their ability to treat veterans with PTSD at risk for suicide.

AB Background The United States military has lost more troops to suicide than to combat for the second year in a row and better understanding combat-related risk factors for suicide is critical. We examined the association of killing and suicide among war veterans after accounting for PTSD, depression, and substance use disorders. Methods We utilized a cross-sectional, retrospective, nationally representative sample of Vietnam veterans from the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study (NVVRS). In order to perform a more in depth analysis, we utilized a subsample of these data, the NVVRS Clinical Interview Sample (CIS), which is representative of 1.3 million veterans who were eligible for the clinical interview by virtue of living in proximity to an interview site, located within 28 standard metropolitan regions throughout the United States. Results Veterans who had higher killing experiences had twice the odds of suicidal ideation, compared to those with lower or no killing experiences (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.073.67), even after adjusting for demographic variables, PTSD, depression, substance use disorders, and adjusted combat exposure. PTSD (OR = 3.42, 95% CI = 1.0910.73), depression (OR = 11.49, 95% CI = 2.1262.38), and substance use disorders (OR = 3.98, 95% CI = 1.0115.60) were each associated with higher odds of suicidal ideation. Endorsement of suicide attempts was most strongly associated with PTSD (OR = 5.52, 95% CI = 1.2125.29). Conclusions Killing experiences are not routinely examined when assessing suicide risk. Our findings have important implications for conducting suicide risk assessments in veterans of war. Depression and Anxiety 00:16, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Previous research documented the elevated risk of suicide and suicidal ideation among Vietnam veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The aim of the current study was to examine which Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, PTSD symptom clusters are most associated with suicidal ideation in this population. Fifty Vietnam combat veterans enrolled in treatment for PTSD responded to the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation and were interviewed with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. In linear regression analysis, it was found that the reexperiencing symptom cluster was significantly associated with suicidal ideation but the other two symptom clusters (avoidance/numbing and increased arousal) were not. Furthermore, scores on a measure of severity of combat exposure were not found to be significantly related to PTSD symptoms or suicidal ideation. The results of this study suggest the importance of reexperiencing symptoms for predicting which individuals with combat-related PTSD are most at risk for suicidal ideation and behavior.

AB This study empirically examines determinants of youth (age 15-24) suicide over the 1960-1998 period. It finds that the rate of youth suicide was positively influenced by the divorce rate, the violent crime rate, and the Vietnam War, and negatively influenced by the percent of the total population composed of those age 15-24. The first three variables have been ignored in the research and the latter is at odds with the "conventional wisdom."

AB Background. Few studies have prospectively examined whether depressive symptoms and other risk factors are associated with a higher risk of suicide death in individuals other than high-risk populations such as psychiatric patients and individuals with self-harm histories. The purpose of the study is to prospectively examine whether depressive symptoms assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) are associated with greater risk of suicide death and whether depressive symptoms and other risk factors are independent predictors of suicide in general-risk populations. Another aim is to evaluate the sensitivity of the BDI for predicting suicide death.
   Methods. 10,238 Korean Vietnam War veterans (mean age: 56.3 years) who participated in two surveys in 2001 were followed up for suicide mortality over 7.5 years.
   Results. 41 men died by suicide. Severely depressed participants had a higher adjusted hazard ratio (aHR = 3.4; 95% CI [1.5-7.7]) of suicide than non-to-moderately depressed ones. Higher suicide risk was associated with more severe depressive symptoms (p for trend = 0.009). After adjustment for depressive symptoms and other factors, very poor health, low education, and past drinking were associated with higher suicide risk, while good health, body mass index, and marital status were not associated with suicide. The sensitivity at the cut-off score of 31 for detecting suicide was higher during the earlier 3.5 years of the follow-up (75%; 95% CI [50-90]) than during the latter 4 years (60%; 95% CI [41-76]).
   Conclusions. Depressive symptoms are a strong independent predictor and very poor health, low education, and drinking status may be independent predictors of future suicide. The BDI may have acceptable diagnostic properties as a risk assessment tool for identifying people with depression and suicidal potential among middle-aged men.

AB Both veterans and jail/prison inmates face an increased risk of suicide. The incarcerated veteran sits at the intersection of these two groups, yet little is known about this subpopulation, particularly its risk of suicide. A Pubmed/Medline/PsycINFO search anchored to incarcerated veteran suicide, veteran suicide, suicide in jails/prisons, and veterans incarcerated from 2000 to the present was performed. The currently available literature does not reveal the suicide risk of incarcerated veterans, nor does it enable meaningful estimates. However, striking similarities and overlapping characteristics link the data on veteran suicide, inmate suicide, and incarcerated veterans, suggesting that the veteran in jail or prison faces a level of suicide risk beyond that conferred by either veteran status or incarceration alone. There is a clear need for a better characterization of the incarcerated veteran population and the suicide rate faced by this group. Implications for clinical practice and future research are offered.

AB Individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD have higher rates of morbidity and mortality as well as an increased risk for death by suicide. Moreover, research has shown that individuals who are diagnosed with (PTSD) are at an increased risk for both suicide ideation and attempts. Among veterans, suicide is far too common and the risk continues to be high for many years following discharge from service. The PTSD-suicidal behavior link has been substantiated by the presence of common risk factors and high rates of comorbidity. War veterans should be adequately assessed for current suicidal behavior on a routine basis.

TI Suicide attempt in a rural area of Vietnam: Incidence, methods used and
   access to mental health care
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Objectives: The study aims to determine the incidence of suicide attempt, describe the methods used, and assess use of health care services including mental health care after suicide attempt in a rural area of Vietnam.
   Methods: All suicide attempters (104) during 2003-2007 were listed, diagnosed and re-evaluated by trained physicians according to the research criteria of the WHO Multicentre Study of Attempted Suicide. All attempters were interviewed by trained medical staff to investigate methods used, socio-demographic characteristics and use of health services.
   Results: The yearly incidence was 10.2 per 100000 person-years, 10.6 per 100000 in males and 9.8 per 100000 in females. 99% of cases committed suicide attempt by poisoning, 62.6% by pesticides and 36.3% by pharmaceutical drugs. 34.3% reported having been in contact with somatic care and 13.2% had received mental health care. Among those who reported some treatment received, 47.5% had been in contact with official health care services, 8.1% had pharmacy keepers' consultation or were treated by traditional healers and 4% reported self treatment.
   Conclusion: The incidence of suicide attempt was lower in this population compared to other settings. While the majority of attempters use pesticides, many had used psychotropic drugs. Contact with mental health services following the attempt was very limited in this setting. Suicide prevention for this high risk group should focus on reducing access to pesticides and psychotropic drugs. Mental health services should be made more accessible in rural areas.

AB Purpose: Despite increasing rates of suicide among youth in Asian cultures, there is a lack of suicide data among 15-24 year-olds, and little is known about the risk and protective factors for suicidality. This study examines the prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts among 15-24 year-olds and identifies the sociodemographic correlates of suicidality in Hanoi, Shanghai, and Taipei.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 17,016 youth aged 15-24 years was conducted in rural and urban areas of Hanoi, Vietnam; Shanghai, China; and Taipei, Taiwan in 2006. Logistic regression was used to analyze correlates of suicidal ideation and attempt across cities.
   Results: The 12-month prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempt was 8.4% and 2.5% across all three cities, respectively. Suicidal ideation was highest in Taipei (17.0%), Shanghai (8.1%), and lowest in Hanoi (2.3%); similar trends were found for suicidal attempts. Younger age cohorts (15-19 year-olds) and females were more likely to report suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts compared with 20-24 year-olds and males. In multivariate logistic regression results, across the three cities, female gender, younger age, family structure, parental support, family history of suicide, migration status, and substance use were associated with suicidal ideation. Factors associated with suicidal attempt included female gender, family history of suicide, parental support, and substance use.
   Discussion: Suicidality is common among Asian youth, with highest levels reported in more industrialized cities. (C) 2012 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB War veterans are at elevated risk of suicide, nonfatal suicide attempts, and suicidal ideation. Suicide is a leading cause of death among veterans. Understanding protective and risk factors for suicide in this high risk group is of great clinical importance, particularly considering the increasing number of war veterans in the United States. The interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide (1) is presented as an explanatory model of suicide in war veterans. In this model, a desire for suicide, comprised of an unmet basic need to belong and a perceived sense of burdensomeness to close others, and the acquired competence to inflict potentially fatal self-harm interact to confer risk for suicide. This chapter describes each component of the interpersonal-psychological theory and its relevance to war veterans. The interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide provides a promising framework to explain suicide in war veterans and may inform the development of screening, prevention, and intervention strategies. Clinical implications derived from the theory and directions for future research are discussed.

AB Rates of suicide among veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) rose significantly from 2005 to 2007, adding to existing concerns about veteran suicide risk by the Department of Veterans Affairs. This paper summarizes the available data about risk and rates of suicide in veterans, including the choice of appropriate comparison groups and the identification of risk factors. The data suggest that taking into account the selection bias of who enters the military (known as the healthy soldier effect), rates of suicide in veterans are higher than expected, especially among activity duty OEF/OIF veterans and even more so among those who experienced injuries and trauma. Thus, the experiences of war and the downstream sequelae, in particular the individuals' psychological reactions and societal responses, lead to suicide risk. This paper describes the VA's response to these data in developing and implementing suicide prevention interventions.

AB Suicidal behavior is a critical problem in war veterans. Combat veterans are not only more likely to have suicidal ideation, often associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, but they are more likely to act on a suicidal plan. Especially since veterans may be less likely to seek help from a mental health professional, non-mental-health physicians are in a key position to screen for PTSD, depression, and suicidal ideation in these patients. The authors discuss the association of PTSD, depression, and suicide in veterans, keys to assessment of suicide risk, and interventions.

AB The current study examines the fluid vulnerability theory (FVT) to determine how the presence of meaning in life explains the emergence of suicide ideation and the transition from suicide ideation to attempts among military personnel and veterans with elevated symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. We used path analysis to determine if the presence of meaning in life and the search for life meaning mediate the relationship between PTSD/depression and suicide ideation that leads to suicide attempts. A total of 393 U.S. service members and veterans (69.7% male; 82.5% Caucasian; mean age = 36.26) enrolled in college completed an anonymous online survey assessing basic demographic information, posttraumatic stress, depression, meaning in life, suicide ideation, and suicide attempts. Results indicate that meaning in life may be an important factor for explaining why some military personnel and veterans do not become suicidal despite their risk of suicide due to clinical conditions (PTSD/depression).

AB As a result of scientific publications indicating that the last two decades have seen an increase in the number of suicides in the US Armed Forces, the topic of suicide in the military of other countries, such as Germany, has also received a lot of attention in media and science alike. Risk factors for suicidal behaviour and suicide were identified in several research projects in the US, Canada, the UK, and Germany. Until now, German suicide research among military service personnel has mainly focused on epidemiological aspects of suicides and suicidality, individual risk factors, sub-groups at risk for suicide, suicides and deployment abroad, and associations of suicide and suicide attempts with acute mental disorders. The key findings are summarized in this review article. Efforts should be made to develop and evaluate risk group-focused and occupation-focused prevention and intervention programs. Future multinational studies should address potential differences between risk groups for fatal and non-fatal suicidal behaviour.

AB Research suggests that combat exposure might increase risk for suicide. The interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide (IPTS) proposes that exposure to painful and provocative experiences such as combat contribute to fearlessness about death and increased pain tolerance, which serve to enhance the individual's capability to attempt suicide. Violent and aggressive combat experiences, in particular, should demonstrate relatively stronger associations to this capability. The current study tests this proposition in a sample of deployed active duty combatants. Results indicate that all types of combat exposure independently contribute to capability for suicide. Consistent with the IPTS, when considering all types of combat simultaneously, combat characterized by violence and high levels of injury and death are associated with relatively stronger associations to this capability.

AB Deployment to a combat zone is a fundamental mission for most military forces, but prior research suggests that there is a complex and nuanced association between deployment and related risk factors for suicide. Deployment and combat experiences vary greatly among military personnel and can affect a variety of protective and risk factors for suicide. This article offers a critical examination of the association among modern U.S. military deployments, suicide attempts, and death while considering the context of a prominent theory of suicide. Although previous work has demonstrated that deployment is not associated with suicide overall in this population, there is growing evidence that risk may be elevated shortly after deployment, and for some subgroups. Specific aspects of combat exposure, including the experience of killing or witnessing death in combat, may be important contributing factors. An analysis of the literature illustrates that deployment-related risk factors for suicide are complex. The limitations of the literature are discussed, and future directions are suggested.

AB Despite evidence that children of male war veterans with combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are at particularly high risk for behavior problems, very little is currently known about suicidal behaviors in this population of youth. This study aimed to examine the prevalence and psychosocial correlates of suicide attempts among psychiatrically hospitalized adolescent offspring of Croatian male PTSD veterans. Participants were psychiatric inpatients, ages 12-18 years. Self-report questionnaires assessed demographics, suicide attempts, psychopathology, parenting style, and family functioning. The prevalence of suicide attempts was 61.5 % (65.2 % for girls and 58.0 % for boys). Internalizing symptoms, family dysfunction, lower levels of maternal and paternal care, and paternal overcontrol were significantly associated with suicide attempts. Our findings suggest that suicide attempts are common among inpatient adolescent offspring of male PTSD veterans and that interventions targeting both adolescent psychopathology and family relationships are needed for adolescents who have attempted suicide.

AB Little is known about suicide variables in women Veterans. The authors reviewed numerous applicable health care and military literary sources regarding suicide in this population. The current article describes the surrounding circumstances, military war/conflict culture, and potential effects on women Veterans, including major collection problems with current Veteran data. Women Veterans are increasingly reporting more behavioral health issues (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder) and attempting suicide upon civilian reintegration. Outcomes from this literature review suggest the importance of nursing advocacy to create better rapport and communication with women Veterans from Vietnam, Gulf I, Iraq, and Afghanistan wars seeking care at civilian health facilities, as some may present with suicidal ideologies.

It provides a review, of existing empirical data concerning factors significantly related to acute suicidal behaviors within high-risk diagnoses. Findings across studies are categorized into risk profiles (as proposed by Clark & Fawcett. 1992) that are meant to aid the clinician in the application of recent research. The profiles are intended as templates in development and clearly require continual updating and clarification as new studies are completed. The article then addresses related management issues such as the importance of viewing risk factors within a comprehensive suicide assessment and the impact of possible negative therapist reactions when working with high-risk patients.

AB Background: Suicide rates among veterans are disproportionately high compared to rates among the general population. Veterans may experience a number of negative emotions (e.g., anger, self-directed hostility, shame, guilt) during periods of postwar adjustment and reintegration into civilian life that may uniquely confer risk for suicide. Mechanisms of these associations, however, are less well studied. The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between negative emotions and suicide risk in veterans through the theoretical framework of the interpersonal theory of suicide.
   Methods: A large sample of veterans (N = 541) completed measures assessing their negative emotions, perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, and suicide risk.
   Results: Self-directed hostility and shame related indirectly to suicide risk through both perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. Thwarted belongingness accounted for the association between anger and suicide risk, whereas perceived burdensomeness accounted for the relationship between guilt and suicide risk.
   Limitations: This study had a cross-sectional design and relied solely on self-report measures.
   Conclusions: These findings provide evidence for the role of negative emotions in conferring risk for suicide in veterans. Clinical implications, limitations, and future research directions are discussed.

AB Expert opinion is divided about whether US military veterans, the vast majority of whom are middle-aged or older, are at increased risk of suicide. To assess the risk of suicide associated with veteran status, the authors conducted a prospective cohort study of 499,356 male participants in the Cancer Prevention Study II. Participants reported their veteran status and other characteristics in 1982 and were followed for mortality through 2004. The relative risk of mortality from suicide according to veteran status at baseline was estimated by using Cox proportional hazards models. During follow-up, 1,248 veterans and 614 nonveterans died by suicide. In age-adjusted analyses, the risk of suicide did not differ by veteran status. Additional adjustment for several sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical factors had little effect on hazard ratios. The authors concluded that the risk of death from suicide among middle-aged and older US males is independent of veteran status and suggest that policies to prevent veteran suicide should focus on factors that may heighten suicide risk rather than on veteran status per se.

AB Background. Previous studies that have examined genetic influences on suicidal behaviour were confounded by genetic vulnerability for psychiatric risk factors. The present study examines genetic influences on suicidality (i.e. suicidal ideation and/or suicide attempt) after controlling for the inheritance of psychiatric disorders.
   Methods. Sociodemographics, combat exposure, lifetime DSM-III-R major depression, bipolar disorder, childhood conduct disorder, adult antisocial personality disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, drug dependence, alcohol dependence and lifetime suicidal ideation and attempt were assessed in 3372 twin pairs from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry who were assessed in 1987 and 1992. Genetic risk factors for suicidality were examined in a multinomial logistic regression model. Additive genetic, shared environmental and non-shared environmental effects on suicidality were estimated using structural equation modelling, controlling for other risk factors.
   Results. The prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt were 16.1 % and 2.4 % respectively. In a multinomial regression model, co-twin's suicidality, being white, unemployment, being other than married, medium combat exposure and psychiatric disorders were significant predictors for suicidal ideation. Co-twin's suicidality, unemployment, marital disruption, low education attainment and psychiatric disorders (except childhood conduct disorder) were significant predictors for suicide attempt. Model-fitting suggested that suicidal ideation was influenced by additive genetic (36 %) and non-shared environmental (64 %) effects, while suicide attempt was affected by additive genetic (17 %), shared environmental (19 %) and non-shared environmental (64 %) effects.
   Conclusions. There may be a genetic susceptibility specific to both suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in men, which is not explained by the inheritance of common psychiatric disorders.

AB Objectives. We sought to examine rates of suicide among individuals receiving health care services in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities over an 8-year period.
   Methods. We included annual cohorts of all individuals who received VHA health care services from fiscal year (FY) 2000 through FY 2007 (October 1, 1999 September 30,2007; N = 8 855 655). Vital status and cause of death were obtained from the National Death Index.
   Results. Suicide was more common among VHA patients than members of the general US population. The overall rates of suicide among VHA patients decreased slightly but significantly from 2000 to 2007 (P < .001). Male veterans between the ages of 30 and 64 years were at the highest risk of suicide.
   Conclusions. VHA health care system patients are at elevated risk for suicide and are appropriate for suicide reduction services, although the rate of suicide has decreased in recent years for this group. Comprehensive approaches to suicide prevention in the VHA focus not only on recent returnees from Iraq and Afghanistan but also on middle-aged and older Veterans.

AB This study aimed to describe the frequency of firearm ownership in veterans entering residential treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and examine the association of firearm ownership with suicide ideation and suicide attempt history, combat exposure, and PTSD symptom severity. Two samples of veterans entering residential PTSD treatment were assessed at intake using self-report measures. Approximately one third of participants endorsed firearm ownership across the two samples. Analyses with a sample predominantly comprised of Vietnam Veterans found that those who endorsed both suicide ideation and prior suicide attempts were less likely to own a firearm compared to suicide ideators and non-suicidal participants. In addition, more frequent combat exposure, but not PTSD symptom severity, was associated with firearm ownership in both samples and most participants endorsed using safe storage practices. These lower rates of firearm ownership generally, and in those with suicide ideation and prior attempts in particular, may reflect an increased focused on means restriction in treatment for combat-related PTSD. Means restriction counseling among PTSD treatment seeking veterans should target those with combat exposure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study examined the timing of suicide and its associated soldier background and postinvestigative events among deployed Army National Guard (ARNG) soldiers from calendar years 2007 through 2014. Suicide deaths were nearly equally distributed between soldiers who had been deployed and those who had not. Among those deployed, however, suicides occurred mostly 1 year or more after having returned from deployment. Soldier background and postsuicide investigative events were associated with the timing of suicide. Having more years of military service, more previous deployments, and being married were associated with in-theater suicides. Soldiers younger in age (17-24 years), single, nonprior service, and lower in rank, in addition to having parent-family conflicts, full-time employment problems, and military transition problems were associated with suicides that had occurred 1-120 days and 120-365 days since return from deployment. Soldiers aged (24-29 years), married, and higher in rank, along with more reported problems including past behavioral health conditions, postdeployment behavior health referrals, criminal behaviors, and military performance were associated with suicides that had occurred 1 year or more after return. Findings likely represent time periods of suicide vulnerability for identifiable groups of soldiers, based on soldier background and events surrounding the suicide. Practical and theoretical implications of the findings are discussed.

AB Iraq and Afghanistan War veterans diagnosed with psychiatric disorders commit suicide at a higher rate than the general population (Kang & Bullman, 2008). Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been identified as a risk factor for suicide in veterans (Bullman & Kang, 1994) and is the most common mental disorder among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans presenting for treatment at Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities (Kang, 2009). Therefore, it is critical for health providers to identify veterans with PTSD who are at high risk for suicide in order to more effectively intervene to promote safety, stabilization, and reduce psychiatric symptoms. In the following paper; we discuss risk for suicide in veterans with PTSD and application of cognitive behavioral therapies to reduce suicidality in high-risk patients. We also discuss pertinent clinical issues common to treating Iraq and Afghanistan War veterans with PTSD.

AB Introduction The risk of suicide among war veterans is a controversial issue, where findings so far have been contradictory.
   Objective This study focusses on suicide in Serbian veterans from the wars in former Yugoslavia in the 1990s in order to create appropriate preventive measures and reduce the number of these fatal cases.
   Methods The autopsy protocols of all 44 suicides committed by war veterans in the Belgrade District population over a period between 1992 and 2000 were investigated. Data were obtained from autopsy records, results of toxicological investigations and psychological autopsy protocols.
   Results Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder were present in 27.3%, major depression in 9.1% and schizophrenia in 6.8% of veterans. The majority of suicides (84.1%) were committed by recruits in the Yugoslav National Army, spending between three and eight months in the zone of war operations. Six committed suicide during the first 30 days after their war activities, while the majority of suicides occurred between five and six years after combat. The most frequent manner of suicide was the use of handguns (56.8%) and bombs (18.2%).
   Conclusion The results of this research may give useful information about the individuals with the highest suicidal risk in order to alleviate the consequences of war psychotraumas in veterans and prevent their growth into a permanent handicap or suicide.

AB This study examines the roles of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and drug dependence in non-fatal suicidality, i.e., suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, among Vietnam veterans in their adult years. The sample includes male veterans deployed to Vietnam, including an oversample of those who tested positive for opiates at their return (n = 642). PTSD, substance abuse, suicidality, and other psychopathology are analyzed using three waves of survey and military data covering the time period from early adolescence to middle adulthood. Measures include the onset and recency of each of the lifetime DSM-IV PTSD symptom criteria, and yearly symptom measures of DSM-IV dependence for alcohol and eight classes of psychoactive substances. Survival and hazard models are applied to assess the effects of drug dependence, PTSD, and other psychopathology on the duration of suicidality. Longitudinal models estimate the casual relationships among PTSD, drug dependence, and suicidality over a 25-year period. Results show evidence of strong continuity of PTSD, drug dependence, and suicidality over time. The causal role of drug dependence on PTSD and suicidality is limited to Young adulthood. Evidence is stronger for self-medication in later adulthood. The results indicate that a life course perspective is needed for the combined treatment of PTSD and drug dependence for severely traumatized populations. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder are at increased risk for suicide attempts. The present study aimed to determine which of the specific DSM-IV symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are independently associated with suicide attempts. Data came from Wave 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). The NESARC has a sample size of N=34653. The full sample size included in analyses was 2322 individuals with PTSD. Among individuals with lifetime PTSD, after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, as well as any mood, substance, personality, or anxiety disorder (excluding PTSD), increasing numbers of re-experiencing and avoidance symptoms were significantly correlated with suicide attempts. Of the specific symptoms, having physical reactions by reminders of the trauma, being unable to recall some part of it, and having the sense of a foreshortened future, were all associated with suicide attempts. These findings will help extend our understanding of the elevated risk for suicide attempts in individuals with PTSD. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is a gap in the literature regarding suicide risk among traumatized individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and this article aims to systematically review literature on the relationship between PTSD and suicidal behavior and ideation. A meta-analysis of 50 articles that examined the association between PTSD and past and current suicidal ideation and behavior was conducted. There was no evidence for an increased risk of completed suicide in individuals with PTSD. PTSD was associated with an increased incidence of prior attempted suicide and prior and current suicidal ideation. Controlling for other psychiatric disorders (including depression) weakened, but did not eliminate, this association. The evidence indicates that there is an association between PTSD and suicidality with several factors, such as concurrent depression and the pre-trauma psychiatric condition, possibly mediating this relationship. There are significant clinical implications of the reported relationship for suicide risk assessment and therapy, and further studies might help to understand the mediating pathways between PTSD and increased suicide risk.

AB The objectives of the current interim report are to measure the extent of the access to care problem, identify and compare the types of patient-and system-based barriers experienced by Vietnam veterans at risk for suicide when seeking care for physical, psychiatric, and substance abuse conditions, analyze patient-perceived quality of care for individuals who obtained access to care, and identify how the care-seeking experience effected future care seeking. This study is based on a longitudinal sample of 494 Vietnam veterans discharged from military service in September 1971 and subsequently identified as at risk for suicide (306 low risk; 188 high risk). Seventy-one percent (350) of 494 participants completed an extensive qualitative and quantitative interview covering, among other topics, physical conditions, psychiatric conditions, substance use, barriers to care, facilitators of care, and quality of care. Barriers, satisfaction, and effect of the experience were compared by type of condition and suicidal risk category using chi(2) analysis and Fisher's as appropriate. The analysis is based on 257 interviews (73 percent) with qualitative data transcribed thus far. Results: Of the 195 patients with self-reported health conditions, 76 (39.0 percent) and 45 (23.1 percent) expressed system-based barriers to care, respectively. The group at higher risk of suicide was significantly more likely (p<0.01) to report patient-based barriers to care and system-based barriers to care (p<0.05), and more likely (p<0.05) to experience negative effects of the care-seeking experience. Both self-perceived and system-based barriers to care pose obstacles for patients at high risk of suicide. Targeted interventions are required to reach out to these patients to address needs for care currently unmet by the health care system and to reduce negative effects of the health care experience.

AB An emerging Literature suggests that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients are at an increased risk for suicide. The objective of this study was: a) to reexamine the relationship between PTSD and suicide by comparing suicide risks of persons with PTSD, to persons with anxiety disorder and to matched controls; and bf to examine the relationship between anger; impulsivity social support and suicidality in PTSD and other anxiety disorders. Forty-six patients suffering from PTSD were compared with 42 non-PTSD anxiety disorder patients and with 50 healthy controls on measures of anger, impulsivity, social support, and suicide risk. Persons with PTSD had the highest scores on the measures of suicide risk, anger, and impulsivity and the lowest scores on social support. Multivariate analysis revealed that in the PTSD group, impulsivity was positively correlated with suicide risk and anger was not. PTSD symptoms of intrusion and avoidance were only mildly correlated with suicide risk at the bivariate level but not at the multivariate level. For the PTSD and anxiety disorder groups, the greater the social support, the lower the risk of suicide. For the controls, social support and impulsivity were not related to suicide risk, whereas anger was. These findings suggest that persons with PTSD are at higher risk for suicide and that in assessing suicide risk among persons with PTSD, careful attention should be paid to levels of impulsivity, which may increase suicide risk, and to social support, which may reduce the risk.

AB As suicide rates in the military rise, increased attention has been placed on the effective management of high-risk service members. Military mental health professionals deployed to combat zones face a number of challenges and barriers for effective risk management that are unique to the deployed setting. To date, there exists no body of literature identifying areas in which suicide risk management differs between garrison and combat settings to guide mental health professionals in improving clinical decision making with respect to managing suicidal service members in combat zones. On the basis of experience gained during deployments to combat zones, the authors outline several key features of the deployed context that can impact suicide risk and its effective management in combat zones and integrate empirical findings relevant to each issue. Considerations for clinical care and risk management are discussed.

AB This cross-cultural study investigates whether religiosity assessed in three dimensions has a protective effect against attempted suicide. Community controls (n = 5484) were more likely than suicide attempters (n = 2819) to report religious denomination in Estonia (OR = 0.5) and subjective religiosity in four countries: Brazil (OR = 0.2), Estonia (OR = 0.5), Islamic Republic of Iran (OR = 0.6), and Sri Lanka (OR = 0.4). In South Africa, the effect was exceptional both for religious denomination (OR = 5.9) and subjective religiosity (OR = 2.7). No effects were found in India and Vietnam. Organizational religiosity gave controversial results. In particular, subjective religiosity (considering him/herself as religious person) may serve as a protective factor against non-fatal suicidal behavior in some cultures.

AB The study aimed to explore the suicidal process, suicidal communication and psychosocial situation of young suicide attempters in a rural community in Hanoi, Vietnam. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, in a community setting, with 19 suicide attempters aged 15-24 who had been consecutively hospitalized in an intensive care unit. In 12 of 19 cases, the first pressing, distinct and constant suicidal thoughts appeared less than one day before the suicide attempt in question. However, distress and mild, fleeting suicidal thoughts had been present up to six months before the suicide attempt in 16 cases. Five respondents had a suicide plan one to three days before attempting suicide. Altogether, 13 engaged in some form of suicidal communication before their attempt. This communication was, however, difficult for outsiders to interpret. Twelve of the respondents were victims of regular physical abuse and 16 had suffered psychological violence for at least one year before attempting suicide. Eighteen of the respondents used pesticides or raticides in their suicide attempts. None sought advice or consultation in the community despite long-standing psychosocial problems. The strategy of reducing the availability of suicide means (e.g., pesticides or raticides) in Asian countries should be complemented with a long-term suicide-preventive strategy that targets school dropouts and domestic violence, and promotes coping abilities and communication about psychological and social problems as well as recognition of signs of distress and suicidal communication.

AB Objectives. We assessed the risk of suicide among veterans compared with nonveterans.
   Methods. Cox proportional hazards models estimated the relative risk of suicide, by self-reported veteran status, among 500 822 adult male participants in the National Death Index (NDI) linked National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a nationally representative cohort study.
   Results. A total of 482 male veterans died by suicide during 1 837 886 person-years of follow-up (76% by firearm); 835 male nonveterans died by suicide during 4 438 515 person-years of follow-up (62% by firearm). Crude suicide rates for veterans and nonveterans were, respectively, 26.2 and 18.8 per 100 000 person-years. The risk of suicide was not significantly higher among veterans, compared with nonveterans, after adjustment for differences in age, race, and survey year (hazard ratio = 1.11; 95% confidence interval = 0.96, 1.29).
   Conclusions. Consistent with most studies of suicide risk among veterans of conflicts before Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom, but in contrast to a previous study using the NDI-linked NHIS data, we found that male veterans responding to the NHIS were modestly, but not significantly, at higher risk for suicide compared with male nonveterans.

AB IMPORTANCE A pressing question in military suicide prevention research is whether deployment in support of Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom relates to suicide risk. Prior smaller studies report differing results and often have not included suicides that occurred after separation from military service.
   OBJECTIVE To examine the association between deployment and suicide among all 3.9 million US military personnel who served during Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom, including suicides that occurred after separation.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort design used administrative data to identify dates of deployment for all service members (October 7, 2001, to December 31, 2007) and suicide data (October 7, 2001, to December 31, 2009) to estimate rates of suicide-specific mortality. Hazard ratios were estimated from time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression models to compare deployed service members with those who did not deploy.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Suicide mortality from the Department of Defense Medical Mortality Registry and the National Death Index.
   RESULTS Deployment was not associated with the rate of suicide (hazard ratio, 0.96; 99% CI, 0.87-1.05). There was an increased rate of suicide associated with separation from military service (hazard ratio, 1.63; 99% CI, 1.50-1.77), regardless of whether service members had deployed or not. Rates of suicide were also elevated for service members who separated with less than 4 years of military service or who did not separate with an honorable discharge.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Findings do not support an association between deployment and suicide mortality in this cohort. Early military separation (<4 years) and discharge that is not honorable were suicide risk factors.

AB Suicide rates have been increasing in military personnel since the start of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, and it is vital that efforts be made to advance suicide risk assessment techniques and treatment for members of the military who may be experiencing suicidal symptoms. One potential way to advance the understanding of suicide in the military is through the use of the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide. This theory proposes that three necessary factors are needed to complete suicide: feelings that one does not belong with other people, feelings that one is a burden on others or society, and an acquired capability to overcome the fear and pain associated with suicide. This review analyzes the various ways that military service may influence suicidal behavior and integrates these findings into an overall framework with relevant practical implications. Findings suggest that although there are many important factors in military suicide, the acquired capability may be the most impacted by military experience because combat exposure and training may cause habituation to fear of painful experiences, including suicide. Future research directions, ways to enhance risk assessment, and treatment implications are also discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Unpleasant health outcomes are common in deprived communities and have been shown a direct connection between socioeconomic status and wellbeing but, the effect of the socioeconomic status on suicide is currently controversial. This study explored the relationship of the socioeconomic status and addiction and mental disorders in suicide attempts and decomposed inequalities into its determinants to calculating share of contribution to the inequality.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study recognized 546 suicide deaths and 6818 attempted suicides from 1 Jan 2010 to 31 Dec 2014 in Ilam Province, West of Iran. Inequality measured by concentration index (CI) and decomposing contribution in inequality. All analysis was performed by standard statistical software, Stata (Ver. 11.2).
   Results: The pooled rate of death in people with suicide attempts was 8.0% and that of having a history of suicide was 5.2%. The overall CI for addiction was -0.233 (95% CI= -0.383 to -0.084), and the CI for mental disorders was 0.0006 (95% CI = -0.009 to 0.010). The more amount of contribution to socioeconomic inequality in suicide attempts because of age group of < 25 yr (26%), socioeconomic level (23%), and marital status (22%).
   Conclusion: Addiction and mental disorders were distributed among suicide attempters unequally and gap between advantaged and disadvantaged attempted suicide confirmed by our results. Addiction prevention-related policies and programmers' should be focus on disadvantaged groups.

TI Attachment Representation and Suicidal Ideation in Vietnam Combat
   Veterans With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
SO ARCHIVES OF SUICIDE RESEARCH

DT Article
DE attachment; combat veterans; posttraumatic stress disorder; suicide
ID HISTORY; ORGANIZATION
AB Attachment representation has been linked to psychopathology and suicidality. Possible links between attachment representations and suicidal ideation in a PTSD sample were examined. Vietnam combat veterans in treatment for PTSD (N = 48) were assessed for PTSD severity, attachment representation and current and lifetime suicidality. Contrary to expectation individuals with secure attachment representations had higher levels of current suicidal ideation than those with insecure attachment representations, and unresolved/disorganized attachment was associated with lower levels of current suicidal ideation. Secure attachment may not provide protection against high levels of distress and suicidal ideation among combat veterans with PTSD.

AB Background: Military veterans are particularly Vulnerable to suicide compared with their civilian peers. Scant attention has been devoted to the problem of firearm suicide among veterans, particularly women. The purpose of this study was to examine the rate, prevalence, and relative odds of firearm use among veteran suicide decedents in the general population.
   Methods: The analyses are based on data derived from 28,534 suicide decedents from the 2003 to 2006 National Violent Death Reporting System. Results: Across the age groups, male and female veterans had higher firearm suicide rates than nonveterans. Among males and females, younger veterans (18-34 years) had the highest firearm and total suicide rates. The male and female veteran suicide decedents were, respectively, 1.3 and 1.6 times more likely to use firearms relative to nonveterans after adjusting for age, marital status, race, and region of residence.
   Conclusions: Although violent death and the use of firearms are generally associated with men, the results reported here suggest that firearms among female veterans deserve particular attention among health professionals within and outside the veterans affairs system. In addition, the focus should not be exclusively on the Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom military cohort but also on men and women who served in earlier combat theaters, including the Gulf war, Vietnam Era, Korean Conflict, and World War II.

AB Lifetime suicidality was assessed in a cohort of 448 ageing Australian Vietnam veterans and 237 female partners during in-person structured psychiatric interviews that permitted direct comparison with age-sex matched Australian population statistics. Relative risks for suicidal ideation, planning and attempts were 7.9, 9.7 and 13.8 times higher for veterans compared with the Australian population and for partners were 6.2, 3.5 and 6.0 times higher. Odds ratios between psychiatric diagnoses and suicidality were computed using multivariate logistic regression, and suicidality severity scores were assigned from ideation, planning and attempt, and analysed using ordinal regression. PTSD, depression alcohol disorders, phobia and agoraphobia were prominent predictors of ideation, attempts and suicidal severity among veterans, while depression, PTSD, social phobia and panic disorder were prominent predictors among partners. For veterans and their partners, PTSD is a risk factor for suicidality even in the presence of other psychiatric disorders, and is stronger in Vietnam veterans than their partners.

TI Socio-Ecological Risk Factors for Prime-Age Adult Death in Two Coastal
   Areas of Vietnam
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MORTALITY; SUICIDE; HEALTH; PATTERNS; ALCOHOL
AB Background: Hierarchical spatial models enable the geographic and ecological analysis of health data thereby providing useful information for designing effective health interventions. In this study, we used a Bayesian hierarchical spatial model to evaluate mortality data in Vietnam. The model enabled identification of socio-ecological risk factors and generation of risk maps to better understand the causes and geographic implications of prime-age (15 to less than 45 years) adult death.
   Methods and Findings: The study was conducted in two sites: Nha Trang and Hue in Vietnam. The study areas were split into 500x500 meter cells to define neighborhoods. We first extracted socio-demographic data from population databases of the two sites, and then aggregated the data by neighborhood. We used spatial hierarchical model that borrows strength from neighbors for evaluating risk factors and for creating spatially smoothed risk map after adjusting for neighborhood level covariates. The Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure was used to estimate the parameters. Male mortality was more than twice the female mortality. The rates also varied by age and sex. The most frequent cause of mortality was traffic accidents and drowning for men and traffic accidents and suicide for women. Lower education of household heads in the neighborhood was an important risk factor for increased mortality. The mortality was highly variable in space and the socio-ecological risk factors are sensitive to study site and sex.
   Conclusion: Our study suggests that lower education of the household head is an important predictor for prime age adult mortality. Variability in socio-ecological risk factors and in risk areas by sex make it challenging to design appropriate intervention strategies aimed at decreasing prime-age adult deaths in Vietnam.

ID MILITARY; WAR; RISK; IRAQ; CARE
AB Many deployed women Veterans, as described in a previous article, have experienced similar combat exposure as their male counterparts in wars since 1990. Upon reintegration, many Veterans visit civilian health facilities with behavioral health issues, sometimes voicing and/or attempting suicide. Effective nursing assessment and actions are needed to specifically care for this unique population. Any suicide variables (e.g., ideation, attempts, completed) are concerning; therefore, all women Veterans from the Vietnam, Gulf I, Iraq, and Afghanistan wars should be assessed. The first priority is always patient safety. Timely and frequent screening for a variety of risk factors, documented for both men and women Veterans, and women specifically, are important. Symptomology may not become evident for 3 to 15 months into reintegration. Applicable dialogue can recognize changing thoughts, judgment, and behavior patterns. Health promotion efforts, interventions, and resourceful referrals are provided.

AB Background
   Few studies have examined suicide risk in individuals once they have left the military. We aimed to investigate the rate, timing, and risk factors for suicide in all those who had left the UK Armed Forces (1996-2005).
   Methods and Findings
   We carried out a cohort study of ex-Armed Forces personnel by linking national databases of discharged personnel and suicide deaths (which included deaths receiving either a suicide or undetermined verdict). Comparisons were made with both general and serving populations. During the study period 233,803 individuals left the Armed Forces and 224 died by suicide. Although the overall rate of suicide was not greater than that in the general population, the risk of suicide in men aged 24 y and younger who had left the Armed Forces was approximately two to three times higher than the risk for the same age groups in the general and serving populations (age-specific rate ratios ranging from 170 to 290). The risk of suicide for men aged 30-49 y was lower than that in the general population. The risk was persistent but may have been at its highest in the first 2 y following discharge. The risk of suicide was greatest in males, those who had served in the Army, those with a short length of service, and those of lower rank. The rate of contact with specialist mental health was lowest in the age groups at greatest risk of suicide (14% for those aged under 20 y, 20% for those aged 20-24 y).
   Conclusions
   Young men who leave the UK Armed Forces were at increased risk of suicide. This may reflect preservice vulnerabilities rather than factors related to service experiences or discharge. Preventive strategies might include practical and psychological preparation for discharge and encouraging appropriate help-seeking behaviour once individuals have left the services.

AB Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is frequently associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Suicide is an important cause of death in veterans, and the risk for intentional death continues to be high many years after service. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether there is a relationship between PTSD and suicidal behavior among veterans. We also discussed the risk factors of suicide among war veterans with PTSD. A systematic review was conducted focusing on war-related PTSD and suicidal behavior. A total of 80 articles from peer-reviewed journals were identified, 34 were assessed for eligibility, and 16 were included. Having a history of PTSD is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality and increased the risk for suicidal behavior. The association between PTSD and suicidal behavior was confirmed by the presence of other risk factors and high rates of comorbidity. Current suicidal behavior should be adequately assessed in war veterans.

   Method: Data came from the Canadian Community Health Survey: Mental Health and Well-Being Canadian Forces Supplement (CCHS-CFS), a cross-sectional survey that provided a comprehensive examination of mental disorders, health, and the well-being of currently active Canadian military personnel (n = 8441: aged 16 to 54 years: response rate 81.1% ). Respondents were asked about exposure to 28 traumatic events that occurred during their lifetime. Suicide attempts were measured using a question about whether the person ever "attempted Suicide or tried to take [his or her] own life."
   Results: The prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts for currently active Canadian military men and women was 2.2% and 5.6%, respectively. Sexual and other interpersonal traumas (for example, rape, sexual assault, Spousal abuse, child abuse) were significantly associated with suicide attempts in both men (adjusted odds ratios [AORs] ranging from 2.31 to 4.43) and women (AORs ranging from 1.73 to 3.71), even after adjusting for sociodemographics and mental disorders. Additionally, the number of traumatic events experienced was positively associated with increased risk Of Suicide attempts, indicating a dose-response effect of exposure to trauma.
   Conclusions: The Current Study is the first to demonstrate that Sexual and other interpersonal traumatic events are associated with suicide attempts in a representative sample of active Canadian military men and women.

AB INTRODUCTION Violent acts in young people constitute one of the most serious forms of violence in any society. Violence by young people in schools, on the streets, and in their families has been documented in many studies worldwide. Homicide and non-fatal assaults involving young people have been reported as a great global burden of premature death, injury and disability. Adolescents and young people are both the main victims and perpetrators of such violence. In Vietnam, an emerging pattern of health problems in adolescents related to intentional injury and violence is drawing increasingly more attention from government and the public.
   OBJECTIVE Describe the situation of intentional injury among Vietnamese youth, including risk and protective factors, in order to suggest policy implications.
   METHODS The 2003 Survey Assessment of Vietnamese Youth was used as a data source, providing a nationally representative sample of 7584 youth aged 14-25 years, resident in 42 of the country's 61 provinces. This sample was drawn from the 45,000 households in the 2002 Vietnam Living Standards Survey, with a multi-staged and stratified design, using the probability-proportional-to-size method to maintain representativity. Data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate statistical techniques.
   RESULTS Of the sample of young people, 2.2% reported injury resulting from violent behavior by a family member and 8.0% by non-family members, the latter demonstrating a significantly higher rate among males than females (13.6% vs. 2.4%). Characteristics of youth most likely to hurt others included: male sex, inebriation at some point, victims of intentional injury, group riot participants and carriers of weapons. Youth who had been members of mass social organizations or clubs in the community were half as likely to hurt other people as those who were unaffiliated with such groups. Females were almost four times more likely than males to attempt suicide. Other risk factors for suicide attempts were past inebriation (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.3-5.4), ever having been a victim of intentional injury by a family member (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.1-11.5) or ever having had feelings of hopelessness (OR 6.5, 95% CI 3.3-13.6).
   CONCLUSIONS Prevalence of violence and self-harm among Vietnamese youth is comparatively less than in Western and other Asian countries. Risk and protective factors appear similar to those found in most populations. In particular, this study indicated a possible protective effect of membership in social groups. National policy for injury prevention should include strategies to reduce violence and self-harm within this population group.

AB Studies of completed suicide by history of military service have produced inconsistent findings; no representative population-based study has compared the risk of nonfatal suicidal behavior among veterans with risk among nonveterans. The objective of this study was to examine whether male veterans of the U. S. military are at heightened risk of suicidal ideation, compared with males who never served in the U. S. military. A total of 17,641 adult men completed the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Subjects provided information about history of ever having served in the U. S. armed forces, past suicidal ideation, alcohol and drug abuse and dependence, measures of psychological distress, and sociodemographic data. Overall, men who had ever served in the armed forces were no more likely than men who had never served to report having seriously considered suicide over the prior 12 months. Military status was not differentially associated with other known suicide risk factors assessed by NSDUH, including psychiatric disorders. Our findings suggest that evidence-based suicide prevention strategies applicable to the general population should be employed to reduce suicide risk among the veteran population as well.

AB Purpose: Despite robust empirical and theoretical evidence for higher rates of suicide among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youths, little is known about the relationship between suicide and sexual orientation among Asian youths. This study examined differences in prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts between LGB and heterosexual youths in the cities of Hanoi, Shanghai, and Taipei, China.
   Methods: The data are from a community-based multi-centre cross-sectional study conducted from 2006 to 2007, with a sample of 17 016 youths aged 15-24 years from Hanoi, Shanghai, and Taipei. Chi-square test and logistic regression were used to evaluate correlates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.
   Results: The overall prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in the preceding 12 months in LGB youths were both higher than in heterosexual youth (12.8% vs. 8.1% and 4.0% vs. 2.4%, respectively). Stratified by city, the prevalence of suicidal ideation was lowest in Hanoi (2.2%), followed by Shanghai (8.0%) and Taipei (17.0%). Similar trends were observed in the prevalence of suicide attempts, which was lowest in Hanoi (0.3%), followed by Shanghai (1.2%) and Taipei (2.5%). Of note, however, multivariate logistic regression results revealed that LGB youth were at a higher risk for suicidal ideation than heterosexual youth only in Taipei (odds ratio 1.65).
   Conclusions: Suicidality is common among Asian youth, with higher prevalence observed in urbanized cities. LGB youths are at greater risk of suicidal ideation than their heterosexual counterparts in Taipei than in the other two examined cities.

AB Background. There appears to be a strong connection between suicidality and the experience of trauma. The study investigated suicidality in chronic civilian post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Method. Ninety-four participants suffering from chronic PTSD were assessed for suicidal ideation, plans and attempts since the index trauma as part of a comprehensive assessment. The prevalence of these was assessed and characteristics of those reporting suicide-related thoughts and behaviour were investigated through logistic and multinominal regression analyses. Results. Over half of the sample (56.4%) reported some aspect of suicidality with 38.3% reporting ideation, 8.5% reporting suicide plans and 9.6% having made suicide attempts since the trauma. Of the nine participants who reported suicide attempts, six had made more than one attempt. The proportions of participants who reported suicidality in this sample were significantly greater than reported within the general population, when comparisons were made with an epidemiological study. Logistic regression analysis indicated that a unit increase in life impairment (OR = 3.1) and depression (OR = 1.14) scores were independently and significantly associated with suicidality. Multinominal regression indicated that life impairment (OR = 2.71) and depression (OR = 1.13) scores were associated with the presence of suicidal ideation compared to no ideation, and life impairment (OR = 5.75), depression (OR = 1.2) scores and receiving psychotropic medication (OR = 10.6) were associated with the presence of plans and attempts compared to no suicidal behaviour. Conclusions. Suicide risk is elevated in those suffering from chronic PTSD and is associated with impaired functioning in combination with depression.

DT Article
DE moral wound; complex trauma; returning from war; veterans' suicide;

ID SUICIDE
AB The moral wound, rendered symbolically in the form of the tiger in Life of Pi, is a complex trauma in which the victim, in order to survive in life-threatening circumstances, commits an ethical transgression against his or her deeply held values. Pi experiences such a trauma and deals with it by dissociating it in the form of the tiger and then has to simultaneously both preserve the tiger and wish it to disappear. Jonathan Shay's work relating the experiences of returning Vietnam veterans to Homer's Odyssey is used to further an understanding of both Life of Pi and American soldiers returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Reasons are considered for the possible delayed effect of trauma as a factor in the increased suicide rate of older veterans. Finally, the concept of the moral wound is discussed, with an eye to its treatment.

AB Objectives This study measured bullying roles across an academic year and examined how change in bullying experiences is associated with symptoms of depression, psychological distress, and suicidal ideation among adolescents in Vietnam.
   Methods 1424 students in middle and high schools completed two self-administered questionnaires, six months apart in 2014-2015.
   Results Students who were victimised often and those who were classified as highly involved as both victims and bullies at one or both survey times showed significantly higher levels of depression, psychological distress, and suicidal ideation than other students. The mental health of adolescents who were involved in bullying as a victim or bully remained at low levels was generally similar to those not involved in any bullying. However, females who had stable but low level in victimisation or bully-victim status had worse mental health than males with stable-low-level exposure.
   Conclusion This is the first longitudinal analysis of bullying among adolescents in Vietnam. Persistent and frequent bullying was strongly linked with poor mental health for males and females. A new observation is that Vietnamese girls appear to be more sensitive to low level but long-term bullying involvement than were boys.

AB Background: There is a rapidly growing public awareness of mental health problems among Vietnamese secondary school students. This study aims to determine the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation, to identify related risk factors, and to explore students' own proposals for improving their mental health.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1161 secondary students in Can Tho City, Vietnam during September through December, 2011. A structured questionnaire was used to assess anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation and proposed solutions. Depression was measured using the Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale.
   Results: The prevalence estimates of symptoms reaching a threshold comparable to a diagnosis of anxiety and depression were 22.8% and 41.1%, respectively. Suicide had been seriously considered by 26.3% of the students, while 12.9% had made a suicide plan and 3.8% had attempted suicide. Major risk factors related to anxiety and depression were physical or emotional abuse by the family, and high educational stress. As proposed solutions, nearly 80% of students suggested that the academic workload should be reduced and that confidential counselors should be appointed at schools. About half the students stated that the attitudes of their parents and teachers needed to change. A significant majority said that they would visit a website that provided mental health support for students.
   Conclusions: Anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation are common among Vietnamese secondary school students. There are strong associations with physical and emotional abuse in the family and high educational stress. Academic curricula and attitudes of parents and teachers need to be changed from a punitive to a more supportive approach to reduce the risk of poor mental health. An internet-based mental health intervention could be a feasible and effective first step to improve students' mental health.

AB Circumstances of modern wars have placed service members at risk for harming noncombatants and engaging in other possible morally injurious acts. Studying a sample of 1,203 combat veterans from the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study (NVVRS), this investigation used structural equation modeling (SEM) to test (1) whether experiences of abusive violence are positively directly linked with drug or alcohol problems and suicidality when accounting for traditional combat stressors, and (2) to what extent experiences of abusive violence have positive indirect effects on these postdeployment outcomes via posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and war-related guilt. Overall, 40% of the sample had witnessed or were directly involved in acts of abusive violence while deployed in Vietnam. When controlling for the effects of traditional combat stressors, SEM results revealed that exposure to acts of abusive violence in Vietnam was linked indirectly with substance abuse via PTSD symptoms and both directly and indirectly with suicidality via PTSD symptoms. There was also a significant link between atrocity exposure and war-related guilt in the model, but veterans' remorse about behavior in Vietnam failed to uniquely predict study outcomes beyond the symptomatology of PTSD. These findings highlight the effects of disproportionate warzone violence on postdeployment mental health, while also suggesting the need for broader conceptual models of combat trauma.

AB In this study, we used data from national surveys of U.S. veterans and nonveterans to investigate whether military service increased risk for incarceration compared to nonveteran peers. White veterans aged thirty-five to fifty-four (early years of the All Volunteer Force and the Vietnam era) were at higher risk for incarceration than white nonveterans. Black and Hispanic veterans of these eras were generally at lower risk of incarceration than age- and race-matched nonveterans. For all racial/ethnic groups, the risk of incarceration among veterans compared to nonveterans declined among those who served in the later years of the implementation of the All Volunteer Force. These findings may reflect the disadvantaged backgrounds of recruits during the early implementation of the All Volunteer Force, from 1973 to 1980, and the improved quality of personnel recruited after 1980. Among all males, the risk of incarceration was not elevated among Vietnam-era and World War II veterans.

AB Background: Suicide is a global public health problem. Recently in the U. S., much attention has been given to preventing suicide and other premature mortality in veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. A strong predictor of suicide is a past suicide attempt, and suicide attempters have multiple physical and mental comorbidities that put them at risk for additional causes of death. We examined mortality among U. S. military veterans after hospitalization for attempted suicide.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted with all military veterans receiving inpatient treatment during 1993-1998 at United States Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities following a suicide attempt. Deaths occurring during 1993-2002, the most recent available year at the time, were identified through VA Beneficiary and Records Locator System data and National Death Index data. Mortality data for the general U. S. adult population were also obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics. Comparisons within the veteran cohort, between genders, and against the U. S. population were conducted with descriptive statistics and standardized mortality ratios. The actuarial method was used estimate the proportion of veterans in the cohort we expect would have survived through 2002 had they experienced the same rate of death that occurred over the study period in the U. S. population having the age and sex characteristics.
   Results: During 1993-1998, 10,163 veterans were treated and discharged at a VA medical center after a suicide attempt (mean age = 44 years; 91% male). There was a high prevalence of diagnosed alcohol disorder or abuse (31.8%), drug dependence or abuse (21.8%), psychoses (21.2%), depression (18.5%), and hypertension (14.2%). A total of 1,836 (18.1%) veterans died during follow up (2,941.4/100,000 person years). The cumulative survival probability after 10 years was 78.0% (95% CI = 72.9, 83.1). Hence the 10-year cumulative mortality risk was 22.0%, which was 3.0 times greater than expected. The leading causes overall were heart disease (20.2%), suicide (13.1%), and unintentional injury (12.7%). Whereas suicide was the ninth leading cause of death in the U. S. population overall (1.8%) during the study period, suicide was the leading and second leading cause among women (25.0%) and men (12.7%) in the cohort, respectively.
   Conclusions: Veterans who have attempted suicide face elevated risks of all-cause mortality with suicide being prominent. This represents an important population for prevention activities.

AB War, for whatever reason, can only mean massive social change. The human casualties of war due to these changes are not restricted to the soldiers who fight the war but the civilians on or near whose soil the war is conducted. The literature appears to associate a war-effect with suicide in various ways e.g. lowered suicide rate during a war but increased suicide using firearms by civilians, increased suicide in the army. However, most western researchers have concentrated on the returning soldiers from Vietnam, the Gulf, Afghanistan or Iraq. The literature suggests that the trauma of war for the soldiers (observing 'buddies' being gunned down/blown up and the trauma associated with modem warfare) is the cause of personality changes/depression and therefore the cause of suicide. By the same token, on the one hand not all returnees from active duty commit suicide and on the other such a trauma induced change due to war will also be prevalent in the civilian population; those, whose loved ones have been blown apart in front of them. In the context of suicide and war there are two main issues to consider. The first is understanding suicide, and the second is the provision of a health care service. Social and economic and environmental changes due to a decision to go to war will clearly cause changes at an individual level. As suggested elsewhere, it would be far too simplistic to associate the cause of change with the act of suicide. That is, out of those who are exposed to change, a small proportion will complete suicide, despite receiving medical help. In this chapter, it is argued that in spite of the large body of literature we are no further forward in understanding suicide. Furthermore, since macro-level changes are purely due to governments' actions it is their responsibility to protect their populations from suicide. But since we have little idea of the dynamics of suicide this responsibility must be focused towards improving the quality of life of those affected by war. It is unreasonable for the Army to promise more of the same suicide prevention programmes time and again given the year on year increase in the suicide rate. Furthermore, it is not sufficient to rely on the over stretched and ill-equipped health services to mop up the aftermath of massive social change due to a policy change or failed policies. Polices that are designed to affect social, political, economic or other changes must have public protection strategies built-in as standard, backed up with a unified database.

AB Despite well-documented postdeployment readjustment problems affecting veterans of Operations Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Iraqi Freedom (OIF), few studies have explored the possible relationship of readjustment stressors to the recent increase in military suicide. This study examined associations between suicidal ideation and postdeployment readjustment problems using cross-sectional population-based survey data from 1665 National Guard members who recently returned from Iraq. The findings suggested that readjustment problems are widespread, with 45% of veterans endorsing one or more financial or family problems 3 months postdeployment. After adjusting for mental health and combat exposure, veterans with the highest number of readjustment stressors were at 52 times greater risk of suicidal ideation than those with no stressors. In a psychiatrically impaired subsample, the high stressor group experienced a fourfold risk of suicide ideation compared with those with no stressors. The findings argue for suicide prevention efforts that more directly target readjustment problems in returning OEF/OIF veterans.

AB Previous studies have shown elevated mortality among psychiatric and substance abusing patients, including veterans with PTSD. Although early studies showed elevated deaths from external causes among Vietnam veterans in the early postwar years, more recent studies have also shown increased health problems among veterans with PTSD. This study compared mortality due to behavioral causes versus other diseases among 1,866 male veterans treated for PTSD. Death certificates obtained for 110 veterans indicated behavioral causes accounted for 62.4% of deaths, standardized mortality ratio D 3.4-5.5, including accidents (29.4%), chronic substance abuse (14.7%), and intentional death by suicide, homicide, or police (13.8%). Results suggest possible opportunities to improve outcomes of this at-risk patient population through harm reduction interventions and improved continuity of care.

AB Objectives: To assess the risk of mortality from suicide among male veteran participants in a large population-based health survey.
   Design and setting: A prospective follow-up study in the US. Data were obtained from the US National Health Interview Surveys 1986 - 94 and linked to the Multiple Cause of Death file ( 1986 - 97) through the National Death Index.
   Participants: The sample comprised 320 890 men, aged >= 18 years at baseline. The participants were followed up with respect to mortality for 12 years.
   Results: Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that veterans who were white, those with >= 12 years of education and those with activity limitations ( after adjusting for medical and psychiatric morbidity) were at a greater risk for completing suicide. Veterans were twice as likely ( adjusted hazard ratio 2.04, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.80) to die of suicide compared with non-veterans in the general population. The risk of death from "natural'' causes ( diseases) and the risk of death from "external'' causes did not differ between the veterans and the non-veterans. Interestingly, male veterans who were overweight had a significantly lower risk of completing suicide than those who were of normal weight.
   Conclusions: Veterans in the general US population, whether or not they are affiliated with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), are at an increased risk of suicide. With a projected rise in the incidence of functional impairment and psychiatric morbidity among veterans of the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, clinical and community interventions that are directed towards patients in both VA and non-VA healthcare facilities are needed.

AB Understanding and reducing mortality from suicide among veterans is a national priority, particularly for individuals receiving care from the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA). This report examines suicide rates among VHA patients and compares them with rates in the general population. Suicide mortality was assessed in fiscal year 2001 for patients alive at the start of that fiscal year and with VHA use in fiscal years 2000-2001 (n = 4,692,034). Deaths from suicide were identified by using National Death Index data. General population rates were identified by use of the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System. VHA rates were 43.13/100,000 person-years for men and 10.41/100,000 person-years for women. For male patients, the age-adjusted standardized mortality ratio was 1.66; for females, it was 1.87. Male patients aged 30-79 years had increased risks relative to men in the general population; standardized mortality ratios ranged from 2.56 (ages 30-39 years) to 1.33 (ages 70-79 years). Female patients aged 40-59 years had greater risks than did women in the general population, with standardized mortality ratios of 2.15 (ages 40-49 years) and 2.36 (ages 50-59 years). Findings offer heretofore unavailable comparison points for health systems. Prior to the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq and before recent VHA initiatives, rates were higher among VHA patients than in the general population. Female patients had particularly high relative risks.

AB The present study sought to identify posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients at high risk for negative behavioral outcomes (violence, suicide attempts, and substance use). The Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD, the Beck Depression Inventory, and demographic and behavioral data from 409 male combat veterans who completed a VA residential rehabilitation program for PTSD were analyzed using signal detection methods (receiver operating characteristics). A validation sample (N = 221) was then used to test interactions identified in the signal detection analyses. The best predictors of behaviors at follow-up were those same behaviors shortly before intake, followed by depressive and PTSD symptoms. However, for each of the models other than that for hard drug use, cutoffs determined at the symptom level did not lend themselves to replication. Recent high-risk behaviors, rather than patients' history, appear to be more predictive of high-risk behaviors postdischarge.

AB PURPOSE: Research suggests that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be associated with later medical morbidity. To assess this, we examined all-cause and cause-specific mortality among a national random sample of U.S. Army veterans with and without PTSD after military service.
   METHODS: We used Cox proportional hazards regressions to examine the causes of death among 15,288 male U.S. Army veterans 16 years after completion of a telephone survey, approximately 30 years after their military service. These men were included in a national random sample of veterans from the Vietnam War Era. Our analyses adjusted for race, Army Volunteer status, Army entry age, Army discharge status, Army illicit drug abuse, intelligence, age, and, additionally-for cancer mortality- pack-years of cigarette smoking.
   RESULTS: Our findings indicated that adjusted postwar mortality for all-cause, cardiovascular, cancer, and external causes of death (including motor vehicle accidents, accidental poisonings, suicides, homicides, injuries Of undetermined intent) was associated with PTSD among Vietnam Theater veterans (N = 7,924), with hazards ratios (HRs) of 2.2 (p < 0.001), 1.7 (p = 0.034), 1.9 (p = 0.018), and 2.3 (p 0.001), respectively. For Vietnam Era veterans with no Vietnam service (N = 7,364), PTSD was associated with all-cause mortality (HR = 2.0, p = 0.001). PTSD-positive era veterans also appeared to have an increase in external-cause mortality as well (HR = 2.2, p = 0.073).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that Vietnam veterans with PTSD may be at increased risk of death from multiple causes. The reasons for this increased mortality are unclear but may be related to biological, psychological, or behavioral factors associated with PTSD and warrant further investigation.

AB Objective To examine depressive symptomatology in women after childbirth in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
   Design A cross sectional survey.
   Setting Hung Vuong Obstetrics and Gynaecology Hospital and the Maternal, Child Health and Family Planning Center of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
   Population Mothers of infants aged +/-six weeks attending well-baby clinics.
   Method Participants were recruited consecutively in the postnatal wards and invited to take part in the study at the first clinic visit. Individual structured interviews about health and social circumstances. including the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were administered during clinic visits. The interview schedule was translated into Vietnamese, back translated for verification and piloted. Interviewers were specifically trained members of staff of the two centres.
   Main outcome measures EPDS scores and responses to structured questions about specific and non-specific symptoms.
   Results Of 506 women who participated, 166 (33%) had EPDS scores in the clinical range. of >12 and 99 (19%) acknowledged suicidal ideation. In a forward stepwise logistic regression analysis, 77% of cases with EPDS scores >12 were correctly classified in a model which included unwelcome pregnancy, lack of a permanent job, <30 days complete rest after childbirth, an unsettled baby, not being given special foods. avoiding proscribed foods and being unable to confide in their husbands.
   Conclusion Depressive symptomatology is more prevalent among parturient women in Ho Chi Minh City. Vietnam than reported rates in developed countries and is at present unrecognised.

AB Expert Rev. Neurother. 12(5), 611-624 (2012) Military veterans represent a unique, heterogeneous population with suicide prevalence rates, risk factors and preventative management needs that differ from those of the rest of community. Veterans worldwide receive high proportions of their healthcare from community providers, and sensitivity to these distinct needs is required for optimized care. An overview of the recent prevalence-study literature, with a focus upon statistical design, is presented in order to provide a critical orientation within this field with high levels of popular media attention. Attention to psychiatric comorbidity, subthreshold symptomology, select signature disorders of contemporary conflicts (namely, post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury), and veteran life narratives before, within and beyond military service will guide our review of risk factor assessment and management strategies. This critical review of the literature provides an overview of this active field of neuropsychiatric research with a select focus upon these topics of special interest.

AB This study examined the relation between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicidal ideation among U.S. military veterans deployed during Operation Enduring Freedom and/or Operation Iraqi Freedom. Specific aims included investigation of (1) whether PTSD was associated with suicidal ideation after controlling for combat exposure and history of suicide attempt(s), (2) whether PTSD was associated with suicidal ideation absent a co-occurring depressive disorder (MDD) or alcohol use disorder (AUD), (3) whether co-occurring MDD or AUD increased risk of suicidal ideation among those with PTSD and (4) whether PTSD/MDD symptom clusters were differentially associated with suicidal ideation. Results pointed to unique effects associated with prior suicide attempt(s), PTSD and MDD. PTSD-diagnosed participants with co-occurring MDD or AUD were not significantly more likely to endorse suicidal ideation than PTSD-diagnosed participants without such comorbidity. The 'emotional numbing' cluster of PTSD symptoms and the 'cognitive-affective' cluster of MDD symptoms were uniquely associated with suicidal ideation. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Vietnam veterans with chronic combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been frequently reported to exhibit high levels of aggression and violent behavior. In this study, gun collection and use habits, attitudes toward violence, and self-reported levels of aggression were compared between veterans with chronic PTSD and non-PTSD veterans with equivalent histories of alcohol and substance abuse. PTSD patients reported different attitudes toward violent crime, higher levels of self-reported aggression, and a significantly higher incidence of potentially dangerous firearm-related behaviors than comparison subjects.

AB A large data gap remains on suicidal behaviors among youth in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, despite the increasing rates of suicide in Asian cultures that may be related to rapid economic changes and the loss of social stability. This study was therefore conducted to explore the prevalence of and factors associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among university students in six ASEAN member states. Data were collected in a cross-sectional survey of 4675 undergraduate university students, mean age 20.6 years (SD = 2.7), range of 18-30 years, from Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam. The overall prevalence of ever suicidal ideation and ever suicide attempt among students in this study was 11.7% and 2.4%, respectively. Different rates of these suicidal behaviors were observed across the countries. In multivariable logistic regression models, suicidal ideation was significantly associated with psychosocial factors including childhood sexual abuse, depressive symptoms, involvement in physical fights, and poor academic performance as well as socio-environmental factors including living with parents or guardians and low involvement in organized religious activity. Suicide attempt was significantly associated with childhood sexual abuse, depressive symptoms, low involvement in organized religious activity and being underweight or overweight. Our findings suggest that individual-level strategies for suicide prevention should be targeted toward students with poor academic performance, mental health problems and a history of adverse childhood experiences. Particular attention should be paid to the role of families that could be a potential stressor in the lives of university students. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Older men have a higher rate of suicide than the general population, but little is known about the prevalence and correlates of suicidality among older male veterans. In this study, we evaluated the prevalence, and risk and protective factors associated with current suicidal ideation (SI) and past suicide attempt (SA) in a contemporary, nationally representative sample of older male veterans. We analyzed data from 1962 male veterans aged 60 or older who participated in the National Health and Resilience Veterans Survey (NHRVS) between October and December 2011. Bivariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression were used to evaluate risk and protective factors associated with current SI and past SA in the full sample, and separately among combat and non-combat veterans. Six percent of the sample reported past 2-week SI, and combat veterans were more likely to contemplate suicide (9.2%) than non-combat (4.0%) veterans. Lifetime SA was reported by 2.6% of respondents. Major depression and physical health difficulties were the strongest risk factors for SI in combat veterans, while generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was the strongest risk factor for SI in non-combat veterans. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was independently associated with SI in both groups of veterans, and social connectedness was negatively related to SI in both groups. These results suggest that a significant proportion of older male veterans in the United States contemplates suicide, with higher rates of SI among combat than noncombat veterans. Interventions designed to mitigate psychological distress and physical difficulties, and to promote social connectedness may help mitigate suicidality risk in this population.

AB The current study aims to assess the relations among war captivity, PTSD, suicidal ideation (SI), and deliberate self-harm (DSH) among former prisoners of war (ex-POWs). Israeli ex-POWs (N=176) and a matched control group of combat veterans (controls; N=118) were assessed using self-report measures. Ex-POWs with PTSD reported higher levels of both SI and DSH compared to ex-POWs and comparable veterans without PTSD. Furthermore, captivity-related variables as well as PTSD symptom clusters were positively related to both SI and DSH. However, only loss of emotional control in captivity and posttraumatic intrusion and emotional numbing symptoms, predicted SI. Ex-POWs with PTSD endorse high levels of SI and DSH. Among ex-POWs, both SI and DSH share similar captivity-related and posttraumatic symptoms correlates but only posttraumatic intrusion and emotional numbing symptoms predict SI.

AB The purpose of this study was to explore the level of suicidal ideation and its personal, peer- and family-related factors among rural Vietnamese adolescents. A self-administered survey was conducted with 171 students from two middle schools in two communes of Quang-Tri Province in Vietnam. Suicidal ideation and risk factors were measured using the Vietnamese version of the World Health Organization (WHO) Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS). The data were analyzed by chi-square test and logistic regression analysis. The prevalence of suicidal ideation was 14.2%, and no gender differences were found. The major risk factors associated with suicidal ideation were feelings of loneliness, having no close friends, and parental drinking. The findings suggest that student interpersonal skills, and family and community involvement are key considerations for the development of a suicide prevention program for this population. Further research is suggested to develop and evaluate a school-based culturally adaptive suicide prevention program.

TI Community-based assessment of unintentional injuries:: a pilot study in

ID ACCIDENTS; CHILDREN; RECALL; GHANA; RATES
AB Aims: Although unintentional injuries are recognised as a major public health problem globally, little is known about their patterns and rates at the community level in most low-income countries. Rapid social development, leading to increased traffic and industrialization, may be changing patterns of injury. Injuries within the home environment have not so far been recognized to the same extent as traffic and work-related injuries in Vietnam, largely because they have not been effectively counted. This study took place in northern Vietnam, in the context of a longitudinal community surveillance site called FilaBavi, as a pilot project aiming to determine the community incidence of unintentional injury and to explore appropriate methods for community-based injury surveillance. Methods: An initial study population of 23,807 was identified and asked about their experience of injury in the preceding three months. Results: Overall 450 new injuries were detected over 5,952 person-years, a rate of 76 per 1,000 person-years. Males were injured at 1.6 times the rate of females, and home and road traffic accidents were most common. Most injuries occurred during unpaid household tasks. Cutting and crushing injuries occurred most frequently. Of 221 deaths from all causes in the FilaBavi population during 1999 among 43,444 person-years, 25 were attributed to unintentional injuries and two to suicide. Unintentional injury was the third leading cause of death in this community, with a case-fatality rate of 0.8%. Discussion: The findings suggest that greater attention needs to be directed toward the prevention of injuries occurring in the home in rural Vietnam. On the basis of this pilot study, a one-year study using the same approach is under way to characterize the patterns of unintentional injury in more detail, including any seasonal variation.

AB Background: There is a correlation between self-esteem in adolescents and risks and protective factors for their health and welfare. The study was conducted to determine the prevalence of low self-esteem and sociodemographic features related to anxiety, depression, educational stress, and suicidal ideation in secondary school students in Vietnam.
   Methods: A cross-sectional design was employed for this study with participation of 1,149 students in Cantho City in Vietnam. A structured questionnaire was applied to ask about self-esteem, depression, anxiety, educational stress, and suicidal ideation.
   Results: Students with low self-esteem were detected at a prevalence of 19.4%. High educational stress and physical and emotional abuse by parents or other adults in the household were major risk factors correlated to low self-esteem, while a protective factor for low self-esteem was attending supplementary classes. An association among lower self-esteem and increased anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation was detected.
   Conclusions: Self-esteem is associated with anxiety, depression, and academic stress, which significantly affect students' quality of life and links to suicidal ideation. These results therefore suggested the need for a school-based or web-based provision aimed at proactively increasing students' self-esteem and skills for dealing with academic stress.

AB Objective. To describe the current situation of intentional injury among Vietnamese youth as well as risk and protective factors. Method. The Sample of Survey Assessment of Vietnamese Youth 2009 (SAVY2) involving 10 044 youth aged 14 to 25 in 2009 was used and compared with SAVY1 in this study. The data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate statistical techniques. Results. Of the sample in 2009, 3% of the young people reported that they had been injured by a family member. The proportion who were intentionally injured by others outside their home was 7.6%. Youth who were most likely to hurt others included urban males, those who had ever been drunk, those who had been intentionally injured by others, and those who had weak family connectedness. Having suicidal thoughts (both sexes) is related to alcohol consumption. Conclusions. The rate of violent behaviors was low, but several risk and protective factors were found and confirmed.

   AGGRESSION; PREVALENCE; IRAQ; VIOLENCE; PTSD; DEPRESSION
AB Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with both aggressive and suicidal behavior. Recent research suggests that the diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder (IED), an impulse-control disorder characterized by repeated impulsive aggressive behavior, may help to identify individuals at risk for attempting suicide. Given the relationship between anger and PTSD, there is likely to be an increased prevalence of IED among individuals with PTSD; however, little is known about the overlap in these two disorders, including how individuals with comorbid IED and PTSD may differ from those with either disorder alone. The purpose of this study is to examine the clinical correlates of comorbid IED and PTSD and the contribution of these two disorders (among others) to lifetime suicide attempt and characteristics of suicidal behavior.
   Method: In a large sample of community research volunteers (N = 1460), we compared individuals with PTSD, IED, and comorbid PTSD and IED on measures of current mood, trait aggression, and trait impulsivity. We also examined the contributions of PTSD, IED, and other syndromal and personality disorders to the prediction of lifetime aggression and lifetime suicide attempt, and their relationship to characteristics of suicide attempts, including level of intent, use of violent versus non-violent means, and the medical seriousness of the attempt.
   Results: Comorbid PTSD and IED was associated with significantly elevated levels of depression, anxiety, anger, aggression, and impulsivity, as well as with high rates of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. IED (beta =.56, p <.001), but not PTSD, significantly and uniquely predicted lifetime aggressive behavior. Both IED and PTSD were associated with lifetime suicide attempt in multivariate analysis (ORs: 1.6 and 1.6, ps <.05). The results show that IED, when comorbid with PTSD, identifies a subgroup of individuals with particularly high levels of aggressive behavior and a high rate of suicide attempt (41.4% in this sample).
   Conclusion: These findings add support to the notion that the diagnosis of IED may aid in identifying individuals at risk for aggressive and suicidal behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB While recent LGBT rights demonstrations and discussions about same-sex marriage have thrust the issue of homosexuality into the spotlight, it was not long ago that the issue of homosexuality was notable by its absence in Vietnam. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with young gay, lesbian and bisexual people in Vietnam's capital city Hanoi, this paper considers the increasing visibility of homosexuality through the theoretical lens of recognition, and illustrates the heterosexist misrecognition that LGBT young people have been subjected to in legislation, the media, their families, and through the education system. Drawing on the narratives of LGBT young people, the paper highlights the potentially negative impact such misrecognition may have on psychological and social wellbeing. Si bien los debates y las recientes manifestaciones en torno a los derechos de las personas lgbt han arrojado luz sobre el tema de la homosexualidad, hasta hace poco, en Vietnam este tema brillaba por su ausencia. Basandose en entrevistas semiestructuradas realizadas a jovenes gay, lesbianas y bisexuales de Hanoi, capital de Vietnam, el presente articulo analiza la creciente visibilidad que ha experimentado la homosexualidad a traves de la lente teorica del reconocimiento, ilustrando, ademas, la desafeccion heterosexista enfrentada por los jovenes lgbt en las leyes, en los medios de comunicacion, en sus familias y en el sistema educativo. Centrandose en las narrativas de los jovenes lgbt, el articulo destaca el impacto potencialmente negativo que tal desafeccion puede tener en su bienestar sicologico y social. Alors que les recentes manifestations pour defendre les droits des personnes LGBT et les discussions sur le mariage entre personnes de meme sexe ont place la question de l'homosexualite sous les projecteurs, cette derniere etait encore absente des debats au Vietnam il n'y a pas si longtemps. En exploitant des entretiens semi-structures conduits avec des jeunes gays, lesbiennes et bisexuel(le)s a Hanoi, cet article prend en compte la visibilite croissante de l'homosexualite a travers une optique theorique de reconnaissance, et illustre la meconnaissance heterosexiste a laquelle les jeunes personnes LGBT ont ete confrontees dans la loi, les medias, leurs familles et le systeme d'education. En s'appuyant sur les recits de jeunes personnes LGBT, l'article met en avant l'impact potentiellement negatif qu'une telle meconnaissance pourrait avoir sur leur bien-etre psychologique et social.

AB Suicide and violence are significant problems in a subset of Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans. This study investigates how posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and resilience in veterans are associated with suicidal ideation and violent impulses while controlling for known covariates of both adverse outcomes. Structured clinical interviews were conducted of N = 2,543 Iraq/Afghanistan-era U.S. veterans. Compared with veterans denying suicidal ideation or violent impulses (n = 1,927), veterans endorsing both (n = 171) were more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD, report childhood abuse, combat exposure, physical pain symptoms, and drug misuse, and less likely to endorse self-direction/life purpose. Veterans reporting concurrent suicidal ideation and violent impulses had higher odds of misusing drugs and reporting pain symptoms relative to veterans reporting suicidal ideation only (n = 186) and had lower odds of endorsing self-direction/life purpose compared with veterans reporting violent impulses only (n = 259). The findings underscore the importance of examining drug abuse, physical pain symptoms, and self-direction/life purpose, as well as PTSD and history of trauma, in the context of clinical assessment and empirical research aimed at optimizing risk management of suicide and violence in military veterans.

AB Introduction: In substance abusing families, sources of familial comorbidity are potentially confounded by genetic-environmental (GE) interplays. The children-of-twins (COT) design can be used to elucidate the association of a parental trait and an offspring outcome such as the association of parental alcoholism and offspring suicidality.
   Methods: We examined the association of paternal alcoholism and offspring suicidal behaviors in an adolescent and young adult COT sample of 'Vietnam Era Twins' offspring who had completed an interview including a comprehensive assessment of lifetime suicidal behaviors. We stratified the COT sample into four groups contingent upon paternal zygosity, MZ versus DZ, and lifetime paternal alcohol dependence history (AD), positive versus negative. We examined whether the relationship of paternal alcoholism and offspring suicidality was best explained by genetic predispositions common to alcoholism and suicidality or by GE interplay-environmental influences correlated with parental alcoholism or the interaction of genetic and environmental factors.
   Results: Our results suggest a main effect of paternal alcoholism on offspring suicide attempt; COT analyses do not support a purely genetic explanation for this association.
   Discussion: Suicide attempts probably result from GE interplays and must be studied in genetically informative samples of offspring of substance abusing parents. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: To date, no population-based data about experiences of low mood and suicidal behaviors among adolescents in Vietnam have been published in the English peer-reviewed literature. The aim was to establish the prevalence of self-reported symptoms of low mood, acts of self-harm, and suicidal thoughts and their correlates among adolescents from two national population-based surveys, Survey Assessment of Vietnamese Youth (SAVY) I (2003-2004) and II (2009-2010).
   Methods: Data from the subset of participants aged 14-19 years from the two structured SAVYs were analyzed. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were used to test for between-group comparisons. Multiple logistic regressions were performed to determine factors associated with low mood and suicidal ideation. A weighting factor was used in all analyses.
   Results: Prevalence of experiences of low mood was 34.06% in SAVY I and 37.34% in SAVY II; prevalence of suicidal behaviors was 5.28% (SAVY I) and 12.21% (SAVY II). Significant risk factors were being female, an ethnic minority, illiterate, or exposed to violence; perceiving study load as too heavy; following a religion other than Buddhism; or living in wealthier families. Better family cohesion protected adolescents from these unfavorable outcomes. Alcohol use co-occurred significantly with experiences of low mood and suicidal behaviors.
   Conclusions: Self-reported lifetime experiences of low mood are common among Vietnamese adolescents, with signs of an increasing trend. Suicidal behaviors are less prevalent than in other settings but are also increasing. Further research is warranted to elucidate these findings and to inform interventions to optimize the mental health of adolescents in Vietnam. (C) 2012 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

AB Research suggests that exposure to psychologic trauma is associated with mortality from external causes, including homicide, suicide, drug overdoses, and unintended injury. However, the etiology of this association is unclear. We examined the survival time and cause of death among a national sample of 15 288 US Army veterans by posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) status 30 years after military service. In these analyses, we included demographic (age, race, marital status, service entry age, and birthplace), predisposing (army volunteer status, discharge status, history of drug abuse, early-age alcohol use, and intelligence), and combat exposure variables. After adjusting for demographic and predisposing factors, all-cause mortality was associated with PTSD for all veterans combined (hazards ratio [HR] = 2.1, P < .001), as well as for era veterans without Vietnam service (FIR = 2.0, P = .001) and theater veterans with Vietnam service (HR = 2.1, P < .001). For theater veterans, PTSD remained significant for all-cause mortality, even after controlling for demographic, predisposition, and combat exposure measures (HR 2.1, P < .001). For external mortality, the adjusted results indicated that PTSD was associated with death for all veterans combined (HR 2.3, P < .001) and for theater veterans separately (HR 2.2, P = .002). For era veterans, the adjusted external mortality results also approached statistical significance (HR = 2.2, P = .068). Among theater veterans, PTSD remained significant for external mortality, even after controlling for all variables and combat exposure (FIR = 2.2, P = .002). Combat exposure was not associated with external mortality once all variables were controlled. In addition, theater veterans who volunteered for Vietnam and those with dishonorable discharges were at increased risk for external-cause mortality. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective To investigate external-cause mortality among 21 609 Norwegian male military peacekeepers deployed to Lebanon during 1978-1998.
   Methods The cohort was followed from the 1st day of deployment through 2013, and mortality during deployment and post discharge was assessed using SMRs calculated from national rates in Norway. Poisson regression was used to see the effect of high-conflict versus low-conflict exposure.
   Results For the total cohort, external-cause mortality was within expected values during deployment (SMR = 0.80) and post discharge (SMR = 1.05). In the low-conflict exposure group, a lower mortality from all external causes (SMR = 0.77), transport accidents (SMR = 0.55) and accidental poisoning (SMR = 0.53) was seen. The high-conflict exposure group showed an elevated mortality from all external causes (SMR = 1.20), transport accidents (SMR = 1.51) and suicide (SMR = 1.30), but these risks were elevated only during the first 5 years after discharge. This group also showed elevated mortality from all external causes (rate ratio, RR = 1.49), and for transport accidents (RR = 3.30) when compared with the low-conflict exposure group.
   Conclusions Overall external-cause mortality among our peacekeepers was equal to national rates during deployment and post discharge. High-conflict exposure was associated with elevated mortality from all external causes, transport accidents and suicide during the first 5 years after discharge from service.

AB Intimate partner violence against women (IPV) is regarded increasingly as a public health problem worldwide. The overall aim of this study was to examine the associations between different exposures to IPV and womens mental health during pregnancy and after childbirth in rural Vietnam.
   This was a secondary analysis of data generated in a community-based longitudinal investigation in which a cohort of pregnant women were recruited and followed until 6 months after childbirth. Different forms of IPV were measured by the Intimate Partner Violence section of the WHO Multi-Country Study on Womens Health and Domestic Violence Against Women questionnaire. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression ScaleVietnam Validation was used to assess symptoms of the common perinatal mental disorders of depression and anxiety (CPMD).
   Overall, 497 women were recruited and complete data were available from 417 (83.9). Exposure to either lifetime or perinatal IPV including emotional abuse, physical violence and sexual violence was associated with increased CPMD symptoms (adjusted odds ratio, OR, ranges 1.314.3) and suicidal thoughts (OR ranges 4.76.1) in women during pregnancy and after childbirth. Experiencing more than one form of IPV increased the magnitude of the association between IPV and CPMD symptoms and thoughts of suicide.
   It is clearly essential in this and other resource-constrained settings to address emotional, physical and sexual violence perpetrated by an intimate partner in any strategies to reduce the risk of perinatal mental health problems in women.

AB Background: Limited evidence is available about poly-victimisation (exposure to multiple forms of victimisation) and mental health among adolescents in low and lower-middle-income countries. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between lifetime exposure to poly-victimisation, health risk behaviours, symptoms of common mental health problems and suicidal ideas in the previous year among high school students in Vietnam.
   Methods: Participants were high school students in rural and urban districts of Hanoi, Vietnam. The data source was an anonymously-completed structured self-report survey. Lifetime exposure to poly-victimisation was assessed using the juvenile victimisation questionnaire revised 2 (JVQ R-2); mental health symptoms by the depression, anxiety and stress scale-21 (DASS-21); involvement in health risk behaviours and previous year suicidal thoughts and plans by questions adapted from the 2013 youth risk behaviour survey. Data were collected between October, 2013 and January, 2014 and were analysed using generalised structural equation modelling.
   Results: In total 1616/ 1745 (92.6 %) eligible students provided complete data. Prior year suicidal thoughts were reported by 21.4 % (95 % CI 18.5-24.5 %) of the female respondents and 7.9 % (95 % CI 6.2-9.8 %) of the male respondents. Prior year suicidal plans were reported by 7.8 % (95 % CI 5.9-9.8 %) of the girls and 4.0 % (95 % CI 2.7-5.3 %) of the boys. Poly-victimisation was associated with increased likelihood of involvement in health risk behaviours and symptoms of common mental health problems among both sexes, which increased adolescents' risk of having suicidal ideas in the previous year. Compared to non-victims or victims of fewer forms, poly-victims were also more likely to report suicidal thoughts and plans among both girls and boys (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Overall, the results revealed that poly-victimisation was associated with increased involvement in health risk behaviours, poorer mental health and increased risks of suicidal ideas among Vietnamese adolescents. Suicidal ideas were prevalent among the students. Interventions to assist victims of violence and prevention of violence, especially poly-victimisation, among adolescents in Vietnam is therefore important.

AB Suicides have markedly increased among military personnel in recent years. We used path analysis to examine factors associated with suicidal/self-harming ideation among male Navy and Marine Corps personnel transitioning to civilian life. Roughly 7% of men (Sailors = 5.3%, Marines = 9.0%) reported ideation during the previous 30 days. Results suggest that combat exposure, substance abuse, and resilience are associated with suicidal ideation/self-harming thoughts through the mediation of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and/or depression symptoms. Substance abuse plays a moderating role. Resilience had a direct effect only among the Marines. Implications for improving the transition to civilian life are discussed.

AB Penetrating craniocerebral injuries (PCIs) are the most fatal injuries of the head that usually have a poor outcome. From the parenchymal destructions to ventricular lacerations, a wide variety of damages occurs during the injury. Surgical treatment is still the mainstay of the management in these patients. Twenty-two consecutive patients with supratentorial PCIs were retrospectively evaluated. Conflicts were the main causes of such injuries followed by suicide attempts and accidental gunfires. Shrapnel and bullet were the most wounding agents. All of the patients underwent surgical treatment following clinical and radiological evaluations. Nine of them were died and 7 were rehabilitated because of severe neurological deficits. (C) 2003 Tohoku University Medical Press.

AB In Operation Iraqi Freedom, which ended in August 2010, nearly 3500 hostile deaths occurred among US military personnel and 32,000 more were wounded in action (WIA). More than 1800 hostile deaths occurred during Operation Enduring Freedom (in and around Afghanistan) through 2014 and about 20,000 were WIA. A larger proportion of wounded personnel survived in Iraq and Afghanistan than during the Vietnam War, but the increased survival rates were not as high as some studies have asserted. The survival rates were 90.2% in Iraq and 91.6% in Afghanistan, compared with 86.5% in Vietnam. The casualty rates varied between the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and before, during, and after the respective surges. Amputation rates are difficult to measure consistently, but I estimate that 2.6% of all WIA and 9.0% of medically evacuated WIA from the Iraq and Afghanistan theaters combined resulted in the major loss of a limb. Elevated non-hostile death rates (including deaths due to accidents, illnesses, homicides, or suicides) resulted in about 220 more deaths in Iraq and about 200 more deaths in Afghanistan than would have been expected in peacetime among populations of the size deployed to those two conflicts.

AB Background: The long-term effects of military deployment on the mental health of war veterans have been investigated extensively, but few studies have examined the longterm impact of parental deployment on children's mental health.
   Methods: Using a retrospective, multigenerational survey and propensity score analysis to adjust for selection effects and endogeneity bias, we investigated the impact of parental deployment on the mental health of the adult children of Australian veterans of the Vietnam War. We analysed data from 1966 adult men (35%) and women (65%) whose fathers (N = 1418) were selected at random from the population of surviving men who served in the Australian army during the Vietnam War (1962-75). Mean age of respondents was 37. The main outcome measures were self-reported diagnosis or treatment for anxiety and depression (i.e. lifetime and previous 12 months), suicidality based on Psychiatric Symptom Frequency Scale, and current mental health as measured by the Mental Health Inventory of the SF-36. The key independent variable was whether their fathers were deployed to the Vietnam War.
   Results: Almost 40 years after the war, the adult children of deployed veterans were more likely to have been diagnosed with anxiety [odds ratio (OR) = 1.54, confidence interval (CI) = 1.04, 2.28] and depression (OR = 1.77, CI = 1.03, 3.05), to have had thoughts of suicide and self-harm (OR = 2.39, CI = 1.57, 3.65) and to have made suicidal plans (OR = 3.52, CI = 1.40, 8.85) than the offspring of comparable, non-deployed army veterans. They also reported poorer current mental health (Coefficient = -5.08, CI = -6.60 - -3.56).
   Conclusions: The results imply that there are significant and enduring adverse effects of parental deployment on the mental health of children in military families, and provide some insight into the potential long-term impacts of recent military engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq.

AB Objective: To investigate and compare, using a retrospective clinical study, the clinical outcomes of penetrating craniocerebral gunshot wounds ( PCGW) with respect to the trajectory of penetration in the axial plane.
   Methods: In total, 22 patients with PCGW caused by conflict, suicide attempt, or accidental firing were included in this study. They were divided into two groups: anteroposterior and lateral. All patients underwent surgical treatment following emergency intervention.
   Results: Of the 22 patients, 16 had anteroposterior and 6 had lateral penetrating injury. Four patients with anteroposterior and five patients with lateral injury died despite surgical treatment. Mortality rate was 25% in the anteroposterior and 83% in the lateral injury group.
   Conclusion: We found that lateral PCGW is the most devastating type of missile injury to the head.

AB The post-9/11 wars produced a new generation of US veterans. As the military campaigns dragged on over extended periods, public discourse on the wars refueled ongoing discussions from the Vietnam era about veterans' social and psychological wellbeing. The public increasingly voiced concerns about psychological injuries such as posttraumatic stress, veterans' postwar reintegration struggles, and suicides. This article will discuss two NGOs organized by and for veterans to analyze how their activism responds to the sense of social crisis prevalent in these public debates on veterans' affairs. It will present the projects' online self-representation and their documentation in activist scholarship and journalism to carve out how civic engagement in veterans' affairs challenges the traditional myth of American individualism to promote volunteerism and community service as vehicles for reintegration, promoting-and enacting-the civil-military social contract.

AB Although research has documented negative effects of combat deployment on mental health, few studies have examined whether deployment increases risky or self-destructive behavior. The present study addressed this issue. In addition, we examined whether deployment effects on risky behavior varied depending on history of pre-deployment risky behavior, and assessed whether psychiatric conditions mediated effects of deployment on risky behavior. In an anonymous survey, active duty members of the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Navy (N = 2116) described their deployment experiences and their participation in risky recreational activities, unprotected sex, illegal drug use, self-injurious behavior, and suicide attempts during three time frames (civilian, military pre-deployment, and military post-deployment). Respondents also reported whether they had problems with depression, anxiety, or PTSD during the same three time frames. Results revealed that risky behavior was much more common in civilian than in military life, with personnel who had not deployed, compared to those who had deployed, reporting more risky behavior and more psychiatric problems as civilians. For the current time period, in contrast, personnel who had deployed (versus never deployed) were significantly more likely to report both risky behavior and psychiatric problems. Importantly, deployment was associated with increases in risky behavior only for personnel with a pre-deployment history of engaging in risky behavior. Although psychiatric conditions were associated with higher levels of risky behavior, psychiatric problems did not mediate associations between deployment and risky behavior. Implications for understanding effects of combat deployment on active duty personnel and directions for future research are discussed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: Previous studies suggested that low total cholesterol was associated with external mortality, including deaths from suicide, homicide, and accidents. However, this reported association was potentially confounded, since cholesterol was also reported to be associated with alcohol abuse, anti-social personality disorder. and other risk factors for external mortality.
   Method: We examined external-cause mortality among a national sample of 4462 male, US veterans at baseline in 1985. Using Cox regressions to estimate survival time, we assessed the impact of low baseline total cholesterol <= 165 mg/dl, age, race, intelligence, BMI, alcohol abuse, anti-social personality disorder, depression, and other factors at follow-up. Study follow-up continued until December 31, 2000. A total of 55 external mortalities occurred during this similar to 16-year period.
   Results: Multivariate Cox regressions predicting external-cause mortality suggested that three predictor variables were significant: low total cholesterol, morbid depression, and anti-social personality disorder, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.97 (p = 0.046), 1.76 (p = 0.043), and 2.22 (p = 0.006), respectively. In addition, a significant interaction was detected for low cholesterol x morbid depression (p < 0.005), whereby those with both at baseline were similar to 7 times more likely to die from external mortality (HR = 6.5, 95% Cl = 3.07-13.76).
   Conclusion: Among a national random sample of community-based men, lower baseline cholesterol predicted external mortality and revealed an interaction with morbid depression. Patients presenting with low cholesterol and morbid depression in clinical practice may warrant clinical attention and surveillance. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID REALITY EXPOSURE THERAPY; VIETNAM VETERANS
AB Exposure therapy treatment can lead to large reductions in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Virtual reality exposure (VRE) therapy is designed to facilitate cognitive behavioral therapy for PTSD. During VRE therapy, patients go into an immersive computer-generated environment (go back to the scene of the traumatic event) to help them gain access to their memories of the traumatic event, change unhealthy thought patterns, gradually habituate to their anxiety, and reduce the intensity of associated emotions. The therapist's ability to manipulate the amount of anxiety experienced by the client during therapy is an important element of successful exposure therapy. Using a within-subjects design, 30 asymptomatic volunteers each experienced four levels of a virtual world depicting a terrorist bus bombing, designed to be increasingly distressful. There was a statistically significant difference between the mean subjective units of discomfort scores ( SUDS) of the four levels, and several planned paired comparisons showed significantly higher SUDS ratings with higher simulation levels. Results suggest that sound may play an important role in successful elicitation of emotional responses during VRE. The results of this analog study provide initial validation of the potential of BusWorld to provide graded exposure for individuals suffering from PTSD originating from suicide bus bombings. Future research exploring whether VR exposure therapy with BusWorld can reduce PTSD in clinical patients

AB Background: Secondary school can be a stressful period for adolescents, having to cope with many life changes. Very little research has been conducted on the mental health status of secondary school pupils in South East Asian countries, such as Vietnam.
   The study aimed to explore perceptions of mental health status, risk factors for mental health problems and strategies to improve mental health among Vietnamese secondary school students.
   Methods: A qualitative design was used to address the main study question including: six in-depth interviews conducted with professionals (with two researchers, two psychiatrists, and two secondary school teachers) to learn about their experience of mental health problems among secondary school pupils; 13 focus group discussions (four with teachers, four with parents, and five with pupils); and 10 individual in-depth interviews with pupils who did not take part in the FGDs, to reflect on the collected data and to deepen the authors' understanding. All interviews and FGDs were audio-taped, transcribed and analyzed for the identification of emerging issues using qualitative techniques of progressive coding, analytic memoing and ongoing comparison.
   Results: Our study confirms the need to pay attention to mental health of pupils in Vietnam. Depression, anxiety, stress, suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts were seen as major problems by all stakeholders. Mental health problems were mainly associated with academic pressure, resulting from an overloaded curriculum and pressure from teachers and parents to succeed. The study found that pupils' mental health demands interventions at many levels, including at the level of government (Ministry of Education and Training), schools, communities, families and pupils themselves.
   Conclusions: Vietnamese secondary school pupils feel that their mental health status is poor, because of many risk factors in their learning and living environment. The need now is to investigate further to identify and apply strategies to improve students' mental health.

AB Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive disorder are over represented in combat veterans. Veterans with both disorders have an increased risk of suicide. The nitric oxide synthase 1 adaptor protein (NOS1AP) gene, which modulates stress-evoked N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) activity, was investigated in combat veterans.
   Methods: A comprehensive genetic analysis of NOS1AP and its association with PTSD was investigated in Vietnam combat veterans with PTSD (n=121) and a group of healthy control individuals (n=237). PTSD patients were assessed for symptom severity and level of depression using the Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI).
   Results: The G allele of NOS1AP SNP rs386231 was significantly associated with PTSD (p=0.002). Analysis of variance revealed significant differences in BDI-II and Mississippi scores between genotypes for rs386231 with the GG genotype associated with increased severity of depression (p=0.002 F=6.839) and higher Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD scores (p=0.033). Haplotype analysis revealed that the C/G haplotype (rs451275/rs386231) was significantly associated with PTSD (p=0.001).
   Limitations: The sample sizes in our study were not sufficient to detect SNP associations with very small effects. In addition the study was limited by its cross sectional design.
   Conclusions: This is the first study reporting that a variant of the NOS1AP gene is associated with PTSD. Our data also suggest that a genetic variant in NOS1AP may increase the susceptibility to severe depression in patients with PTSD and increased risk for suicide.

AB Objective: The purpose of the study was to determine if patients with a history of major depressive episode and comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) have a higher risk for suicide attempt and differ in other measures of suicidal behavior, compared to patients with major depressive episode but no PTSD. In addition, to explore how PTSD comorbidity might increase risk for suicidal behavior in major depressive episode, the authors investigated the relationship between PTSD, cluster B personality disorder, childhood sexual or physical abuse, and aggression/ impulsivity.
   Method: The subjects were 230 patients with a lifetime history of major depressive episode; 59 also had lifetime comorbid PTSD. The demographic and clinical characteristics of subjects with and without PTSD were compared. Multivariate analysis was used to examine the relationship between suicidal behavior and lifetime history of PTSD, with adjustment for clinical factors known to be associated with suicidal behavior.
   Results: Patients with a lifetime history of PTSD were significantly more likely to have made a suicide attempt. The groups did not differ with respect to suicidal ideation or intent, number of attempts made, or maximum lethality of attempts. The PTSD group had higher objective depression, impulsivity, and hostility scores; had a higher rate of comorbid cluster B personality disorder; and were more likely to report a childhood history of abuse. However, cluster B personality disorder was the only independent variable related to lifetime suicide attempts in a multiple regression model.
   Conclusions: PTSD is frequently comorbid with major depressive episode, and their co-occurrence enhances the risk for suicidal behavior. A higher rate of comorbid cluster B personality disorder appears to be a salient factor contributing to greater risk for suicidal acts in patients with a history of major depressive episode who also have PTSD, compared to those with major depressive episode alone.

AB Aim To investigate the association between parental war involvement and different indicators of psychosocial distress in a community sample of early adolescents ten years after the war in Croatia 1991-1995.
   Methods A total of 695 adolescents were screened with a self-report questionnaire assessing parental war involvement, sociodemographic characteristics, and alcohol and drug consumption. Personality traits were assessed with the Junior Eysenck Personality Questionnaire; depressive symptoms with the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI); and unintentional injuries, physical fighting, and bullying with the World Health Organization survey Health Behavior in School-aged Children. Suicidal ideation was assessed with three dichotomous items. Suicidal attempts were assessed with one dichotomous item.
   Results Out of 348 boys and 347 girls who were included in the analysis, 57.7% had at least one veteran parent. Male children of war veterans had higher rates of unintentional injuries (odds ratio [OR], 1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 2.63) and more frequent affirmative responses across the full suicidal spectrum (thoughts about death OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.02 to 4.3; thoughts about suicide - OR, 5; 95% CI, 1.72 to 14.66; suicide attempts - OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.03 to 12.67). In boys, thoughts about suicide and unintentional injuries were associated with parental war involvement even after logistic regression. However, girls were less likely to be affected by parental war involvement, and only exhibited signs of psychopathology on the CDI total score.
   Conclusion Parental war involvement was associated with negative psychosocial sequels for male children. This relationship is possibly mediated by some kind of identification or secondary traumatization. Suicidality and unintentional injuries are nonspecific markers for a broad range of psychosocial distresses, which is why the suggested target group for preventive interventions should be veteran parents as vectors of this distress.

   SAMPLE
AB Background: The investigation aimed to estimate the association between carbonated soft drink consumption frequency and externalizing and internalizing behaviour among university students in five ASEAN counties.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey included 3353 university students from Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam, median age 20 years (interquartile range 3 years).
   Results: In all five ASEAN countries, the study found a prevalence no soft drink consumption in the past 30 days of 20.3%, less than one time a day 44.7%, once a day 25.4% and two or more times a day 9.6%. In the adjusted logistic regression analysis, higher frequency of soft drink consumption (one and/or two or more times a day) was associated with externalizing behaviour (in physical fight, injury, current tobacco use, problem drinking, drug use, pathological internet use and gambling behaviour), and higher frequency of soft drink consumption (two or more times a day) was associated with depression in females, but no association was found for the general student population in relation to internalizing behaviour (depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, suicidal ideation, suicide plan, suicide attempt and sleeping problem).
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that carbonated soft drink consumption is associated with a number of externalizing but not internalizing health risk behaviours.

AB This article will examine baseline assessment data from consecutive admissions to the MISSION Program, a transitional case management program for homeless veterans, to better understand the differences across military service eras that impact the psychosocial treatment needs of homeless, mentally ill, substance-abusing veterans. In all, 373 homeless veterans with a co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorder received the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Diagnosis, a modified Addiction Severity Index, the BASIS-32, and a comprehensive assessment battery focusing on other psychosocial treatment needs. Chi-square analysis and ANOVA were used to measure differences in mental health, substance use, physical health status, and homelessness across service eras, broken down by Vietnam era, post-Vietnam era, and Persian Gulf/Middle East era. Persian Gulf/Middle East era veterans were significantly more likely to have mental health problems than other veteran cohorts, especially problems with post-traumatic stress disorder (p <= .001), and reported more days of mental health problems in the last month (p = .01). Mideast veterans also became homeless at a significantly earlier age than other veterans (p <= .001), were more likely to report housing instability in their families of origin (p <= .05) and to attribute their homelessness to mental health problems (p = .01). Service providers need to be aware of the diversity of homeless veterans' service needs by period of military service in order to develop well-targeted, effective interventions.

AB Background. During deployment and upon returning home, veterans experience emotional challenges that test their social and psychological adaptation and place them at risk for suicidal thinking. Individual variability in skill-based capacity to adaptively perceive, understand, correctly use, and manage emotions (called emotional competence) may play a role in the development of psychological suffering and suicidal thinking. Based on research in healthy and clinical samples, poor emotional competence was predicted to be associated with suicidal thinking among returning veterans. Method. Participants were selected from the W. F. Caveness Vietnam Head Injury Study (VHIS) registry, which in the late 1960s began prospectively assessing 1221 veterans). The study sample was composed of veterans examined between 2003 and 2006 and included 185 participants who at the time of assessment with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) did (N= 46) or did not endorse (N= 139) suicidal thinking then or during the previous two weeks and received performance-based measures of emotional competence (Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test; MSCEIT, Version 2.0) and theory of mind. MSCEIT subtests and theory of mind tasks were condensed via principal component analysis: Component 1 (Emotion Processing) included use, understand, and manage emotions tasks, and Component 2 (Emotion Perception) included perceive emotions. Results. Veterans endorsing suicidal thoughts showed poorer emotion processing whereas emotion perception and theory of mind tasks did not show significant group effects. In addition, veterans who endorsed thoughts of suicide were deployed at a younger age, had lower education, and tended to report more negative experiences in social interactions upon return to the United States. Conclusions. The capacity to understand, use, and manage emotionally charged stimuli and situations may represent risk factors for suicidal thinking among veterans.

AB Background Increased suicide risk among US military personnel is a growing concern. Research has linked trauma exposure, including exposure to combat-related injuries, death, and atrocities to suicidal ideation among combat veterans. Guilt (feeling bad about what you did to another) and shame (feeling bad about who you are) have been proposed as potential contributors to suicidal ideation among military personnel, but have not yet received much empirical attention. Methods Sixty-nine active duty military personnel receiving outpatient mental health treatment at a military clinic completed self-report symptom measures of guilt, shame, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and suicidal ideation while engaged in treatment. Generalized linear regression modeling was utilized to test the association of guilt and shame with suicidal ideation. Results Mean levels of guilt and shame were significantly higher among military personnel with a history of suicidal ideation. Guilt (B = 0.203, SE = .046, P < .001) and shame (B = 0.111, SE = .037, P = .002) were independently associated with severity of current suicidal ideation above and beyond the effects of depression, PTSD symptoms, and the depression-by-PTSD interaction, and fully mediated the relationships of depression and PTSD symptom severity with suicidal ideation. When considered simultaneously, only guilt (B = 0.167, SE = .053, P = .001) was significantly associated with increased suicidal ideation. Conclusions Guilt and shame are associated with increased severity of suicidal ideation in military mental health outpatients. Guilt has a particularly strong relationship with suicidal ideation.

AB Stanley Kubrick's anti-war film Full Metal Jacket (1987) dramatically represents US Marine Corps basic training during the Vietnam War as both gruelling and brutalising. The brutal, linguistically aggressive and physically intimidating scenes purport to detail the dehumanising process that Marine Corps recruits were put through in preparation for combat during that period. In the film, the recruits are trained by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, played by the actor R. Lee Ermey, who is himself an ex-Marine Corps drill instructor (1965-1967) and who also served in Vietnam in 1968. As a result of his experience as an instructor, Ermey was given free rein by Kubrick to write his own dialogue for the abusive barrack room and field training scenes in order to lend the drama an air of authenticity (see Ermey 2017). Within the fictional world of the film, the intense training and disciplinary regime ultimately causes one recruit, Private Leonard Lawrence, to crack psychologically. Private Lawrence is nicknamed 'Gomer Pyle' by Hartman upon their first meeting, this name being a direct allusion to the hapless character of the same name who was a US Marine recruit in the sitcom Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., which ran from 1964-1969 - contemporaneously with the time period in which Full Metal Jacket is set. This insulting allusion is merely the start of a long line of linguistically impolite/aggressive and ultimately physically aggressive interactions which Lawrence/Pyle suffers at the hands of Hartman, both directly and, later in the film as a result of Hartman's orchestrations, from the other recruits. Under this unrelenting barrage of impoliteness, aggression, and abuse, Lawrence/Pyle eventually shoots Hartman dead before turning his rifle on himself and committing suicide. Thus, the film argues that the dehumanising effect of the basic training, which was ostensibly carried out to toughen up and mentally prepare conscripted recruits for combat in Vietnam, had a profound, brutalising and (potentially) utterly destructive effect on those subjected to it. In this article, we explore the creative linguistic aggression displayed by the character of Hartman. We focus particularly on the reasons underlying the creativity of Hartman's impoliteness and aggression, and argue that these are essentially to foreground the seriousness of the training regime which the recruits must follow.

AB IMPORTANCE Human trafficking and exploitation of children have profound health consequences. To our knowledge, this study represents the largest survey on the health of child and adolescent survivors of human trafficking.
   OBJECTIVE To describe experiences of abuse and exploitation, mental health outcomes, and suicidal behavior among children and adolescents in posttrafficking services. We also examine how exposures to violence, exploitation, and abuse affect the mental health and suicidal behavior of trafficked children.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A survey was conducted with 387 children and adolescents aged 10 to 17 years in posttrafficking services in Cambodia, Thailand, or Vietnam, which along with Laos, Myanmar, and Yunnan Province, China, compose the Greater Melong Subregion. Participants were interviewed within 2 weeks of entering services from October 2011 through May 2013.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, suicidal ideation, self-injury, and suicide attempts. RESULTS Among the 387 children and adolescent study participants, most (82%) were female. Twelve percent had tried to harm or kill themselves in the month before the interview. Fifty-six percent screened positive for depression, 33% for an anxiety disorder, and 26% for posttraumatic stress disorder. Abuse at home was reported by 20%. Physical violence while trafficked was reported by 41% of boys and 19% of girls. Twenty-three percent of girls and 1 boy reported sexual violence. Mental health symptoms were strongly associated with recent self-harm and suicide attempts. Severe physical violence was associated with depression (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.55; 95% CI, 1.64-7.71), anxiety (AOR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.12-4.05), and suicidal ideation (AOR, 3.68; 95% CI, 1.77-7.67). Sexual violence while trafficked was associated with depression (AOR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.22-4.23) and suicidal ideation (AOR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.80-6.54).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Children and adolescents in posttrafficking care showed high symptom levels of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder, which are strongly associated with self-harm or suicidal behaviors. Mental health screening and reintegration risk assessments are critical components of posttrafficking services, especially in planning for family reunification and other social integration options.

ID COLLEGE-STUDENTS; GENDER; HEALTH; PREVENTION; RISK
AB Tim Nguyen is a 25-year-old, heterosexual Vietnamese American man who lives in a large Midwestern city. Tim and his 20-year-old sister, Terri, were born and raised in the United States; their parents were immigrants from Vietnam. Tim's father passed away soon after Terri's birth; both Tim and Terri were raised by their mother. Terri is a college student who lives on campus in the same city as Tim does. Tim lives with his mother and grandmother and works as a cashier in a supermarket.
   Recently, Tim discovered that Molly, his girlfriend of 5 years, had been cheating on him. When he confronted Molly, she promptly broke up with him, which left him devastated. When his mother found out about the breakup, she berated him for "losing Molly to another man." That evening, Tim locked himself in his room and attempted to kill himself by overdosing on prescription drugs. Tim's was discovered by Terri, who rushed him to the hospital for treatment. Fortunately, his suicide attempt was not life threatening. After being discharged, Tim was referred to a mental health agency for counseling. He was accompanied by Terri for his first session.

AB Aims
   To estimate all-cause mortality rate and to assess predictors of all-cause mortality among injection drug users (IDUs) in Thai Nguyen province, Vietnam between 2005 and 2007.
   Design
   Prospective cohort study.
   Setting
   Community-dwelling IDUs were enrolled and followed at 3-month intervals for up to 2 years.
   Participants
   A total of 894 male IDUs (median age of 32 years, 22.8% HIV-positive, all having injected opioids).
   Measurements
   Deaths were confirmed by family members and by reviewing government records. Marginal Cox proportional hazards models for clustered data were constructed to determine the independent predictors of all-cause mortality, using both fixed baseline measurements and time-dependent repeated measurements.
   Findings
   During 710.1 person-years of follow-up, 45 (5.0%) drug injectors died. The causes of deaths were AIDS-related (14 cases, 31%), drug overdose (12, 27%), suicide (three, 7%), traffic accident (three, 7%), violence (two, 4%), pneumonia (two, 4%), non-traffic accident (one, 2%) and unknown causes (eight, 18%). The all-cause mortality rate was 6.3% (95% CI = 4.6-8.5) per 100 person-years. The standardized mortality ratio was 13.4. The HIV incidence rate was 5.2 (95% CI = 3.5-7.6) per 100 person-years. In multi-factorial analysis, HIV infection [hazard ratio (HR) = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.9-6.3] and previous diagnosis of tuberculosis (HR = 10.0, 95% CI = 4.1-24.3) were associated significantly with increased hazard of death.
   Conclusions
   The all-cause, age- and sex-standardized mortality among Vietnamese IDUs is 13-fold higher than the general population and substantially higher than IDUs studied in developed countries. Effective prevention and control of HIV infection and tuberculosis are needed urgently.

   NUMBER
AB Nicotine dependence is an addiction to tobacco products and a global public health concern. Association between the SLC6A4 polymorphisms and nicotine dependence is controversial. Two variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) domains, termed HTTLPR and STin2, in the SLC6A4 gene are well characterized transcriptional regulatory elements. Their polymorphism in the copy number of the repeat correlates with the particular personality and psychiatric traits. We analyzed nicotine dependence in 1,804 participants from Central Vietnam. The Fagerstrom Test (FTND) was used to evaluate the nicotine dependence and PCR was used to determine the SLC6A4 HTTLPR and STin2 VNTRs. The HTTLPR VNTR was associated with difficulties to refrain from smoking in a prohibiting environment. The STIn2 10/10 genotype was associated with (1) years of smoking, (2) difficulties to quit the first cigarette, and (3) higher number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD). Stratification analysis was used to find the genetic interaction between these two VNTRs in nicotine dependence as they may synergistically regulate the SLC6A4 expression. Smokers with the S/S HTTLPR genotypes showed a much stronger association between STin2 10/10 variant and CPD. This finding is consistent with the molecular evidence for the functional interaction between HTTLPR and STin2 in cell line models, where STin2 has described as a stronger expressional regulator. Similarly, we found that STin2 is a much stronger modifier of smoking with 10/10 genotype related to higher nicotine dependence. The present study supports genetic interaction between HTTLPR and STin2 VNTRs in the regulation of nicotine dependence with the dominance of the STin2 effects. This finding could be explained by their differential effect on the SLC6A4 expression.

   BRAIN; MANAGEMENT; VIETNAM
AB The principles of management of civilian gunshot wounds (GSWs) to the head and spine have evolved directly from the experience gained in war by military neurosurgeons. The type of craniocerebral wounds being produced in urban gang warfare and suicide attempts using handguns or rifles at close range vary considerably from the lower velocity fragment injuries which are common in modern warfare. Civilian craniocerebral GSWs are often devastating. The in-hospital mortality for civilians with penetrating craniocerebral injury is 52-95% depending on the proportion of suicide victims in the series. The most important predictive factor is the post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Score (GCS). Many civilian victims (47%) present with GCS 3-5 and only approximately 8.1% survive. Of these survivors, 1.4% will have nil, mild or moderate disability without surgery and 4.8% with surgery. Higher post-resuscitation GCS is associated with a significantly improved survival: GCS 6-8, 35.6% and GCS 9-15, 90.5%. A selective treatment policy is recommended for the patients with GCS 3-5. There are many clinical and radiological correlates with poor outcome that help the neurosurgeon decide on operative versus supportive treatment. Early aggressive resuscitation, surgery and vigorous control of intracranial pressure offers the best chance of achieving a satisfactory outcome. Spinal GSWs are uncommon and the neurosurgeon should be aware of the principles of management and prognosis. The indication for acute spinal cord decompression is deteriorating neurological status. Steroids are not indicated for these injuries. Neurosurgeons should take an active role in formulating and supporting public policy which aims to reduce possession and usage of firearms and therefore the prevalence of gunshot injuries.

AB Introduction: Published research indicates that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with increased mortality. However, causes of death among treatment-seeking patients with PTSD remain poorly characterized. The study objective was to describe causes of death among Veterans with PTSD to inform preventive interventions for this treatment population.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted for all Veterans who initiated PTSD treatment at any Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center from fiscal year 2008 to 2013. The primary outcome was mortality within the first year after treatment initiation. In 2018, collected data were analyzed to determine leading causes of death. For the top ten causes, standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated from age- and sex-matched mortality tables of the U.S. general population.
   Results: A total of 491,040 Veterans were identified who initiated PTSD treatment. Mean age was 48.5 (+/- 16.0) years, 90.7% were male, and 63.5% were of white race. In the year following treatment initiation, 1.1% (5,215/491,040) died. All-cause mortality was significantly higher for Veterans with PTSD compared with the U.S. population (SMR=1.05, 95% CI=1.02, 1.08, p<0.001). Veterans with PTSD had a significant increase in mortality from suicide (SMR=2.52, 95% CI=2.24, 2.82, p<0.001), accidental injury (SMR=1.99, 95% CI=1.83, 2.16, p<0.001), and viral hepatitis (SMR=2.26, 95% CI=1.68, 2.93, p<0.001) versus the U.S. population. Of those dying from accidental injury, more than half died of poisoning (52.3%, 325/622).
   Conclusions: Veterans with PTSD have an elevated risk of death from suicide, accidental injury, and viral hepatitis. Preventive interventions should target these important causes of death. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

AB Some people say that depression feels like a black curtain of despair coming down over their lives. Many people feel like they have no energy and can't concentrate. Others feel irritable all the time for no apparent reason. The symptoms vary from person to person, but if some person feels "down" for more than two weeks, and these feelings are interfering with his/her daily life, he/she may be clinically depressed[1].
   History has shown that the experience of deployment to war can have legacies that manifest themselves in a variety of physical and psychological health problems [2,3]. It is widely recognised that exposure to combat and other wartime experiences can have both short-term and long-term psychological effects [4]. War related imprisonment has been shown as a stressful event associated with the exhibition of higher rates and greater intensity of posttraumatic stress reactions, compared with war veterans who were not imprisoned. This indicates that wartime captivity produces stress residuals of considerable depth, range and persistence [5]. There is a strong indication that stressor characteristics influence the variety and number of exhibited intrusive, avoidance and arousal symptoms. Victims of rape tended to present with more avoidance symptoms and fewer hyperarousal symptoms, whereas former prisoners and veterans tended to report more hyperarousal symptoms. Rape victims and former prisoners also reported more symptoms than the other groups(5). Groups suffering different types of trauma may show similarities in psychological dimensions of depression [5].
   The prevalence of psychological effects after conflict suggest that traumatic exposure and resultant symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression can influence social functioning and how individuals perceive mechanisms aimed at promoting justice and reconciliation, such as amnesties, criminal trials, and truth commissions [6].
   More than 90% of completed suicides are associated with mental or addictive disorders. These disorders provide the major context for suicide and suicidal behavior [7].

TI Disability Rating, Age at Death, and Cause of Death in US Veterans with

SO MILITARY MEDICINE

ID POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; BENEFITS; HEALTH; PTSD
AB Introduction: The association between disability and cause of death in Veterans with service-connected disabilities has not been studied. The objective of this study was to compare age at death, military service and disability characteristics, including disability rating, and cause of death by year of birth. We also examined cause of death for specific service-connected conditions. Materials and methods: This study used information from the VETSNET file, which is a snapshot of selected items from the Veterans Benefits Administration corporate database. We also used the National Death Index (NDI) for Veterans which is part of the VA Suicide Data Repository. In VETSNET, there were 758,324 Veterans who had a service-connected condition and died between the years 2004 and 2014. Using the scrambled social security number to link the two files resulted in 605,493 (80%) deceased Veterans. Age at death, sex, and underlying cause of death were obtained from the NDI for Veterans and military service characteristics and types of disability were acquired from VETSNET. We constructed age categories corresponding to period of service; birth years 1938 and earlier corresponded to Korea and World War II ("oldest"), birth years 1939-1957 to the Vietnam era ("middle"), and birth years 1958 and later to post Vietnam, Gulf War, and the more recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan ("youngest"). Results: Sixty-two percent were in the oldest age category, 34% in the middle group, and 4% in the youngest one. The overall age at death was 75 +/- 13 yr. Only 1.6% of decedents were women; among women 25% were in the youngest age group, while among men only 4% were in the youngest group. Most decedents were enlisted personnel, and 60% served in the U.S. Army. Nearly 61% had a disability rating of >= 50% and for the middle age group 54% had a disability rating of 100%. The most common service-connected conditions were tinnitus, hearing loss, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In the oldest group, nearly half of deaths were due to cancer or cardiovascular conditions and <2% were due to external causes. In the youngest group, cardiovascular disease and cancer accounted for about 1/3 of deaths, whereas external causes or deaths due to accidents, suicide, or assault accounted for nearly 33% of deaths. For Veterans with service-connected PTSD or major depression; 6.5% of deaths were due to external causes whereas for Veterans without these conditions, only 3.1% were due to external causes. Conclusion: The finding of premature death due to external causes in the youngest age group as well as the finding of higher proportions of external causes in those with PTSD or major depression should be of great concern to those who care for Veterans.

AB This study is a 6-year longitudinal study of 51 treatment-seeking male veterans with combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder. Measures of PTSD and psychiatric symptomatology, social functioning, and program impact were assessed at admission to an inpatient treatment program, at 18 months, and 6 years later. Previous studies had shown that the treatment program's impact on course of illness had been negligible. The sample showed an extremely high mortality rate of 17% over 6 years. The remaining veterans showed improvement in violence and alcohol and drug use, but an increase in hyperarousal symptoms and social isolation. Nearly three-fourths had had an inpatient hospitalization. Veterans' self-ratings, in contrast, indicated significant improvement in all areas of functioning except employment, as well as an overall positive view of the impact of the program on their lives. Results indicate that the majority of the veteran sample had experienced some improvement in their ability to cope with their chronic illness, decreasing their use of violence and substance abuse but still were experiencing high levels of symptomatology. The extremely high mortality rate, however, provides a somber reminder of the seriousness of this disorder.

AB This is the second part of our analysis of the military's mental health care dilemma. Since the First World War, military and government officials have been quite wary of mass psychiatric attrition and escalating pension costs from warzones. Specifically, the military worries about unknown repercussions should war stress injuries be de-stigmatized and treated equally as physical wounds, as required per the military's own documented lessons learned. Leaders fear that so-called evacuation syndromes would spread, thereby depleting the fighting force for invalid reasons, eroding unit morale, and providing an acceptable escape from one's military duties instead of the disapproval deserved, thus jeopardizing the military's primary mission to fight and win wars, as well as risk possible financial strain in societies dealing with too many psychiatrically disabled veterans. Consequently, the military routinely admits to ignoring its war trauma lessons, resulting in a generational pattern of self-inflicted crises, including suicide epidemics. Moreover, besides neglecting such lessons, the military has adopted various approaches over time to reduce the possibility of evacuation syndromes by aggressively preventing psychiatric attrition, treatment, and disability pensions. After an extensive review of the war stress literature, we identified 10 overarching strategies the military has employed in order to resist fully learning from its lessons on the psychiatric realities of modern warfare by eliminating, minimizing, and/or concealing its mental health problem. Part two of the article series examines the following avoidance strategies intended to prevent psychiatric attrition and disability pensions: (1) Cruel and Inhumane Handling; (2) Legal Prosecution, Incarceration, and Executions; (3) Weaponizing Stigma to Humiliate, Ridicule, and Shame into Submission; (4) Denying the Realities of Mental Health; and (5) Screening and Purging Weakness. We argue that by not accepting the realities of the combat stressors, no effective methods for assessment and treatment of the stress reactions, not to mention prevention methods, have emerged that contributes to alleviating the veteran suicide and mental health crises.

AB Traumatic experiences can lead to a range of mental health problems with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) leading as the most documented disorder following trauma. Epidemiological research has found the rate of exposure to trauma to far outweigh the prevalence of PTSD. Indicating that most people do not develop PTSD following a traumatic event, this phenomenon has led to an interest in evaluating risk factors to determine who develops PTSD. Risk factors for the development of psychopathology following trauma exposure fall into three categories: pre-trauma, peri-trauma and posttrauma factors. Pre-trauma factors can include age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, prior psychopathology, and neurobiological factors. Peri-trauma factors can include the duration/severity of trauma experience and the perception that the trauma has ended. Post-trauma factors can include access to needed resources, social support, specific cognitive patterns, and physical activity. To date, several important risk factors have been found to impact the risk of developing PTSD including gender, age, education, IQ, race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, pre-trauma psychopathology, prior trauma exposure, familial psychiatric history, and neurobiological factors. This article outlines the state of research findings on pretraumatic, peritraumatic, and posttraumatic risk factors for the development of PTSD and associated psychopathology following trauma.

AB Objective: The aim of the present study was to develop and evaluate a multidimensional measure of distress experienced by partners of Australian combat veterans.
   Method: The Partners of Veterans Distress Scale (POV-DS) was developed using factor analysis on a sample of 665 female members of Partners of Veterans Association of Australia. Content validity for the scale was established by using focus groups and expert feedback during item development phase. In addition, two self-report inventories were administered to assess physical/mental health, and satisfaction with life.
   Results: Following principal-axis factoring, 45 items were retained, loading on seven distinct but correlated factors: Sleep problems, Hyper-vigilance, Social isolation, Financial problems, Intimacy problems, Exhaustion, and Negative affect. The factor structure was cross-validated using confirmatory factor analysis on a hold-out sample. The distress subscales all exhibited excellent internal consistency (alpha s ranged from 0.84 to 0.95). Validation analyses revealed subscales derived from the seven-factor model explained 31% to 45% of the variance in partners' physical health, mental health, and satisfaction with life.
   Conclusions: The study found that the POV-DS is a reliable and valid tool for assessing distress in partners of Australian combat veterans.

AB Background: Suicidal ideation (SI) is a serious issue affecting U.S. veterans, and those with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are at an especially high risk of SI. Guilt has been associated with both PTSD and SI and may therefore be an important link between these constructs.
   Methods: The present study compared models of trauma-related guilt and used path analysis to examine the direct and indirect effects of PTSD and trauma-related guilt on SI among a sample of 988 veterans receiving outpatient PTSD treatment at a Veterans Affairs (VA) specialty clinic.
   Results: Results showed that a model of trauma-related guilt including guilt-cognitions and global guilt (but not distress) provided the best model fit for the data. PTSD and trauma-related guilt had direct effects on SI, and PTSD exhibited indirect effects on SI via trauma-related guilt.
   Limitations: The use of cross-sectional data limits the ability to make causal inferences. A treatment-seeking sample composed primarily of Vietnam veterans limits generalizability to other populations.
   Conclusions: Trauma-related guilt, particularly guilt cognitions, may be an effective point of intervention to help reduce SI among veterans with PTSD. This is an important area of inquiry, and suggestions for future research are discussed.

AB Background: Pathological internet use may lead to serious psychosocial problems and dysfunction.
   Objectives: The purpose of the study was to investigate the prevalence of pathological internet use among undergraduate university students in five ASEAN countries in relation to sociodemographics, internet use variables, psychosocial factors, and comorbid symptoms.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional survey in 2015 in Indonesia (Yogyakarta), Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur), Myanmar (Yangon), Thailand (MahaSarakham), and Vietnam (Hanoi), 3240 undergraduate university students (Mean age = 20.5 years, SD = 1.6), who were randomly selected, responded to a questionnaire including the "Young Diagnostic Questionnaire for Internet Addiction" (YDQ) and other measures.
   Results: Overall, the prevalences of pathological internet use were 35.9% (ranging from 16.1% in Myanmar to 52.4% in Thailand), maladaptive use 34.8% and adjusted Internet users 29.9%. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, internet use variables (heavy overall Internet use, heavy Internet use for recreational purposes, and heavy smartphone use), psychosocial factors (the experience of childhood physical abuse, childhood sexual abuse, lack of social support, and poor academic performance), and comorbid symptoms (having a self-classified gambling problem, hazardous or harmful alcohol use, past 12-month drug use, severe depression, sleeping problems, having attempted a suicide, and PTSD symptoms) were found to be associated with pathological internet use.
   Conclusions: The study found a very high prevalence of pathological internet use; those students lacking psychosocial support and having comorbid symptoms were at the highest risk.

AB Exposure to potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs) among combat veterans has been acknowledged as significant stressful combat events that may lead to mental health problems, including self-injurious thoughts and behavior (SITB). However, few studies have examined the risk and protective factors that can explain the conditions in which PMIEs may contribute to the development and maintenance of SITB. In the current study, we aimed to examine the association between PMIEs and SITB among combat veterans and explore the moderating roles of intolerance of uncertainty (IU) in this association. A volunteer sample of 191 Israeli combat veterans was recruited during 2017. Participants completed validated self-report questionnaires in a cross-sectional study. Results indicated that two separate measures of PMIEs, the Perceived Perpetration by Oneself and Others subscale of the Moral Injury Events Scale (MIES) and the Causes subscale of the Moral Injury Questionnaire (MIQ-Causes), were positively associated with higher levels of SITB. Moreover, beyond the contributions of reserve duty, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and depressive symptoms, MIQ-Causes scores significantly predicted current SITB. Importantly, under low and average levels of inhibitory IU, significant positive effects were revealed for the MIQ-Causes on current SITB, R-2 = .34. Although veterans exposed to PMIEs are more prone to SITB, even years after their release from military service, their IU may temper the link between experiences of PMIEs and SITB.

AB Background Trafficking is a crime of global proportions involving extreme forms of exploitation and abuse. Yet little research has been done of the health risks and morbidity patterns for men, women, and children trafficked for various forms of forced labour.
   Methods We carried out face-to-face interviews with a consecutive sample of individuals entering 15 post-trafficking services in Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam. We asked participants about living and working conditions, experience of violence, and health outcomes. We measured symptoms of anxiety and depression with the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist and post-traumatic stress disorder with the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, and used adjusted logistic regression models to estimate the effect of trafficking on these mental health outcomes, controlling for age, sector of exploitation, and time in trafficking.
   Findings We interviewed 1102 people, of whom 1015 reached work destinations. Participants worked in various sectors including sex work (329 [32%]), fishing (275 [27%]), and factories (136 [13%]). 481 (48%) of 1015 experienced physical violence, sexual violence, or both, with 198 (35%) of 566 women and girls reporting sexual violence. 478 (47%) of 1015 participants were threatened and 198 (20%) were locked in a room. 685 (70%) of 985 who had data available worked 7 days per week and 296 (30%) of 989 worked at least 11 hours per day. 222 (22%) of 983 had a serious injury at work. 61.2% (95% CI 58.2-64.2) of participants reported symptom of depression, 42.8% (39.8-45.9) reported symptoms of anxiety, and 38.9% (36.0-42.0) reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. 5.2% (4.0-6.8) had attempted suicide in the past month. Participants who experienced extremely excessive overtime at work, restricted freedom, bad living conditions, threats, or severe violence were more likely to report symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
   Interpretation This is the first health study of a large and diverse sample of men, women, and child survivors of trafficking for various forms of exploitation. Violence and unsafe working conditions were common and psychological morbidity was associated with severity of abuse. Survivors of trafficking need access to health care, especially mental health care. Copyright (C) Kiss et al. Open Access article distributed under the terms of CC BY-NC-ND.

AB Moral injury is an emerging construct related to negative consequences associated with war-zone stressors that transgress military veterans' deeply held values/beliefs. Given the newness of the construct, there is a need for instrumentation that might assess morally injurious experiences (MIEs) in this population. Drawing on a community sample of 131 Iraq and/or Afghanistan Veterans and clinical sample of 82 returning Veterans, we conducted an initial psychometric evaluation of the newly developed Moral Injury QuestionnaireMilitary version (MIQ-M)a 20-item self-report measure for assessing MIEs. Possibly due to low rates of reporting, an item assessing sexual trauma did not yield favourable psychometric properties and was excluded from analyses. Veterans in the clinical sample endorsed significantly higher scores across MIQ-M items. Factor analytic results for the final 19 items supported a unidimensional structure, and convergent validity analyses revealed that higher scores (indicative of more MIEs) were correlated with greater general combat exposure, impairments in work/social functioning, posttraumatic stress and depression in the community sample. In addition, when controlling for demographics, deployment-related factors and exposure to life threat stressors associated with combat, tests of incremental validity indicated that MIQ-M scores were also uniquely linked with suicide risk and other mental health outcomes. These findings provide preliminary evidence for the validity of the MIQ-M and support the applicability of this measure for further research and clinical work with Veterans.

TI Mortality among UK Gulf War veterans
SO LANCET
LA English
DT Article
ID VIETNAM; HEALTH; COUNTERPOINT
AB Background Armed forces personnel who served in the Gulf War report more current ill-health than those who were not deployed. There has been concern expressed that they may also experience higher mortality rates.
   Methods A retrospective cohort study was done including all 53 462 UK Gulf War veterans (Gulf cohort) and a comparison group equivalent in size of personnel who were not deployed but matched for age, sex, rank, service, and level of fitness (Era cohort). Individuals were identified on central registers of the Office for National Statistics and information on death among cohort subjects, including cause of death, obtained. Follow-up extended from April 1, 1991 (the end of the Gulf War) until March 31, 1999.
   Findings There were 395 deaths among the Gulf cohort and 378 deaths amongst the Era cohort (mortality rate ratio [MRR] 1.05, 95% CI 0.91-1.21). Mortality from "external" causes was higher in the Gulf cohort (Gulf 254, Era 216; MRR 1.18 [0.98-1.42] while mortality from "disease-related" causes was lower (Gulf 122, Era 141; 0.87 [0.67-1.11]). The higher mortality rate from "external" causes in the Gulf cohort was principally due to higher mortality rates from accidents. There was, however, no excess of deaths recorded as suicide in the Gulf cohort.
   Interpretation This follow-up of Veterans of the Gulf war has shown, 8 years after the end of the conflict, that although they have experienced higher mortality rates than a comparison cohort, the excess mortality rate is very small and does not approach statistical significance. The excess is related mainly to accidents rather than disease, a pattern that is consistent both with US veterans of the Gulf war and veterans from other conflicts.

AB BackgroundCombat exposure is associated with increased risk of mental disorders and suicidality. Moral injury, or persistent effects of perpetrating or witnessing acts that violate one's moral code, may contribute to mental health problems following military service. The pervasiveness of potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs) among U.S. combat veterans, and what factors are associated with PMIEs in this population remains unknown.
   MethodsData were analyzed from the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study (NHRVS), a contemporary and nationally representative survey of a population-based sample of U.S. veterans, including 564 combat veterans, collected September-October 2013. Types of PMIEs (transgressions by self, transgressions by others, and betrayal) were assessed using the Moral Injury Events Scale. Psychiatric and functional outcomes were assessed using established measures.
   ResultsA total of 10.8% of combat veterans acknowledged transgressions by self, 25.5% endorsed transgressions by others, and 25.5% endorsed betrayal. PMIEs were moderately positively associated with combat severity ( = .23, P < .001) and negatively associated with white race, college education, and higher income (s = .11-.16, Ps < .05). Transgressions by self were associated with current mental disorders (OR = 1.65, P < .001) and suicidal ideation (OR = 1.67, P < .001); betrayal was associated with postdeployment suicide attempts (OR = 1.99, P < .05), even after conservative adjustment for covariates, including combat severity.
   ConclusionsA significant minority of U.S combat veterans report PMIEs related to their military service. PMIEs are associated with risk for mental disorders and suicidality, even after adjustment for sociodemographic variables, trauma and combat exposure histories, and past psychiatric disorders.

AB This overview, based on a literature review and new data from the three cohorts (Whitehall Studies I and II, and the Vietnam Experience Study), has four objectives: (a) to outline the major determinants of height, so providing an indication as to what exposures this characteristic may capture; (b) to summarise, by reviewing reports from large scale studies, the relation between adult height and a range of disease outcomes - both somatic and psychiatric - with particular emphasis on coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke: (c) to discuss why these relationships may exist, in particular, the role, if any, of socioeconomic position in explaining the apparent associations: and, finally (d) to outline future research directions in this field.
   The large majority of evidence for predictors of height, and its health consequences, comes from observational studies. While genetic predisposition is a major determinant of height, secular rises in childhood and adult stature across successive birth cohorts suggest that early life environment also has an important impact. Plausible non-genetic determinants of height include nutrition, illness, socioeconomic status, and psychosocial stress. Evidence for an association between height and a series of health endpoints is accumulating. Thus, shorter people appear to experience increased risk of CHD, and these associations appear to be independent of socioeconomic position and other potentially confounding variables. For stroke, and its sub-types, findings are less clear. In contrast to CHD, some cancers. such as carcinoma of the colorectum, prostate, breast (in women), central nervous system, skin, endometrium, thyroid and blood (haematopoietic) are more common in taller people. While height may be negatively related to the risk of completed suicide, conclusions about the links between stature and other health endpoints is problematic given the paucity of evidence, which should be addressed.
   Ultimately, for want of better data, investigators in this area have used height as a proxy for a range of pre-adult exposures. In future, research should aim to explore the predictive capacity of direct measures of diet, psychosocial stress, childhood chronic illness and so on, rather than focus on height or its components. The problem is that extended follow-up of child cohorts with such data are required, and studies which hold these data are not currently available, although several are either maturing to the point where they offer sufficient clinical outcomes to facilitate analyses or are in the advanced planning stage.

AB Background: The children of male veterans with combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are at particularly high risk of emotional and behavioral problems. However, no studies have examined non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) in this population of youth.
   Aims: To determine the prevalence and psychosocial correlates of lifetime NSSI in a sample of psychiatric outpatient adolescent offspring of Croatian PTSD male veterans.
   Method: Consecutive outpatient adolescent offspring of Croatian male PTSD veterans, aged 12 to 18 years, were assessed on the Deliberate Self Harm Inventory, the Youth Self-Report, the Family Assessment Device, the Parental Bonding Instrument and the Demographics Questionnaire.
   Results: Of the whole sample, 52.7% of adolescents reported NSSI at least once during their lifetime. Lifetime NSSI was significantly associated with internalizing symptoms (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.14; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-4.42, p = .040), poor family functioning (adjusted OR = 6.54; 95% CI: 2.02-21.22, p = .002), lower maternal and paternal care (adjusted OR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.40-0.56, p = .000 and adjusted OR = 0.82; 95% CI: 0.73-0.91, p = .000, respectively) and higher paternal control (adjusted OR = 1.84; 95% CI: 1.59-2.14, p = .000) in multivariate analysis. No association was found between lifetime NSSI and any of the socio-demographic variables.
   Conclusion: NSSI is a significant clinical problem in outpatient adolescent offspring of PTSD male veterans, which may be influenced by clinical and family factors. Interventions aimed at reducing internalizing symptoms and improving family functioning and parental behaviors are needed in the treatment of adolescent offspring of male PTSD veterans engaging in NSSI.

TI Consequences of captivity: health effects of far East imprisonment in
   World War II

AB Though medical consequences of war attract attention, the health consequences of the prisoner-of-war (POW) experience are poorly researched and appreciated. The imprisonment of Allied military personnel by the Japanese during the World War II provides an especially dramatic POW scenario in terms of deprivation, malnutrition and exposure to tropical diseases. Though predominantly British, these POWs also included troops from Australia, Holland and North America. Imprisonment took place in various locations in Southeast Asia and the Far East for a 3.5-year period between 1942 and 1945. Nutritional deficiency syndromes, dysentery, malaria, tropical ulcers and cholera were major health problems; and supplies of drugs and medical equipment were scarce. There have been limited mortality studies on ex-Far East prisoners (FEPOWs) since repatriation, but these suggest an early (up to 10 years post-release) excess mortality due to tuberculosis, suicides and cirrhosis (probably related to hepatitis B exposure during imprisonment). In terms of morbidity, the commonest has been a psychiatric syndrome which would now be recognized as post-traumatic stress disorderpresent in at least one-third of FEPOWs and frequently presenting decades later. Peptic ulceration, osteoarthritis and hearing impairment also appear to occur more frequently. In addition, certain tropical diseases have persisted in these survivorsnotably infections with the nematode worm Strongyloides stercoralis. Studies 30 years or more after release have shown overall infection rates of 15. Chronic strongyloidiasis of this type frequently causes a linear urticarial larva currens rash, but can potentially lead to fatal hyperinfection if immunity is suppressed. Finally, about 5 of FEPOW survivors have chronic nutritional neuropathic syndromesusually optic atrophy or sensory peripheral neuropathy (often painful). The World War II FEPOW experience was a unique, though often tragic, accidental experiment into the longer term effects of under nutrition and untreated exotic disease. Investigation of the survivors has provided unique insights into the medical outcome of deprivation in tropical environments.

AB Background: Combat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) involves significant suffering, impairments in social and occupational functioning, substance use and medical comorbidity, and increased mortality from suicide and other causes. Many veterans continue to suffer despite current treatments. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has shown promise in refractory movement disorders, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder, with deep brain targets chosen by integration of clinical and neuroimaging literature. The basolateral amygdala (BLn) is an optimal target for high-frequency DBS in PTSD based on neurocircuitry findings from a variety of perspectives. DBS of the BLn was validated in a rat model of PTSD by our group, and limited data from humans support the potential safety and effectiveness of BLn DBS.
   Methods/Design: We describe the protocol design for a first-ever Phase I pilot study of bilateral BLn high-frequency DBS for six severely ill, functionally impaired combat veterans with PTSD refractory to conventional treatments. After implantation, patients are monitored for a month with stimulators off. An electroencephalographic (EEG) telemetry session will test safety of stimulation before randomization to staggered-onset, double-blind sham versus active stimulation for two months. Thereafter, patients will undergo an open-label stimulation for a total of 24 months. Primary efficacy outcome is a 30% decrease in the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) total score. Safety outcomes include extensive assessments of psychiatric and neurologic symptoms, psychosocial function, amygdala-specific and general neuropsychological functions, and EEG changes. The protocol requires the veteran to have a cohabiting significant other who is willing to assist in monitoring safety and effect on social functioning. At baseline and after approximately one year of stimulation, trauma script-provoked (18)FDG PET metabolic changes in limbic circuitry will also be evaluated.
   Discussion: While the rationale for studying DBS for PTSD is ethically and scientifically justified, the importance of the amygdaloid complex and its connections for a myriad of emotional, perceptual, behavioral, and vegetative functions requires a complex trial design in terms of outcome measures. Knowledge generated from this pilot trial can be used to design future studies to determine the potential of DBS to benefit both veterans and nonveterans suffering from treatment-refractory PTSD.
