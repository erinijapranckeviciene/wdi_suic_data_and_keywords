AB The suicide phenomenon is assuming alarming proportions worldwide; an average of 1,200 cases of suicide per day recorded by the World Health organization.
   In Algeria, the phenomenon has long remained taboo subject, despite its scientific importance, and its profound consequences, which continue to touch the brunt of the population in general and youth in particular.
   Suicide has experienced in recent years, a wide media coverage which tends to regard it as the result of several factors. This transition to the act is often associated with problems of the population and the difficulties of everyday life.
   This communication proposes therefore a sociological reading of deferent observed suicidal tendencies, and analyzed, from, of an empirical survey conducted in the last two years in the region of Kabylia. The aim through this proposal; is to try to explain the specificity of cultural and sociological factors that characterize the phenomenon of suicide in this region.

AB One of the most intractable social and economic challenges in emerging countries, namely, high unemployment, may be tackled by social entrepreneurship and franchising. In this ongoing research, we focus on Algeria as the case study to demonstrate the practical application of social entrepreneurship and franchising in an emerging country. Though Algeria has invested heavily in large-scale government- sponsored employment programs, unemployment, especially among the youth, remains stubbornly high, leading to a number of serious social and security problems (criminality, drug usage, suicides, illegal emigration, terrorism, etc.). We argue that social entrepreneurship combined with franchising has the potential to foster quickly a large number of social entrepreneurs, leading to the creation of a large number of sustainable jobs, especially among the educated youth in Algeria and, by extension, in many emerging countries.

TI SENTIMENTAL TERROR NARRATIVES GENDERING VIOLENCE, DIVIDING SYMPATHY
SO JOURNAL OF MIDDLE EAST WOMENS STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID MEDIA
AB Why do novels and studies originating in the United States and Europe sympathetically depict Middle Eastern women who commit or support forms of violence identified as terrorist? This article draws on scholarship on cosmopolitanism and the sentimental novel, as well as on novelistic and journalistic accounts of Palestinian female suicide bombers from the United States and Algeria/France: Barbara Victor's Army of Roses: Inside the World of Palestinian Suicide Bombers (Rodale, 2003) and Yasmina Khadra's The Attack (Doubleday, 2005). It argues that sentimental terror narratives use gendered, maternal imagery to produce a liberal stance on terrorism that combines sympathetic comprehension of the forces that foster violence with condemnation of the violence itself The article uses Syrian novelist Khaled Khalifa's Madih al-Karahiya (In Praise of Hatred, 2006) as an alternative literary depiction of gender and violence, aimed at a Syrian audience, that produces non-normative forms of sympathy to foster national reconciliation after civil conflict.

AB Two recent novels by Algerians (Tahar Djaout's The Last Summer of Reason, and Slimane Benaissa's The Last Night of a Damned Soul) offer critiques of Islamic totalitarianism in two settings: local Arab states like the one fictionalized by Djaout, and the cosmopolitan community of diasporic Muslims recruited to the ranks of suicide bombers in the name of self-and social purification. Djaout, assassinated by fundamentalists outside his home in Algeria for writing against them, and Benaissa, charting the psychological path towards violence taken by one westernized Muslim in the United States, instantiate the ongoing debate within Islam.

AB The use of political assassinations against key leaders of liberation movements has had a major impact on the course of history in Africa and the Middle East. Not only have some of the greatest of Third World leaders been killed but so, too, has the hope for political change they embodied. This survey of assassinations carried out by western states and their agents from the 1960s onwards reveals a bloody legacy of killings of leaders from Algeria, Cameroon, Congo, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Morocco, Mozambique, Palestine, South Africa, Togo and Zimbabwe - all of which were linked to the interests of western imperialism. Today's daily diet of suicide bombings and the targeting of civilians by both western militaries and jihadis is one consequence, it is suggested, of the brutalisation effected by the policy of political assassination.

ID TERRORISM
AB A number of observers have expressed serious concerns that Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI), as it expands in the Sahel, may become strong enough to be a threat to Europe and carry on the global mission of Al-Qaeda as conceived by bin Laden. This fear seems unwarranted. Using institutional analysis to study the AQMI behavioral fluctuations over the last decade, this article argues that AQMI's need to find a compromise between external and internal legitimacy has constrained its behavior. The affiliation of the Algerian terrorists with Al-Qaeda was in many ways a marriage of convenience that created a number of internal contradictions. At the cognitive level, implicit Algerian nationalism to rid the country of its corrupt regime remains at odds with pan-Islamic views shared by Al-Qaeda's leadership. At the normative level, indiscriminate suicide bombing supported by Al-Qaeda is abhorrent to many Algerian terrorists, who construe their mandate in the spirit of the Algerian war of independence where it is their duty to protect civilians. These and other contradictions prevent AQMI from developing a coherent political agenda and thus it is less likely to engage in a long-term conflict against European societies.

AB A key finding in the terrorism literature is that dictatorships experience less terrorism than democracies. However, we have few explanations for why some dictatorships experience substantial threats from terrorism while others do not. A growing body of work on authoritarian politics focuses on political institutions in these regimes to explain a broad range of political outcomes. Building on this literature, we argue that opposition political party activity increases the collective action capacity of regime opponents and that elected legislatures can channel this mobilized capacity into support for the government. However, when active opposition parties operate in the absence of legislatures, political opponents increasingly turn to terrorism. We find evidence that terrorist groups are most likely to emerge in dictatorships with opposition political parties but no elected legislature. These regimes also experience the highest volume of subsequent attacks.

SO MISSION ACCOMPLISHED?: THE CRISIS OF INTERNATIONAL INTERVENTION
LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
AB With Iraq "over" and Afghanistan on the wane, it was if the age of intervention had run out of steam. It needed some new cause to espouse. It soon found one. On 17 December 2010, a young Tunisian street trader committed suicide in public in protest of harassment by local officials. His action sparked the first revolution of the so-called Arab Spring. It was followed by street riots in Algeria, Oman, Yemen, Syria and Morocco. Then on 25 January the occupation of Tahrir Square in Cairo began. Egypt was bigger than all the others put together. The Arab Spring, through still winter, had come of age.
   The international community greeted these protests with unashamed enthusiasm, but was unsure how to proceed. The uprisings seemed autonomous, mimicking each other but essentially local outpourings of domestic dissent. How might liberal interventionism respond to changes that appeared to be moving in the right direction but without external stimulus? In particular might intervention find a way to help events in Egypt, ruled by a regime so far regarded as friendly to the West yet sitting on a powder keg of 82 million Arabs?

ID MATERNAL MORTALITY
AB Background: The United Nations Assembly adopted the Sustainable Development Goals to succeed the Millennium Development Goals in September 2015. From a European perspective, the development of health in the countries of North Africa are of special interest as a critical factor of overall social development in Europe's Mediterranean partners. In this paper, we address the mortality related SDG-3 targets, the likelihood to achieve them until 2030 and analyze how they are defined. Methods: We projected mortality trends from 2000-2015 to 2030, based on mortality estimates by inter-agency groups and the WHO in mother and child health, non-communicable diseases, and road traffic mortality. The gap analysis compares the time remaining until 2030 to the time needed to complete the target assuming a linear trend of the respective indicator. A delay of not more than 3.75 years is considered likely to achieve the target. Results: The SDG-3 targets of a Maternal Mortality Ratio below 70 per 100 000 live births and an U5MR below 25 per 1 000 live births have been achieved by Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia. Libya and Tunisia have also achieved the target for Newborn Mortality with Egypt close to achieving it as well. Algeria and Morocco are generally on track for most of the indicators, including deaths from non-communicable diseases and suicide rates; however, all of the countries are lagging when it comes to deadly Road Traffic Injuries for 2030. Mauritania is the only North African country which is not likely to reach the 2030 targets for any of the mortality indicators. Conclusions: Although mortality statistics may be incomplete there is an impressive gradient from East to West showing Mauritania and deadly road traffic injuries as the most problematic areas. Given the large differences between countries baselines, we consider it preferable to set realistic targets to be achieved until 2030.
