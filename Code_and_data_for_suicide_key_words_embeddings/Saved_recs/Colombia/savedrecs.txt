AB Introduction: Suicides are one of the main public health issues globally.
   Objective: To analyze the trends and impact of suicide mortality in Colombia and Mexico between 2000 and 2013, nationally, by sex and age groups.
   Materials and methods: Mortality vital statistics from the Colombian Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadistica and the Mexican Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia were used. We conducted a descriptive and cross sectional study for which we calculated standardized mortality rates and years of life lost in people between 0 and 100 years of age.
   Results: In Colombia, the suicide mortality rate decreased between 2000 and 2013 for both sexes (28% for men and 38% for women); an opposite trend was observed in Mexico (with an increase of 34% for males and 67% for females). In 2013, the years of life lost in Colombia were 0,32 among men and 0,15 among women, with a decreasing trend since 2000, whereas in Mexico a level of 0,42 was observed in men and 0,2 in women, with an increasing trend since 2000. The age groups where suicides had a bigger impact were those of men 15 to 49 years of age in both countries, while suicides were more uniformly distributed among women between 15 and 84 years of age.
   Conclusions: Suicide mortality increased gradually in Mexico, whereas in Colombia an opposite trend was observed. Suicides can be prevented, so it is fundamental to implement public health policies focused on timely identification, comprehensive prevention strategies and the study of associated risk factors.

AB Objectives. To report trends in mortality from suicide in Colombia from 1985 to 2002 by sex, age group, and method, and determine the number of Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL) to suicide during this period.
   Method A Age- and sex-specific and age-adjusted crude mortality rates were calculated based on mortality and population information available from the official database of the Department of National Statistics Administration, Colombia. YPLL were estimated and adjusted for societal impact, age, and poor quality of mortality records. The results were tabulated according to codes X600-X849 and Y870 from the International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems, 10th revision (ICD-10), and codes E950-E959 from the 9th revision (ICD-9).
   Results. Suicide rates have been climbing in Colombia since 1998, particularly among young adults and males. The highest rates among males were in the age groups 20-29 years of age and over 70 years of age, and rates increased over time. Among females, the highest rates were recorded for the group 10-19 years of age. The YPLL rose in proportion with the increase in suicides, from 0.81% in 1981 to 2.20% in 2002. Among males, the most common methods used were firearms and explosives, hanging, and poison, with a relative increase in hanging; whereas among females, poison was most common.
   Conclusions. A rising trend in suicide rates in Colombia was confirmed, especially among the productive segment of the population, which has resulted in a marked increase in YPLL.

AB Introduction: Suicide is a serious social and public health problem that affects the population of most countries in the world. Differences in suicide rates have been previously described between rural and urban areas.
   Objective. To study the trend of mortality rates by suicide in Colombia, in rural and urban areas by sex, age group and suicide methods for the period 1979-2014.
   Materials and methods. We conducted an ecological trend study using death certificates from the National Administrative Department of Statistics. Specific and adjusted mortality rates by age and sex were calculated. We estimated negative binomial and inflection points regression models to study the trends in mortality rates stratified by sex, age group and suicide method.
   Results. A total of 56,448 suicides were reported in Colombia between 1979-2014. The risk of suicide was higher in urban areas for men; for individuals between 25-44 years and 65 and over; and for those who used hanging as a suicide method. Also, the risk of suicide was higher in the rural area for men between 45-64 years old and men who used firearms, cutting weapons, hanging and others as suicide methods. Trend of suicide rates in urban areas showed its maximum peak in 1999 and the rural ones in 2000, then in the two areas there was a gradual descent. The hanging in the two areas presented a tendency to rise in men.
   Conclusions. Suicide has shown a tendency toward reduction after the year 2000, with differences between urban and rural areas.

   euthanasia in Hungary; human rights; right to die
AB The institution of active euthanasia has been legal in Colombia since 2015. In California, the regulation on physician-assisted suicide will come into effect on January 1, 2016. The legal institution of active euthanasia is not accepted under the law of the United States of America, however, physician-assisted suicide is accepted in an increasing number of member states. The related regulation in Oregon is imitated in other member states. In South America, -Colombia is not the first country to legalize active euthanasia: active euthanasia has been legal in Uruguay since 1932. The North American legal tradition markedly differs from the South American one and both are incompatible with the Central European rule of law. In Hungary and in most European Union countries, solely the passive form of euthanasia is legal. In the Benelux countries, the active form of euthanasia is legal because the supranational law of the European Union does not prohibit it. Notwithstanding, European Union law does not prescribe legalization of either the active form of euthanasia, or the physician-assisted suicide.

AB Historically, seasonal variations in suicide rates were thought to be associated with changes in weather. Most of this evidence however, is based on studies that were conducted in developed countries that are located outside the tropics. As such, it is necessary to examine this association in developing countries, such as Colombia, which do not experience marked seasons. In addition, it is important to adjust for the effect of holidays when analyzing this association as they have been reported to be a relevant confounding factor. Our objective was to estimate the association between daily suicide incidence among men and women in five major Colombian cities (Bogota, Medellin, Cali, Barranquilla, and Bucaramanga) and daily temperature and rainfall. For this purpose, we conducted a multi-city, multi-temporal ecological study from 2005 to 2015, using data from the suicide mortality registries (provided by the National Administrative Department of Statistics). Daily measurements of the two weather variables were obtained from the official historical registry of the meteorological station at each city airport. We used these data to estimate conditional Poisson models for daily suicide counts, stratifying by sex and adjusting for holidays. Although we found that none of the weather variable estimators could reject the null hypothesis, we uncovered an association between suicide incidence and long weekends in the total suicide model (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR): 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-1.23). We found no evidence of association between weather variables and suicide in Colombia. Our study is based on daily observations and it provides evidence of absence of this association in a tropical country that does not experience marked seasons.

AB The scope of this article is to analyze the risk of death by suicide in Colombia based on the covariables of sex, age group, year, region and/or department from 2000 to 2013. The databases of deaths by suicide and population projections of DANE were used. A longitudinal and analytical study was conducted. From 2000 to 2013, annual trends of deaths by suicide by means of modeling of covariables were established and risk estimates were collected. The Poisson regression model (PRM) was used. IRR was used according to the MRP with a level of significance of (P < 0.05). Colombians between the years 2000-2013, male, 15 to 34 years old, from the Central and Eastern regions and from the Departments of Vaupes, Huila and Quindio were those with the highest risk of death by suicide. The suicide rate decreased slightly as the years went by. The highest risk of suicide occurred among men of productive age, older adults, and in underdeveloped regions. Colombia requires a mental health policy that implements strategies for primary care, health promotion and disease prevention, aimed at promoting the quality of life, detection of suicidal ideation, treatment and rehabilitation of these people from a comprehensive rights and care approach.

DE Mortality; homicide; suicide; adolescent; violence; Colombia
AB Introduction: Psychosocial behaviors are the object of indifference, which has lead to a generalized increase in attitudes favoring violence. Among these, we can find young people as victims or killers.
   Objective: To describe the behavior of mortality due to homicide and suicide in young population between 15 and 24 years old in the departments of Colombia from 1998 to 2008.
   Materials and methods: This was a descriptive study form a secondary source. We used 150,433 death certificates with homicide or suicide as cause of death in 15 to 24 years old population in Colombia during the period 1998-2008. We calculated an index for favorable conditions for violence according to economical, social and educational variables.
   Results: Mortality rate was 95.6 deaths/100,000 people in this age range for homicide, and 10.1 for suicide. Men showed greater risk than women, with it being 12.3 higher for homicide and 1.2 for suicide. This evidences the way in which violence takes productive and reproductive lives, thus affecting the structure by sex and age and decreasing the opportunity window, but having a higher risk in some departments more than in others.
   Conclusion: According to the index for conditions for violence, the departments of Vaupes, Guaviare, Arauca and Guainia a are the ones with more favorable conditions for an increased risk of dying by homicide and suicide in people from 15 to 24 years old, regardless of other departments having higher deaths rates.

AB A community survey in 4,426 adults was undertaken as part of the World Mental Health Survey Initiative reporting the prevalence and risk factors for suicide-related outcomes in Colombia. Lifetime prevalence estimates of suicide ideation, plans, attempts, and risk factors for suicide-related outcomes were assessed. Retrospective reports of disorders age-of-onset were used to study associations between primary mental disorders and first onset of suicide-related outcomes. Risks of plans and attempts were highest with ideation early age-of-onset and within the first year. The highest risk for ideation and attempt among ideators occurred in the 18-29 age group. After first employment (defined as the first paid job accepted by the respondent) and presence of mental disorders constituted risk factors. Impulse-control disorders were strongest diagnostic predictors.

AB The main objective was to analyze the level, trend and impact of mortality by external causes in Colombia and Mexico between 1998 and 2015. The years of life lost were calculated for people younger than 85 years of age and their trend was estimated using a joinpoint regression analysis. The decomposition of life expectancy by cause of death and age groups was also calculated. In Colombia a significant decrease was observed in all the analyzed external causes of death; in Mexico, the increase of mortality by homicides and the continued rise in suicides reversed their declining trend. Mexico presented a higher mortality due to external causes than Colombia, which clearly shows the divergent trends in both countries.

AB We report the results of a retrospective, descriptive, qualitative study of suicide among university students in Bogota, Colombia. The objective of this study was to document the magnitude, principal characteristics, and impact of this phenomenon in the selected population. A semi-structured survey was employed to collect information from 66 individuals linked to the universities. A total of 45 cases of suicide were documented in the study period (2004-2014). Of these, 69% occurred in males and 31% in females. The age range was 17-27 years, with 62% of the cases in the 19-22 year-old group. The most common mechanisms employed were suffocation and poisoning, followed by intentional falls, use of a firearm, and drug overdose. The selected location was the place of residence in 52% of cases and the university campus in 16% of cases. The distribution of students by area of knowledge showed a predominance of social and human science (44%) followed by engineering (22%). A history of difficulties in family and affective relationships was common among victims, as was a history of exposure to intolerance of differences in sexual orientation. The individuals surveyed expressed a wide range of interpretations of the significance of suicide, both positive (courage, self-affirmation, autonomy) and negative (defeat, despair, and an inability to adapt).

AB Objective. Describe the psychometric properties of the Suicide Resilience Inventory (SRI-25), adapted to Spanish, in a student sample of adolescents and young adults from San Juan de Pasto, Colombia.
   Methods. The SRI-25 was adapted to the Spanish language by means of a simple translation. This involved the participation of 573 schoolchildren and college/-university students between 10 and 25 years of age.
   Results. In an exploratory factorial analysis by principal components, a structure of three factors was found to explain 52.83% of the variance. Factorial analysis was carried out by sex, educational level, and developmental stage. On this basis, it was confirmed that in all the groups, the items are weighted on the same factors as in the original test: namely, internal protection, emotional stability, and external protection. A Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.922 was obtained for the total test. Concerning the validity of the construct, the SRI-25 presented significant correlations with measurements of self-esteem, social support, problem-solving skills, reasons for living, depression, despair, and suicidal ideas.
   Conclusions. It was proved that the SRI-25 is a useful instrument for measuring resilience to suicide among adolescents and young people pursuing their education in San Juan de Pasto, Colombia.

AB This work shows the risk factors and psychological predictors associated with suicidal behavior in university students in Manizales and Medellin (Colombia). The sample comprised 1408 students. Plutchik's suicide risk, Beck's despair and depression and Barratt impulsivity scales were used. A suicide risk factor of 23.2% was found. Binary regression analysis shows that depression (OR= 1.2), impulsivity (OR= 1.04), hopelessness (OR= 1.1), suicide attempt (OR= 31.5), mental illness and family suicide attempt (OR= 2.2, OR= 2.1) explain between 41% and 62% of the variance of suicide risk. Through a structural equation modeling analysis, three explanatory models were established that show mental illness and suicide attempt in the family (model 1), impulsivity (model 2), and a history of suicide attempt by the student (model 3) are suicide mediating variables. The greatest total effect occurred in model 3, which explains 62.7% of the variation in suicide risk.

AB Objectives. To determine seasonal trends in the number of deaths from violence in Bogota, Colombia from 1997-2006 and to analyze any possible associations with the city's economic cycles.
   Methods. An ecologic study based on the official death toll from violence registered between January 1997 and September 2006 in Santa Fe de Bogota, Colombia. Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) time-series trimester models were used to describe the behavior of violent deaths. The explanatory variables for the city's economic cycles were the trimester series of the consumer price index, the unemployment rate, and the total number of people employed; these were related to the death series through transfer function models.
   Results. Of the 36 575 total deaths from violence in Bogota, 57.7% were homicides and 23.7% resulted from traffic accidents. The homicide, suicide, and traffic accident deaths showed downward trends, with a noteworthy seasonal pattern in the traffic accident and suicide deaths that peaked during the last two trimesters of each year. Significant associations were found between all the death series from all the different causes and at least one economic series, and in each case a respective transfer function model was identified.
   Conclusions. Homicides constituted the largest portion of the violent deaths, and exposed a seasonal pattern to this death type. Significant associations were found between deaths from violence and some economic variables, revealing a cycle tied to the life of the city. The socioeconomic circumstances affecting a society were confirmed to influence the level of violence.

AB Objective: To assess the effect of an educational intervention to prevent suicidal behavior in teenagers of grades 6th to 8th at a school in Manizales, Colombia. Materials and methods: Quasi-experimental study (n = 103), that collected demo-graphic variables, the Plutchik Suicide Risk Scale, the Myth or Reality Survey, the Rathus Assertiveness Scale, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Participants were divided into five groups and an educational intervention lasting 8 sessions was given to them. A month later, the same questionnaires were administered. Results: Before the educational intervention, suicidal risk was identified in 42.7% of the sample, low self-esteem in 56.9%, confrontational assertiveness in 68.9%, and 2,9 on the myths around suicide questionnaire. After the interven-tion, the suicide risk factor fell to 6.8%, high self-esteem was found in 45.1%, a greater proportion of patients, 44.7% showed confrontational assertiveness, and the score on the myths questionnaire rose to 4.5. The t-test for paired groups showed significant learning in all cases (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The study highlighted the importance recognizing and strengthening social skills, having assertive communication and intellectual skills in order to reduce suicidal risk in young students.

DT Article
DE Altruistic Manner; Assisted Suicide; Autonomy; Decriminalization; End of
   Life
AB This paper aims to analyse the right to assisted suicide. Assisted suicide consists of ending one's own life, following instructions from a medical doctor, which means the person causes their own death. Autonomy means self-determination, in which the person builds their life according to their own preferences. Based on the respect of one's autonomy, a capable person facing a terminal illness or an untreatable illness, which causes suffering, has the right of choosing death after receiving the necessary orientations by a physician to commit suicide. In Brazil assisted suicide is characterized as a crime of inducement, instigation or assistance to suicide, according to article 122 of the criminal code. Considering that several European countries, five states of the United States of America, Quebec and Colombia allow assisted suicide practiced according to the procedure established by the law, in respect of self-determination and taking into consideration that living is a choice and not an imposition, the practice of assisted suicide in Brazil in an exclusively altruistic manner, could be considered non culpable conduct.

AB With the aim of knowing the psychometric characteristics of a Spanish version of the Positive and Negative Suicidal Ideation Inventory-PANSI, an instrumental study was developed. Its application required the participation of 643 students of high schools and universities of San Juan de Pasto (Colombia). The exploratory factor analysis showed a bi-factor structure, that accounted for 64% of variance. The first factor corresponded to negative suicidal thoughts, while the second one included protective thoughts against suicide. The total scale and the sub-scales had high values of internal consistency. Significant relationships were found between PANSI and measures of depression, hopelessness, suicidal thoughts and self-esteem, and with severity indicators of suicidal behavior. It was concluded that PANSI has adequate psychometric properties, making it suitable to be used with adolescents and young students.

AB Objective. Analyze the behavior of direct medical costs in relation to the number of suicide attempts and compare the costs of cognitive-behavioral therapy with those of conventional treatment.
   Methods. The cost of hospital services for attempted suicide was quantified for 248 patients with a diagnosis of mental illness treated at the Antioquia Mental Hospital, a state social enterprise (E.S.E.), and a cost-outcome analysis was performed.
   Results. It was found that the average direct cost of care for patients with four or more suicide attempts was equivalent to US$ 5,641, a US$ 5,490 difference vis-a-vis the group with a single attempt. Moreover, the cost increased with the number of attempts. Finally, the diagnosis of mental illness (e.g., chronicity), the method used in the suicide attempt, and the need for specialized services were associated with the increase in direct costs.
   Conclusions. The use of a public health approach involving preventive strategies that assess and monitor psychosocial factors could reduce the problem and its direct medical costs.

AB The author explores the concept of identity as a frame of analysis in adolescents responding to various actual experiences of trauma. The author looks into numerous themes including the impact of broken identities, different ways of understanding the "victim identity", the identities of trauma, the role of transitions, as well as identity dilemmas. By examining the experience of young Mapuche in South America, the experience of war and political violence in Mexico and el Salvador, the identity of displaced young people in Colombia, and a multilevel analysis of child suicides among the Embera ethnic group in Choco, Colombia, a psychosocial and communitarian analysis of the impact of violence and war on youth is offered.

AB Purpose: To examine suicide mortality trends among young people (10-24 years of age(1)) in selected countries and territories of the Americas.
   Methods: An ecological study was conducted using a time series of suicide mortality data from 19 countries and one territory in the Region of the Americas from 2001 to 2008, comprising 90.3% of the regional population. The analyses included age-adjusted suicide mortality rates, average annual variation in suicide mortality rates, and relative risks for suicide, by age and sex.
   Results: The mean suicide rate for the selected study period and countries/territory was 5.7/100,000 young people (10-24 years), with suicide rates higher among males (7.7/100,000) than females (2.4/100,000). Countries with the highest total suicide mortality rates among young people (10-24 years) were Guyana, Suriname, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Chile, and Ecuador; countries with the lowest total suicide mortality rates included Mexico, Venezuela, Cuba, and Brazil, and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. During this period, there was a significant increase in suicide mortality rates among young people in the following countries: Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, and Suriname; countries with significant decreases in suicide mortality rates included Canada, Colombia, Cuba, El Salvador, and Venezuela. The three leading suicide methods in the Americas were hanging, firearms, and poisoning.
   Conclusions: Some countries of the Americas have experienced a rise in adolescent and youth suicide during the study period, with males at a higher risk of committing suicide than females. Adolescent and youth suicide policies and programs are recommended, to curb this problem. Methodological limitations are discussed. (C) 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

AB In the present report we want it to see if there is a connection between serotonin and/or dopamine and the aggression-suicidal risk axis in patients with major depression disorders. 113 patients were selected and we used the following specific scales: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Colombia Suicide Risk Scale, and the Buss & Perry Aggression Questionnaire. Serotonin and dopamine were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. The results of this study are clear in terms of the relationship between neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine on one hand and aggression and suicide risk on the other. Our analysis of the data reveals significant Pearson correlations with both aggressive serotonin and dopamine and suicide risk. Moreover, following linear regression, both serotonin levels and dopamine levels resulted in significant predictors of aggression and suicide risk. In addition, the social implications of our results are presented and discussed.

DE Aging; Death; Euthanasia; Suicide
AB The purpose of this article is to promote a debate about controversial issues there are pertinent to human ageing, but which are not often discussed by the society. Through bibliographic research, documentary and empirical studies, we presented questions related to ageing, death, euthanasia and suicide. It has been noted in this study that some topics are often considered a taboo, such as euthanasia, but there are countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Colombia where this procedure has already been adopted and, in some cases, even regulated. It has been found in this work that death is often not the greatest fear of the human being, but rather the fear of loss of freedom and control of one's life. Family support, clinical treatments and spirituality can be considered to be great allies in trying to prevent suicide by older people.

TI Geospatial, racial, and educational variation in firearm mortality in
   the USA, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia, 1990-2015: a comparative analysis
   of vital statistics data
SO LANCET PUBLIC HEALTH

DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; DEATH RATES; SUICIDE
AB Background Firearm mortality is a leading, and largely avoidable, cause of death in the USA, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia. We aimed to assess the changes over time and demographic determinants of firearm deaths in these four countries between 1990 and 2015.
   Methods In this comparative analysis of firearm mortality, we examined national vital statistics data from 1990-2015 from four publicly available data repositories in the USA, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia. We extracted medically-certified deaths and underlying population denominators to calculate the age-specific and sex-specific firearm deaths and the risk of firearm mortality at the national and subnational level, by education for all four countries, and by race or ethnicity for the USA and Brazil. Analyses were stratified by intent (homicide, suicide, unintentional, or undetermined). We quantified avoidable mortality for each country using the lowest number of subnational age-specific and period-specific death rates.
   Findings Between 1990 and 2015, 106-3 million medically-certified deaths were recorded, including 2 472 000 firearm deaths, of which 851 000 occurred in the USA, 272 000 in Mexico, 855 000 in Brazil, and 494000 in Colombia. Homicides accounted for most of the firearm deaths in Mexico (225 000 [82.7%]), Colombia (463 000 [93.8%]), and Brazil (766 000 [89.5%]). Suicide accounted for more than half of all firearm deaths in the USA (479000 [56.3%]). In each country, firearm mortality was highest among men aged 15-34 years, accounting for up to half of the total risk of death in that age group. During the study period, firearm mortality risks increased in Mexico and Brazil but decreased in the USA and Colombia, with marked national and subnational geographical variation. Young men with low educational attainment were at increased risk of firearm homicide in all four countries, and in the USA and Brazil, black and brown men, respectively, were at the highest risk. The risk of firearm homicide was 14 times higher in black men in the USA aged 25-34 years with low educational attainment than comparably-educated white men (1.52% [99% CI 1-50-1.54] vs 0.11% [0.10-0.12]), and up to four times higher than in comparably-educated men in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. In the USA, the risk of firearm homicide was more than 30 times higher in black men with post-secondary education than comparably educated white men. If countries could achieve the same firearm mortality rates nationally as in their lowest-burden states, 1 777 800 firearm deaths at all ages and in both sexes could be avoided, including 1 028 000 deaths in men aged 15-34 years.
   Interpretation Firearm mortality in the USA, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia is highest among young adult men, and is strongly associated with race and ethnicity, and low education levels. Reductions in firearm deaths would improve life expectancy, particularly for black men in the USA, and would reduce racial and educational disparities in mortality. Copyright (C) 2019 The Author(s).

DT Article
DE Euthanasia; assisted-suicide; dignity; autonomy; right to die
AB Two recent 2017 decisions of Colombia's Constitutional Court have widened the scope of the right to euthanasia, first declared by the Court in its 1997 ruling. From its initial configuration as a fundamental liberty right, based upon the dignity/autonomy of terminally ill, competent patients, it has come to be attributed (on the basis of an idea of dignity centered on the avoidance of suffering and not so much on the autonomy notions of the first decision) to terminally ill and seriously suffering girls, boys and teenagers (which means that in cases of their complete lack of competence the right is exercised by their parents). This paper analyses the core of this jurisprudence and highlights (in addition to the need to distinguish between competent and non-competent patients when discussing "good death" matters) what is considered a questionable use of the labile concept of dignity as a parameter for judging the constitutionality of laws.

AB The association between suicide risk and exposure to violence in the home, street, school, television in adolescents of Santa Marta (Colombia) was analyzed. A sample of 210 adolescents aged 12-19 years (M = 14.6 SD = 1.38) was evaluated. The subjects responded to the Plutchik Suicide Risk Scale and the Violence Exposure Scale. We found a bivariate association with exposure to violence in the home. In an adjusted logistic regression model the support of parents / siblings / friends (OR = 0.213 CI 95% = 0.70-0649) is a protective factor for suicidal risk, while female gender (OR = 5.397 95% CI = 2.541-11.460), exposure to violence in the home (OR = 2.344, 95% CI = 1.161-4.298) and difficulties in entering education (OR = 3.257, 95% CI = 1013-10.467) are risk factors. It is concluded that adolescent women, victims of domestic violence and with problems to access basic education are more likely to present suicidal risk.

AB Objective. Describe the mortality patterns, burden of disease, and mechanisms of injury by homicide in Colombia between 1985 and 2006.
   Methods. The official population and mortality databases in Colombia were used. Equivalencies of the underlying cause of death were identified and grouped according to the shortlists of the Ninth and Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases. The years of potential life lost (YPLL), indices of YPLL, and crude, adjusted, and specific mortality rates associated with major causes and external causes for each sex were calculated. The homicide mechanisms were described.
   Results. During the study period, a total of 523 870 homicides were recorded (484 475 in men and 39 395 in women). Homicides accounted for 13.8% of total mortality (21.4% of mortality in men and 2.6% in women) and generated 24.2% of YPLL (35.2% in men and 5.8% in women). The highest rates in men were found in the 20-44-year age range, with specific rates of up to 366.9 per 100 000 population, and in women in the 15-40 years age range with specific rates of up to 24.9 per 100 000 population. The most frequent homicide mechanism in both sexes was firearms.
   Conclusion. Homicides represent a significant burden of disease in Colombia, particularly affecting the young male population. Mortality from homicide has trended downward in recent years.

AB The balance sheet concerning the guarantees of the human rights, in the penitentiaries and prison centers of Colombia, is a non-encouraging situation; persons deprived of the freedom in the penitentiary centers of the country suffer inhuman conditions. In spite of the constitutional and legal advances remains the historical debt of Colombian State, respect the guarantees of human rights of a group of persons considered by the international community in conditions of vulnerability and under the custody of the State. Colombia has proved to be unable to materially abide with dispositions of by the Constitution, poliened which have been endorsed but the jurisprudence of this high tribunal, regarding the guarantees, of the human rights of the population deprived of freedom. The article contains a research about several forms of torture and cruel inhuman and degrading treatments permanently persons deprived of freedom and of the reasons significant increase of cases of suicide and violent deaths of prisoners in prison and penitentiary centers of the country.

AB Attachment is considered an important element in mental health, however, the relationship between attachment dimensions and suicidal risk has been little studied. Objective: To establish the association between trust, communication, and alienation and suicide risk in Colombian school adolescents. Subjects and Method: A cross-sectional observational study with an analytical component was designed in a randomized sample of 399 school adolescents (n = 1,901), according to a 30% prevalence of high suicide risk, members of the official educational institutions of Santa Marta (Colombia), the commune with the highest index of unsatisfied basic needs. Participants completed the Armsden & Greenberg attachment inventory and the Plutchik suicide risk scale, both validated locally. Reliability and association tests were calculated. Results: Adolescents were 339 adolescents between 13 and 19 years of age (M = 15.7, SD = 1.1), 57.8% were women. 59.9% of adolescents showed low trust in the mother, 57.2% low communication with the mother, 54.9% low alienation with the mother, 46.3%, low trust in the father, 49% low communication with the father, 48.7% low alienation with the father, and 28.6% high suicide risk. There was an association (adjusted) between high suicide risk and trust in the mother (OR = 2.00, 95%CI 1.12-3.57), communication with the mother (OR = 3.80, 95%CI 2.13-6.75), trust in the father (OR = 2.39, 95%CI 1.41-4.03), and communication with the father (OR = 2.01, 95%CI 1.19-3.37). Conclusions: Low trust and low communication with mother and father are risk factors for high suicide risk in Colombian school adolescents. Further research on this association in other populations is needed, as well as to consider other mediating factors.

AB IMPORTANCE The increasing legalization of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide worldwide makes it important to understand related attitudes and practices.
   OBJECTIVE To review the legal status of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide and the available data on attitudes and practices.
   EVIDENCE REVIEW Polling data and published surveys of the public and physicians, official state and country databases, interview studies with physicians, and death certificate studies (the Netherlands and Belgium) were reviewed for the period 1947 to 2016. FINDINGS Currently, euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide can be legally practiced in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Colombia, and Canada (Quebec since 2014, nationally as of June 2016). Physician-assisted suicide, excluding euthanasia, is legal in 5 US states (Oregon, Washington, Montana, Vermont, and California) and Switzerland. Public support for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in the United States has plateaued since the 1990s (range, 47%-69%). In Western Europe, an increasing and strong public support for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide has been reported; in Central and Eastern Europe, support is decreasing. In the United States, less than 20% of physicians report having received requests for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide, and 5% or less have complied. In Oregon and Washington state, less than 1% of licensed physicians write prescriptions for physician-assisted suicide per year. In the Netherlands and Belgium, about half or more of physicians reported ever having received a request; 60% of Dutch physicians have ever granted such requests. Between 0.3% to 4.6% of all deaths are reported as euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide in jurisdictions where they are legal. The frequency of these deaths increased after legalization. More than 70% of cases involved patients with cancer. Typical patients are older, white, and well-educated. Pain is mostly not reported as the primary motivation. A large portion of patients receiving physician-assisted suicide in Oregon and Washington reported being enrolled in hospice or palliative care, as did patients in Belgium. In no jurisdiction was there evidence that vulnerable patients have been receiving euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide at rates higher than those in the general population.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are increasingly being legalized, remain relatively rare, and primarily involve patients with cancer. Existing data do not indicate widespread abuse of these practices.

AB Introduction: Poisoning due to pesticides is an important public health problem worldwide due its morbidity and mortality. In Colombia, there are no exact data on mortality due to pesticide poisoning.
   Objective: To estimate the trend of mortality rate due to pesticide poisoning in Colombia between 1998 and 2011.
   Materials and methods: We carried out a descriptive analysis with the database reports of death as unintentional poisoning, self-inflicted intentional poisoning, aggression with pesticides, and poisoning with non-identified intentionality, population projections between 1998 and 2011, and rurality indexes. Crude and age-adjusted mortality rates were estimated and trends and Spearman coefficients were evaluated.
   Results: A total of 4,835 deaths were registered (age-adjusted mortality rate of 2.38 deaths per 100,000 people). Mortality rates were higher in rural areas, for self-inflicted intentional poisoning, in men and in age groups between 15 and 39 years old. The trend has been decreasing since 2002. Municipality mortality rates due to unintentional poisoning and aggression correlated significantly with the rurality index in less rural municipalities.
   Conclusions: Mortality rates due to pesticide poisoning presented a mild decrease between 1998 and 2011. It is necessary to adjust and reinforce the measures conducive to reducing pesticide exposure in order to avoid poisoning and reduce mortality.

AB Background: Recent epidemiological studies have suggested that air pollution could be associated with suicide. However, other studies have criticized these results for being analytically weak and not taking into account potential confounding factors. As such, further studies examining the relationship under diverse contexts are necessary to help clarify this issue. This study explored the association between specific air pollutants (NO2, SO2, PM10, PM25, CO and O-3) and suicide incidence in four Colombian cities after adjusting for climatic variables and holidays
   Methods: A time series of daily suicides among men and women living in Bogota, Medellin, Cali and Bucaramanga was generated using information from the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) for the years 2011-2014. At the same time, the average daily concentration of each air pollutant for each city was obtained from monitoring stations belonging to the National Air Quality Surveillance System. Using this information together, we generated conditional Poisson models (stratified by day, month and year) for the suicide rate in men and women, with air pollutants as the principal explanatory variable. These models were adjusted for temperature, relative humidity, precipitation and holidays.
   Results: No association was found between any of the examined pollutants and suicide: NO2 (IRR:0.99, 95% CI: 0.95-1.04), SO2 (IRR:0.99, 95% CI: 0.98-1.01), PM10 (IRR:0.99, 95% CI:0.95-1.03), PM2.5 (IRR:1.01, 95% CI: 0.98-1.05), CO (IRR:1.00, 95% CI:1.00-1.00) and O-3 (IRR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.96-1.04). In the same way, no association was found in stratified models by sex and age group neither in lagged and cumulative effects models.
   Conclusions: After adjusting for major confounding factors, we found no statistically significant association between air pollution and suicide in Colombia. These "negative" results provide further insight into the current discussion regarding the existence of such a relationship.

AB This paper reflects, from a queer perspective, on the emergence of gender ideology (R) in Colombia in the context of the peace agreement between the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the Government, as well as on the case of homophobic harassment that drove Sergio Urrego to suicide. On the one hand, gender ideology (R) is reviewed and an attempt is made to trace the registered trademark of that term, which is naturalized but which has a particular invention and purpose, reason why it was decided to include the registered trademark symbol: (R). Another goal is to understand how gender ideology (R) operates and how it was used in the "no" campaign of the referendum for the peace agreement in Havana to unite different conservative sectors against the gender perspective of the agreements. At the same time, the case of the death of Sergio Urrego, which triggered the mass use of gender ideology (R), is examined. The concept of frameworks, developed by Judith Butler in Frameworks of War, is used to understand how in certain contexts, such as in Sergio Urrego's school, non-heterosexual lives do not count as lives and therefore are not worthy of protection.

AB Introduction. When determining some population's state of health, an understanding of the causes of mortality is essential.
   Objectives. Changes in mortality due to causes was established to determine their contribution to the life-expectancy by gender and region of the Colombian population aged 15 to 74, between 1985 and 1999, by gender and region.
   Materials and methods. This was a descriptive, retrospective study; the sources of information were records of deaths from 1983 to 2001 and population projections according to Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadistica. The age selected as a sample population was 15 to 74. Changes in mortality were measured by using Eduardo Arriaga's methodology, which is based on calculating temporary life-expectancy, absolute and relative change indices, and how changes in mortality due to cause of death contribute to life-expectancy.
   Results. The main cause of reduced temporary life-expectancy in both genders was the increase in deaths by suicide, homicide and other violent causes (the reduction was greater for men than women in all regions studied). The greatest positive contribution to longevity was by the reduction in circulatory system diseases and accidents.
   Conclusions. A minimal gain in temporary life-expectancy was achieved as the positive affect of reduced mortality due to natural causes. This gain was annulled by the negative contributions of increased mortality due to suicide, homicide and other violent avoidable acts.

AB Background Pesticide self-poisoning accounts for 14-20% of suicides worldwide. Regulation aimed at restricting access to pesticides or banning highly hazardous pesticides is one approach to reducing these deaths. We systematically reviewed the evidence of the effectiveness of pesticide regulation in reducing the incidence of pesticide suicides and overall suicides.
   Methods We did a systematic review of the international evidence. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase for studies published between Jan 1, 1960, and Dec 31, 2016, which investigated the effect of national or regional bans, and sales or import restrictions, on the availability of one or more pesticides and the incidence of suicide in different countries. We excluded other interventions aimed at limiting community access to pesticides. We extracted data from studies presenting pesticide suicide data and overall suicide data from before and after national sales restrictions. Two reviewers independently assessed papers for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We undertook a narrative synthesis of the data in each report, and where data were available for the years before and after a ban, we pooled data for the 3 years before and the 3 years after to obtain a crude estimate of the effect of the ban. This study is registered through PROSPERO, number CRD42017053329.
   Findings We identified 27 studies undertaken in 16 countries-five low-income or middle-income countries (Bangladesh, Colombia, India, Jordan and Sri Lanka), and 11 high-income countries (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, UK, and USA). Assessments largely focused on national bans of specific pesticides (12 studies of bans in six countries-Jordan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Greece [ Crete], South Korea, and Taiwan) or sales restrictions (eight studies of restrictions in five countries-India, Denmark, Ireland, the UK and the USA). Only five studies used optimum analytical methods. National bans on commonly ingested pesticides in five of the six countries studied, including four studies using optimum analytical methods, were followed by reductions in pesticide suicides and, in three of these countries, falls in overall suicide mortality. Greece was the only country studied that did not show a decrease in pesticide suicide following a ban. There were no high-quality studies of restricting sales to people for occupational uses; four of the seven studies (in three of the five countries studied-India, Denmark, and the USA) showed sales restrictions were followed by decreases in pesticide suicides; one of the two studies investigating trends in overall suicide mortality reported a fall in deaths in Denmark, but there were also decreases in suicide deaths from other methods.
   Interpretation National bans on highly hazardous pesticides, which are commonly ingested in acts of self-poisoning, seem to be effective in reducing pesticide-specific and overall suicide rates.

TI Association between economic growth and injury mortality among seniors

AB Background Injuries among seniors are recognised as an important public health problem not only in developed countries but also in middle-income countries. There is ample epidemiological literature that relates economic growth to the reduction of infectious and childhood diseases. Less evidence exists to document if economic growth alone is enough to reverse the increasing trends of injury mortality and morbidity among seniors in a middle-income country.
   Aim To investigate the association between economic growth and injury deaths among older people in Colombia.
   Method Using data from Colombia, 1979-2006 (n=28), time-series models were used to ascertain if the variation over time in injury mortality among seniors is related to short-term oscillations in economic performance. Four empirical specifications usually used in the analysis of such data were implemented. Models were run by type of injury and gender.
   Results A negative but moderate effect of economic growth was found on injury deaths among older people. The reported elasticity was between -0.98 and -1.26. Men benefit from economic growth more than women. Economic growth seems to reduce traffic injuries, suicides and homicides. A positive association was also found between falls and growth in gross domestic product.
   Conclusions The results indicate a non-homogeneous association between economic growth and injury deaths among seniors in Colombia. This association is usually stronger in a negative direction among children and younger adults. Although more research is needed to understand the causal relationship between economic growth and injury, the association found may suggest that economic growth may not be sufficient to reverse injury deaths among older people; therefore, additional health policies need to be in place to reduce mortality due to preventable injuries in seniors.

ID IDEATION
AB Suicidal behavior, in its different manifestations, represents an international public health problem, being one of the ten main causes of general mortality and one of the three top main causes of death in adolescence and young adulthood.
   The statistics of suicidal attempts are also very worrying, even more if it is considered that for each case of suicide attempt attended in a health-care center, it is estimated that there are four non-reported and non-attended cases. Several studies report the importance of considering the role of some risk factors such as a family loss, a family history of suicidal behaviors, severe mental health problems in the family, economic problems, personality disorders, non-stable mood state, aggressiveness, impulsiveness and social alienation. When those problems ore combined with alcohol or drug abuse, the suicide risk is higher.
   The presence of suicidal behaviors in Latin-Americans high school and university students has been reported by different papers in which the suicidal ideation indicators range from 8% to 25% and the suicide attempts vary from 8% to 12%. In these papers the difference between women and men is highlighted, given that the first group has a higher propensity of suicidal attempts and men group is in full risk of comitted suicide. There are no statistics that confirm the differences between high school and university students. Some studies have confirmed the importance of stressful life events in the suicide phenomenon during adolescents, especially of interpersonal and emotional stressors. Few studies have inquired about the characteristics of suicidal behaviors in student population in Colombia. For this reason, health promotion and suicide prevention actions have not reached the expected effects. The purpose of this study is to know the prevalence and the characteristics of suicidal behavior in high school and college students in the city of Son Juan de Posto. A descriptive study was developed with 463 students belonging to six high schools and two universities, which ensures equal proportions regarding level (high school or university), gender and type of education (public or private). Their ages range from 9 to 30 years old. The Parasuicide Indicators Schedule (CIP- Cedula de Indicadores Parasuicidas) was applied; it was part of a battery of tests of the "Adaptation and validation of psychological instruments in students of Son Juan de Posto,, project, which was approved by the ethical committee of the University of Narino. The stressful life events questionnaire for adolescents (Cuestionario de Eventos Estresantes Vitales para Adolescentes -EEVA-Udenar) was applied to a randomly selected sub-sample.
   The prevalence of suicidal behavior was of 30%, 18% of the sample analyzed had suicidal thoughts, 4% had suicidal plans and 8% reported previous suicide attempts. The suicidal behavior was more frequent in women than in men and it is unsettling that the proportion of suicide attempts between women and men is 3:1. Suicide behaviors were more frequent in students whose ages ranged from 17 to 20 years old. Suicide attempts are more common in students with ages between 25 and 30 years old and from 13 to 20 years old. Moreover, the suicidal ideation was highly reported in students with ages ranging from 17 to 24 years old. In addition the highest prevalence of suicidal behavior took place during university years, but 9(th) graders are the group with the highest risk of suicide attempts. However, suicidal behavior is reported to be more common in university students than in high school students. This tendency was equal as for ideations and plans, but the proportions were the some for suicide attempts. The students of public institutions reported a higher presence of suicidal behaviors, specifically in ideations and plans, but the situation is the opposite for suicide attempts.
   Using the ANOVA procedure, it was found that the presence of stressful life events was different for each kind of suicidal behavior. In this way, the highest frequencies were found in suicide attempters, followed by the "ideators" and the "planers". Finally, the lowest frequencies were found in the non-suicidal students. However, these differences were not found in the intensity of stressful life events. The main events related to suicide attempts were: sexual violence, physical family abuse, living far away from one's family and suicidal behaviors in a member of the family. On the other hand, the events mainly related to suicide ideation were: parents divorce, terminal illness, losing a job and suicidal behaviors in a member of the family. Most of the attempters have presented a self-harming behavior at least once, but the main average was 2.25 times during their life. The first attempt was carried out at an age ranging from 7 to 22 years, the average was 14 years old, but the type is in the rank between 13 and 15 years old (47%). Near 40% of attempters had a real intention of ending their lives and 42% of them were not worried about living or dying. The purpose of the suicidal behavior was mainly dying, ending their problems, getting attention and ending suffering.
   The most highly reported self injury method was cutting themselves with sharp objects, followed by the ingestion of pills. Sixty six percent of the suicide attempts were not reported to somebody and only 22% of the cases were taken to some health center; in other words, only one of five suicide attempts could be registered in government statistics. When these persons carried out a suicide attempt, they doubted about the effectiveness of the method and only one third expected death to be a sure event. More than half of the suicide attempters did not ask for help. However when they did, women turned to friends and spiritual counselors, while men looked for the family and friend support.
   The high rate of suicidal behaviors in high school and college students in the city of Son Juan de Pasto was evidenced. The prevalence of suicidal ideation was higher than the prevalence found in other studies, and the suicide attempts were fewer. The age in which people turned into a full risk group ranged from 17 to 24 years old, although the suicidal behaviors first showed up around 11 years old, which is the tendency showed in other countries. It was identified that stressful life events associated with suicidal ideation had the characteristic of threat, and those related with suicide attempt had the characteristic of harm or loss, proposed by Folkman and Lazarus. The crucial role of some stressful life events in the origin of the suicidal behavior was demonstrated. Specifically, being a victim of sexual abuse is a key event for the beginning of the suicidal process. The presence of repeated suicide attempts is a risk factor to commit suicide, because the predictor value of that event has been demonstrated. Moreover, the presence of suicide ideation makes more probable the presence of a more hazardous behavior in the future. When the students look for ending their problems or stop being a problem for other people, at the moment of the suicide attempt, the serious conflict that the adolescents live in this age is shown. Since the suicide attempt is a very private event, the under-report of the suicide attempts is a matter of concern. That suggests why the governmental statistics are actually so high. This situation demands early preventive actions to identify cases in high risk of suicidal behavior. A new issue studied in this work is the difference between public and private institutions, students belonging to the former have a higher propensity to suicidal ideations while the latter have more risk to attempt suicide.
   The overview offered by this paper urges coordinated actions to identify and intervene in high risk cases to prevent suicide behavior and to promote life.

AB Objective: To analyse the trend in inequalities in mortality due to external causes among municipalities in Antioquia, department of Colombia, from 2000 to 2010, and its association with socioeconomic conditions. External causes included violent deaths, such as homicides, suicides and traffic accidents, among others.
   Methods: Ecological design of mortality trends, with the 125 municipalities of Antioquia as the unit of analysis. The age-adjusted smoothed standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was estimated for each of the municipalities by using an empirical Bayesian model. Differences in the SMR between the poorest and least poor municipalities were estimated by using a two-level hierarchical model (level-1: year, level-2: municipality).
   Results: Mortality due to external causes showed a downward trend in the department in the period under review, although the situation was not similar in all municipalities. The findings showed that the risk of death from external causes significantly increased in poor and underdeveloped municipalities.
   Conclusions: Intervention is required through policies that take into account local differences in mortality due to external causes. (C) 2016 SESPAS. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

AB In Colombia, an increase of suicidal behavior in adolescents caused by personal and environmental factors is evidenced. This quantitative, descriptive, correlational research aimed to establish the existing relationship between social cognition, perception of the quality of relationships and emotional regulation with the variables of psychosocial risk, suicide risk and level of psychological well-being in adolescents in contexts of high socioeconomic vulnerability of Bogota. A total of 155 adolescents were selected through non-probabilistic sampling at convenience, with ages between 13 and 17 years (M = 14.47 and DE = 1.03). The results allowed observing the existence of significant relationships between the study variables. From a linear regression analysis, the emotional bond and emotional self-regulation had a higher level of explanation about the perception of well-being and the psychosocial risk associated with suicide. Finally, the results and implications of a greater participation of the emotional bond in comparison to that of social cognition in adolescence are discussed, in order to formulate programs that promote well-being and prevent risk.

AB The article analyses the quality and consistency of a comprehensive interview guide, adapted to study attempted suicide and its ideation among the elderly, and imparts the method followed in applying this tool. The objective is to show how the use of a semi-structured interview and the organization and data analysis set-up were tested and perfected by a network of researchers from twelve universities or research centers in Brazil, Uruguay and Colombia. The method involved application and evaluation of the tool and joint production of an instruction manual on data collection, systematization and analysis. The methodology was followed in 67 interviews with elderly people of 60 or older and in 34 interviews with health professionals in thirteen Brazilian municipalities and in Montevideo and Bogota, allowing the consistency of the tool and the applicability of the method to be checked, during the process and at the end. The enhanced guide and the instructions for reproducing it are presented herein. The results indicate the suitability and credibility of this methodological approach, tested and certified in interdisciplinary and interinstitutional terms.

AB Background: Euthanasia requests have increased as the number of debilitated patients rises in both developed and developing countries such as India due to medical, psychosocial-emotional, socioenvironmental, and existential issues amid fears of potential misuse. World's position: Albania, Colombia, the Netherlands, and Switzerland permit euthanasia conditionally. Australia's legalization of euthanasia has been withdrawn. The United States permits withdrawal of life support. Mexico and Norway permit active euthanasia. India's position: Following the Aruna Shanbaug case the Supreme Court granted legal sanction to passive, but not active, euthanasia that is valid till the Parliament legislates on euthanasia.

AB Characterizing the behavior of mortality by external causes in the City of Medellin, Colombia, between 1999-2006, according to gender, age and basic cause of death was the objective of this longitudinal descriptive study, with secondary information source from 22128 registrations of external-cause casualties. The performed analysis is uni-varied and bi-varied by gender, age groups and causes of death. The external causes registered in the period were: 72.9 percent homicide; 15.3 percent, transportation accident; 7.3 percent, traumatisms; 4.2 percent, suicide; and 0.4 percent, other causes. The highest mortality rate was found in the 20-24 years of age group (27.6 per thousand inhabitants), a fact that deserves especial attention because of the social, familial and labor implications a casualty has in productive stages.

AB Exposure to vulnerable and violent events, such as forced displacement, generate several adverse effects on the mental health of victim population. The objective of this study is to describe the current mental health condition and some associated sociodemographic and environmental factors in 471 adolescents and young people between 13 and 28 years of age, who have been victims of forced displacement in three Colombian cities. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) interview, CAPI (Computer Assisted Personal Interview) version was administered; an ad hoc questionnaire on aspects of forced displacement and the consumption of psychoactive substances; the APGAR family function scale and the MOS (Medical Outcomes Study) scale of social support. It was found a prevalence of any mental disorder in the last years of 24.4% and any substance use disorder of 4.7%. The most prevalent disorders were specific phobia (6.8%), post-traumatic stress disorder (5.7%) and major depressive disorder (5.1%). Dependence on marijuana was found at 2.1% and alcohol abuse at 1.9%. 14.6% of adolescents and young victims of forced displacement have considered committing suicide at some point along their lives. Being a minor- age man, with a functional family and adequate social support, were protective factors from mental disorders.

AB IMPORTANCE Understanding global variation in firearm mortality rates could guide prevention policies and interventions.
   OBJECTIVE To estimate mortality due to firearm injury deaths from 1990 to 2016 in 195 countries and territories.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study used deidentified aggregated data including 13 812 location-years of vital registration data to generate estimates of levels and rates of death by age-sex-year-location. The proportion of suicides in which a firearm was the lethal means was combined with an estimate of per capita gun ownership in a revised proxy measure used to evaluate the relationship between availability or access to firearms and firearm injury deaths.
   EXPOSURES Firearm ownership and access.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cause-specific deaths by age, sex, location, and year.
   RESULTS Worldwide, it was estimated that 251 000 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 195 000-276 000) people died from firearm injuries in 2016, with 6 countries (Brazil, United States, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, and Guatemala) accounting for 50.5%(95% UI, 42.2%-54.8%) of those deaths. In 1990, there were an estimated 209 000 (95% UI, 172 000 to 235 000) deaths from firearm injuries. Globally, the majority of firearm injury deaths in 2016 were homicides (64.0%[95% UI, 54.2%-68.0%]; absolute value, 161 000 deaths [95% UI, 107 000-182 000]); additionally, 27% were firearm suicide deaths (67 500 [95% UI, 55 400-84 100]) and 9% were unintentional firearm deaths (23 000 [95% UI, 18 200-24 800]). From 1990 to 2016, there was no significant decrease in the estimated global age-standardized firearm homicide rate (-0.2%[95% UI, -0.8% to 0.2%]). Firearm suicide rates decreased globally at an annualized rate of 1.6%(95% UI, 1.1-2.0), but in 124 of 195 countries and territories included in this study, these levels were either constant or significant increases were estimated. There was an annualized decrease of 0.9% (95% UI, 0.5%-1.3%) in the global rate of age-standardized firearm deaths from 1990 to 2016. Aggregate firearm injury deaths in 2016 were highest among persons aged 20 to 24 years (for men, an estimated 34 700 deaths [95% UI, 24 900-39 700] and for women, an estimated 3580 deaths [95% UI, 2810-4210]). Estimates of the number of firearms by country were associated with higher rates of firearm suicide (P<.001; R-2 = 0.21) and homicide (P<.001; R-2 = 0.35).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study estimated between 195 000 and 276 000 firearm injury deaths globally in 2016, the majority of which were firearm homicides. Despite an overall decrease in rates of firearm injury death since 1990, there was variation among countries and across demographic subgroups.

AB Methods Ecologic study conducted during 2004-08 using a time-series design. Policies were implemented with variations in hours of restriction of sales and consumption of alcohol. Most restrictive policies prohibited alcohol between 2 a.m. and 10 a.m. for 446 non-consecutive days. Moderately restrictive policies prohibited alcohol between 3 a.m. and 10 a.m. for 1277 non-consecutive days. Lax policies prohibited alcohol between 4 a.m. and 10 a.m. for 104 non-consecutive days. In conditional autoregressive negative binomial regressions, rates of homicides and unintentional injury deaths (excluding traffic events) were compared between different periods of days when different policies were in effect.
   Results There was an increased risk of homicides in periods when the moderately restrictive policies were in effect compared with periods when the most restrictive policies were in effect [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.15, 90% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.26, P = 0.012], and there was an even higher risk of homicides in periods when the lax policies were in effect compared with periods when the most restrictive policies were in effect (IRR 1.42, 90% CI 1.26-1.61, P < 0.001). Less restrictive policies were not associated with increased risk of unintentional injury deaths.
   Conclusion Extended hours of sales and consumption of alcohol were associated with increased risk of homicides. Strong restrictions on alcohol availability could reduce the incidence of interpersonal violence events in communities where homicides are high.

AB Introduction: The 5-HTT short allele has been controversially associated with an increased risk of major depressive disorder.
   Objective: To determine the association of 5-HTT short allele with major depression in Bogota, Colombia.
   Materials and methods: We carried out a study of cases (n=68) matched 1: 1 with controls by gender and age (+/- 5 years). Major depression was diagnosed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, and 5-HTT polymorphism using PCR.
   Results: Females were predominant (82.4%). The S (short) allele predominated in cases compared with controls (S: 72.1% vs. 63.2; L (long): 27.9% vs. 36.8%), and the SL genotype was more frequent in cases (SL: 45.6% vs. 36.8%; LL: 27.9% vs. 36.8%; SS: 26.5% vs. 26.5%), although not significantly. There were significant differences in those under age 37, with a predominance of the S allele in cases (p=0.038; OR=2.75; 95% CI: 0.88-8.64). Multivariate analysis, adjusted for comorbid anxiety disorders, showed a significant association of major depression with the SL genotype (p=0.049; OR=3.20; 95% CI: 1.00-10.23); the S allele was close to statistical significance (p=0.063; OR=2.94; 95% CI: 0.94-9.13), and it was statistically significant in cases under 37 years of age (p=0.026; OR=10.79; 95% CI: 1.32-80.36).
   Conclusions: The SL genotype was associated with major depressive disorder in patients of all ages. The S allele was significantly associated with major depressive disorder in patients under age 37, adjusted for comorbid anxiety disorders.

AB Traumatic brain injury (TBI) caused by a firearm projectile (FAP) is a severe condition produced by mechanical alterations on the encephalon. In Colombia, one in every five killings is produced at cranial level. Objective: to do a literature review to identify the medical-legal and clinic-surgical issues of TBI by FAP. Methodology: a review conducted by means of medical literature databases searching and data gathering published by governmental entities. Results: TBI by FAP is an event epidemiologically constant; and its standards are related to the presence of the armed conflicts. It is associated with clinical manifestations and severe medical complications connected with diverse variables such as type of weapons and ammunition, sex of the victims, main region of the lesion and death mechanism. If the surgical operation is not performed, the mortality in this event is very high, but if the surgery is carried out, the lesions determine the decrease of life expectancy and quality. Conclusion: the current Colombian armed conflict makes TBI by FAP a topic of criminological, criminalistics and medical-legal relevance.

AB Aims:To study the risk of pathological gambling and its possible relation with mental disorders and school and family problems in a population of school pupils from the city of Medellin (Colombia), with a view to providing guidance for mental health care.
   Method: Cross-sectional study; sample comprises 3486 students aged 10 to 19 years selected from all the educational institutions in the city. The sample is probabilistic and represents an estimated population of 290,000 young people from Medellin. The SOGS instrument (South Oaks Gambling Screening) was used for screening risk and likelihood of problem gambling. The analytic stage assessed possible associated factors such as mental disorders, alcohol use and drug use, with statistical significance levels of 5% and prevalence rates with 95% confidence intervals.
   Results: A total of 48.6% were without problems, 37.6% were at risk and 13.8% were possible pathological gamblers. Males were more at risk than females (2.5:1), and the highest proportion of possible pathological gamblers was in the 10-14 age group (58.7%), vs. the 15-19 group (41.3%). Pathological gambling in young people is associated in this study with: anxiety OR=2.1(1.69-2.60), depression OR=1.73(1.33-2.24), suicide attempt OR=1.85(1.20-2.85), impulsivity OR=3.48(2.85-4.26), violent behavior OR=4.64(3.57-5.58), and problems at school OR=2.46(1.97-3.06); recent use of cigarettes, drunkenness and illegal drugs (use/addiction) were identified as associated risk factors, p value: <0.05
   Conclusions: Pathological gambling risk is high in this young population, and is associated with mental disorders, use of psychoactive substances, and school and family problems. This situation suggests the need for large-scale and comprehensive preventive and therapeutic intervention measures for addressing the problem.

AB Background: The Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) is a self-report instrument for the quantification of hopelessness in nonpsychiatric, as well as psychiatric patients. Hopelessness is a key psychological variable in suicide prediction. Until now the psychometric properties of the instrument have not been studied in a representative sample of the general population.
   Aims: The objectives of the study were to generate normative data and to further investigate the construct validity and factorial structure of the BHS.
   Methods: A nationally representative face-to-face household survey was conducted in Colombia in 2012 (N = 1500).
   Results: Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the BHS was 0.81. Confirmatory factor analysis supported a three-factor model, achieving good fit indices (total sample: RMSEA = 0.043, CFI = 0.936, TLI = 0.921). Normative data for the BHS were generated for both genders and different age levels. Intercorrelations with hopelessness were highest for depression (r = 0.57), followed by anxiety (r = 0.52).
   Conclusions: The normative data provide a framework for the interpretation and comparisons of the BHS with other populations. Evidence supports reliability and validity of the three-factor BHS as a measure of hopelessness in the general population.

AB Background: Requests for physician-assisted death (PAD) in patients with cognitive impairment are complex and require careful consideration. Of particular difficulty is determination of whether the request is voluntary and well considered. Results: Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) are both legal in The Netherlands, Luxemburg, Colombia, and Canada. Euthanasia is legal in Belgium, while PAS is legal in Switzerland and Oregon, Washington, Montana, Vermont, and California (USA). Upon a PAD request, evaluation of the capacity to consent medical treatment is relevant for the decision-making process, while evaluation of testamentary capacity is appropriate before an advance euthanasia directive is written. Anosognosia assessment throughout the Alzheimer's disease continuum provides essential and relevant information regarding the voluntary and well-considered nature of the PAD request; meanwhile, early assessment of hypernosognosia or subjective cognitive decline assists in formulation of a clinical prognosis. Furthermore, the assessment of physical and psychological suffering should incorporate verbal and nonverbal cues as well as consideration of the psychosocial factors that might affect due care criteria. Conclusion: The clinical approach to a PAD request should consider the legal framework and the decision-making capacity, assess memory deficit awareness and the perception of suffering, and evaluate mental competency when considered pertinent.

AB Background: Interpersonal violence and suicide are among the main causes of mortality and morbidity around the world. In several developing countries, such as Colombia, they are among the first five entities of public health concern. Aggressiveness is an important endophenotype for aggression and suicidal behavior, having a heritability of around 50%. Exploration of classical candidate genes, involved in serotoninergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission, has identified few consistent risk factors for aggressiveness. miRNAs are a novel class of molecules with a growing role in normal neural function and neuropsychiatric disorders; of special interest, miR-124 is a brain-specific miRNA that is key for neuronal plasticity. We evaluated the hypothesis that a functional polymorphism in MIR124-1 gene might be associated with aggressiveness in a Colombian sample.
   Methods: The Spanish adaptation of the refined version of the Aggression Questionnaire and the abbreviated Barratt Impulsiveness Scale were applied to 170 young subjects. The functional SNP in MIR124-1 (rs531564) was genotyped by a TaqMan assay.
   Results: We found a significant association between the MIR124-1 and aggressiveness in our sample, with G/G carriers having lower scores (P = 0.01). This association seemed to be specific for aggressiveness, as it was not significant for impulsiveness.
   Conclusions: We showed for the first time the association of a functional polymorphism in MIR124-1 and aggressiveness. Known targets of miR-124 (such as BDNF and DRD4 genes) could explain the effect of this miRNA on behavior. A future analysis of additional novel functional polymorphisms in other brain expressed miRNAs could be useful for a deeper understanding of aggression in humans. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Objective: This multicenter study estimated the prevalence of bipolar disorder (BPD) among emergency department (ED) patients in Latin America. Methods: To identify patients with BPD, a combination of DSM IV-criteria interview and the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) was used. Data from 1,505 patients from hospitals in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico was analyzed. Results: The prevalence of BPD in this sample was 5.2% (95% CI = 4.5% to 6.9%). Themean age was 37 years (response rate of 83.0%). Compared to non-BPD patients, BPD patients were more likely to report asthma (16.7% vs. 9%), thyroid problems (12.8% vs. 5.8%), seizures (23.1% vs. 3.0%), obesity (39.7% vs. 26.9%), alcohol abuse (30.8% vs. 10.0%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (50.0% vs. 12.0%), depression (81.6% vs. 45.7%), obsessive compulsive disorder (20.1% vs. 3.0%), panic disorders (23.1% vs. 12.3%), phobic disorders (11.2% vs. 3.1%), and any anxiety disorder (82.1% vs. 41.8%; all p <= 0.05). Suicidal plans and attempts were also significant higher in the bipolar group (11.5% vs. 2.8% and 10.3% vs. 1.8% respectively). Multivariate analysis identified ADHD, depression, alcohol abuse, anxiety disorder, and last month suicide plans and attempts to be independently associated with BPD. Conclusion: Our study supports that BPD is prevalent in ED in Latin-American countries and that comorbidity is the rule, not the exception. Patients presenting at ED with irritability, anxiety, pressure speech, euphoria, with suicidal tendencies, involved in risky behaviors, alcohol abuse, dependence or those with history of mental health hospitalization in the past 12 months must be assessed for comorbid BPD.
