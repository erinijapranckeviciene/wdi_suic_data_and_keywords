DT Article
DE Driver suicides; Finland
AB Objectives. This Study focused oil driver suicides in Finland. The first aim Was to find Out What the prevalence of these suicides Was during the years 1974-2006. The second aim was to find Out whether there were differences between northern and southern Finland in regards to the number of cases and the backgrounds of the drivers Who committed Suicide this way.
   Study design. All case reports of fatal motor vehicle accidents from the years 2005-2006 were investigated (n=528). Results were compared to the years previously investigated: 1974-1975, 1984-1985, 1987-1988, 1991-1992, 1993-1994 and 1997-1998 (n=3482).
   Methods. As driver suicides Were Classified, only those crashes ill which the driver's intention had notably influenced the progress of the crash and the driver's background information clearly Supported suicide. Driver suicides in northern and southern Finland were compared. Driver Suicides were related to both the number of fatal motor vehicle accidents and the number of inhabitants.
   Results. Driver Suicides increased during the period under study. However, both the number and the proportion of driver suicides have been quite constant since the beginning of the 1990s, averaging 20 per year, which is 8% of all fatal motor vehicle accidents in Finland. There were no differences in northern and Southern Finland regarding driver suicides.
   Conclusions. Driver Suicides represent a small proportion (2%) of all suicides committed ill Finland every year. However, the proportion of driver suicides of all fatal motor vehicle accidents is greater, around 8%-9%. As a majority of driver Suicides are collisions, the), affect an even larger group of people. Possible preventive Measures are discussed. (Int J Circumpolar Health 2009: 68(3):249-260)

AB There are more firearms in Northern Finland as compared to Southern Finland, and a positive association between suicide rates and the number of firearms in a given region has been demonstrated in previous literature. Accordingly, the authors compared firearm suicide rates of Finnish adolescent (under 18 years) males in the two geographic regions. Young adult (18-24 years) and adult (25-44 years) males were used as reference groups. National data on cases of suicide in Northern and Southern Finland between 1972 and 2009 were obtained from Statistics Finland. Firearm suicides (n = 5,423) were extracted according to ICD-classification (ICD-8/9: E955, ICD-10: X72-X75). The distribution of types of firearms (hunting gun, handgun, other) employed in suicides was also investigated. The adolescent male firearm suicide rate in Northern Finland was almost three times higher than that observed in Southern Finland, while there was no difference in rates of suicide by other methods. A northern excess in firearm suicide rates was also found among young adult and adult males. Hunting guns were the most common type of firearms employed in young male suicides, and their use was especially common in Northern Finland. Our results indicate that the use of firearms plays a major role in explaining the northern excess in young Finnish male suicide rates, and emphasize a need to advance suicide prevention according to specific regional characteristics.

AB Aims: To investigate urban-rural differences in male suicide mortality between 1988 and 1997 in the province of Kuopio in eastern Finland. Methods: Male suicide mortality between 1988 and 1997 was studied in eastern Finland. The data were collected from official autopsy reports. Age, marital status. household type, place of death, method Of Suicide and the region within the county were analysed. Results: The age-adjusted male suicide mortality remained quite constant at 67 and 65/100,000 (> 15 years of age) in 1988 and 1997, respectively. In urban areas, a decline in suicide rates was noted in all age groups of men, whereas in rural areas. after an initial decline, a marked increase took place during the last years of the study period., especially among middle-aged and elderly men. This coincided with the time of recovery from an economic recession in Finland that particularly affected rural areas. Conclusion: Male suicide mortality may be regionally diverging in Finland.

AB Sex differences in suicide rates and suicide methods was compared among adolescents in South Korea, Japan, Finland, and the United States. This study analyzed suicide rates and suicide methods of adolescents aged 15-19 years in four countries, using the World Health Organization mortality database. Among both male and female adolescents, the most common method of suicide was jumping from heights in South Korea and hanging in Japan. In Finland, jumping in front of moving objects and firearms were frequently used by males, but not by females. In the United States, males were more likely to use firearms, and females were more likely to use poison. The male to female ratio of suicide rates was higher in the United States (3.8) and Finland (3.6) than in Korea (1.3) and Japan (1.9). Sex differences in suicide methods may contribute to differences in the suicide rates among males and female adolescents in different countries.

AB We explore the effects of unemployment on the well-being of the regional population with disaggregated suicide data across gender and age in Finland during 1991-2011. On the basis of the economic theory of rational suicides we show that rising unemployment expectations have a negative effect on well-being by increasing regional suicide mortality. We find that a possible future job loss has a significant effect on the prime working-age male (35-64 years old) suicides. We also provide strong evidence of the social norms on unemployment in Finland. We find, especially, that working-age males suffer more heavily from unemployment if they live in the area where the regional unemployment is low relative to the national average.

AB By the beginning of the twenty-first century, suicide is often discussed in relation to the concept of risk. According to psychiatric understanding of suicide, the risk of suicide is increased under certain circumstances and in connection to mental disorders. Thinking of suicide in terms of risk factors has a historical background in the rise of psychiatric epidemiology during decades after the Second World War. In the case of Finland, the emergence of psychiatric epidemiology of suicide in the 1960s and 1970s also coincides with the building of a welfare state through active use of social planning. In this article, the author examines how social engineering thinking, criticism of biologically oriented psychiatry, and psychiatric epidemiology changed the way how suicide was perceived in the discourse of psychiatry.

AB Background and aim: The Nordic countries provide a suitable setting for comparing trends in suicide mortality. The aim of this report is to compare suicide trends by age, gender, region and methods in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden 1980-2009. Methods: Suicide statistics 1980-2009 were analyzed for men and women aged 15 years and above and the age group 15-24 years. Regional suicide rates in 2009 were presented in maps. Results: The suicide rates across the Nordic countries declined from 25-50 per 100,000 in 1980 to 20-36 in 2009 for men and from 9-26 in 1980 to 8-11 in 2009 for women. The rates in Finland were consistently higher than those of the other countries. A significant increase of suicides in young women in Finland and Norway and a lack of a decline among young women in Sweden were noted. The male-female ratio of suicide converged to approximately 3:1 across the region during the study period. Rural areas in Finland, Norway and Sweden saw the highest suicide rates, whereas the rates in the capital regions of Denmark, Norway and Sweden were lower than the respective national rates. Conclusions: We hold that the overall decline of suicide rates in the Nordic countries reflects the socio-economic development and stability of the region, including the well-functioning healthcare. The increasing rates in Finland and Norway and the unchanged rate in Sweden of suicide in young women are an alarming trend break that calls for continued monitoring.

AB The first aim of the study was to investigate the changes in regional suicide rates for the province of Kuopio, Eastern Finland, from 1988 to 1997 and compare rates with those for the whole Finland. The second aim was to investigate gender-related changes in suicide rates and methods during the study period. Altogether, 777 suicides were examined. Between 1988 and 1997, regional male suicide mortality decreased, approaching the mean national level, which was rising during the same interval. From 1992 to 1997, there was a rise in regional suicide mortality, which coincided with a decrease at the national level. Female suicide rates in Eastern Finland also initially decreased, but thereafter remained variable and slightly higher than the national level. Gender-related differences in suicide mortality diminished. The initial difference between genders in mean age (49.5 years in women, 41.8 years in men) disappeared towards the end of the study period (47.0 years in women, 45.2 years in men). The decline in mean ages of women was mostly due to change in urban suicides, whereas the increase in the mean age of men was caused by change in rural suicides. Among men, the relative proportion of self-poisoning suicides rose significantly. The divergent development of suicide rates from the province of Kuopio and the entire nation may reflect differences in the development of social structures in rural Eastern Finland compared to more densely populated parts of the country. Gender differences and local variation in suicide mortality should be taken into account when assessing and developing further suicide prevention strategies.

ID TRENDS; PREVENTION; DEATHS; STATES
AB Background: The lethality of the suicide method employed is a strong risk factor for the completion of suicide. We examined whether annual changes in the pattern of suicide methods is related to annual changes in suicide rates in South Korea, the United States (US), and Finland.
   Methods: We analyzed annual data from 2000-2011 for South Korea and Finland, and 2000-2010 for the US in order to examine trends in the rates and methods of suicide. Data on suicide methods were obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO) mortality database.
   Results: Along with an annual rapid increase in suicide rates, the incidence of hanging increased steadily while suicide by self-poisoning steadily decreased in South Korea. In the US, along with an annual increase in suicide rates, the proportion of suicides committed by hanging increased while those committed with the use of firearms steadily decreased. In Finland, annual changes in the suicide rate and suicide method were not statistically significant during the study period.
   Conclusions: Our present findings suggest that the increased use of specific lethal methods for suicide, namely hanging, is reflected in the increased suicide rates in the Korean and the US populations. The most effective approach for reducing overall suicide rates may be the implementation of population-based initiatives that reduce both the accessibility (e. g., access to firearms) and the social acceptability (e. g., effective and responsible regulations for reporting suicide) of lethal methods of suicide.

AB Background: There are only a few recent studies on secular trends in child and adolescent suicides. We examine here trends in rates and methods of suicide among young people in Finland, where suicide rates at these ages are among the highest in the world. Methods: The data, obtained from Statistics Finland, consisted of all suicides (n = 901) committed by persons under 18 years of age over the period 1969-2008. Gender-specific trends were analysed separately for the years 1969-1989 and 1990-2008 using 3-year moving averages. Trends in methods of suicide were examined from 1975 to 2008 in five-year periods. Results: The male-to-female ratio in youth suicides was 3.6:1. The male rates increased in 1969-1989, while the rates among females were inconsistent. After 1990, the rates decreased for males but turned to an increase among females. Shooting was the most common suicide method among males throughout the period, while hanging exceeded poisoning as the most common method among females after 1990. All violent suicides decreased for males and increased for females in 1990-2008. Conclusions: The increase in violent, i.e., more lethal, suicide methods among young females is alarming, as females are known to have higher rates of attempted suicide than males. Alcohol consumption, rates and treatment of depression and violent behaviour among adolescents are discussed as approaches towards explaining this phenomenon.

ID HABIT
AB We investigate the determinants of suicide in Finland using annual data for consumption and suicides from 1860 to 2010. Instead of using some ad hoc measures of cyclical movements of the economy, we build our analysis on a more solid economic theory. A key feature is the habit persistence in preferences, which provides a way to measure individual well-being and predict suicide. We estimate time series of habit levels and develop an indicator (the hardship index) to describe the economic hardship of consumers. The higher the level of the index, the worse off consumers are. As a rational response to such a bad situation, some consumers might commit suicide. We employ the autoregressive distributed lags cointegration method and find that our index works well in explaining the long-term behavior of people committing suicide in Finland.

   POPULATION; DEPRESSION; DIAGNOSES; PEOPLE
AB Suicide mortality among the elderly is high in most Western countries. We investigated the characteristics of suicide victims 65 years or older in a nationwide psychological autopsy study, the research phase of the National Suicide Prevention Project in Finland. This study population included all completed suicides (N = 1,397 of whom 211 were 65 years or older) that occurred in Finland during a 12-month research period in 1987-1988. The elderly suicide victims were found to have used violent suicide methods more often than the young. Although almost 70% of the elderly persons who had committed suicide had been in contact with health care services during the month before their death, their suicidal intentions were rarely communicated in these contacts. They had been referred to psychiatric services less often than the young, and only 8% had received adequate antidepressive medication. The fact that most elderly suicides have contact with health care services during their final month suggests a potential for suicide prevention. However, the major obstacle to this is the poor recognition of mental disorders and suicidal ideation among the elderly.

AB Background: Suicide mortality in Finland particularly among young people remains high, compared with other European countries. Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among military conscripts in Finland. Aims: In this record-based study, we investigated characteristics of all 48 suicides among Finnish conscripts during the period 1991-2007. Methods: We collected and analyzed healthcare records during military service and medicolegal investigations (medicolegal autopsy) of suicide victims. Results: Of the 48 suicides, 36 (75%) were completed during leave days. Shooting, hanging and jumping were the most common methods used; a service gun was used in four (14%) of the 29 shooting cases. One-third of the victims had been in contact with military healthcare during the week preceding their suicide, and two-thirds during the preceding month. Conclusions: When conscripts use healthcare services, suicidal thoughts should be actively asked of those conscripts with history of any risk factors for suicidal behavior.

TI Low Morals at a High Latitude? Suicide in Nineteenth-century Scandinavia
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL HISTORY
LA English
DT Article
ID STATISTICS
AB This paper explores the usage of suicide statistics and the emergence of suicidology in nineteenth-century Scandinavia and Finland. Drawing upon texts from Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark-with a focus on Swedish language sources-it illustrates the significance that suicide statistics gained during this period, and pays attention to the question of how the Scandinavian discussion on suicide was linked to ideas from outside the geographic area. Taking the cross-references between the selected texts as a starting point, this short foray into early suicidology commences in Finland and works its way westwards.
   The discussed works provide a multi-faceted perspective on the issue of suicide statistics in nineteenth century Scandinavia. The paper confirms the influence of central European personalities and ideas on the discussion in the Nordic countries, but at the same time shows that Scandinavian scholars presented unique and novel works, and thus were actively participating and contributing to the emerging pan-European debate on suicide.

AB The authors examined all hanging-suicides during 1988-2013 (N=851) in the province of Oulu, northern Finland. Using death-certificate data and ICD-diagnoses from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register, we focused on gender differences in suicide, mental health, and somatic health. Male victims were more likely to have intoxication or problematic alcohol use; female victims were more likely to have somatic or mental hospitalization. Previous physical or mental hospitalization was related with absence of intoxication at the time of suicide. Suicide prevention should focus on acute alcohol abuse in the presence of acute stressors, suicidal thoughts and mental illness.

AB Background: Filicide is the tragic crime of murdering one's own child. Previous research has found that the offending parents are commonly depressed and that suicide is often associated as an actual act or an intention. Yet, filicide is an underreported crime and previous studies have been strained with methodological problems. No comprehensive international studies on filicide have been presented in the literature until now.
   Methods: This was a descriptive, comprehensive, register-based study of all filicides in Austria and Finland during 1995-2005. Filicide-suicide cases were also included.
   Results: Most of the perpetrators were the biological mothers; in Austria 72%, in Finland 52%. Suicide followed filicide either as an attempt or a fulfilled act in 32% and 54% of the cases in Austria and Finland, respectively. Psychotic mood disorders were diagnosed for 10% of the living perpetrators in Austria, and 12% in Finland. Non-psychotic depression was diagnosed in 9% of surviving perpetrators in Austria, 35% in Finland.
   Conclusion: The data from the two countries demonstrated that filicide is such a multifaceted and rare phenomenon that national data from individual countries seldom offer sufficient scope for its thorough study. Further analyses are needed to produce a complete picture of filicide.

AB The authors studied the prevalence of stroke among suicide victims and whether prestroke depression had influence on suicide process. The authors used a comprehensive database of all suicides (N = 2,283) committed in Northern Finland over a period of 15 years with information on all hospital-treated somatic and psychiatric disorders. Of the total suicide data population, 3.4% had suffered from stroke. After adjusting for age and sex, prestroke depression in stroke victims increased the hazard of suicide up to 2.2-fold compared to victims with stroke but without any lifetime depression. The high-risk period for suicide was 2 years after stroke. (The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences 2010; 22: 182-187)

AB Objective To examine longitudinally risk factors for suicide in depression, and gender differences in risk factors and suicide methods. Method We linked data from (i) The Finnish Hospital Discharge Register, (ii) the Census Register of Statistics Finland, and (iii) Statistics Finland's register on causes of deaths. All 56 826 first-hospitalized patients (25 188 men, 31 638 women) in Finland in 1991-2011 with a principal diagnosis of depressive disorder were followed up until death (2587 suicides) or end of the year 2014 (maximum 24 years). Results Clinical characteristics (severe depression adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.19 [95% CI 1.08-1.30]; psychotic depression AHR 1.45 [1.30-1.62]; and comorbid alcohol dependence AHR 1.26 [1.13-1.41]), male gender (AHR 2.07 [1.91-2.24]), higher socioeconomic status and living alone at first hospitalization were long-term predictors of suicide deaths. Highest risk was associated with previous suicide attempts (cumulative probability 15.4% [13.7-17.3%] in men, 8.5% [7.3-9.7%] in women). Gender differences in risk factors were modest, but in lethal methods prominent. Conclusion Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics at first hospitalization predict suicide in the long term. Inpatients with previous suicide attempts constitute a high-risk group. Despite some gender differences in risk factors, those in lethal methods may better explain gender disparity in risk.

AB National differences in the legislation on cause and manner of death investigation are reflected in a high autopsy rate in suicides in Finland and a low corresponding rate in Denmark. The consequences for mortality statistics of these different investigation practices on deaths classified as suicides in Denmark and Finland, respectively, are not known in detail.
   The aim of this article was to analyse autopsy rates in deaths classified as suicides, and to identify any differences in investigation practices in deaths with a comparable cause of death, but classified as unnatural deaths other than suicide.
   Data from the mortality registries were summarised for the years 2000, 2005 and 2010. Autopsy rates (total, forensic and medical) were analysed with regard to deaths classified as suicide, and they were compared for three age groups (1-50 years, 51-70 years and >= 71 years) and for causes of death. Deaths classified as suicide were compared with other unnatural classifications, and comparable causes of death were coded into six subgroups: poisonings, suffocations/strangulations, firearm discharges, drowning/submersions, explosions/flames and other/unspecified causes.
   The total autopsy rate for suicides was 99.8% in Finland and 13.2% in Denmark. Almost all of these autopsies were conducted as forensic autopsies. In the age group >= 71 years, Danish suicides outnumbered Finnish suicides (410 versus 283). The total autopsy rate was lower in the more senior age group in Denmark (19.5%, 9.9%, 5.6%), whereas it was consistently high in Finland (99.8%, 99.9%, 99.6%). Among Danish deaths due to poisonings, the autopsy rate was 89.5% when these were classified as accidents, but only 20.7% for cases classified as suicides. The number of deaths in the two Danish subgroups was comparable (550 versus 553).
   In Denmark, the decision regarding the need, if any, for a forensic autopsy is made during the external forensic examination of the body. Our study showed that the limited use of forensic autopsy to confirm the cause of death in deaths classified as suicides raises doubts about the accuracy of the Danish suicide mortality statistics. Our finding is emphasised by those cases in which the cause of death was registered as intentional self-poisoning. The high number of suicides among the elderly in Denmark is striking and begs further investigation and research. Overall, our data from Finland and Denmark reveal striking differences between the two countries and warrant further comparative studies on the subject in other countries.

AB Suicide mortality varies in both the short and long term. Our study examines suicide mortality in Finland and Sweden from the 1750s until today. The aim of our study is to detect any seasonal peaks in suicide rates and examine their temporal evolution to suggest a mechanism that may explain such peaks.
   We acquired the study material from the Finnish and Swedish cause of death statistics (257,341 deaths by suicide) and the relevant population gender structure data. We then separately calculated the annual male and female suicide rates per 100,000 inhabitants. We analysed the suicide peaks, calculating factors of proportionality for the available data by dividing the suicide rates in the peak months (May and October) by the annual suicide rates.
   Suicide rates in Finland and Sweden peak twice a year. Both men and women in both countries most often commit suicide in May. There is another peak in October, with the exception of Finnish men. These suicide peaks coincide with a temperature increase in May and the biggest annual drop in temperature in October. We also observed a monotonic long-term change in the Swedish statistics, but not in the Finnish data. Our hypothesis is that seasonal variation in suicide rates may be caused by abrupt temperature changes twice a year that trigger the activity in brown adipose tissue and deepen depression.
   While the overall suicide mortality rates varied considerably, the monthly proportions in May did not. This finding suggests a routine factor underlying the spring peak in suicide mortality.

AB Suicide peaks in late spring and October are still seen in Finland among many countries. Weather factors have been suggested as explanations for these peaks, although with inconsistent results. Since the exact timing of these peaks varies each year, the length of daylight and changes in it seem inadequate as an explanation. We hypothesized that ambient temperature and the timing of thermal seasons might associate with suicide rate.
   Suicide rates from three areas across Finland (N = 10,802) were analyzed with Poisson regression in six different models against variables calculated from the local ambient daily temperature, diurnal temperature range, and the duration from the onset of thermal seasons. Separate models for men and women were constructed.
   The temperature change over 5 days associated with the suicide rate of men in Helsinki region, or in other words, the lower the suicide rate was, the higher the temperature decrease had been. For women, the results were more inconsistent.
   Our study is in line with some earlier studies which imply that impairment of thermoregulation might exist among suicide victims.

AB Suicide rate among schizophrenia patients may vary for several reasons, one of the most important being the time point of the suicide during the illness process. However, prospective studies on suicide risk in population-based cohort of individuals with new-onset schizophrenia have been lacking.
   The data were collected for 10,934 individuals alive in Finland at the age of 16 from the genetically homogenous, population-based Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort ascertained already during mid-pregnancy. The Finnish Hospital Discharge Register was used until the end of 1997 (age 31) to identify cases with mental disorder. Case records were scrutinized and diagnoses were re-checked for DSM-III-R criteria. One hundred subjects met the DSM-III-R criteria for schizophrenia. Deaths by the end of year 2005 (age 39) were ascertained from death certificates.
   Suicides (n = 7) accounted for 50% of all the deaths at age from 16 to 39. Seven (7.0%) subjects with schizophrenia had committed suicide; suicide rate being 2.9% (1/35) for women and 9.2% (6/65) for men. Furthermore, 71% of suicides in schizophrenia occurred during the first 3 years after onset of illness.
   The suicide rate for patients with new-onset schizophrenia followed until the age of 39 was high and accounted for half of the deaths. Great majority of the suicides took place during the first years of the illness.

AB Psychiatric patients exhibit increased suicide risk shortly after hospitalization, but little is known about patients who are discharged after treatment for physical illness. Information on all suicides over a period of 13 years in northern Finland as well as information from hospital registers were used to examine the interval between the last hospitalization and the suicide. On the basis of discharge diagnoses of physical or psychiatric illnesses, three groups were distinguished. Among victims with psychiatric disorders, survival time was shorter than among those without such a history, even if the last admission was for a physical condition. Clinicians should note the putative suicide risk among somatic patients at discharge, especially among those with a psychiatric history.

AB Despite the large amount of research on adolescent suicidality, there are few detailed studies illustrating the characteristics of child and adolescent completed suicide. Our study presents the characteristics of child and adolescent suicides occurring over a period of 25 years within a large geographical area in Northern Finland, with a special focus on gender differences. The study sample included all 58 suicides among children and adolescents (<18 years) occurring in the province of Oulu in Finland between 1988 and 2012. The data is based on documents pertaining to establish the cause of death from forensic autopsy investigations. A register linkage to the data from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register (FHDR) was also made. 79% of the suicide victims were male. Violent suicide methods predominated in both genders (males 98%, females 83%). While symptoms of mental illness were common, only a minority (15% of males and 17% of females) had a previous history of psychiatric hospitalization. 17% of females but none of the males had been hospitalized previously due to self-poisoning. A greater proportion of females than males had a history of self-cutting (33% vs. 7%) and previous suicide attempts (25% vs. 4%). 48% of males and 58% of females were under the influence of alcohol at the time of their suicide, and alcohol intoxication was related to suicides during the night. One fifth of the adolescents screened positive for substances other than alcohol. The results of this study indicate that there are similarities but also some differences in the characteristics of male and female suicides in adolescents. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives. To determine the regional patterns and the temporal trends of suicides in Finnish Lapland.
   Study Design. Population-based ecological mortality study.
   Methods. Data oil suicides and Population aged 15 years and over during the period 19611 2005 were tabulated by sex. age and commune (local government districts). Age-adjusted mortality was calculated by 5-year periods and smoothed by loess regression.
   Results. Male suicide mortality in Lapland was 51 per 100,000 person-years. all excess of 17% (95% CI 12-23%) compared with the national mortality, The excess was highest in men aged 15-24 years (excess 54%; 95% CI 39-70%). and it increased over time. In females, suicide mortality was 13/100,000. a deficit of 10% (95% CI 1-19%) versus all Finland. Male Suicides were most common in north-central Lapland and in the cities Kemi and Kemijarvi. In females, the pattern was similar in kind but the numbers were small. The epidemic wave of suicides which Culminated in 1990 in all Finland showed differing trends by small areas in Lapland.
   Conclusions. Male suicides are excessively common in Lapland compared with the national level. and they concentrate oil a geographically contiguous area in the central north and in 2 towns. The findings encourage local Studies to investigate the underlying causal factors and interventions to reduce suicides. (Int J Circumpolar Health 2009; 68(3):224-234)

AB Background: Previous studies have suggested differences in seasonal variation of violent and non-violent suicides, but seasonal distribution of the specific methods of suicide is less clear. Method: We investigated the seasonal distribution of the specific suicide methods for both genders during a 16-year period. The seasonal effect was explored by monthly ratio statistics from the large population-based data including all suicides in Finland during years 1980-1995 (n = 20 234). Results: Hanging peaked in spring among both genders. In summer, the significant peaks were occurred in suicides by drowning, jumping and gassing among males. The. bimodality in female suicides with autumn peaks was explained by poisoning and drowning. Traffic suicides showed substantial winter-troughs for both genders. Conclusions: The results suggested that specific violent and nonviolent methods of suicides grouped into their traditional clusters on the basis of their seasonality, except suicides by gassing and shooting. The seasonal distribution in specific suicide methods should take into account in suicide prevention at clinical work and also it should be considered while determining which methods of suicides are regarded as violent or non-violent methods in research.

AB The influence of weather on mood and mental health is commonly debated. Furthermore, studies concerning weather and suicidal behavior have given inconsistent results. Our aim was to see if daily weather changes associate with the number of suicide attempts in Finland. All suicide attempts treated in the hospitals in Helsinki, Finland, during two separate periods, 8 years apart, were included. Altogether, 3,945 suicide attempts were compared with daily weather parameters and analyzed with a Poisson regression. We found that daily atmospheric pressure correlated statistically significantly with the number of suicide attempts, and for men the correlation was negative. Taking into account the seasonal normal value during the period 1971-2000, daily temperature, global solar radiation and precipitation did not associate with the number of suicide attempts on a statistically significant level in our study. We concluded that daily atmospheric pressure may have an impact on suicidal behavior, especially on suicide attempts of men by violent methods (P < 0.001), and may explain the clustering of suicide attempts. Men seem to be more vulnerable to attempt suicide under low atmospheric pressure and women under high atmospheric pressure. We show only statistical correlations, which leaves the exact mechanisms of interaction between weather and suicidal behavior open. However, suicidal behavior should be assessed from the point of view of weather in addition to psychiatric and social aspects.

AB Suicide is among the 10 leading causes of death. Attempted suicide is 10-40 times more frequent than completed suicide and is the strongest single predictor of subsequent suicide. The current study population included all persons in Finland who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of attempted suicide between 1996 and 2003 (N = 18,199). Information on background variables and mortality was obtained by register linkage. The risk of repeated attempted suicide was 30% and the risk of suicide was 10%. The risks of repeated attempted suicide, completed suicide, and death from any cause were high immediately after discharge from the hospital. Analysis of competing causes of death revealed that while alcohol-related disorder was not associated with suicide, it markedly increased the risk of other violent death: The subdistribution hazards rate (SHR) was 2.61 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.12, 3.21). Schizophrenia-related disorders (SHR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.57, 2.21) and mood disorders (SHR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.47, 2.01) were associated with the risk of suicide. The risks of suicide and all-cause mortality were extremely high immediately after hospitalization for attempted suicide.

AB Previous research has documented an association between birth order and suicide, although no study has examined whether it depends on the cultural context. Our aim was to study the association between birth order and cause-specific mortality in Finland, and whether it varies by ethno-linguistic affiliation. We used data from the Finnish population register, representing a 5% random sample of all Finnish speakers and a 20% random sample of Swedish speakers, who lived in Finland in any year 1987-2011. For each person, there was a link to all children who were alive in 1987. In total, there were 254,059 siblings in 96,387 sibling groups, and 9797 deaths. We used Cox regressions stratified by each siblings group and estimated all-cause and cause-specific mortality risks during the period 1987-2011. In line with previous research from Sweden, deaths from suicide were significantly associated with birth order. As compared to first-born, second-born had a suicide risk of 1.27, third-born of 1.35, and fourth- or higher-born of 1.72, while other causes of death did not display an evident and consistent birth-order pattern. Results for the Finnish-speaking siblings groups were almost identical to those based on both ethno-linguistic groups. In the Swedish-speaking siblings groups, there was no increase in the suicide risk by birth order, but a statistically not significant tendency towards an association with other external causes of death and deaths from cardiovascular diseases. Our findings provided evidence for an association between birth order and suicide among Finnish speakers in Finland, while no such association was found for Swedish speakers, suggesting that the birth order effect might depend on the cultural context.

AB Previous studies have shown a positive association between unemployment and attempted suicide. This study investigated transitions of employment status among suicide attempters during the severe economic recession. The main research question was whether inequality in the labour market also prevails among as selected a population as suicide attempters. The material consisted of 2495 persons who attempted suicide during 1989-1994 in Helsinki, Finland. Logistic regression analysis and survival analysis were used. Unemployment rates among suicide attempters were higher than in the general population, male rates being higher than female rates throughout the recession. There were significant changes in the employment status of the entire attempted suicide population from 1989 to 1994, especially in terms of the transition from employment to unemployment. Gender, age and education level predicted exit from the labour market. Among suicide attempters young middle-aged men with low education had the highest risk of unemployment.

AB Seasonal patterns of death from suicide are well-documented and have been attributed to climatic factors such as solar radiation and ambient temperature. However, studies on the impact of weather and climate on suicide are not consistent, and conflicting data have been reported. In this study, we performed a correlation analysis between nationwide suicide rates and weather variables in Finland during the period 1971-2003. The weather parameters studied were global solar radiation, temperature and precipitation, and a range of time spans from 1 month to 1 year were used in order to elucidate the dose-response relationship, if any, between weather variables and suicide. Single and multiple linear regression models show weak associations using 1-month and 3-month time spans, but robust associations using a 12-month time span. Cumulative global solar radiation had the best explanatory power, while average temperature and cumulative precipitation had only a minor impact on suicide rates. Our results demonstrate that winters with low global radiation may increase the risk of suicide. The best correlation found was for the 5-month period from November to March; the inter-annual variability in the cumulative global radiation for that period explained 40 % of the variation in the male suicide rate and 14 % of the variation in the female suicide rate, both at a statistically significant level. Long-term variations in global radiation may also explain, in part, the observed increasing trend in the suicide rate until 1990 and the decreasing trend since then in Finland.

AB Suicide preceded by homicide is a rare but tragic event that often shocks the whole community. Annual rates show considerable variation, though not as great as the incidence of homicides. Within the industrialized nations, Finland's prevalence rates for homicide-suicide have been mid-range. The National Suicide Prevention Project recorded and carefully analysed all suicides committed in Finland during a 12-month period. In this material of almost 1400 suicides, 10 verified homicide-suicide cases were found. The perpetrator was male in all but one case, and all the victims were family, 9/10 being spouses and/or children. The most typical homicide-suicide seemed to be a man shooting a family member during a separation process. No perpetrator was found suffering from a psychotic disorder but three had major depression. The homicide-suicides were compared with the suicides and statistically significant differences emerged in two variables: shooting was more often the method used in the homicide-suicide cases, which, furthermore, were more likely to involve a divorce or recent rupture in another long-term intimate relationship. Sharing few common variables with either homicide or suicide, homicide-suicide appears to be a distinct phenomenon whose prevention would seem to be extremely difficult on the individual level. Since shooting is the most common method of homicide-suicide, firearm licenses should be more restricted. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aircraft assisted suicides were studied in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and Finland during 1956-2012 by means of literature search and accident case analysis. According to our study the frequency varied slightly between the studies. Overall, the new estimate of aircraft assisted suicides in the United States in a 20-yr period (1993-2012) is 0.33% (95% Cl 0.21-0.49) (24/7244). In the detailed accident case analysis, it was found that in five out of the eight cases from the United States, someone knew of prior suicidal ideation before the aircraft assisted fatality. The caveats of standard medico-legal autopsy and accident investigation methods in investigation of suspected aircraft assisted suicides are discussed. It is suggested that a psychological autopsy should be performed in all such cases. Also the social context and possibilities of the prevention of aviation-related suicides were analyzed. In addition, some recent aircraft assisted suicides carried out using commercial aircraft during scheduled services and causing many casualties are discussed.

DT Article
DE culture; folklore; suicide
AB Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the folk stories of Norway, Iceland and Finland with a view to discovering accounts of suicide as an escape option from intolerable predicaments, and to compare any such accounts with material from Southern Europe.
   Method: The Poetic Edda (Norway/Iceland) and The Kalevala (Finland) were examined for accounts of suicide, and evidence regarding the influence of these texts and individual accounts was collected.
   Results: The Poetic Edda provided one account and The Kalevala three accounts of suicide performed as a means of escaping intolerable situations. Both the Poetic Edda and The Kalevala are in public awareness and have influenced the politics and culture of their respective regions. The individual suicides have been depicted in literature, music and the visual arts, from the distant past to the present time.
   Conclusion: Suicide as a means of escape from intolerable predicaments has been public knowledge in these regions for a millennium. This is consistent with findings from Southern Europe and substantiates that intolerable predicaments may lead to suicide.

ID ADOLESCENT SUICIDE; MENTAL-DISORDERS; DIAGNOSES
AB Although both severe medical disorders and mental disorders are established risk factors for suicide, it is not known if patients who commit suicide in general hospitals differ from others. This study investigated current mental disorders and other clinical characteristics among general hospital suicide victims and compared them with other suicide victims in an unselected nationwide population. Drawing on data from a psychological autopsy study of all suicides (N = 1397) in Finland during one. year, all suicides committed by patients in a general hospital setting were identified. Retrospective DSM-III-R consensus diagnoses were assigned and general hospital suicide victims were compared with other suicide completers in terms of clinical characteristics. Twenty-six general hospital suicide victims, 1.9% of all suicides, were identified. Subjects who completed suicide during general hospital treatment were older and used more violent suicide methods than other suicide victims. One or more diagnoses of psychiatric (Axis I) disorders were assigned for 88% of the general hospital suicide victims. Overall, the most prevalent disorder was major depression, which was more common among the general hospital suicide victims, even when age was controlled for. The findings of this study suggest that most people who commit suicide during a spell of general hospital treatment suffer from current mental disorder, as do suicide victims in general. The recognition and treatment of major depression in particular should be improved in order to prevent suicide in general hospitals. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective We studied the prevalence of hospital-treated Parkinson's disease (PD) among suicide victims and the profile of these persons, taking into account suicide attempts, timing of depression and comorbid somatic diseases.
   Methods The database of this study consisted of suicide victims aged 50 years of age or older (n = 555) during a fourteen-year period in the province of Oulu in Northern Finland.
   Results Hospital-treated Parkinson's disease occurred in 1.6% of the subjects, indicating a rather low prevalence of suicide in this group of patients. The persons with PD had attempted suicide earlier in 44% of the cases, while the corresponding percentage for other victims in older age was 9.9% (p = 0.009 Fischer exact test).
   Conclusions Based on the case characteristics of our study the profile of PD person who completed suicide was as follows: male subject with recently diagnosed disease, living in rural area, having multiple physical illnesses, and having attempted suicide earlier. Psychiatric consultation is thus highly recommended for the PD patients with this disease profile. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

   TRENDS; RATES
AB It is unclear whether suicides by different methods are distinguishable by their sociodemographic or clinical characteristics. We set out to investigate whether completed suicides by different methods show disparities in their sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Within the National Suicide Prevention Project in Finland, all 1,397 suicides occurring April 1, 1987, through March 31, 1988, were investigated using the psychological autopsy method. Disparities were found in characteristics of suicide completers using different methods. Intoxication suicides were more often female and had a history of both previous attempts and psychiatric treatment, whereas suicides by shooting were the opposite in character. Victims using vehicle exhaust gas were most frequently younger males who had experienced a recent interpersonal loss or other adverse event and committed suicide while intoxicated with alcohol. Thus, typical characteristics associate with certain suicide methods, probably due to differences in availability and acceptability of the methods. Various restrictions on the availability of suicide methods are likely to exert their possible impact on somewhat different subpopulations at risk. In terms of suicide prevention, it seems reasonable to target availability restrictions for certain identifiable groups of potential suicide attempters. For instance, carefulness in the practice of prescribing of intoxicating substances to particular psychiatric patients seems justified.

AB Aim: Women with a recent induced abortion have a 3-fold risk for suicide, compared to non-pregnant women. The increased risk was recognised in unofficial guidelines (1996) and Current Care Guidelines (2001) on abortion treatment, highlighting the importance of a check-up 2 - 3 weeks after the termination, to monitor for mental health disorders. We studied the suicide trends after induced abortion in 1987 - 2012 in Finland. Methods: We linked the Register on Induced Abortions (N = 284,751) and Cause-of-Death Register (N = 3798 suicides) to identify women who had committed suicide within 1 year after an induced abortion (N = 79). The abortion rates per 100,000 person-years were calculated for 1987 - 1996 (period with no guidelines), 1997 - 2001 (with unofficial guidelines) and 2002 - 2012 (with Current Care Guidelines). Results: The suicide rate after induced abortion declined by 24%, from 32.4/100,000 in 1987 - 1996 to 24.3/100,000 in 1997 - 2001 and then 24.8/100,000 in 2002 - 2012. The age-adjusted suicide rate among women aged 15 - 49 decreased by 13%; from 11.4/100,000 to 10.4/100,000 and 9.9/100,000, respectively. After induced abortions, the suicide rate increased by 30% among teenagers (to 25/100,000), stagnated for women aged 20 - 24 (at 32/100,000), but decreased by 43% (to 21/100,000) for women aged 25 - 49. Conclusions: The excess risk for suicide after induced abortion decreased, but the change was not statistically significant. Women with a recent induced abortion still have a 2-fold suicide risk. A mandatory check-up may decrease this risk. The causes for the increased suicide risk, including mental health prior to pregnancy and the social circumstances, should be investigated further.

AB Suicide is a notable cause of death worldwide, and while suicidal behavior appears to be associated with variations in temperature, no estimations are available of climate change impacts on suicide rates. The study aims to evaluate the influence of temperature on suicide mortality, especially on multi-decadal and longer time scales, that is, at scales on which the ongoing warming distinctly operates and is correspondingly appropriate for the current policy responses to warming climate.
   Our results are based on an extraordinarily long record of deaths from suicide in Finland from 1751 to 2008, and a similarly long climatic record of ambient temperatures correlative of environmental change in the study region.
   We show that temperature variability explains more than 60 % of the total suicide variance up until the initiation of a national suicide prevention program. Despite ongoing warming, suicide rates have declined since the initiation of the program.
   By understanding the complexity of suicidal behavior as a response to ambient warming and the observed effects of interventions, our results underline the pressing need for a network of prevention programs to battle against temperature-mediated health hazards.

AB Background The effect of recent increases in antidepressant prescribing on population suicide rates is uncertain.
   Aims To investigate the relationship between antidepressant sales and trends in suicide rates.
   Method Graphical and quantitative assessment of trends in suicide and antidepressant sales in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland.
   Results Suicide rates declined in all four countries during the 1990s, whereas antidepressant sales increased by 3- to 4-fold. Decreasing suicide rates in Sweden and Denmark preceded the rise in anti depressant sales by over 10 years, although the reductions accelerated between 1988 and 1990. In Norway, a modest but short-lived decline in suicide rates began around the time of the increase in antidepressant sales. In Finland, decreases in male suicide rates and to a lesser extent in female suicide rates began around the time of increased antidepressant sales. In all four countries decreases in suicide rates appeared to precede the widespread use of SSRIs.
   Conclusions We found mixed evidence that increases in antidepressant sales have coincided with a reduction in the number of suicides in Nordic countries.

AB Objective Older adults comprise a fifth of all suicides. Elders are the fastest growing part of the population, thus the number of persons needing nursing home care will increase dramatically in the near future. Little information has been available about suicides in nursing homes. The present study described all suicides among older adults in nursing homes in Finland during a 12-month period emphasizing the factors that have been found to be associated with suicide in the general elderly population.
   Methods Drawing on data from a psychological autopsy study of all suicides (n = 1397) in Finland during one year, all suicides committed by patients in nursing homes were identified. Retrospective DSM-IV consensus diagnoses were assigned.
   Results Twelve elderly (aged 60 years or more) nursing home residents who died by suicide, 0.9% of all suicides, were identified. The primary finding of the present study was that nursing home residents who died by suicide had suffered from highly comorbid somatopsychiatric disorders. One or more diagnoses on Axis I were made for all who died by suicide in nursing home. Depressive syndrome was diagnosed in three-quarters of subjects. Only a third of these were identified to have suffered from depressive symptoms before their death.
   Conclusions Early recognition and adequate treatment of both somatic diseases and mental disorders, particularly depression, as well as early recognition of suicide risk among nursing home residents, are needed in order to prevent suicide. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB This study was to analyse the effects and interrelationships of three socioeconomic indicators education, occupation-based social class and income - on non-alcohol and alcohol-associated suicide mortality among women in Finland. The register data used comprised the 1990 census records linked to the death register for the years 1991-2001 for women who were 25-64 years old in 1990. Adjusted relative mortality rates and the relative index of inequality (RII) were estimated using Poisson regression. The study population experienced 1926 suicides, of which 563 (29%) had alcohol intoxication as a contributory cause. The age-adjusted effects of education on non-alcohol associated suicide were modest, while social class and income related inversely and strongly. The effect of social class was partly mediated by income, and social class explained income differences to some extent. The associations between these socioeconomic indicators and alcohol-associated suicide were stronger, and following adjustment for each other large effects were left for education, social class and income. Further adjustment for living arrangements had little effect on socioeconomic differences in both types of suicide, but practically all of the effects of income and some of education and social class were mediated by employment status. In conclusion, current material factors are hardly the main underlying drivers of socioeconomic differences in suicide among Finnish women. Low social class proved to be an important determinant of suicide risk, but the strong independent effect of education on alcohol-associated suicide indicates that the roots of these differences are probably established in early adulthood when educational qualifications are obtained and health-behavioural patterns set.

AB This article analyses and compares the epidemiology of mental disorders and relevant public policies in Chile and Finland. In Chile, a specific mental health law is still lacking. While both countries highlight the role of primary care, Finland places more emphasis on participation and recovery of service users. Comprehensive mental health policies from Finland, such as a successful suicide prevention program, are presented. Both countries have similar prevalence of mental disorders, high alcohol consumption and high suicide rates. In Chile, the percentage of total disease burden due to psychiatric disorders is 13% and in Finland 14%. However, the resources to address these issues are very different. Finland spends 4.5% of its health budget on mental health, while in Chile the percentage is 2.2%. This results in differences in human resources and service provision. Finland has five times more psychiatric outpatient visits, four times more psychiatrists, triple antidepressant use and twice more clinical guidelines for different psychiatric conditions. In conclusion, both countries have similar challenges but differing realities. This may help to identify gaps and potential solutions for public health challenges in Chile. Finland's experience demonstrates the importance of political will and long-term vision in the construction of mental health policies.

AB To investigate those ante- and perinatal circumstances preceding suicide attempts and suicides, which have so far not been studied intensively.
   Examination of the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (n = 10,742), originally based on antenatal questionnaire data and now followed up from mid-pregnancy to age 39, to ascertain psychiatric disorders in the parents and offspring and suicides or attempted suicides in the offspring using nationwide registers.
   A total of 121 suicide attempts (57 males) and 69 suicides (56 males) had occurred. Previously unstudied antenatal factors (maternal depressed mood and smoking, unwanted pregnancy) were not related to these after adjustment. Psychiatric disorders in the parents and offspring were the risk factors in both genders. When adjusted for these, the statistically significant risk factors among males were a single-parent family for suicide attempts (OR 3.71, 95% CI 1.62-8.50) and grand multiparity for suicides (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.15-6.18). When a psychiatric disorder in females was included among possible risk factors for suicide attempts, it alone remained significant (OR 15.55, 8.78-27.53).
   A single-parent family was a risk factor for attempted suicides and grand multiparity for suicides in male offspring even after adjusting for other ante- and perinatal circumstances and mental disorders in the parents and offspring. Mothers' antenatal depressed mood and smoking and unwanted pregnancy did not increase the risk of suicide, which is a novel finding.

AB Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among adolescents worldwide. Studies on the seasonal pattern of youth suicides are rare and the results are very contradictory and heterogeneous. Generally, suicide methods affect the pattern of suicide seasonality. Shooting is the most common suicide method among Finnish adolescents. We investigated whether shooting suicides of victims aged less than 18 years are correlated with a specific period of the year. Also, the seasonal pattern of shooting suicides in adolescents was compared with that of adult victims. Our data comprised 42 adolescent suicide victims and, for comparison, 1,926 adult suicide victims over the years 1988 to 2004 from Northern Finland. Of these, 59.5% (n = 25) of the adolescents and 28.8% (n = 554) of the adults had committed suicide by shooting. We observed that shooting suicides among the under-aged showed a significant peak in autumn (ratio 2.70, 95% CI: 1.97-3.42), while those of adult victims peaked in spring (ratio 1.19, 95% CI: 1.05-1.35). The monthly pattern of suicides correlated significantly with the mean duration of daily sunshine hours (trailing by 3 months) in the under-aged (r = 0.67, p = 0.016), but not in the adults (r = 0.06, p = 0.854). The role of firearm availability, psychosocial factors such as start of the school year, and some biological factors are discussed. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Background: Time patterns of suicide have been attributed not only to social and psychological factors but also to direct geophysical effects. Seasonal variations in day length and temperature seem likely to contribute to the timing of the suicide process. Methods: We analysed all suicides (n = 1658) committed in a northern province of Finland during a period of 153 months. Daily data on the number of suicides, local weather conditions and geomagnetic storms were compiled and modelled with Poisson regression using the province population as the denominator, and with the means of harmonic series for seasonal variation. Time series analysis of monthly numbers of suicides was carried out using the seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on loess. Results: Marked fluctuations in the number of suicides occurred during the study period (P=0.01). There was significant seasonal variation in death from suicide (P=0.01), but analysis of the meteorological data showed no evidence of effect on the risk of suicide. Limitations: Assessment of mental disorder or alcohol consumption was missing, since only data derived from death certificate was available for each case. Conclusions: The seasonal effect was significant, but remained modest compared to sex and age as risk factors for suicide. Preventive measures need to be tailored according to time of the year.

AB Objective Methods Recent reports suggest that the mortality gap between persons with schizophrenia and the general population is increasing. We investigated the mortality, age at death, and causes of death among persons diagnosed with schizophrenia and the general population in Finland during 1984-2014. All persons with schizophrenia in Finland were identified from hospital discharge register, and compared with the Finnish population aged 16 years and older during 1984-2014, based on data from Statistics Finland. Age at death and standardized mortality ratio (SMR) were calculated for each follow-up year. Results Conclusion Mean age at death increased from 57.6 years in 1984 to 70.1 years in 2014 in persons with schizophrenia, and from 70.9 to 77.5 years in the general population. All-cause SMR remained stable during the follow-up (2.6 in 1984 and 2.7 in 2014). A major change was observed in SMR for suicides which decreased from 11.0 in 1984 to 6.6 in 2014 (-40%). The SMRs for cardiovascular and cancer deaths showed increasing trends. The longevity of persons with schizophrenia is improving at approximately the same rate as the general population but suicide rates have declined substantially. However, there is still a major disparity in mortality compared with general population.

AB Background: The seasonality of suicide rates and methods of suicide may be related to changes in weather and conditions of employment. Particularly the amount of occupational outdoor exposure could show differences in the distribution of suicides by season and the selection of suicide method, in addition to age at the time of death. Methods: The data consisted of all death certificates (n = 1359) of completed suicides in the province of Oulu, Finland, during the years 1988-1999. For male subjects included in this study, four occupational groups were identified according to decreasing occupational outdoor exposure. The mean ages, the distribution of suicide methods and the seasonal variation in suicides for each occupational group were analyzed. Results: Farmers were significantly older at the time of suicide than construction or indoor workers, and farmers employed significantly more violent methods than the other occupational groups. In the spring, farmers had a significant peak in the rate of suicides. In the winter, forest workers had a significant trough in the rate of suicides. In the summer, indoor workers had a significant peak in the rate of suicides. Limitations: The analyses were restricted to males due to the low number of females in the study population. Conclusions: The novel finding in this study was that the seasonality of violent suicides was most strongly seen as a spring peak and a winter trough among outdoor workers. The recognition of typical risk factors of different occupations, such as outdoor exposure, and occupational-related susceptibility towards certain suicide methods could benefit in the prevention of suicides.

AB Gunshot injuries are a major problem worldwide from the human, medical, and economic perspectives. The number and characteristics of gunshot fatalities have been observed to vary significantly between countries. This study analyzes fatal gunshot wounds in the region of Uusimaa, Southern Finland, between 1995 and 2001. Gunshot wounds were typically found in suicides committed by men aged between 20 and 60 years. In most cases, a handgun was used. Mental disorders were present in the history of almost one quarter of the victims. Alcohol was identified in postmortem toxicology in half of the cases, but drugs of abuse were relatively uncommon.
   The autopsy rate in Finland is among the highest of the European Union countries, and a medicolegal investigation is performed in virtually all fatal gunshot incidents. This study is therefore representative of forensic investigations of gunshot fatalities in Finland overall.

AB Since the 1960s, homicides against children have decreased dramatically in Finland. The article examines this decrease by disaggregating the trend in five child homicide types between 1960-1974 and 2003-2009. There were several factors reducing the motivation and opportunity to commit most child homicide types during the period. Some were results of active social policies, some were byproducts of the policies, and some were related to the change of the moral climate. Most of the factors were interdependent. However, one type of child homicide has been resistant to any of the factors and the decreasing general trend: maternal filicide-suicides.

AB Objective: Recent case reports of insulin suicides have raised the need to study in detail the suicides among diabetes patients.
   Methods: The data consisted of 2489 suicides (2030 men, 459 women) in Northern Finland during 1988 to 2010. The suicide victims with hospital-treated type 1 (n = 27) or type 2 diabetes (n = 51) were compared with those without diabetes (n = 2411).
   Results: Of all suicide victims, 3.1% had diabetes (34.6% type 1 and 65.4% type 2 diabetes). 24.0% of victims with type 2 diabetes were under the influence of alcohol when they died from suicide, while the proportion was 44.4% in type 1 diabetes and 46.6% in victims without diabetes (P = 0.007). Compared to those with type 2 diabetes or without diabetes, victims with type 1 diabetes had suffered more commonly from depression (44.4%, 23.5%, 19.9%, respectively) (P = 0.006) and chosen self-poisoning as suicide method (48.1%, 31.4%, and 18.0%) (P < 0.001). In victims with type 1 diabetes insulin as a suicide method covered half of the self-poisoning cases, while the proportion in type 2 diabetes was 13%.
   Conclusion: We suggest that physicians who treat diabetes patients should evaluate co-occurring depression and substance abuse, both of which are major risk factors of suicide. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Patients with epilepsy are known to have comorbid affective disorders and a higher risk for suicide compared with the general population. Epilepsy, depression, and suicidal behavior have been shown to have common pathogenic mechanisms in their etiology. We evaluated the association between epilepsy, suicidal behavior, and depression by using the comprehensive database of all suicides (n = 1877) committed in northern Finland during the years 1988-2002 with information on all hospital-treated somatic and psychiatric disorders. Hospital-treated epilepsy occurred in 1.3% of the victims. Compared with other suicide victims, those with epilepsy were more often female, were older, and had significantly more often suffered from depression. Epilepsy was first diagnosed 8.8 (3.9-11.6) years before suicide, and depression, about I year after epilepsy diagnosis. Interictal depression among patients with chronic epilepsy is often classified as atypical or chronic depression, or it can mimic a dysthymic disorder. Therefore, diagnosis and treatment of depression among patients with epilepsy constitute a great challenge in clinical practice. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To investigate the relationship between adolescent regular daily smoking and later suicides in a prospective longitudinal birth cohort setting.
   Method: Data from the Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort Study (N = 10,934) were linked with national death certificates from Statistics Finland. The information on suicide attempts until the end of 2001 was gathered from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register (FHDR). The information on adolescent regular daily smoking was gathered via a questionnaire in 1980 and 198 1, when the subjects were age 14 years.
   Results: Of all cohort males who smoked regularly at age 14 years, 2.6% committed suicide by age 34 years, while the corresponding proportion was 0.8% among experimental smokers and 0.4% among nonsmokers (chi(2) = 15.8, df = 2, p <.001). After adjusting for sociodemographic factors in adolescence and psychiatric morbidity, regular smokers were at a 4.05-fold hazard (95% CI = 1.18 to 13.93, p =.026) for committing suicide at a younger age. Corresponding associations were not found among females. The choice of suicide method was not associated with smoking habits in adolescence. Furthermore, the proportion of suicide attempts was significantly higher among regular daily smokers, among both boys (3.3% vs. 1.2%) and girls (4.2% vs. 1.2%), compared with other adolescents.
   Conclusion: At the epidemiologic level, adolescent regular smoking was found to be associated with increased risk for suicide among males before the age of 34 years. Further studies are needed to investigate the effects of smoking on neurobiology of depression, self-damaging aggression, and impulsive behavior.

AB It is generally acknowledged that depressed patients need specific attention during the first weeks after initiation of antidepressant (AD) treatment because of the increased risk of suicide.
   The study population consisted of all individuals residing in Finland from 1999 to 2003 who had purchased a prescribed antidepressant at least once but had no preceding antidepressant prescription. Data sources were the National Prescription Register, the Causes of Death Register, Census Data of Statistics Finland, and the National Care Register. Follow-up started at the first purchase and ended at the end of 2003 or death. Data on prescriptions were used to construct contiguous treatment periods of follow-up time. Life-table analysis with Poisson regression was used to estimate risk ratios (RR) of antidepressant use with respect to all-cause mortality and to deaths from suicide.
   Current AD use was associated with a lowered all-cause mortality (RR = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.18-0.19) compared with those who filled one previous prescription only. There was no difference in suicide mortality when any current antidepressant usage was compared to the one-prescription group. Current SSRI usage was associated with lower risk of suicide compared to the one-prescription or other antidepressant groups (RR 0.47, 0.38-0.59).
   Current AD treatment is associated with decreased all-cause mortality rates in patients who have ever had AD treatment.

AB Background: Depression and substance abuse are common among patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, previous studies have not examined the temporal association between psychiatric disorders, TBI and suicide.
   Objective: To study the prevalence of TBI injury among suicide victims; to determine the association of suicide, psychiatric disorders and TBI severity; and to examine the effect of pre- and post-traumatic psychiatric disorders on their remaining life-time.
   Methods: This study examined all suicides (n = 1877) committed during a 16-year period in the province of Oulu, Finland. The information of suicide victims was extracted from the official death certificates and the National Hospital Discharge Registers.
   Results: TBI was found in 5.5% (n = 103) of the victims. Compared to the victims without TBI, those with TBI had significantly more hospital-treated psychiatric and alcohol disorders. If TBI subjects had comorbid psychiatric disorders, the time period between TBI and suicide was under 3 years in similar to 90% of victims in this suicide population.
   Conclusions: Seriousness of injury, male gender, older age, being unemployed and presence of psychiatric and alcohol disorders are important to identify as possible predictors for suicidal behaviour in TBI patients. Further studies are required to shed light on interventions aimed at better life management.

AB Several studies show a peak in suicide rates during springtime and suggest differences in the seasonal variation of suicides. However, the seasonal distribution of the temperature impact on suicide is less clear. This study investigated the relationship between diurnal temperature range (DTR) on suicide mortality. Daily temperature and suicide data for Helsinki were analyzed for the period of 1973-2010 inclusive. Overall, DTR reached its maximum during the spring from mid-April to mid-June, which is also the season with highest suicide mortality in the study region. Specifically, the seasonal timing and maxima for both DTR and suicides vary from year to year. Time series analysis of DTR and suicide records revealed a significant (P < 0.01) correlation between the springtime DTR maxima and suicide rates for males. No similar association could be found for females. These results provide evidence that a higher springtime DTR could be linked statistically to a higher seasonal suicide rate each spring, whereas the exact timing of the DTR peak did not associate with the seasonal suicide rate. A possible mechanism behind the springtime association between the DTR and suicides originates from brown adipose tissue (BAT) over-activity. Activation of BAT through the winter improves cold tolerance at the cost of heat tolerance. This might trigger anxiety and psychomotor agitation, affecting mood in a negative way. As a hypothesis, the compromised heat tolerance is suggested to increase the risk of death from suicide.

AB ObjectivesSuicide risk in psychiatric inpatients is known to be remarkably high after discharge. However, temporal patterns and risk factors among patients with bipolar disorder remain obscure. We investigated post-discharge temporal patterns of hazard and risk factors by type of illness phase among patients with bipolar disorder.
   MethodsBased on national registers, all discharges of patients with bipolar disorder from a psychiatric ward in Finland in 1987-2003 (n=52,747) were identified, and each patient was followed up to post-index discharge or to suicide (n=466). For discharges occurring in 1995-2003 (n=35,946), factors modifying hazard of suicide during the first 120days (n=129) were investigated.
   ResultsThe temporal pattern of suicide risk depended on the type of illness phase, being highest but steeply declining after discharge with depression; less high and declining in mixed states; lower and relatively stable after mania. In Cox models, for post-discharge suicides (n=65) after hospitalizations for bipolar depression (n=9,635), the hazard ratio was 8.05 (p=0.001) after hospitalization with a suicide attempt and 3.63 (p<0.001) for male patients, but 0.186 (p=0.001) for patients taking lithium. Suicides after mania (n=28) or mixed episodes (n=20) were predicted by male sex and preceding suicide attempts, respectively.
   ConclusionsAmong inpatients with bipolar disorder, suicide risk is high and related strongly to the time elapsed from discharge after hospitalizations for depressive episodes, and less strongly after hospitalizations for mixed episodes. Intra-episodic suicide attempts and male sex powerfully predict suicide risk. Lower suicide rate after hospitalizations for depression among patients prescribed lithium is consistent with a preventive effect.

A survey of suicides among 15-24-year-olds in 34 of the wealthiest nations demonstrated that 15,555 youths killed themselves in a 1-year study period. Thirty-four percent of these suicides were firearm-related. Finland led the participating nations in total and firearm-related suicide rates. An association was found between divorce rates and youth suicide rates, firearm-related suicide among youths, and suicide rates among young males. For a smaller sample of countries, an association was found between firearm availability and firearm-related suicide rates among youths and suicide rates among young males.

AB Objective: The suicide rate has decreased in many countries, while the use of antidepressants has increased greatly. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between use of antidepressants and suicide rate.
   Method: Population-based suicide rates and reimbursed prescriptions of antidepressants between 1994 and 2001 in Finland were analyzed in the whole population, and separately by gender, age, and geographical region.
   Results: There were significant differences in suicide rates between men and women (p < .0001), but there were no differences between different regions of the country. The decline in the suicide rate was significantly associated with use of antidepressants among men aged 15 to 44 (p < .000 1), 45 to 64 (p = .0005), and 75 years and over (p = .001) and men in 3 regions (p < .001). The decline in the suicide rate was significantly associated with the use of antidepressants among 15- to 44-year-old women (p = .008) and women in 1 region (p = .013). Use of antidepressants had a significant association with the decrease in the suicide rate (risk ratio = 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.30, p < .001), despite the effect of background variables, their interaction, and the course of time.
   Conclusions: An increase in the use of antidepressants may decrease the suicide rate. Baseline suicide rate and access to health care may influence this association.

In fact, medicolegal autopsies are performed in 87.2% of all unintentional injury deaths, 98.3% of homicides and 99.5% of suicides. Finland has exceedingly high medicolegal autopsy rates compared with other countries. Autopsy rates should be appropriately considered when performing international comparisons of injury-related deaths.

AB The aim of the study is (1) to describe and analyse health and social service use and medicine purchases in the last 2 years of life among older adults who died by suicide and (2) to compare use and purchases between three groups: those who died by suicide, died a natural death or who lived longer. Nation-wide Finnish register data were used. The data consist of 316,639 decedents who died at the age of 70 years or older in 1998-2008 and 222,967 people who lived longer. Use of hospital, long-term care and home care, and the purchase of prescribed psychotropic medications were studied for the 2-year period. Binary logistic regression analyses were applied. 1118 older adults died by suicide (0.4 % of all deaths). A majority of older adults who died by suicide had multiple somatic diseases and mental disorders, especially depression, and had contact with health and social services in the last 2 years of life. At the same level of morbidity, use of hospital and long-term care was less common among those who died by suicide than among those who died of natural causes, but more common than among those who lived longer. Those who died by suicide received less home care than those who lived longer. A high proportion of suicides occurred in the first month following hospital discharge. Health and social services should improve support for older adults with chronic diseases and depression.

   METAANALYSIS
AB Depressive disorders are involved as a background factor in over 50% of suicide cases. The most widely used antidepressants today are serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). However, not all users benefit from SSRI medication. Although the overall number of suicides in Finland have decreased notably during the last decade, the annual rate is still relatively high, particularly in male population. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the genetic variants associated with decreased citalopram efficiency, 5HTTLPR/rs25531, and increased impulsive behavior, MAOA-uVNTR and HTR2B Q20*, are more frequent among citalopram users committing suicide than among the citalopram users in general. Also the effect of alcohol was evaluated. The study population comprised 349 suicide victims (184 males and 165 females). Based on the suicide method used, cases were divided into two groups; violent (88 males and 49 females) and non-violent (96 males and 116 females). The control group (284; 159 males and 125 females) consisted of citalopram users who died of causes other than suicide. We found that male citalopram users with low functioning s/s genotype of 5HTTLPR/rs25531 were in increased risk to commit violent suicide (OR 2.50, 95% CI 1.15-5.42, p = 0.020). Surprisingly, high blood alcohol concentration was observed to be a risk factor only in non-violent suicides (both males and females), but not in violent ones. No association between suicides and MAOA-uVNTR and HTR2B Q20*, which have been previously connected to violent and impulsive behavior, was detected.

AB Objective Elderly people commit suicide more often than people under the age of 65. An elevated risk is also attached to depression and other axis I psychiatric disorders. However, little is known about the preferred suicide method, effect of primary psychiatric diagnosis, and length of time between discharge from psychiatric hospitalization and suicide. The lack of information is most apparent in the oldest old (individuals over 75 years).
   Methods On the basis of forensic examinations, data on suicide rates were separately examined for the 50 - 64, 65 - 74 and over 75 year-olds (Total n=564) with regard to suicide method, history of psychiatric hospitalization and primary diagnoses gathered from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register. Study population consisted of all suicides committed between 1988 and 2003 in the province of Oulu in Northern Finland.
   Results Of the oldest old, females had more frequent hospitalizations than males in connection with psychiatric disorders (61% vs 23%), of which depression was the most common (39% vs 14%). In this age group, 42% committed suicide within 3 months after being discharged from hospital and 83% used a violent method. Both elderly males and females were less often under the influence of alcohol, but used more often violent methods than middle-aged persons.
   Conclusions Suicide rates within the first 3 months following discharge from hospital in the 65 - 74 and the over 75 year olds were substantial and should influence post-hospitalization treatment strategies. To reduce the risk of suicides in elderly patients discharged from hospital, close post-hospitalization supervision combined with proper psychoactive medication and psychotherapy, are possible interventions.

AB Evidence from politically and socially stable countries in Northern Europe and the Southern Hemisphere indicates a marked decrease in the seasonality of suicide over the past two decades. Generalizability of this trend to societies in transition has not vet been investigated. Data for suicide by hanging in Timis County of Romania show both a nondecrease in seasonality of suicide for the current transitional period (1990-98), relative to the last decade of the Communist regime (1980-89) and shifts in location for suicide peak and trough months. Recent decreases in the seasonality of suicide might not generalize to societies in transition, and research would improve from focusing on the "natural laboratories" these societies represent.

AB Objective: Our aim was to analyse the relationship between good school performance and risk of suicide in the Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort, especially in psychoses.
   Method: A total of 11 017 cohort members who were alive at the age of 16 years were followed up to the age of 35 years. School performance was measured by the school marks given at age 16 at the end of comprehensive school. School, diagnostic and mortality data were based on national registers.
   Results: For psychotic persons having good school performance (highest 20%), the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for suicide was 3.56 (0.97-13.05) compared with the remaining 80%. In the non-psychotic population (97% without psychiatric hospitalization), accordingly, adjusted HR was 0.28 (0.07-1.16). Interaction (school performance x psychiatric diagnosis) was significant (P = 0.01) even when adjusted with gender, social class and age of onset of illness.
   Conclusion: Good school performance at age 16 years is associated with increased risk of suicide (before age 35 years) in persons who develop psychosis, whereas in persons who do not develop psychosis, it is associated with lower suicide risk.

AB PURPOSE: We sought to investigate the relationship between regular daily smoking in adolescence and in adulthood, the onset age of suicidal behavior, and the repetitiveness of suicide attempts by the age of 31 years.
   METHODS: Data from the Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort (NFBC 1966, n = 7995) were linked with the National Finnish Hospital Discharge registers (FHDR). Smoking habits of the cohort members were assessed at the ages of 14 and 31 years.
   RESULTS: After adjusting for hospital, treated psychiatric disorders and several sociodemographic characteristics, women with prolonged smoking from 14 to 31 years especially were at increased hazard (adjusted hazard ratio, 6.67; 95% confidence interval, 3.06-14.52) for having their first suicide attempt at younger age compared with infrequent smokers/nonsmokers. Smoking habits were not associated with the repetitiveness of suicide attempts in either gender.
   CONCLUSION: This study confirms the association between smoking and suicidality. Further studies are needed to investigate the neurobiological basis of this association. Ann Epidemiol 2009;19:329-335. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID UNITED-STATES; CONSUMPTION; MORTALITY; RATES
AB Studies suggest that the population level link between alcohol and suicide differs across countries and between men and women. The aim of this paper was to estimate the relationship between alcohol consumption and suicide in Canada and to put the results in a comparative perspective. The relationship was elucidated for whole Canada, different provinces and also separately for men and women. The total suicide rate in Canada increased signicantly by around 4% as alcohol consumption increased by one litre per capita, suggesting that approximately 25 - 30% of Canadian suicides were related to alcohol. The relationship was stronger for women than for men. A signicant effect was found in all provinces except from Quebec, but the overall regional variation was not statistically signicant. In an international perspective, the relationship for women was somewhat weaker than in Sweden and Norway, but larger than in Finland, the United States and Southern European countries. For men, the association was similar to what is found in the United States and Finland, weaker than in Sweden, Norway and Russia but stronger than in Southern European countries. The results only partly support the idea that intoxication frequency explains national differences in this relationship. Possible explanations for the stronger association among women are also discussed.

AB This study aimed to analyse the effects of different socioeconomic indicators on non-alcohol-associated and alcohol-associated suicide in Finland. The data used comprised the 1990 census records for men who were 25-64-years old linked to the death register for 1991-2001. Poisson regression was used to calculate the adjusted relative mortality rates. There were 6,452 suicides among the study population, and in 42% of them alcohol intoxication was a contributory cause. Education, occupation-based social class and household income were inversely and strongly related to suicide regardless of the link with alcohol. For non-alcohol-associated suicide, the effect of education was largely mediated by social class and income, the effect of social class was partly explained by education and partly mediated by income, and the effect of income was rather small after adjustment for the other two indicators. When alcohol was involved, social class mediated a large part of educational effect, but a strong association also remained. Respectively, education explained a large proportion of the social class differences. Income had a minor effect. Adjustment for employment status explained some of the income differences, but living arrangements had little effect. The findings imply that low social class is associated with increased suicide risk regardless of employment status, and that the roots of socioeconomic differences in alcohol-associated suicide lie in early adulthood when education and health behavioural patterns are set. This casts some doubt on claims that current material factors are the main drivers of socioeconomic differences in suicide.

AB Aim: Suicide is a common cause of death in many Western countries and it has been predicted to become even more common worldwide. The authors analysed socioeconomic differences and trends in Finnish suicide mortality, and assessed the relevance to public health by calculating socioeconomic differences in years of life expectancy lost attributable to suicide. Data and methods: Census records were used, linked with the death records of men and women aged 25 years and over in 1971-2000 in Finland. Results: Suicide among male and female manual workers was 2.3 and 1.3 times higher respectively than among upper non-manual workers. The differences were largest among those in their thirties. Because of the decline in suicide among upper non-manual workers and a slower decrease or even an increase among other socioeconomic groups, the relative mortality differences increased somewhat during 1970-90, then decreased in the 1990s but remained higher than in the 1970s. In 1991-2000 the suicide-related life expectancy gap between the upper non-manual and manual male workers was 0.6 years, and this difference contributed 10% to the total difference in years of life expectancy lost between these socioeconomic groups. Conclusion: Large and persistent socioeconomic differences were found in suicide mortality and suicide was an important component of the socioeconomic difference in total mortality. Reducing these differences could significantly improve equity in health and reduce the burden of excess mortality.

AB Study Design: A population-based study of suicides and linkage with national hospital discharge registers.
   Objective: To investigate the prevalence of hospital-treated musculoskeletal diseases, particularly back pain (BP), among suicide victims to compare suicide characteristics between victims with and without musculoskeletal diseases, to analyze comorbidity between musculoskeletal diseases and psychiatric disorders, and to evaluate whether specific drugs have a role in suicides by poisoning.
   Summary of Background Data: Depression, other psychiatric disorders, and suicidal behavior are common comorbid conditions in patients with diseases of the musculoskeletal system.
   Methods: The data consisted of 2310 suicides (1885 men and 425 women) committed in the province of Oulu in Northern Finland during 1988 to 2007. The information on hospital-treated musculoskeletal diseases (MSD) was extracted from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Registers. The suicide victims with a diagnosis of BP, including sciatica (BP, n = 133), and victims with MSD other than BP/MSD, n = 357) were compared with those of having no history of MSD (reference group, n = 1820). The data on suicides were based on death certificates that were taken from official medicolegal investigations.
   Results: A total of 490 (21.3%) of suicide victims had a history of hospital-treated MSD. The age of death of the victims with BP was about 11 years higher compared with the reference group. After adjusting for age, nonviolent suicide methods and use of analgesics in poisoning suicides in both genders and hospital-treated depression/substance-related disorders in men were also more common in the BP and MSD groups. Women with BP had been more often under the influence of alcohol when committing suicide compared with the other groups.
   Conclusion: Victims with a history of hospital-treated MSD committed suicide at older age. However, the older the person is, the more is the chance that he or she needs to have a treatment for some MSD at some point of life. Use of analgesics as a potential suicide method should be kept in mind when treating patients with musculoskeletal system diseases.

AB To assess the role of toxicologic detection of alcohol to diagnose substance abuse disorders in suicides, the author reviewed suicide studies with both comprehensive toxicologic and diagnostic data. The sensitivity of alcohol detection to diagnose alcohol and substance abuse disorders in suicides was low in all studies (range, 39%-42%), and the specificity was 80%-95%. A higher cutoff level for alcohol did not increase diagnostic performance. The author concludes that toxicologic detection of alcohol is not a reliable indicator of alcohol and substance abuse disorders in suicides because of the high rate of false-negatives. Most of the suicides with positive alcohol detection seem to suffer from chronic substance abuse problems. The role of intoxication is difficult to assess because of methodologic problems.

AB This paper analyses cause-specific mortality in ages 15-30 years in Finland, using longitudinal population register data that covers the period 1970-2004. The aim is to see how mortality risks interrelate with living conditions in the parental home and with regional confounders, in order to understand why the two native population groups of the country differ in mortality. Results based on Cox proportional hazard models reveal that, in young men, socio-economic circumstances interrelate with external causes of death excluding suicides, probably because of social class differences in hazardous lifestyles. Thus injuries and accidents, but not suicides, depend on socio-economic background. For suicides, we find a regional mortality pattern that is highly similar to variation in overall mortality at higher ages, whereas for all other external causes of death such differences cannot be observed. These results suggest that hereditary factors cannot be ruled out as an explanation to the population-group mortality gradient. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Clinical information on parricidal offenders has accumulated in recent decades. The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the mortality of matricidal and patricidal offenders in detail by using a comprehensive national data set with follow-up ranging from 3 to 24 years. The sample included forensic psychiatric examination statements and mortality data of 99 matricidal, 113 patricidal, and Ill control male violent offenders evaluated in a forensic psychiatric examination from 1973 to 2004 in Finland. The Standardized Mortality Ratio among parricidal offenders 25 to 49 years of age was increased compared with that of the general population. One-third of deaths among parricidal offenders were attributable to suicide. The matricidal males who committed suicide had a significantly shorter survival time after the offense than did the patricidal and control offenders who died by suicide. The results of the present study are compared with the previous study findings on parricidal offenders and offenders in general.

SO ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE violent death; alcohol; accident; suicide; homicide
ID MENTAL-DISORDERS; SUICIDE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; TRENDS
AB Background: In Finland, the high rates of forensic autopsy and postmortem toxicology furnish a reliable base for nation-wide studies on alcohol-related violent deaths.
   Material and methods: National mortality and population data within Finland, from 1987 to 1996, were used to analyze sex- and age-specific rates, proportions, and trends of violent deaths associated with alcohol. Deaths were defined as alcohol-related when alcohol was certified as a contributing factor to death.
   Results: During the study period, 10,360 (23.3%) of the 45,544 violent deaths that occurred were alcohol-related. Among 15- to 64-year-olds, 28.6% of accidents, 30.5% of suicides, and 55.3% of homicides were associated with alcohol (alcohol-positive). Differences in epidemiologic patterns and trends for different types of violent death were observed between sexes and age groups. For instance, alcohol-positive accidents significantly decreased in males (-2.3%/year; CL95: -3.3, -1.2; p < 0.001), but not in females (+0.5%/year; CL95: -2.7, +3.7; p = 0.772), and alcohol-positive suicides increased slightly in females (+3.9%/year; CL95: +0.0, +7.9; p = 0.047), but not in males (-0.2%/year, CL95: -1.4, +1.0; p = 0.704).
   Conclusions: The victims of violent deaths have often consumed or abused alcohol before the fatal events. Especially in young adults, consumption of alcohol is likely one of the most serious risk factors in accidents and may decrease the threshold for suicide ideation and impulsive behaviors. Studies that explore the effects of sociodemographic and health factors on random populations with relevant control data will increase the understanding of the causal connection between alcohol and violent deaths.

AB The marked variation regarding the suicide rate in 34 European countries is well described by regressing the national suicide rate on the capital cities' latitudes and on an interaction term of squared latitude multiplied with longitude. The interaction term explains 40.8% and 29.1% of men's and women's suicide rate, respectively, and latitude explains a further significant increment of 10.9% and 10.6% variance of men's and women's suicide rate, respectively. This regression model quantifies the Finno-Ugrian suicide hypothesis of Kondrichin and of Marusic and Farmer. The European countries highest in suicide rate constitute a contiguous, J-shaped belt, spanning from Finland to Austria. This area maps onto the second principal component identified for European gene distribution, representing ancestral adaptation to cold climates and the Uralic language dispersion. Thus, population differences in genetic risk factors may account for the spatial pattern in European suicide rates.

LA English
DT Article

ID DISORDERS
AB Backgroud: We investigated whether alcohol drinking contributes to suicides in cancer sufferers when compared with non-cancer suicides. We also explored the suicide method used in cancer suicides.
   Methods: The population-based, prospectively collected data sample consisted of 1515 completed suicides committed in the province of Oulu, Finland, during the period 1988-99. Victims who suffered from cancer were compared with other suicides.
   Results: Cancer patients who committed suicide were significantly less commonly under the influence of alcohol than non-cancer suicide victims (84.8% vs 54.7%). Mental disorders were less prevalent among cancer patients than non-cancer patients. The cancer patients were significantly older and more often retired and a trend that a greater proportion of cancer suicide victims were male was noted. Shooting and poisoning were the most common suicide methods among cancer patients.
   Conclusion: An early recognition and evaluation of the extent of the suicidal tendencies among cancer patients is of great importance in clinical oncology, since preventive interventions would be effective especially for those without comorbid alcoholism at the time of the suicide.

AB Objective: The author hypothesized, based on research until 1991, that a five-fold increase in the use of antidepressants might reduce Swedish suicide rates by 25%. A subsequent 3.5-fold increase in the use of antidepressants provided a 'natural experimental situation' for prospectively testing this hypothesis.
   Method: Swedish statistics on suicide, use of antidepressants, unemployment and alcohol consumption were obtained for 1978-96. Time-series of the latter variables were compared with suicide rates. Demographic subgroups regarding age, gender and county were analysed. Suicide rates were also compared with the use of antidepressants in Denmark, Norway and Finland.
   Results: Suicide rates decreased in accordance with the a priori hypothesis. Alcohol consumption and unemployment rates did not correlate well with suicide rates.
   Conclusion: This naturalistic study is not conclusive. The increased use of antidepressants appears, however, to be one of the contributing factors to the decrease in the suicide rate. It is of great scientific and clinical importance that this be evaluated by further studies.

AB Objective: We investigated suicide mortality among people with mental retardation (MR) over a period of 35 years.
   Method: The nationwide, population-based cohort of 2369 people with MR was followed-up from a representative sample of 9.4% of the population in Finland in 1962. The standardized mortality ratio of suicides was calculated and case studies of all MR suicides based on all available data were performed.
   Results: Women with MR had an equal suicide risk to Finnish women in general, while men had only one-third of the population risk. Risk factors for suicide were similar to those in the general population. Most suicide victims had mild MR and were hospitalized for comorbid mental disorders. Suicide methods were passive and alcohol was involved in only one case.
   Conclusion: Suicide mortality in MR is significantly lowered among males. Suicide prevention in MR should be focused on people with comorbid mental disorders. Problems in adjustment to new circumstances need to be recognized. Appropriate and adequate treatment of comorbid depression is emphasized.

A total of 222 consecutive patients (143 female) aged 65 years or older (mean age 76.5 years; range 65-100) presenting at the emergency department of the Karolinska University Hospital after self-poisoning during 1994-2000, were followed up for the cause of death by January 1, 2006. Survival analysis was applied to study suicide and death risk. Of the 15 suicides, 13 (87%) occurred during the first year after the index episode of self-poisoning (cumulative suicide risk 6.2%). The risk of dying of all causes during the first year was increased fourfold. Self-poisoning in both elderly men and women is associated with high early suicide risk.

AB Background. Suicide is a major cause of mortality worldwide. Differences in rates of suicide exist between urban and rural areas; however, little rigorous research has examined the phenomena of rural suicide. Objective. This review examines the current body of literature on rural suicide and investigates differences between rural and urban suicide, including socioeconomic, psychological, and cultural variables. Prevention and intervention strategies specific to rural communities are discussed. Description of studies. All empirical and epidemiological studies of rural suicide were included in the review regardless of study design or methodology. Results. Although findings are mixed, research and epidemiological data indicate that suicide is a public health concern in rural areas, with suicide rates often greater than in urban areas. Discussion. Rural locale may create geographic, psychological, and sociocultural barriers to treatment of suicide. A better understanding of the role of rurality in the development and maintenance of suicidal thoughts and behaviors is needed and may inform prevention and intervention efforts.

AB Objective: Evaluation was done of a possible link between psychiatric and physical illnesses in suicide victims 25 years of age or younger. Methods: This was a follow-up study based on a 13-year database (n = 1,585) of all suicides committed during the years 1988 to 2000 in northern Finland with linkage to national hospital discharge registers. The setting for the study was the province of Oulu, located in nor-them Finland. Subjects comprised 202 male and 27 female suicide victims aged 25 years or less. Results: Despite the young age of the suicide victims, lifetime prevalence of physical illness was about 70% in both males and females. In relation to mental disorders, female suicide victims were affected significantly more (45%) than their male counterparts (21%). About 27% of the subjects with physical illnesses had also suffered from mental disorders, but the respective proportion among those without any physical illness was only 7%. An increased prevalence of mental disorders was found in victims with diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, musculoskeletal, respiratory, and digestive systems. Furthermore, increased incidences of mental disorders were also noticed in connection with injuries, poisonings, and symptoms or signs of infectious diseases. Prevalence of mental disorders in these physical disease categories varied from 25% to 44%. Conclusion: We recommend a greater attention to young people with physical illnesses and other symptoms in the hope that such screening may lead to an early recognition of psychiatric disorders and suicidal tendencies.

AB The aim of the present study was to test whether the seasonal distribution of suicides differed between atopic and non-atopic Suicide victims. A cross-sectional comparison of the semi-annual and seasonal distribution of suicides was made by using a 13-year database of all suicides (1296 males, 289 females) committed during the years 1988-2000 in the province of Oulu in Northern Finland. During the first half of the year, the proportion of suicides among atopic patients was significantly higher than that linked with non-atopic patients. Of all atopic patients, 72% committed suicide during the first and 28% during the second half of the year. Suicides among victims without any atopic disorders followed a uniform seasonal distribution throughout the year (50 vs. 50%). The exacerbation of an atopic disorder may increase the risk of suicide in spring; something that should be taken note of in clinical work. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

   TRENDS
AB Objectives: A marked decline in suicide rates has co-occurred with increased antidepressant sales in several countries but the causal connection between the trends remains debated. Most previous studies have focused on overall suicide rates and neglected differential effects in population subgroups. Our objective was to investigate whether increasing sales of non-tricyclic antidepressants have reduced alcohol-and non-alcohol-related suicide risk in different population subgroups.
   Methods: We followed a nationally representative sample of 950,158 Finnish adults in 1995-2007 for alcohol-related (n = 2,859) and non-alcohol-related (n = 8,632) suicides. We assessed suicide risk by gender and social group according to regional sales of non-tricyclic antidepressants, measured by sold doses per capita, prevalence of antidepressant users, and proportion of antidepressant users with doses reflecting minimally adequate treatment. Fixed-effects Poisson regression models controlled for regional differences and time trends that may influence suicide risk irrespective of antidepressant sales.
   Results: The number of sold antidepressant doses per capita and the prevalence of antidepressant users were unrelated to male suicide risk. However, one percentage point increase in the proportion of antidepressant users receiving minimally adequate treatment reduced non-alcohol-related male suicide risk by one percent (relative risk 0.987, 95% confidence interval 0.976-0.998). This beneficial effect only emerged among men with high education, high income, and employment, among men without a partner, and men not owning their home. Alcohol-related suicides and female suicides were unrelated to all measures of antidepressant sales.
   Conclusion: We found little evidence that increase in overall sales or in the prevalence of non-tricyclic antidepressant users would have caused the fall in suicide rates in Finland in 1995-2007. However, the rise in the proportion of antidepressant users receiving minimally adequate treatment, possibly due to enhanced treatment compliance, may have prevented non-alcohol-related suicides among men.

AB Objective: Physical time-givers may have a modifying effect on the time patterns of death from suicide.
   Method: Data on a total of 1397 suicides in Finland over a year were collected using the method of psychological autopsy. We linked versatile information on each individual to meteorological data adjusted for local weather conditions, and to the universal astronomic data.
   Results: The number of suicides with seasonal mismatch was greater than the expected in the northernmost region of the country (P = 0.03). The northern location was the most significant predictor of such suicides (P = 0.001). They were associated with the changes in ambient temperature during the preceding day (P < 0.00001), the changes to colder preceding suicides in the spring.
   Conclusion: Our findings show that mismatch between the changes in ambient temperature and those in the length of day may precede death from suicide in some individuals.

AB Objective: This study examined the timing of suicide among elderly and middle-aged persons after their final hospitalization and examined characteristics of suicides in relation to the timing of suicide. Methods: Data were examined for Northern Finnish middle-aged (50-64 years, N=370) and elderly (65 years or older, N=194) suicide victims. Suicides were classified by a forensic examiner. Results: Compared with elderly persons whose suicide occurred more than 180 days after hospitalization or who had had no hospitalizations, elderly persons who committed suicide within one week after hospitalization were more likely to have a history of hospital-treated psychiatric and alcohol-related disorders and depression and were more likely to have been given a psychiatric diagnosis at their last hospitalization. Compared with elderly men, elderly women were more likely to commit suicide in the first month after being discharged from the hospital. Conclusions: An increased risk of suicide after hospitalization should be taken into account in the treatment arrangements for elderly persons. (Psychiatric Services 60: 390-393, 2009)

AB Background Seasonal variation in suicidal death has been observed in many countries. In particular, a cyclic variation was found for both men and women in England and Wales in the 1960s and 1970s. Men showed a single 12-month cycle whereas women showed two cycles.
   Aims To re-examine the seasonal variation in suicides in England and Wales for the period 1982-1996.
   Method A harmonic analysis was used to detect the seasonality of the suicide data.
   Results The seasonal effect on suicide is greatly diminished in England and Wales. This is shown by the reduced amplitude and smaller proportion of variance:; accounted for by the season.
   Conclusions The seasonal effect on suicide has either diminished or vanished.

AB This paper investigates, first, the differences in attempted-suicide rates among men and women between urban districts and, second, the association between regional characteristics and attempted-suicide rates. The data cover all attempted suicides referred to healthcare in 1989 and 1997 in Helsinki, Finland. There are clear and persistent differences in the attempted-suicide rates between the studied districts. Although female rates increased in all seven districts from 1989 to 1997, their mutual relationships remain similar. There are more changes among men both within and between the districts. Socio-economic disadvantage within the districts was associated with higher attempted-suicide rates. We conclude that socio-economic characteristics and their changes over time in the districts are likely to affect the suicidal behaviour of men more than women. Improving the employment status and structural position, especially of men, would probably prove to be important for the prevention of attempted suicide.

AB Seasonality is one of the oldest and most resistant-to-elucidation issues in suicide research. However, in recent years epidemiological research has yielded new results, which provide new perspectives on the matter. This qualitative review summarizes research published since the 1990s. In particular, the focus is on studies dealing with the historical change of seasonality, cross-sectional comparisons including method-specific diversity, and the association with weather variables and other putative covariates. Recent research has shown that in Western countries the seasonality of suicide is tending to diminish and may, eventually, disappear. It can no longer be considered a universal and homogeneous phenomenon. In addition, different major seasonal cycles have now been determined which mainly depend on different suicide methods. Just as in the epidemiology of suicide methods, the (seasonal) availability and perceived adequacy of methods emerge as the major driving force beyond the seasonal phenomena in suicide.

AB We examined an association between a history of hospital-treated depression and physical diseases in 1877 suicide victims from Northern Finland. Information on physical diseases and depression of victims was extracted from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Registers. Of suicide victims, 31% of female and 16% of male victims had a lifetime history of depression. When compared with victims without any lifetime hospital-treated physical illnesses, a history of depression was shown to associate with the diseases of the nervous, circulatory, respiratory, and musculoskeletal systems in the group of symptoms and signs, injuries and poisonings, and infectious diseases among male victims. Respectively, in female victims, an increased prevalence of depression was seen in endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases, diseases of the nervous, circulatory, genitourinary, skin and subcutaneous tissue, and musculoskeletal systems, and with injuries and poisonings, pregnancy-related problems and infectious diseases. This study is the first to evaluate comorbidity between physical illnesses and depression over the lifetime in Suicide victims; earlier studies reported Findings in living patients from epidemiological or clinical populations. Since depression can affect quality of life in severely ill patients, targeting depression in patients with chronic illness may assist in decreasing suicide rates. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB The study of websites displaying methods of both physical self-harm and suicide has become an important aspect of deliberate self-injury and suicide research. However, little is known about contextual factors related to entering such sites. Using data from 3,567 respondents aged 15-30 in the US, UK, Germany, and Finland, we found that experiences of victimization are associated with entering pro-self-harm sites and pro-suicide sites. Also, the victimization context had relevance, as online victimization was particularly related to pro-self-harm behavior. The findings suggest a need to organize more specific online support for the victims of violence and online aggression.

TI Support groups:: a psychological or social device for suicide
   bereavement?
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE & COUNSELLING
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper examines the psychological studies of bereavement support groups as well as exploring the ways in which people talk about their participation in such groups after their family member's suicide. Rather than reflecting any universal human condition, talk about experiences is considered as a local and contextual social construction, which in this case takes place in qualitative inter views in the modern West (Finland). The paper draws on a study of 16 inter views with bereaved parents and (adult) children, half of whom had attended a bereavement support group after their family member's suicide. The study makes a contribution to the research field of family suicide bereavement from which sociological analysis has been so far largely missing.

AB Objective. To assess the demographic and psychosocial profiles of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who committed suicide. Two control groups were used: osteoarthritis (OA) and suicide victims with neither RA nor OA.
   Method. A study based on a prospective, 13-yr follow-up database with linkage to national hospital discharge registers of all suicides (1296 males, 289 females) committed during the years 1988-2000 in the province of Oulu situated in northern Finland.
   Results. Females were significantly over-represented among RA patients who committed suicide (52.6% RA women vs 17.3% women with neither RA nor OA). Comorbid depressive disorders preceded suicides in 90% of the female RA patients. Before their suicide, 50% of the female RA patients (vs 11% of the male RA patients) had experienced at least one suicide attempt. The method of suicide was violent in 90% of the RA females. RA males were less often depressive, but committed suicide after experiencing shorter periods of RA and fewer admissions than females.
   Conclusion. Attempted suicides and especially depression in female RA patients should be taken more seriously into account than previously in clinical work so that the most appropriate psychiatric treatment can be provided for such patients.

ID SEASONAL-VARIATION; SEX DIFFERENCE; WEATHER; EXPERIENCE; AUSTRALIA;
   SUNSHINE; BEHAVIOR; FINLAND
AB Background: Seasonality of suicide has been noted in several studies. A spring peak of suicide was observed, and associations between various climatic parameters and suicide have been suggested. This study sets out to verify seasonal patterns of suicide rates and to explore the association with climate in Taiwan.
   Method: The study used a nationwide mortality database in Taiwan from January 1997 to December 2003. An autoregressive integrated moving average model was applied to examine the presence of seasonality and the association of climate with suicidal death.
   Results: Seasonality with a spring peak was evident in suicidal death regardless of gender or age. Ambient temperature was positively associated with suicide after adjustment for trend and seasonality. Limitations: Misclassification and underreporting of suicidal death in the registry system might confound the results. Ecological fallacies might exist.
   Conclusions: The seasonal effect on suicide is significant in Taiwan. Suicide rates may be influenced by ambient temperatures. The findings are of research interest for future studies regarding mechanisms of suicidal behavior, and also of practical interest for better timing of suicide interventions and effective preventive strategies.

DE population; seasons; suicide
ID GEOMAGNETIC-ACTIVITY; MENTAL-DISORDERS; DEPRESSION
AB Background: Suicide has been attributed to social and psychological factors but also to geophysical effects. Of the latter, changes in solar radiation and geomagnetic activities may contribute to the frequency and the seasonal pattern of suicides. Methods: We studied with a population-based, nationwide analysis all the individuals who committed suicide (n=27,469) in Finland during the period of 1979 to 1999. The daily data on the number of suicides, and the mean and maximum levels of geomagnetic activity were compiled and modelled with Poisson regression using the number of inhabitants in each province as the denominator. Time series analysis of monthly numbers of suicides was carried out using a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure. Results: There was a strong seasonal effect on suicide occurrence (P<0.00001), the risk of suicide being greatest in spring. The seasonal effect was most pronounced when the number of suicides was relatively low. High levels of solar radiation activity were associated with the increased risk of suicide (P=0.00001), but the effect of geomagnetic activity was weak. Limitations: No individual data on alcohol consumption or mental disorders were available. Conclusions: Suicide occurrence varies markedly by season and needs attention where prevention is concerned.

ID MORTALITY; MEN; LEVEL
AB Objective: The study was conducted to estimate the association between serum total cholesterol concentration and mortality from suicide, Method: The baseline serum total cholesterol concentration of 37,635 adults was determined in five independent population surveys conducted during 1972-1992 in Finland. Mortality from different causes of death was monitored for a mean of 14.6 years after the survey dates. The means for violent suicides (N=130) included hanging, firearms, cutting, jumping, and unspecified means. The means for nonviolent suicides (N=46) included drug overdose, poisoning with gases, and drowning. Results: Serum total cholesterol concentration was positively related to the risk of violent suicide. Among subjects whose serum total cholesterol concentration was in the highest category, the adjusted relative risk was more than twofold compared with the lowest category. The violent/nonviolent suicide ratio increased linearly with increasing cholesterol category. No association between serum total cholesterol concentration and the risk of nonviolent suicide was found. Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate the positive relationship of high serum total cholesterol concentration with increased risk of violent suicide.

AB Trends in adolescent suicide rates (15-19 years) from 1979 to 1996 were compared with suicide trends in individuals of 20 years and over in 30 countries and with trends in rates of deaths due to undetermined causes in adolescents in 17 countries of the WHO European Region. In 21 of the 30 studied countries, male adolescent suicide rates increased during the study period (highest increases in Belarus, Kazakstan and Ireland) accompanied by far less increases or decreases in suicide rates of males of 20 years and over. Part of the observed increases in Sweden, Ireland and Greece can be attributed to improved suicide statistics, while increases in Finland, Belgium, Bulgaria and the United Kingdom can be even higher due to the rising classification of deaths as "undetermined". In Portugal, decreasing suicide trends seem to be misinterpreted by ignoring the vast increases in rates of undetermined deaths. Female adolescent suicide rates rose less markedly than in males in 18 countries, with the exception of strong increases in Norway, Ireland. Increases in female adolescent suicide rates were marginally affected by changes in classification practices and were accompanied primarily by declining suicide rates in females of 20 years and over.

AB We report an unusual suicide, committed with a common pencil. A 72-year-old male inflicted himself a penetrating thoracic wound while being hospitalized for a hip prosthesis operation. Although the patient was immediately operated, the cardiac injury appeared to be fatal. Cases of suicidal penetrating wounds of the anterior chest wall are rare and they are mostly inflicted by knives, glass fragments, or other sharp instruments. The potential danger of a pencil should be taken into consideration, especially in psychiatric hospitals and imprisonment facilities. We examined the legislation in Italy and Finland concerning the regulation of privacy in special care institutions.

Baseline interviews (n = 104) were carried out during the National Suicide Prevention Project in Finland from 1987 to 1988. Semi-structured follow-up interviews including the 12-item General Health Questionnaire and the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory were carried out ten years later (n = 64, 64% of those still alive). Mental symptoms were reported to have been common after suicide but they had subsided during three years. Mental symptoms had been common especially among children after their parent's suicide. At baseline mothers had had depressive symptoms more often than others, but at follow-up there was no statistical difference. Life changes associated with the suicide were common, and they could be unfavourable as well as favourable. At the time of the follow-up study, half of the interviewees felt that baseline interviews had helped them to adjust to the suicide.

SO LANCET
LA English

   SCHEDULE; RISK; CARE; UNEMPLOYMENT; ASSOCIATION; PREVENTION; DISORDERS
AB Background In many countries, psychiatric services have been reformed by reducing the size of hospitals and developing community mental-health services. We investigated this reform by assessing the relation between suicide risk and different ways of organising rnental-health services.
   Methods We did a nationwide comprehensive survey of Finnish adult mental-health service units between Sept 1, 2004, and March 31, 2005. From health-care or social-care officers of 428 municipalities, we asked for information, classified according to the European service mapping schedule, about adult mental-health services. For each municipality, we measured age-adjusted and sex-adjusted suicide risk, pooled between 2000 and 2004, and then adjusted for register-derived socioeconomic factors.
   Findings A wide variety of outpatient services (relative risk [RR] 0 . 92, 95% CI 0.- 87-0.96), prominence of outpatient versus inpatient services (0 . 93, 0.89-0.97), and 24-h emergency services (0 . 84, 0.75-0.92) were associated with decreased death rates from suicide. However, after adjustment for socioeconomic factors, only the prominence of outpatient services was associated with low suicide rate (0.94, 0.90-0.98). We replicated this finding even after adjustment for organisational changes and inpatient treatment.
   Interpretation Well-developed community mental-health services are associated with lower suicide rates than are services oriented towards inpatient treatment provision. These data are consistent with the idea that population mental health can be improved by use of multifaceted, community-based, specialised mental-health services.

AB The mortality of Female homicidal offenders has scarcely been studied. Our aim was to examine the mortality of homicidal women in Finland using a representative nation-wide material. The data consisted of all 132 women Mho underwent forensic psychiatric examinations after committing homicide or attempted homicide in 1982-1992. We analysed their rate and cause of death during follow-up using standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and the official classification of death. The mean follow-up rime for dead subjects was 7 years (S.D. 4). and for the rest 11 years (S.D. 3). There were 22 observed deaths. the expected value being 1.3 (SMR 17.4). The SMR for unnatural deaths was 226 and for suicides 425. The SMRs for women below 40 years were over 220. In conclusion. homicidal women have an over 200-fold risk of unnatural death, rising to over 400-fold for suicide. This should be taken into consideration in planning discharge programmes for homicidal offenders. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SUICIDES
AB Background Injuries are a major public health problem worldwide, being the leading cause of death in children and adolescents in developed countries. However, knowledge on recent secular trends in injury deaths of adolescents is sparse.
   Methods Using Official Cause-of-Death Statistics of Finland, we examined the nationwide trends in the age-and sex-specific incidence rates of fatal injuries among 10-14-year-old and 15-19-year-old adolescents in Finland between 1971 and 2013.
   Results The incidence rate of fatal injuries decreased considerably in both age groups during the 43-year follow-up period. The decline in injury deaths was mainly due to decreased deaths in traffic accidents. The number of drownings reached the ultimate goal-that is, there were no drownings in Finnish 10-19-year-old adolescents in 2013. The rates of intentional injury deaths remained stable in girls, while in 15-19-year-old boys a decreasing trend was evident. During the deep economic depression in 1990, the incidence of suicide in 15-19-year-old boys was as high as 40.1. At that time, boys' suicide risk was 7.4 times higher than that of girls. Since then, boys' risk for suicide has clearly decreased and was 1.6 times higher than the corresponding risk in girls in 2013.
   Conclusions The incidence rate of fatal injuries decreased considerably in Finnish adolescents during the period 1971-2013. The clearest change occurred in road traffic injuries and drownings. The rates of intentional injury deaths remained unaltered in girls while 15-19-year-old boys showed a decreasing trend.

AB Mortality, especially mortality due to suicides, is higher among patients suffering from schizophrenia than among the general population. Little is known about the factors predicting the mortality of schizophrenia patients, It has also been suggested that mortality among psychiatric patients increases as the number of beds in mental hospitals decreases. These questions were studied in 4338 schizophrenia patients discharged in 1982, 1986, 1990 and 1994 from mental hospitals in Finland. During this period, the number of beds in mental hospitals in Finland decreased from 3.8 to 1.3 per 1000 inhabitants.
   During the three-year follow-up. 226 patients or 5.2% died. There were no statistically significant differences in mortality between the cohorts. The total mortality was higher in males than in females. Age, physical illness and number of hospital days predicted increased mortality due to natural causes. Mortality due to unnatural causes (suicides and accidents) was predicted by number of prescribed psychosedatives, number of hospitalisations and short duration of illness. Mortality due to unnatural causes was higher in the first year after index discharge from hospital.
   The reduction in number of beds in mental hospitals does not seem to be associated with increased mortality in chronic schizophrenia. The high mortality of schizophrenia patients indicates the need for careful medical examinations and treatment of physical illnesses, as well as counselling for a healthy lifestyle. Need for psychosedative medication at discharge from hospital and multiple previous hospitalisations may indicate an increased suicide risk and thus requires special attention. In outpatient treatment, it is important to remember that the risk of unnatural death increases during the first years after discharge from hospital. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B,V.

AB Greenland is the most extreme of human habitats in regard to annual changes in natural light. From being very low, the rate of suicides in Greenland has increased during the past few decades to be among the highest in the world. Several studies have shown seasonality in suicides with spring or summer peaks, but this has not been previously shown in Greenland. Official data from 1968 to 1995 from West Greenland were pooled. A significant seasonality in the 833 suicides was found using Rayleigh's test, a peak in June and a trough in the winter. Suicides increased during the period, and reached high rates in most age groups, up to 577 per 100,000 person-years in men aged 15-24 years in 1990, and up to 147 per 100,000 person-years in women aged 15-24 years in 1995. Violent methods of suicide were used by 93%. Depression has been reported uncommonly. High alcohol intake and extended periods of light in the summer may contribute to impulsive-aggressive summer suicides. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Suicide Seasonality: Complex Demodulation as a Novel Approach in
   Epidemiologic Analysis
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article

AB Background: Seasonality of suicides is well-known and nearly ubiquitous, but recent evidence showed inconsistent patterns of decreasing or increasing seasonality in different countries. Furthermore, strength of seasonality was hypothesized to be associated with suicide prevalence. This study aimed at pointing out methodological difficulties in examining changes in suicide seasonality.
   Methododology/Principal Findings: The present study examines the hypothesis of decreasing seasonality with a superior method that allows continuous modeling of seasonality. Suicides in Austria (1970-2008, N = 67,741) were analyzed with complex demodulation, a local (point-in-time specific) version of harmonic analysis. This avoids the need to arbitrarily split the time series, as is common practice in the field of suicide seasonality research, and facilitates incorporating the association with suicide prevalence. Regression models were used to assess time trends and association of amplitude and absolute suicide numbers. Results showed that strength of seasonality was associated with absolute suicide numbers, and that strength of seasonality was stable during the study period when this association was taken into account.
   Conclusion/Significance: Continuous modeling of suicide seasonality with complex demodulation avoids spurious findings that can result when time series are segmented and analyzed piecewise or when the association with suicide prevalence is disregarded.

TI The challenge of suicide prevention - An overview of national strategies
SO DISEASE MANAGEMENT & HEALTH OUTCOMES

DT Review
AB Suicide is a global phenomenon. It is estimated that 0.5-1.2 million people worldwide die by suicide each year. Taking into account the global epidemiologic data concerning suicide and the economic impact of this phenomenon on diverse societies, this review aims to examine national suicide prevention strategies. Recognition of suicide as an international public health problem, increased reporting by countries on suicide rates to the WHO, and recognition of the costs (associated with suicide) to society have been crucial influences on the establishment of national strategies. Past reviews on national suicide prevention strategies highlight the fact that those countries with established national strategies share a number of themes relating to intervention. These are grounded in international guidance on suicide prevention and accepted epidemiologic and treatment-based research. This paper highlights comparative rates of suicide around the world, explores the economic implications of suicide and the nature of specific established national strategies for prevention. This paper highlights the urgency for the development of national suicide prevention strategies in all countries. Clearly, countries can learn from each other and integrate established, shared themes. It is argued that nations need to move towards nation-specified prevention strategies with effective structures for research, monitoring, and evaluation. This has been seen in countries such as Finland and New Zealand, where strategies have been effective in building inter-agency working and so benefiting different stake-holders.

AB Background: This study investigated attempted suicide trends during a deep economic recession in the 1990s in a well-defined urban catchment area. Methods: The data covered every suicide attempt treated in health care during sample periods in 1989-1997 in Helsinki, Finland. Annual rates were estimated, 3-year moving averages for trends calculated, and significances tested. Results: The overall attempted suicide rate remained stable over the 9-year study period. Against expectations, male rates decreased significantly (P < 0.01), especially among those aged 15-34. There was a convergence of female and male rates, although male rates remained higher. The proportion of poisonings as method increased (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Despite the deep economic recession, with rapidly rising unemployment attempted suicide rates remained unexpectedly stable. The total attempted suicide rate did not increase as might have been anticipated, and the male rate even decreased.

AB A systematic review of the literature on maternal homicide and suicide was performed to understand the causes of pregnancy-associated death. Forty-four studies examined homicide and/or suicide and pregnancy-associated death (defined as the death of a woman, from any cause, while she is pregnant or within 1 year of termination of pregnancy) (1). Of these studies, 747 homicides and 349 suicides were identified. All studies were included except duplicate datasets, case reports of less than 3 events, suicide attempts, unpublished manuscripts, review articles, or non-English studies. Homicide is a leading cause of pregnancy-associated death and suicide is also an important cause of death among pregnant and recently pregnant women. Healthcare providers should understand that homicide is a leading cause of pregnancy-associated death, most commonly as a result of partner violence. Therefore, screening for both partner violence and suicidal ideation are essential components of comprehensive medical care for women during and after pregnancy.

AB Objective: To investigate the outcome of subjects with major depressive disorder after serious suicide attempt and to examine the effect of psychotic symptoms on their outcome.
   Method: The study population included all individuals aged 16 years or older in Finland who were hospitalized with ICD-10 diagnoses of major depressive disorder and attempted suicide from 1996 to 2003 (N = 1,820). The main outcome measures were completed suicides, overall mortality, and repeated suicide attempts during drug treatment versus no treatment.
   Results: During the 4-year follow-up period, 13% of patients died, 6% completed suicide, and 31% made a repeat suicide attempt. Subjects with major depression with psychotic features completed suicide more often than subjects without psychotic features during the follow-up (hazard ratio [HR] 3.32; 95% CI, 1.95-5.67). Antidepressant treatment reduced all-cause mortality by 24% (HR 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56-0.97) but did not reduce suicide mortality (HR 1.06; 95% CI, 0.71-1.58).
   Conclusions: Psychotic symptoms during major depressive episode increase the risk of completed suicide after serious suicide attempt. The quality of treatment for major depression with psychotic features after attempted suicide should be improved to prevent suicide.

   INTEGRATION; CONTEXT; FINLAND; NORWAY
AB Recently, the long observed pattern of a monotonic increase in suicide with age has shifted, often dramatically, because more recent birth cohorts have exhibited much higher suicide rates at younger ages than earlier cohorts have. These changes, however did not occur in all countries. We examine cohort variations in suicide rates in 14 modern, western societies using an extension of the age-period-cohort characteristic model that incorporates hierarchical linear modeling. Results support a general Durkheimian perspective. Birth cohorts experiencing relatively less social integration and regulation, as measured by higher rates of nonmarital births and larger relative cohort size, have higher suicide rates than other cohorts. Societies that provide alternative sources of social integration and regulation, as through collectivist institutions or through greater support for families and children, moderate this tendency. On the other hand, when societies experience rapid social change, the relationship between decreased social integration and regulation and increased suicide rates is stronger especially for males. These results have implications for stemming the increased suicide rates for youth observed in many contemporary societies.

AB Objectives: Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, and disproportionately affects Indigenous populations. Seasonal suicide patterns are variable in the literature, and could offer novel approaches to the timing and focus of prevention efforts if better understood. With a suicide surveillance system in place since 1989, this study offers an unprecedented opportunity to explore seasonal variations in both fatal and non-fatal suicide behavior in an Indigenous Arctic region.
   Study design: Cross-sectional.
   Methods: In this descriptive study, we analyzed data collected from 1990 to 2009 in the rural northwest region of Alaska, both graphically and using the chi-squared test for multinomials.
   Results: We found a significant monthly variation for suicide attempts, with a peak in suicide behavior observed between April and August (P = 0.0002). Monthly variation was more pronounced among individuals <= 29 years of age, and was present in both males and females, although the seasonal pattern differed by sex.
   Conclusions: Our findings of a significant seasonal pattern in suicide behavior, with monthly variation (summer peak) in non-fatal suicide behavior among younger age groups, and among both males and females can assist planners in targeting subpopulations for prevention at different times of the year.

AB South Korea has among the highest rates of suicide in the world, and previous research suggests that suicide frequency increases with anomalously high temperatures, possibly as a result of increased sunshine. However, it is unclear whether this temperature-suicide association exists throughout the entire year. Using distributed lag nonlinear modeling, which effectively controls for nonlinear and delayed effects, we examine temperature-suicide associations for both a warm season (April-September) and a cool season (October-March) for three cities across South Korea: Seoul, Daegu, and Busan. We find consistent, statistically significant, mostly linear relationships between relative risk of suicide and daily temperature in the cool season but few associations in the warm season. This seasonal signal of statistically significant temperature-suicide associations only in the cool season exists among all age segments, but especially for those 35 and older, along with both males and females. We further use distributed lag nonlinear modeling to examine cloud cover-suicide associations and find few significant relationships. This result suggests that that high daily temperatures in the cool season, and not exposure to sun, are responsible for the strong temperature-suicide associations found in South Korea.

AB In Europe, the countries with the highest suicide rates form a so-called J-curve, which starts in Finland and extends down to Slovenia-a country with one of the world's highest suicide rates. So far, the strongest association between suicide and genes has been shown for the serotonergic system. A functional polymorphism 68G > C (Cys23Ser) and a promoter polymorphism-995G > A of serotonin receptor 2C (HTR2C) have already been investigated, but no associations with suicide were determined. In the present study 334 suicide victims and 211 controls of Slovenian origin were genotyped for the above-mentioned polymorphisms using standard methods. In the case of the polymorphism-995G > A no association with suicide was found. However, a significant association was observed between female suicide victims and polymorphism 68G > C. The significance remained when we combined alleles of female and male populations. An excess of GG genotype and allele G was observed. However, no statistically important differences were present when only males were analyzed. Haplotype analysis on female population showed marginal association of haplotype G-C with suicide. The present study speaks for the plausible implication of the HTR2C in suicide susceptibility.

AB Background: The aim was to study the prevalence of, and factors associated with, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among child and adolescent inpatients during hospital treatment. Methods: The target group included all the child and adolescent psychiatric inpatients (n = 504) in Finland on a chosen day. Suicidality was determined by the psychiatrist responsible for the inpatient treatment, using a questionnaire also exploring demographic, diagnostic, and treatment characteristics, as well as traumatic events of the patient. Results: The rate of suicidal ideation was 37.6%, and suicide attempts 10.8%. The factors independently associated with suicidal ideation in multivariate analysis were the following: being affected by open adult sexual behaviour (OR 3.2), having depression (OR 2.5) or conduct disorder (OR 2.4) diagnosis, and manifesting violent acts (OR 2.4). The factors independently associated with suicide attempts were: manifesting violent acts (OR 8.1), having depression diagnosis (OR 5.3), being affected by open adult sexual behaviour (OR 4.9), involuntary treatment (OR 4.7), and being of the female sex (OR 3.7). Suicidal ideation was particularly prevalent among boy patients having conduct disorders, manifesting violent acts, and belonging to the age group under 13 years old. Suicide attempts were particularly prevalent among depressive adolescent girl patients. Limitations: Suicidality was based solely on the clinician's evaluation. Conclusions: Suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are common among child and adolescent psychiatric inpatients. Particular attention should be directed to inpatients who manifest violent acts or have depressive disorder. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fatal alcohol and drug poisonings in Finland during the years 2004-2009 were studied. Cases were divided into those that occurred outside the hospitals (the majority of cases) and those that occurred within the hospitals (the minority of cases). Differences and similarities between the two groups were analysed. The postmortem toxicological investigation of all sudden and unexpected deaths in Finland is centralised at the Department of Forensic Medicine, University of Helsinki. We examined each fatal poisoning separately and verified the cause and place of death as well as the age and sex of the deceased. Fatal poisonings, including suicides, have remained unchanged for many years from the same high level, that is, about 1200 cases annually (22/100,000 inhabitants). The number of patients dying in hospitals due to poisoning has also remained stable (55-70 patients/year). However, the toxic agents involved in such poisonings have changed and deaths due to opioids are now being more numerous. The number of fatal unintentional drug poisonings rose significantly from 191 to 341 (3-6/100,000 inhabitants, p < 0.001) during the study years, and the difference between poisonings caused by drugs or alcohol also changed significantly (p < 0.001). Diminishing substantially, the number of all fatal poisonings will be challenging because of the high percentage of suicides. However, a reduction in unintentional drug overdoses, which are presently on the rise, should be possible.

AB Background Excess mortality among people with schizophrenia due to natural and unnatural causes, especially due to suicides, is a well-known fact. It has been suggested that deinstitutionalization increases suicide mortality but there are also contradictory results. We studied the changes in mortality and causes of death among schizophrenia sufferers during and after the years of deinstitutionalization process in Finland. Method The sample, identified from the Finnish hospital discharge register (FHDR), consisted of patients aged 15-65 and hospitalized for the first time due to schizophrenia. We focused on the 5-year follow-up from inclusion years 1980-1998 (N = 23,959). Changes in 5-year follow-up mortality during the study period were explored for both genders and for different causes of death separately using multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results During the study period 1,926 deaths occurred. Suicide was the major cause of death in both genders. A significant reduction in overall 5-year mortality was observed among persons hospitalized in 1995-1998 when compared to people hospitalized 1980-1984. In males a significant reduction was seen in all mortality (P = 0.025) due to suicides (P = 0.007) but not in the case of natural deaths. In females no significant changes in mortality were found. Conclusion Our study confirms a reduction in suicide mortality of male schizophrenia sufferers after the deinstitutionalization process. However the overall mortality is still very high and the attention needs to be focused on the general well-being of schizophrenia patients.

AB Background: In this study we evaluate differences between rural and urban areas in the causes and incidence of fatal poisonings.
   Methods: Data from all fatal poisonings that occurred in Northern Finland from 2007 to 2011 were retrieved from Cause of Death Registry death certificates provided by Statistics Finland. The demographics and causes of fatalities were compared between rural and urban areas. Incidences were calculated based on the population data.
   Results: There were a total of 684 fatal poisonings during the study period and 57.9% (n = 396) occurred in the urban population. Ethanol was the most common primary poisoning agent in cases of fatal poisoning, accounting for 47.5% of cases in urban areas and 68.1% in rural areas (P < 0.001). Fatal poisonings caused by psychoactive pharmaceutical products and opioids were more common in urban areas (28.3% compared to 18.0%, P < 0.001). The crude incidence of fatal poisonings in the study area was 18.8 (17.4-20.2) per 100,000 inhabitants per year and there was no difference in incidence between urban and rural areas. In the youngest age group (15 to 24 years), the incidence of fatal poisonings observed in urban areas was two times higher than that in rural areas.
   Discussion: Higher rate of fatal ethanol poisonings in rural areas could be linked to higher alcohol consumption in rural areas and also differences in drinking behaviour. Higher incidence of poisoning suicides in urban areas could be due to availability of different toxic agents as a suicidal method. Preventive measures could be key in reducing the number of fatal poisonings in both areas, as most of the fatal poisonings still occur outside hospital.
   Conclusion: There was a higher rate of fatal ethanol poisoning in rural areas and higher rate of fatal poisoning related to psychoactive pharmaceutical products and opioids in urban areas. There were twice as many fatal poisonings in the youngest age group (15-24 years) in urban areas compared to rural areas, and suicide was more common in urban areas.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate differences in characteristics of burn patients who had attempted suicide, as compared with other burn patients admitted to the Helsinki Burn Centre during 1989-97. Burn patients were first drawn from a computerised register, after which a psychiatrist examined their medical records and ascertained the suicide attempters. Of the total of 811 burn patients, 46 (5.7%) had attempted suicide. The median total body surface area (TBSA) of suicide attempters (24.0%) was markedly higher than in the other patients (6.0%, P < 0.001). Flame was a much more common cause of burns among suicide attempters (82.1%) than among the remainder (44.5%. P < 0.001). Suicide attempters were also more often unemployed (28.2 versus 12.9%) or on disability pension (30.8 versus 7.1%) before the injury (P < 0.001). Although the proportion with self-inflicted burns among all burn patients was not high, the markedly higher severity of their burns makes them an important clinical subgroup for further Study.

AB Objective: This study analyzed trends in suicides occurring after a psychiatric hospitalization during more than a decade of significant structural changes in mental health services in Finland-that is, deinstitutionalization, downsizing of inpatient care, and decentralization. Methods: Retrospective register data on completed suicides and psychiatric inpatient treatments were collected for the periods 1985-1991 and 1995-2001, representing service provision before and after significant structural changes. The data were used to produce an estimate for a change in postdischarge suicide risk. Results: In both periods, a fifth of suicide victims had been psychiatrically hospitalized within the preceding year. Among persons hospitalized, the risk of suicide was greater in 1985-1991 than in 1995-2001 for both one week after discharge (risk ratio [RR]=1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]= 1.38-1.62) and one year after discharge (RR=1.25, CI=1.19-1.30). When types of disorders were analyzed separately, the relative risk of suicide one year postdischarge for those hospitalized in the earlier period was greater for patients with schizophrenia (RR=1.26, CI=1.17-1.36) and patients with affective disorders (RR=1.60, CI=1.48-1.73). In parallel with general development of inpatient psychiatric services, in 1995-2001 the inpatient treatment periods preceding suicides were significantly shorter (a mean +/- SD of 45 +/- 340 days in 1995-2001, compared with a mean of 98 +/- 558 days in 1985-1991), the number of individual patients treated in the hospital for schizophrenia spectrum disorders was lower (26% compared with 36%), and the number treated for affective disorders was higher (45% compared with 35%). Conclusions: The restructuring and downsizing of mental health services was not associated with any increase in suicides immediately (one week) or one year postdischarge. Instead, the risk of these suicides decreased significantly between the two time periods among several diagnostic categories. Although the role of psychiatric hospitalization in general may have changed over time, patients who are hospitalized now may be less suicidal after discharge. Our results indicate, in terms of postdischarge suicides, that the downsizing of psychiatric hospitals has been a success. However, there is still a substantial need for better recognition of suicidal risk among psychiatric patients.

AB Although suicide rates among prisoners are high and vary between countries, it is uncertain whether this reflects the importation of risk from the general population or is associated with incarceration rates.
   We collected data on suicides and undetermined deaths in 12 countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, England and Wales, Finland, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, and Sweden) directly from their prison administrations for 2003-2007. These were compared with rates of suicides in the general population separately by gender using Pearson's correlations. In addition, they were compared with rates of incarceration. Linear regression was used to examine any association after adjustment for rates of incarceration.
   Data were collected on 861 suicides in prison, of which 810 were in men. In the men, crude relative rates of suicide were at least three times higher than the general population. Western European countries had similar rates of prisoner suicide which were mostly higher than those in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. There was no association between rates of suicide in prisoners and general population rates or rates of incarceration. In the women, inmate suicide rates varied widely and were mostly raised compared with rates in the general population. In addition, these rates did not appear to be associated with general population rates of suicide.
   Rates of prison suicide do not reflect general population suicide rates, suggesting that variations in prison suicide rates reflect differences in criminal justice systems including, possibly, the provision of psychiatric care in prison.

AB Objective No previous study has comprehensively investigated the pattern of health care contacts among elderly subjects attempting suicide. The present study compared elderly suicide attempters with younger attempters, before and after attempted suicide, in terms of health care contacts, clinical diagnoses of mental disorders, and characteristics predicting lack of treatment contact after the index attempt.
   Methods All consecutive 1198 suicide attempters treated in hospital emergency rooms in Helsinki, Finland, from 15.1.1997 to 14.1.1998 were identified and divided into two age groups: (1) elderly suicide attempters aged 60 years or more (n = 81) and (2) suicide attempters aged under 60 years (n = 1117).
   Results During the final 12 months before the attempt, the majority of elderly suicide attempters had a contact with primary health care, but their mood disorders were likely to have remained undiagnosed before the index attempt. In primary health care, only 4% had been diagnosed with a mood disorder before the attempt, but 57% after (p < 0.001). After the suicide attempt, most elderly suicide attempters were referred for aftercare, two thirds having contact with psychiatric care.
   Conclusions For purposes of preventing suicidal behaviour, screening for depression, plus further education on recognition. diagnosis and treatment of mood disorders among the elderly in primary health care setting are needed. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Background: Season of birth is associated with several psychiatric disorders and suicidal behavior. We explored the association between the season of birth and suicide among schizophrenic and psychotic suicide victims. Methods: The study sample consisted of all suicides in the province of Oulu in Northern Finland from 1989 to 2010. Causes of death were extracted from death certificates, and psychiatric diagnoses associated with the hospital treatments were obtained from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register. The seasons were defined as follows: winter (from November to January), spring (from February to April), summer (from May to July), and autumn (from August to October). Suicide victims (n = 1,902) were categorized as having either schizophrenia (n = 228) or psychosis other than schizophrenia (n = 240). Suicide victims without any hospital-treated mental disorder (n = 1,434) were used as a comparison group. Results: The distribution of births among suicide victims with schizophrenia differed statistically significantly from that observed in the general population, with a peak in summer (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.5). Conclusions: Birth during summer may predispose schizophrenic persons to suicide. The putative roles of serotonin, dopamine, and vitamin D status in the season of birth of psychotic suicide victims are discussed. (C) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB An unequal distribution of suicides over months and seasons has been a consistent finding in epidemiological surveys on suicide. Jails and prisons are a high-risk setting for suicide all over the world. The high prevalence of both outward and self-directed violence in prison populations indicates dysfunctional central serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission and, therefore, could account for an unequal distribution of suicides over months and seasons due to underlying bioclimatic factors. Within a total survey of suicides in the Austrian penitentiary system, the weekly, monthly and seasonal distribution of custodial suicides between 1947 and 1999 was studied. After an explorative comparison of suicide distribution over weekdays, months and seasons of the year by chi(2)-tests, a harmonic Poisson regression model was per-formed to detect seasonality of suicides. No unequal distribution of suicides was evident over the 53-year period. A limitation of this study was its sample size of 412, a low number compared with population-based samples, where a spring suicide peak was consistently found. An explanation for lacking seasonality could be that bioclimatic factors are less relevant in urban, industrialized areas, where jails and prisons usually are located. One of the core characteristics of penal institutions is the limited possibility for communication and social interaction. This social isolation is independent of seasonal changes. If the individual's possibilities for social interactions are limited, the influence of seasonal changes in social activities may be less relevant. This could explain the absence of seasonal changes in custodial suicide incidence. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The presence of psychopathology is a significant predictor of suicidality, and it is possible that the seasonal variation of suicide completion may be related to seasonality in the manifestation of psychiatric disorders common to suicide completers. In the current study, we evaluated 115 French-Canadian male suicide completers from the Greater Montreal Area for DSM-IV psychiatric disorders using proxy-based diagnostic interviews. Subjects were assessed for seasonal differences in the prevalence of DSM-IV psychiatric diagnoses just before their deaths. Diagnoses of major depressive disorder (MDD) without comorbid cluster B personality disorders, and schizophrenia were differently distributed between seasons. Most (63.4%) subjects with MDD committed suicide in the spring/summer (P = .038). However, closer examination revealed that depressed suicides with comorbid cluster B personality disorders did not show seasonality, while 83.3% of depressed suicides without comorbid cluster B personality disorders committed suicide in the spring/summer (P = .019). 87.5% of those suicides with schizophrenia committed suicide in the fall/winter (P = .026), and the only suicide with schizophrenia who died in the spring/summer was also the only one without positive symptomology. Our study is limited to male suicide completers, and results should not be generalized to women. We conclude that seasonal variation in suicide manifests itself differently in patients with different psychopathology. These findings indicate that assessment of suicide risk may need to include consideration of possible seasonal effects, depending on psychopathology. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of seasons on suicides has been suggested repeatedly. In order to reveal a true seasonal pattern, an, appropriate statistical technique, which is sensitive to a specific type of cyclic variation in the data, must be chosen. This study is a review of the use of statistical techniques for seasonality and of some important characteristics of study samples that were evaluated from 46 original suicide seasonality articles published in major psychiatric journals. The results showed that statistical techniques were applied in a majority of articles, but they were commonly lacking regarding analyses, which compared seasonal patterns among subgroups of a population. In recent studies more sophisticated statistical techniques were utilized for seasonality, like spectral analyses, as compared with earlier studies, in which the emphasis was on chi-square tests. Lack of reporting essential features of the data, such as the sample size and monthly values of suicides, were frequent. The calendar effect was adjusted only in 11 studies. Some recommendations concerning the methodological and reporting issues are summarized for future articles on the seasonal affect on suicides.

AB Victims of suicides are frequently known to have suffered from depression and alcohol-related disorders, but whether these disorders exert different impacts on the period of survival following last hospitalizations have remained unknown. We surveyed 1585 suicide victims from northern Finland and assigned them to one of three groups, based on lifetime history of depression, alcobol-related disorders, and both together. We then compared survival times in the three groups. Survival times in depressed alcoholic and non-alcoholic males were significantly shorter than those of males with alcobol-related disorders alone. Depressed but non-alcobolic suicide victims bad more commonly used violent methods, bad less often been under the influence of alcohol, and bad bad more psychotic disorders than the rest. It is apparently important in clinical practice to recognize the increased risk of suicide soon after hospital discharge not only P in depressed patients, but also in those with a history of both depression and alcobol-related disorders.

AB In 1983 Finland became the second country in the world, after Sweden, to adopt a law prohibiting all kinds of physical punishment towards children, also by parents. The present investigation was carried out in 2011, 28 years after the law was adopted. Changes in exposure to various types of physical punishment towards respondents born between 1931 and 1996 are presented. A representative sample from Western Finland, consisting of 4,609 respondents (2,632 females, 1,977 males) between 15 and 80 years, filled in a paper-and-pencil questionnaire. A number of psychosocial concomitants were measured. The results showed a significant drop in reports of being slapped and beaten with an object among respondents who were born after the law was adopted. The decline in physical punishment was associated with a similar decline in the number of murdered children. Respondents who had been exposed to higher amounts of physical punishment than average scored significantly higher on alcohol abuse, depression, mental health problems, and schizotypal personality. Divorced respondents had been significantly more physically punished than others. Respondents who had attempted suicide during the last 12 months had been exposed to physical punishment during childhood significantly more often than those who had not attempted suicide. Aggr.

The results show a significant annual 4% decrease in the number of child homicides, with the main decline being due to a decrease in cases of filicide-suicide among both fathers and mothers. One possible explanation for the decrease may be the increases in the general prescription of antidepressant medication. However, other factors may also have played a significant role in the decline as well.

AB The object of this study was to investigate the attitudes of physicians, nurses and the general public to physician-assisted suicide (PAS), active voluntary euthanasia (AVE) and passive euthanasia (PE) in Finland.
   Respondents received a postal questionnaire to evaluate the acceptability of euthanasia in five scenarios, which were imaginary patient cases. Age, severity of pain and prognosis of the disease were presented as background factors in these scenarios.
   This work was carried out in Finland in 1998.
   The respondents include a random selection of 814 physicians (506 responded, 62%), 800 nurses (582 responded, 68%) and 1000 representatives of the general public (587 responded, 59%).
   Thirty-four percent of the physicians, 46% of the nurses and 50% of the general public agreed that euthanasia would be acceptable in some situations. Of the scenarios, PE was most often considered acceptable in cases of severe dementia (physicians 88%, nurses 79% and general public 64%). In the same scenario, 8% of physicians, 23% of nurses and 48% of general public accepted AVE. In the scenario of an incurable cancer, 20% of the physicians, 34% of the nurses and 42% of the general public accepted PAS. All forms of euthanasia were generally more acceptable in older, than in younger, scenario patients.
   This paper conclude that PE was largely accepted among Finnish medical professionals and the general public. Only a minority favored AVE and PAS.

AB Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common injury sustained by soldiers in war, with rates ranging from 14 to 20% among wounded veterans from both 20(th) and 21(st) century conflicts. To date little is known about the frequency of lethal and nonlethal suicidal behaviours among these veterans. In the only suicide prevalence estimate to date, World War 2 veterans with TB! from Finland had a suicide rate ranging between 70-80 per 100,000, double the rate for the general Finnish population. Turning to suicide risk factors, research to date suggests that factors including sex, injury severity, post-injury psychiatric morbidity and occupational status may modulate the level of suicide risk among veterans with TBI. Suicide prevention efforts can be organised hierarchically, to focus at three levels: Universal interventions (such as suicide screening) that target all veterans with TBI; Selected interventions (such as pharmacotherapy) that target veterans in at-risk groups (e.g., depressed veterans); and Indicated interventions (such as crisis intervention) that target veterans who have displayed suicidal behaviour. The future challenge is to combine research and clinical practice efforts to reduce the overall levels of suicide.

Results: These incidents accounted for 188 child deaths; 69% were under 11 years old, and 58% were killed with a firearm. Approximately 76% of perpetrators were males, and 75% were parents/caregivers. Eighty-one percent of incidents with paternal perpetrators and 59% with maternal perpetrators were preceded by parental discord. Fifty-two percent of incidents with maternal perpetrators were associated with maternal psychiatric problems. Conclusions: Strategies that resolve parental conflicts rationally and facilitate detection and treatment of parental mental conditions might help prevention efforts.

AB Background There are few prospective studies on risk factors for attempted suicide among psychiatric out- and in-patients with major depressive disorder.
   Aims To investigate risk factors for attempted suicide among psychiatric out- and in-patients with major depressive disorder in the city of Vantaa, Finland.
   Method The Vantaa Depression Study included 269 patients with DSM-IV major depressive disorder diagnosed using semi-structured interviews and followed up at 6- and 18-month interviews with a life chart.
   Results During the 18-month follow-up, 8% of the patients attempted suicide. The relative risk of an attempt was 2.50 during partial remission and 7.54 during a major depressive episode, compared with full remission (P < 0.001). Numerous factors were associated with this risk, but lacking a partner, previous suicide attempts and total time spent in major depressive episodes were the most robust predictors.
   Conclusions Suicide attempts among patients with major depressive disorder are strongly associated with the presence and severity of depressive symptoms and predicted by lack of partner, previous suicide attempts and time spent in depression. Reducing the time spent depressed is a credible preventive measure.

AB The aim of this research was to study the role and trend of antidepressant use as a method of suicide in completed self-poisoning suicides in patients with affective disorders during a 23-year follow up period. The data consisted of 483 completed self-poisoning suicides from 1988 to 2011 in the province of Oulu in Northern Finland (286 men and 197 women). Of the self-poisoning victims, 26.9% (n = 130) had hospital-treated unipolar depression and 3.1% (n = 15) hospital-treated bipolar disorder. Further, 53.8% (n=70) of those with unipolar depression and 53.3% (n = 8) of those with bipolar depression died by suicide using antidepressants. During the 23-year follow-up period, the proportion of those using antidepressants doubled among all self-poisoning victims of suicide. A significant decline was observed in the use of tricyclic antidepressants in self-poisoning suicides while a linear increase was found in the use of SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and other antidepressants. During recent years one in five self-poisoning suicides involved the use of antiepileptics. A limitation of our study was that the psychiatric diagnoses only include hospital inpatient episodes. In conclusion, the use of new antidepressants has increased rapidly, but the risk of their use in self-poisoning suicide has perhaps been underestimated.

   MORTALITY; RISK; AGE
AB Alcohol dependence is a risk factor for suicide, and in the general population alcohol consumption and suicide rates are known to be associated. We investigated victims with and without alcohol misuse among unselected completed suicides to explore the role of alcohol misuse in the suicidal process rind final act. In a total 1-year (1987-1988) population of suicides in the National Suicide Prevention Project in Finland, alcohol-misusing and -non-misusing victims were compared. On the basis of informant interviews, 35% (n = 349) of included victims were classified as alcohol misusers and 65% (n = 648) as non-misusers. The misusers were more often younger, male, divorced or separated and had more often worked, but were recently unemployed. They had experienced more often recent adverse life events possibly dependent on their own behaviour, were far more likely to be alcohol-intoxicated at the time of suicide, and tended to die from drug overdose. Several characteristics of these predominantly male alcohol misusers indicated better earlier lifetime psychosocial adjustment compared to the non-misusers, but more adverse life events close to suicide. Alcohol misuse is likely to have a deteriorating influence on the life course of those who eventually succumb to suicide, and its adverse consequences are common in misusers during the final months.

AB Research on the relationship between social integration and suicide rates has neglected a historical perspective. Analyses are often based on relatively short time periods where there may not be enough variation in integration to affect the national suicide rate, or where overall integration levels are not low enough to buttress a link between a specific index of low integration, such as divorce, and suicide. The present investigation contributes to the literature by testing a hypothesis on domestic integration and suicide over a century, the longest period studied to date, encompassing periods of low and high overall social integration, and emergent risk and protective factors. Data are available for core variables for Denmark, 1906-2006. Annual data include those on suicide, and indicators of integration (divorces, births, marriages), as well as for economic strain (unemployment) and time trends. A log linear Poisson model is estimated, which explores the central divorce-suicide relationship under controls for confounders. Controlling for confounders, a one percent increase in divorce increases male suicides by 0.52% and female suicides by 1.12%. As anticipated, marriages decrease suicide: a one percent increase in marriages reduces suicide by 0.77% for men and by 0.63% for women. The trend in divorce, in particular, offers accurate predictions of suicide throughout the century. The relationship between divorce and suicide over a century is robust. The results offer the strongest support to date in support of a social integration model based on long term historical data on suicide and divorce. (C) 2011 Western Social Science Association.

DE Depression; Suicide; Prevention; Korea
ID PREVALENCE
AB The number of Korean people who are currently suffering from depressive disorders that require medical treatment is assumed to be more than 2 million. However, only around 15% of those with depressive disorder are actively receiving medical treatment, and this leads to an increasing suicide rate. Hence, the National Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency held a round-table conference to provide information on depression and suicide and suggested a reasonable policy through comprehensive discussion with experts. The prevalence of depression, which is closely related to suicide rates, is lower in Korea than in the U.S., but the rate of suicide is the highest among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. It is thought that the underestimated prevalence of depression is owing to the inconsistency between the diagnostic criteria of depression and characteristics of depression in Korea. Therefore, it is necessary to develop Korean diagnostic criteria for depression reflecting cultural characteristics and conduct a regular and organized nationwide survey. Moreover, a term related to suicide officially used by Statistics Korea is 'intentional self-injury'. However, in a Korea-based community study, it was found that 60% to 72% of those attempting suicide had mental disorders; thus suicide is not merely an intentional self-injury but a medical condition that should be treated. To reduce suicide, both medical and social approaches are necessary. Furthermore, a strengthening of the public perception that a medical approach is important for suicide prevention is greatly needed. Moreover, it is necessary to prepare an effective national suicide prevention strategy through studies evaluating the suicide prevention policies currently implemented and psychological autopsy of suicide deaths similar to those practiced in Finland.

ID ELDERLY SUICIDE; RISK-FACTORS; PEOPLE; ILLNESS
AB Objective: Suicide rates in persons over 65 have been reported to be higher than those of younger age groups. Since the absolute number of suicides in the elderly is expected to rise, more precise ways to identify potential risk factors for elderly suicides are needed.
   Methods: On the basis of forensic examinations suicide rates and methods in elderly Finns of northern Finland were compared with those of adults aged 18-64 years. Data from earlier illnesses of the suicide victims were scrutinized for records of multiple physical disorders.
   Results: Over the 15-year period the mean annual suicide rate per population of 100 000 was significantly lower in the. elderly (22.5) than adults aged 18-64 years (38.4). A decrease in suicide rates over time occurred in both groups. Suicide methods among elderly were more often violent, and they were seldom under the influence of alcohol. They also had a high prevalence of previous hospital-treated depressive episodes and hospital-treated physical illnesses. A lifetime history of hospital-treated depression was more common among elderly victims who had received hospital treatment for genitourinary diseases, injuries or poisonings after their 50th birthday.
   Conclusions: Our results from elderly suicide victims suggest an association between multiple physical illnesses and a history of depression. Especially, genitourinary diseases as well as hospital treatment due to injuries or poisonings were shown to associate with depression. Elderly Northern Finns showed lower suicide rates, and they decreased during the study period suggesting that active preventive measures against suicide are also feasible in the elderly.

AB Background: Several studies have shown that individuals with a history of suicide attempt form a high-risk mortality group. Completed suicide is the main cause of death among them, but excess mortality for other causes of death is much less studied. Furthermore, little is known whether living with others modifies the excess risk of mortality among suicide attempters. Methods: We evaluated an 11% sample from the population registration data of Finns aged 15 years and older in the period 1988-2007 with an 80% oversample of death records and a linkage with information on causes of hospitalisation. We estimate standardised mortality rates and Poisson regression models separately for the general population and those treated in hospital for suicide attempt. Results: Compared with the general population, all-cause mortality risk was similar to 10-fold among women and well over 10-fold among men during the first 3 months following suicide attempt. The risk for suicide was even greater, but in addition to external causes of death, mortality from smoking-and alcohol-related diseases was elevated. Instead, the proportion of alcohol-associated suicides was smaller among the suicide attempters. Among suicide attempters, the association between living arrangements and mortality was much weaker than in the general population. Conclusion: Premature mortality is extremely high after suicide attempt, especially in the first year. Our results do not support the idea that the resources provided by living with others ameliorate the effects of suicide attempt on subsequent mortality. Suicide prevention should focus on designing adequate aftercare following the attempt, especially for those with alcohol problems.

DE Child; Death; Poisoning
ID CHILDHOOD; TRENDS; ADOLESCENTS
AB Aim:
   Trends in paediatric deaths due to poisoning are little studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the cause and secular trend of poisoning deaths among Finnish children.
   Methods:
   Death certificates of all Finnish children aged 0-15 who died due to poisoning between 1969 and 2003 were obtained from the Statistics of Finland and analysed.
   Results:
   During the study period, altogether 121 children aged 0-15 years died from poisoning in Finland. Among 0- to 4-year olds, the incidence of poisoning deaths declined to practically zero by the beginning of 1980s. Most of these deaths were unintentional poisonings. Among 5- to 15-year olds, the incidence of poisoning deaths varied during the study period. In this age group, up to 53% of the deaths were suicides among girls compared with 20% among boys (p = 0.017). The corresponding figures for substance abuse were 54% among boys and 9% among girls (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion:
   Despite the declining secular trend seen in paediatric poisoning deaths in Finland from 1969 to 2003, the risk of death from both intentional and unintentional poisoning persists in children. Health programmes should be continued especially to promote well-being in families and to prevent teenage suicides and substance abuse.

AB Background. The relationship between smoking and suicide remains controversial.
   Method. A total of 16 282 twin pairs born before 1958 in Finland and alive in 1974 were queried with detailed health and smoking questionnaires in 1975 and 1981, with response rates of 89% and 84%. Smoking status and dose, marital, employment, and socio-economic status, and indicators of psychiatric and somatic illness were assessed at both time points. Emergent psychiatric and medical illness and vital status, including suicide determined by forensic autopsy, were evaluated over 35-year follow-up through government registries. The association between smoking and suicide was determined in competing risks hazard models. In twin pairs discordant for smoking and suicide, the prospective association between smoking and suicide was determined using a matched case-control design.
   Results. Smokers had a higher cumulative suicide incidence than former or never smokers. Heavy smokers had significantly higher suicide risk [hazard ratio (HR) 3.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.31-5.22] than light smokers (HR 2.30, 95% CI 1.61-3.23) (p = 0.017). Compared with never smokers, smokers, but not former smokers, had increased suicide risk (HR 2.56, 95% CI 1.43-4.59), adjusting for depressive symptoms, alcohol and sedative-hypnotic use, and excluding those who developed serious somatic or psychiatric illness. In twin pairs discordant for smoking and suicide, suicide was more likely in smokers [odds ratio (OR) 6.0, 95% CI 2.06-23.8].
   Conclusions. Adults who smoked tobacco were more likely to die by suicide, with a large, dose-dependent effect. This effect remained after consideration of many known predictors of suicide and shared familial effects, consistent with the hypothesis that exposure to tobacco smoke increases the risk of suicide.

AB The pattern of geographic variation in European suicide rates in the high-risk group of individuals aged 65 years and over was investigated, in order to provide a further test of the Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis, i.e. the assumption that genetic differences between populations may partially account for spatial differences seen in the suicide prevalence. National suicide rates (average of 1970-2002) of the elderly from 34 European countries were regressed on geographic position terms, i.e. capital cities' latitude and longitude, along with transformations (e.g. squared latitude) and interaction terms (e.g. latitude multiplied with longitude) of these, which statistically modeled various possible geographic gradients in the suicide rates. In these regression models, the strongest and statistically significant predictor of elderly suicide rates was an interaction term of squared latitude multiplied with longitude, indicating that suicide rates increased to the northeast. This accounted for 13.8% (total), 20.8% (males) and 11.6% (females) of the cross-national variance in elderly suicide rates. No further geographic position term accounted for a significant increment of further variance in suicide rates over and above this predictor. Controls for national quality of living conditions and alcohol consumption rates left these results essentially unchanged. Replicating previous evidence based on suicide rates of the general population, suicide rates of the elderly show a northeastern gradient across Europe. This J-shaped belt of high-suicide-rate countries spans from Central Europe (Austria, Hungary and Slovenia) to Northeastern Europe (Finland and the Baltic countries). There are early historical and genetic communalities among the populations inhabiting this area, but, in terms of culture, recent history, political systems and socioeconomic factors, there is great diversity between these countries. The current findings thus add to cumulated empirical evidence consistent with the Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis.

AB Some studies suggest seasonality of suicide attempts in females, but not in males. The reasons for this gender difference remain unclear. Only few studies addressed the question whether gender differences in seasonality of suicide attempts reflect gender differences in the choice of method for suicide attempts, with inconsistent results. So, this study aimed to analyze the association of gender with seasonality in suicide attempts by persons living in two Northern Bavarian regions [city of Nuremberg (480,000 inhabitants) and region of Wuerzburg (270,000 inhabitants)] between 2000 and 2004. We addressed this question by focussing on the frequency of suicide attempts in relation to the seasons. The sample consisted of 2,269 suicide attempters (882 males and 1,387 females). The overall seasonality was assessed using the chi(2) test for multinomials. Moreover, the ratio of observed to expected number of suicide attempts (OER) with 95% confidence intervals within each season was calculated. As a result, overall distribution of suicide attempts differed significantly between seasons for women (chi(2) = 9.19, df = 3, P = 0.03), but not for men. Female suicide attempts showed a trough in the spring (decline compared to the expected value by 10%; OER = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.8-1.0). This trough was restricted to female low-risk suicide attempts (decline by 13%; OER = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.77-0.98). No seasonality was found for men. Seasonality of high-risk methods was more pronounced than that of low-risk methods; however, no significant gender differences were found concerning this aspect. The overall distribution of the sub-types of suicidal acts (parasuicidal gestures, suicidal pauses, suicide attempts in the strict sense) showed seasonality neither for males nor for females. Whereas seasonality was absent in male suicide attempters, the frequency of low-risk suicide attempts in females was 13.1% lower than expected in the spring.

AB Background The suicide rate is a macro indicator of the population's psychosocial wellbeing and an evaluation criterion of the effectiveness of suicide prevention strategies. A high level of injury deaths of undetermined intent (UD) is usually discussed in connection with the validity of suicide statistics. An effort is made to develop a criterion to characterise the quality of suicide statistics.
   Methods Standardised rates of suicides (X60-X84) and UD (Y10-Y34) by the International Classification of Disease version 10 as an average for the past five available years were taken from the WHO European mortality database. Rate ratios were computed by dividing rates of UD by suicide rates.
   Results There is considerable variation in suicide and UD rates among countries. The highest overall rates of UD were registered in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, and the lowest in Greece, Spain and Italy. The EU-15 average UD rate of 1.97 and the rate ratio of 0.194 UD to suicides were combined into a '2-20 benchmark', in which the primary indicator is 2.0 UD cases per 100 000 and the secondary indicator is the proportion of UD to suicides 0.20 (20%), which enables countries to be clustered according to the quality of suicide statistics. The following countries satisfied the benchmark: Greece, Norway, Spain, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Austria, Italy, Romania, Hungary, Ireland and Finland.
   Conclusion This study used the developed '2-20 benchmark' in Europe to assess suicide registration quality in a particular country, to compare the relative position of countries, and to set a target for those European countries that have not yet achieved the benchmark.

AB Background: suicide is a problem with world impact and the leading cause of premature deaths. The study of its distribution over time can bring a changed understanding of parameters attributed to, and the prevention of, suicide.
   Aim: to identify the temporal pattern of suicide by systematic review.
   Methods: Pubmed (Medline), LILACS, Virtual Health Library (VHL), Science Direct and Scopus (Elsevier), Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) and PsyNET (APA) were searched, using suicide-related descriptors and terms, for observational epidemiological studies of the temporal distribution of suicide. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42016038470).
   Limitations: The lack of uniformity in reporting or standardisation of methodology in the studies selected, hindered comparison of populations with similar socioeconomic and cultural profiles, considerably limiting the scope of the results of this review.
   Results: forty-five studies from 26 different countries were included in this review. Clear seasonal patterns were observed by day of the week, month, season and age-period-cohort effects. Few studies studied by trend, time of day or day of the month.
   Conclusion: the review findings provide further evidence of substantial temporal patterns influenced by geographic, climatic and social conditions.

AB Biobehavioral dispositions can serve as valuable referents for biologically oriented research on core processes with relevance to many psychiatric conditions. The present study examined two such dispositional variables weak response inhibition (or disinhibition; INH-) and threat sensitivity (or fearfulness; THT+) as predictors of the serious transdiagnostic problem of suicide risk in two samples: male and female outpatients from a U.S. clinic (N=1078), and a population-based male military cohort from Finland (N=3855). INH- and THT+ were operationalized through scores on scale measures of disinhibition and fear/fearlessness, known to be related to DSM-defined clinical conditions and brain biomarkers. Suicide risk was assessed by clinician ratings (clinic sample) and questionnaires (both samples). Across samples and alternative suicide indices, INH- and THT+ each contributed uniquely to prediction of suicide risk beyond internalizing and externalizing problems in the case of the clinic sample where diagnostic data were available. Further, in both samples, INH- and THT+ interactively predicted suicide risk, with individuals scoring concurrently high on both dispositions exhibiting markedly augmented risk. Findings demonstrate that dispositional constructs of INH- and THT+ are predictive of suicide risk, and hold potential as referents for biological research on suicidal behavior.

AB Background: Over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics are frequently used in suicide attempts. Accessibility, toxicity, and unsupervised acquisition of large amounts may be facilitators. Aims: To identify patient characteristics associated with OTC drug use as a suicide attempt method among adults. "Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted using chart review of all individuals who presented to the emergency department (ED) of two adult general hospitals following a suicide attempt during 2009-2010 in Montreal, Canada. Results: Among the 369 suicide attempters identified, 181 used overdosing, 47% of whom used OTC drugs. In logistic regression, women and those with medical comorbidity were more likely to use overdosing, while those with substance use disorders were less likely to do so. Among those who overdosed, women were more likely to use OTC drugs, while those who were Caucasian, had children, comorbidities, diagnoses with substance use disorders, and made attempts in the Fall were less likely to do so. Substances most frequently used were: acetaminophen among OTC drugs (30%); antidepressants (37%), anxiolytics (30%), opioids (10%), and anticonvulsants (9%) among prescription drugs; and cocaine (10%) among recreational drugs. Limitations: Reasons for the suicide method choice were not available. Conclusion: OTC drugs, in particular acetaminophen, are frequently used in suicide attempts. Accessibility to these drugs may be an important contributor.

AB Background: There are an estimated one million completed suicides per year worldwide. As a response to increasing concern about suicide within Europe, the EUROSAVE (European Review of Suicide and Violence Epidemiology) study was undertaken to examine recent trends in the epidemiology of suicide and self-inflicted injury mortality in the European Union (EU). Methods: Suicide and self-inflicted injury mortality data for the 15 EU countries for the years,1984-1998 were obtained from the World Health Organisation (WHO), the European Statistical Office of the European Commission (EUROSTAT) and national statistical agencies. Data were also obtained for a second group of deaths classified as 'undetermined' or 'other violence'. Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated and examined for trends over time. Results: Finland had the highest suicide rate, while Greece had the lowest for the latest available year (1997). Age-standardized suicide rates tended to be lowest in the Mediterranean countries. Significant downward linear time trends in suicide,mortality were observed in most countries, although rates varied markedly between countries. Both Ireland and Spain displayed significant upward linear trends in suicide mortality. Portugal had the highest rate of undetermined deaths-both in 1984 and 1998 while Greece had the lowest in both 1984 and 1997. Five countries (including Ireland and Spain) showed significant downward trends in deaths due to undetermined causes whereas Belgium and Germany showed borderline significant upward linear trends in deaths due to undetermined causes. Conclusions: Although suicide rates in most countries seem to be decreasing, the validity of the data is uncertain. Misclassification may contribute to the geographical and temporal variation in suicide rates in some EU countries but it does not explain the phenomenon. More detailed research comparing suicide-recording procedures and practices across the EU is required. In the absence of adequate EU wide data on suicide epidemiology, effective prevention of this distressing phenomenon is likely to remain elusive.

AB Background: Our knowledge of the influence of place of birth and socioeconomic status on attempted suicide in a defined national population is limited.
   Methods: The study population at baseline in 1993 included approximately 4.5 million Swedish persons aged 25 to 64 years, of whom 5 70 000 had been born abroad. Each individual was tracked until attempted suicide, remigration, death, or the end of the study on December 31, 1998. The Cox regression was used in the analysis.
   Results: Labor migrants from Finland and other OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries and refugees from Poland and Iran had higher hazard ratios of attempted suicide than Swedish-born control subjects. Women born in Latin America, Asia, and Eastern Europe had significantly higher hazard ratios of attempted suicide than Swedish-born women. In contrast, men born in southern Europe and Asia had significantly lower hazard ratios of attempted suicide. The hazard ratios of attempted suicide among women from Iran, Asia, southern Europe, Latin America, and eastern Europe considerably exceeded those of men from the same country of origin. When socioeconomic status was included in the final model, the hazard ratios remained high for women, while the risk of attempted suicide among men declined sharply with increased income.
   Conclusions: Place of birth, socioeconomic status, and sex are associated with attempted suicide. Socioeconomic status explains only part of the association between place of birth and attempted suicide.

AB ObjectiveTo analyse mortality and life expectancy in people with alcohol use disorder in Denmark, Finland and Sweden.
   MethodA population-based register study including all patients admitted to hospital diagnosed with alcohol use disorder (1158486 person-years) from 1987 to 2006 in Denmark, Finland and Sweden.
   ResultsLife expectancy was 24-28years shorter in people with alcohol use disorder than in the general population. From 1987 to 2006, the difference in life expectancy between patients with alcohol use disorder and the general population increased in men (Denmark, 1.8years; Finland, 2.6years; Sweden, 1.0years); in women, the difference in life expectancy increased in Denmark (0.3years) but decreased in Finland (-0.8years) and Sweden (-1.8years). People with alcohol use disorder had higher mortality from all causes of death (mortality rate ratio, 3.0-5.2), all diseases and medical conditions (2.3-4.8), and suicide (9.3-35.9).
   ConclusionPeople hospitalized with alcohol use disorder have an average life expectancy of 47-53years (men) and 50-58years (women) and die 24-28years earlier than people in the general population.

   METAANALYSIS; LONGITUDE; LATITUDE
AB There is now convergent evidence from classic quantitative genetics (family, twin, and adoption studies) and molecular genetic studies for specific genetic risk factors for suicidal behavior. This emerging research field has recently been supplemented by geographical studies concerned with the Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis (FUSH), which states that population differences in genetic risk factors may partially account for conspicuous geographical patterns seen in suicide prevalence. In particular, the European high-suicide-rate nations constitute a contiguous, J-shaped belt, spanning from Finland to Austria. This area maps onto the second principal component identified for European gene distribution, most likely reflecting a major migration event of the past (i.e., the ancestral adaptation to cold climates and the Uralic language dispersion) still detectable in modern European populations. The present research tested the hypothesis in the United States. Consistent with the hypothesis, available historical (1913-1924 and 1928-1932) U.S. state suicide rates were uniformly positively associated with available state proportions of reported American ancestries from European high-suicide-rate countries (Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, and the Ukraine). However, contrary to the hypothesis, available contemporary (1990-1994) suicide rates were uniformly negatively associated with these ancestry proportions. The findings of this first test outside Europe are therefore conflicting. A proposal based on the geographical study approach is offered to further the progress of investigations into the genetics of suicide.

AB Objective: Road traffic suicides typically involve a passenger car driver crashing his or her vehicle into a heavy vehicle, because death is almost certain due to the large mass difference between these vehicles. For the same reason, heavy-vehicle drivers typically suffer minor injuries, if any, and have thus received little attention in the research literature. In this study, we focused on heavy-vehicle drivers who were involved as the second party in road suicides in Finland. Methods: We analyzed 138 road suicides (2011-2016) involving a passenger car crashing into a heavy vehicle. We used in-depth road crash investigation data from the Finnish Crash Data Institute. Results: The results showed that all but 2 crashes were head-on collisions. Almost 30% of truck drivers were injured, but only a few suffered serious injuries. More than a quarter reported sick leave following their crash. Injury insurance compensation to heavy-vehicle drivers was just above euro9,000 on average. Material damage to heavy vehicles was significant, with average insurance compensation paid being euro70,500. Three out of 4 truck drivers reported that drivers committing suicide acted abruptly and left them little opportunity for preventive action. Conclusions: Suicides by crashing into heavy vehicles can have an impact on drivers' well-being; however, it is difficult to see how heavy-vehicle drivers could avoid a suicide attempt involving their vehicle.

AB Aims: The purpose of this Study was to investigate what Suicide prevention means in terms of practical interventions. Another Purpose was to assess the feasibility of a previously developed theoretical model for analysing suicide prevention (1 3). Methods: The data consisted of plans for action provided by professionals from five fields (n = 173) (psychologists [n = 41]. clergy [n = 37], nurses [n = 34], social workers [n = 32], and physicians [n = 29]) as responses to an inquiry within the National Suicide Prevention Project in Finland. The plans were operationally described and theoretically interpreted using the model. Results: The analysis indicated that practice patterns were more or less similar irrespective of the focus of suicide prevention. Neither did clear sectoral or professional profiles of practice appear, Clinical topics, individually focused interventions and curative strategies constituted the main approach. Interventions focused mainly on risk factors, the priorities being life crises, acute risk of suicide, coping of survivors, and a suicide attempt. The bulk of the strategies were aimed at developing professional interventions and skills. Conclusions: The model proved to be a feasible tool for differentiating and theoretically interpreting suicide-prevention approaches. The paradigm adopted by the sectors was versatile and comprehensive: the activities were multifocused. till aims of prevention and locations of intervention were included. and a common set of interventions - a "multimethod approach" - was applied. The adoption of the idea of risk as well as of protective factors can lie interpreted its reflecting a process theory of suicide development.

   crashes; survey; heavy vehicles or trucks
AB Objective: Every profession has its own safety and health risks. In addition to the risk of being involved in a "normal" road crash, professional heavy vehicle drivers are at risk of becoming victims of people attempting suicide by crashing into their vehicles. Road suicides are not that rare, at least not in Finland, where they represent about 12% of all fatal road crashes. The purpose of this study was to survey professional heavy vehicle drivers about their experiences, views and opinions regarding road suicides. Methods: The sample included heavy vehicle drivers (N = 863) randomly recruited from a transport workers' union. Results: About 18% of the respondents reported a suspected suicide attempt of a motor vehicle driver crashing into their vehicle, with 15% of these (i.e.2.8% of the whole sample) also reporting a resulting crash. More than half of the respondents reported personally knowing another professional driver who had experienced a crash caused by a suicidal driver. Almost 80% of the drivers reported being afraid that someone would attempt suicide by crashing into their vehicle; however, thinking about such a possibility produces a level of anxiety in less than half of all respondents. Most respondents agreed about the challenges of avoiding a crash if somebody deliberately drives their car towards their vehicle. Conclusion: Heavy vehicle drivers perceive road suicides as an occupational risk in their profession. We discuss possible preventive measures against suicide attempts by crashing into a heavy vehicle.

The searches revealed 4139 references from the databases. The references were filtered and 32 peer-reviewed research articles revealed in years 2004-2014 were selected as data. The articles were analysed using inductive content analysis, by finding all possible background factors related to homicide. Results: The factors were described as percentages of the range. The background factors of familicide perpetrators were categorised as follows: perpetrators who had committed homicide of a child and intimate partner and possibly committed suicide; a father had who killed a child; a mother who had killed a child; a father who had committed a filicide-suicide; and a mother who had committed a filicide-suicide. Conclusions: Psychological instability, violence and crime were found in all these categories of familicides. Perpetrators who had committed a suicide in addition to the familicide had more often been diagnosed with depression, but they sought treatment for mental health problems less often and had violence and self-destructiveness less often in their background than in other familicide categories. Social and healthcare professionals should be more sensitive to emerging family problems and be prepared for intervention.

AB Purpose Mortality among schizophrenia patients is substantially higher than in the general population. The aim of this study was to investigate, in a nationwide cohort of suicidal schizophrenic individuals, how the risks of suicide, severe suicide attempts and death are associated with usage of antidepressant or antipsychotic treatment.
   Methods The study population included all individuals in Finland who were hospitalised with a diagnosis of attempted suicide between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2003, who also had at least one hospitalisation due to schizophrenia diagnosis (ICD-10 F20), and were at least 16 years old when the index hospitalisation began. Cox's proportional hazards modelling and Bayesian intensity estimation were used in the analysis.
   Results There were 1611 patients with a mean follow-up time of 4.3 years. Current use of antipsychotics was associated with decreased mortality due to suicide (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.34-0.81, p=0.004), but no significant decrease in mortality was observed during current use of antidepressants (0.66, 0.41-1.08, p=0.099), when compared to past use. In more detailed analysis when current users were compared to non-users, olanzapine, and mixed use of antipsychotics, were associated with reduced all-cause mortality, and mixed use also with reduced risk of suicide mortality. Current use of citalopram was associated with decreased all-cause and suicide mortality.
   Conclusions In a population of suicidal schizophrenic individuals antipsychotic medication, treatment was associated with lower mortality from suicide and all-causes. Antidepressive medication was associated with lower all-cause mortality when used in combination with antipsychotics. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Objective: This study examined the association between the dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids and low mood, major depression, and suicide.
   Method: A total of 29,133 men ages 50 to 69 years participated in a population-based trial in Finland. The intake of fatty acids and fish consumption were calculated from a diet history questionnaire. Self-reported depressed mood was recorded three times annually, data on hospital treatments due to a major depressive disorder were derived from the National Hospital Discharge Register, and suicides were identified from death certificates.
   Results: There were no associations between the dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids or fish consumption and depressed mood, major depressive episodes, or suicide.
   Conclusions: Dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids showed no association with low mood level.

ID UNITED-STATES; TRENDS
AB The purpose of our study was to examine the nationwide trends in the age- and sex-specific incidence rates of fatal injuries among 10-19-year-old adolescents in Finland, a country with a welt-defined white population of 5.2 million. A population- based study was based on Official Cause-of-Death Statistics of Finland. We included adolescents aged 10-19 years who died because of an injury in 1971-2002. During the study period, the incidence of injury-related deaths declined considerably, from 43.0 (per 100,000 persons) (95% confidence interval (0): 38.5, 47.5) in 1971 to 19.9 (95% CI: 16.5, 23.4) in 2002 (p < 0.001). The decrease was seen in both genders. The decline in injury deaths was mainly due to decrease of deaths in traffic accidents. A sharp peak in boys' suicides was found during economic depression. To sum up, the incidence of adolescent injury deaths declined considerably in Finland between 1971 and 2002. The reasons for this positive development are probably multifactorial, including improvements in traffic safety and emergency services. The trend in intentional deaths showed no change during the 32-year study period and therefore prevention of adolescent violence and suicides should also receive attention. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective Higher prevalence of suicide notes could signify more conservatism in accounting and greater proneness to undercounting of suicide by method. We tested two hypotheses: (1) an evidentiary suicide note is more likely to accompany suicides by drug-intoxication and by other poisoning, as less violent and less forensically overt methods, than suicides by firearm and hanging/suffocation; and (2) performance of a forensic autopsy attenuates any observed association between overtness of method and the reported presence of a note.
   Methods This multilevel (individual/county), multivariable analysis employed a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Representing the 17 states participating in the United States National Violent Death Reporting System throughout 2011-2013, the study population comprised registered suicides, aged 15 years and older. Decedents totaled 32,151. The outcome measure was relative odds of an authenticated suicide note.
   Results An authenticated suicide note was documented in 31% of the suicide cases. Inspection of the full multivariable model showed a suicide note was more likely to manifest among drug intoxication (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.70; 95% CI, 1.56, 1.85) and other poisoning suicides (OR, 2.12; 1.85, 2.42) than firearm suicides, the referent. Respective excesses were larger when there was no autopsy or autopsy status was unknown (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.61, 2.14) and (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.86, 2.72) relative to the comparisons with a forensic autopsy (OR, 1.62, 95% CI, 1.45, 1.82 and OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.66, 2.43). Hanging/suffocation suicides did not differ from the firearm referent given an autopsy.
   Conclusions Suicide requires substantial affirmative evidence to establish manner of death, and affirmation of drug intoxication suicides appears to demand an especially high burden of proof. Findings and their implications argue for more stringent investigative standards, better training, and more resources to support comprehensive and accurate case ascertainment, as the foundation for developing evidence-based suicide prevention initiatives.

AB Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in late adolescence and adulthood is associated with a higher risk of suicide; however, it is unknown whether this association is also present in people who sustained a TBI during childhood. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether experiencing a TBI during childhood is a risk factor for suicide later in life and to examine whether the risk of suicide differs by sex or injury severity. A cohort of 135,703 children aged 0-17 years was identified from the Quebec population-based physician reimbursement database in 1987, and follow-up was conducted until 2008. Of the children in this cohort, 21,047 had sustained a TBI. Using a survival analysis with time-dependent indicators of TBI, we found a higher risk of suicide for people who sustained a TBI during childhood (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.49, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 2.14), adolescence (HR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.26), and adulthood (HR = 2.53, 95% CI: 1.79, 3.59). When compared with less severe injuries, such as concussions and cranial fractures, more severe injuries, such as intracranial hemorrhages, were associated with a higher risk of suicide (HR = 2.18 vs. 2.77, respectively). Repeated injuries were associated with higher risks of suicide in all age groups.

LA English
DT Article

AB Background Seasonality in youth suicide has been speculated to be associated with the school calendar, as it tends to increase at the beginning of the academic year or after a long break, but robust empirical evidence remains scarce.
   Methods We examined the nationwide death records in the Vital Statistics of Japan to investigate the seasonal patterns of suicide among youth. Our data set included 108 968 suicides by individuals who died at 6-26 years of age between 1974 and 2014 in Japan. The daily frequencies of death were plotted against the Japanese school calendar, which has little regional and temporal variations. We also estimated a Poisson regression model to uncover the cyclical patterns of suicide deaths.
   Results We found that the frequencies of suicide by middle school students (ages 12-15 years) and high school students (ages 15-18 years) sharply increased around the dates when a school session began in April and September. These tended to be low during school breaks. The results of regression analysis suggested middle school students were more than twice as likely to die by suicide when the summer break ended and the second semester began, compared with the baseline week in July. Similarly, the frequency of suicide for high school students also increased by similar to 40% at the end of the summer break. Importantly, no such pattern was found for those aged 18-26 years.
   Conclusions Our findings strongly indicate that the cyclical pattern of youth suicide is closely related to the school calendar.

AB Background: Only few studies have been carried out on the relationship between pregnancy and deaths from external causes.
   Methods: Information on deaths from external causes among women aged 15 - 49 years in Finland in 1987 - 2000 ( n= 5299) was linked to three national health registers to identify pregnancy- associated deaths ( n= 212).
   Results: The mortality rate for women during pregnancy and within 1 year of pregnancy termination from external causes was lower than mortality from external causes among non- pregnant women ( relative risk 0.79; 95% confidence interval 0.69 - 0.91). Owing to elevated suicide and homicide rates, however, an increased risk was observed for women after abortions, especially in the age group of 15 - 24 years.
   Conclusions: The low rate of deaths from external causes suggests the protective effect of childbirth, but the elevated risk after a terminated pregnancy needs to be recognized in the provision of health care and social services.

AB Study Objectives: To examine the relationship between the frequency of nightmares and the risk of suicide.
   Design and Setting: A prospective follow-up study in a general population of Finland starting in 1972.
   Participants: A total of 36,211 subjects (17,700 men and 18,511 women) aged 25-64 years at baseline.
   Interventions: N/A
   Measurements: The study included self-administered questionnaires (mainly questions on socio-economic factors, medical history, health behavior, and psychosocial factors) and health examination at the local primary healthcare center. The frequency of nightmares was estimated. The subjects were followed until Dec. 31, 1995, or death. Information on deaths caused by suicide (n=159) or other self-inflicted injury was obtained from the National Death Register by computerized record linkage using the national personal identification code assigned to every Finnish resident. Using the Cox proportional hazards regression model we controlled for several potential confounding factors.
   Results: The frequency of nightmares was directly related to the risk of suicide. Among subjects having nightmares occasionally the adjusted relative risk of suicide was 57% higher, and among those reporting frequent nightmares 105% higher compared with subjects reporting no nightmares at all.
   Conclusions: This is the first study to report a direct and graded association between the frequency of nightmares and death from suicide in a general population.

AB Background: The relationship between family background and mortality of offspring was studied by using a prospectively collected, general population, birth cohort database (n=11,017), that is the Northern Finland 1966 birth cohort which is linked with the national death register. Methods: A logistic regression analysis was performed in order to examine the association between family background and death of offspring (between ages 16 and 28 years). Results: It was revealed that 117 subjects (90 males and 27 females) from the original birth cohort had died. The majority of the deaths were due to unnatural causes in both sexes (79%). After adjusting for confounders (psychiatric diagnosis and parental social class), the results indicated that the general mortality risk for males with a single-parent family background was significantly increased compared with males from a two-parent family background (odds ratio 1.8 and 95% confidence interval: 1.1-2.9). The risk of committing suicide was significantly increased among young adult males with a single-parent family background (OR 2.5 and 95% Cl: 1.1-5.8). Conclusion: Our finding calls for health care professionals to provide more preventative mental health support for children and adolescents living in broken homes.

AB A search was undertaken at Forensic Science South Australia (FSSA) for all cases of suicide registered in South Australia, Australia, over a 10-year period from January 2003 to December 2012. More recent data was not accessioned as not all contemporary cases may have been completed or formally registered. The data were compared to corresponding numbers on two national registers: the National Coronial Information System (NCIS) and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). A total of 2105 cases of suicide were registered at FSSA, with a death rate of 13.3/100,000 population. NCIS data were available from 2003 to 2010, with 1542 suicides recorded (12.3/100,000 population). ABS data were available from 2003 to 2011, with 1366 deaths coded as suicides (12.4/100,000 population). Significant differences were found between local data on suicides and related data accrued nationally from the same population, with only 67.8% of local drug overdoses recorded on the NCIS. Although this represents an Australian-based study the conclusions have global applications. Thus, given the likely accuracy of local data, reliance on smaller, community-specific datasets in any country/jurisdiction may be of far greater use in analyzing and monitoring such complex cases.

DE suicide prevention; prevention theory; model for analysis
AB This prospective follow-up study monitored the evolution of psychologists' conceptions of suicide prevention over the course of their participation in psychological autopsy studies that constituted the first phase of the National Suicide Prevention Project in Finland. Another purpose of the study was to consider the feasibility of an earlier suicide prevention model. Ideas on prevention were compared in two different situations and items were categorized using descriptive and conceptual criteria of prevention. They could be classified into a typology of four categories: care approach, cultural-educational approach, conditions approach, and critical approach. The follow-up suggested that the model is a feasible method for analysing conceptions of suicide prevention, and that it was possible to interpret conceptions in a theoretically adequate manner. In addition, ideas could be compared with certain known theoretical models of prevention. The model could thus be used in further research and for practical purposes. Experiences of psychological autopsy studies definitely had an impact on the psychologists' views: conceptions altered towards emphasizing the care approach and individual risk factors. Nonetheless, the overall structure of the prevention paradigm remained multifactorial, stressing multistage influencing. Surprisingly, the priority of acute suicide risk as a preventive target did not increase. Promotive aims remained the most important aim category. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Context: To our knowledge, no prospective, population-based study in existence examines predictive associations between early or middle childhood psychopathologic disorders and later completed suicides.
   Objective: To study predictive associations between childhood psychopathologic disorders at the age of 8 years and later completed suicides and severe suicide attempts.
   Design: Birth cohort study of individuals 8 to 24 years old.
   Setting: Finland.
   Participants: The sample includes 5302 Finnish people born in 1981 who were examined at the age of 8 years to gather information about psychopathologic conditions, school performance, and family demographics from parents, teachers, and children.
   Main Outcome Measures: National register-based lifetime information about completed suicides and suicide attempts that prompted hospital admission.
   Results: Of all 24 deaths among males between 8 and 24 years of age, 13 were suicides, whereas of 16 deaths among females, only 2 were suicides. Fifty-four males and females (1%) had either completed suicide or made a serious suicide attempt, defined as a suicide attempt that prompted hospital admission. Of 27 males with completed or serious suicide attempts, 78% screened positive on parent or teacher Rutter scales at the age of 8 years, whereas of 27 females only 11% screened positive. Among males, completed or serious suicide attempt outcome was predicted at the age of 8 years by living in a nonintact family; psychological problems as reported by the primary teacher; or conduct, hyperkinetic, and emotional problems. However, self-reports of depressive symptoms at the age of 8 years did not predict suicide outcome. No predictive associations between the study variables measured at the age of 8 years and suicide outcome were found among females. Male suicide outcome was predicted most strongly by comorbid conduct and internalizing problems.
   Conclusions: Most males who completed suicide and/or made serious suicide attempts in adolescence or early adulthood had psychiatric problems by the age of 8 years, indicating a trajectory that persists throughout their lives. However, female severe suicidality is not predicted by psychopathologic disorders at the age of 8 years. The results give additional support to the importance of early detection and treatment of psychiatric problems in males.

AB BACKGROUND: Depressive mood and suicides are more frequent in women seeking voluntary abortion and occur in a seasonal rhythmic fashion. Whether voluntary abortion shows a similar seasonal rhythm was investigated in this study. METHODS: A 4-year analysis was performed on the database of the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) (508 130 abortions) and on the medical records of our institute (3463 abortions). The ratio of voluntary abortions to the number of vital pregnancies (terminated with birth and voluntary abortion) present at the third month of gestation (8-12 weeks) was evaluated. Analyses were carried out by the periodogram method. RESULTS: The rate of voluntary abortions showed a seasonal rhythm with an amplitude of 6.1-6.7% and peaked in May (+/- 38 days). The national frequency of female suicides, obtained from the same ISTAT database, showed a similar rhythm, with an amplitude of 11.1% and maximal rate in June (+/- 37 days). CONCLUSIONS: The present data show a seasonal rhythm in the rate of voluntary abortion, which is almost identical to that of female suicides. This link suggests common provocative mechanisms and may indicate common preventative measures.

AB Background Childhood cancer survivors have been reported to be vulnerable to psychiatric morbidities and risky health behavior. Suicides, substance abuse, accidents, and violence as causes of death can be regarded as an extreme manifestation of risky health behavior. In the current study, the authors studied the risk of suicide and other risky health behavior-related deaths among childhood cancer patients in Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Methods Using linkage between national cancer, population, and cause-of-death registries, the authors investigated the causes of death in 29,285 patients diagnosed with cancer before age 20 years between 1971 and 2009 compared with a cohort of 146,282 age-matched, sex-matched, and country-matched population comparisons. Rate ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs were estimated using Poisson regression models, adjusting for demographic factors. Results The overall risk of dying of a risky health behavior was found to be increased among childhood cancer patients (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.06-1.47) when compared with population comparisons. The elevated risk was statistically significant among patients with central nervous system tumors (RR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.08-2.05) and patients diagnosed at ages 5 to 9 years and 15 to 19 years (RR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.01-2.24] and RR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.03-1.67], respectively). The overall risk of suicide was found to be increased (RR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.02-1.83), and statistically significantly so when patients were diagnosed between ages 15 and 19 years (RR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.09-2.39). Conclusions Childhood cancer patients appear to have an increased risk of risky health behavior-related causes of death compared with the general population. The results of the current study suggest the importance of integrating psychosocial support into the follow-up care of these individuals.

AB This article investigates the prevalence of traumatization and mental distress in a sample of 1055 male European long-term prisoners as part of a wider study of the living conditions of prisoners serving sentences of at least five years in Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, England, Finland, France, Germany, Lithuania, Poland, Spain and Sweden. Data were collected in a written survey using the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) as well as questions on attempted suicide and auto-aggressive behaviour. Participants experienced a mean of three traumatic events, with 14 per cent developing a Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) subsequently. In each national sample, more than 50 per cent of the participants were in need of treatment because of psychological symptoms and nearly one-third had attempted suicide.

AB Background: Mortality rates, in particular due to suicide, are especially high in bipolar patients. This nationwide, registry based study analyses the associations of medication use with hospitalization due to attempted suicides, deaths from suicide, and overall mortality across different psychotropic agents in bipolar patients.
   Method: Altogether 826 bipolar patients hospitalized in Finland between 1996-2003 because of a suicide attempt were followed-up for a mean of 3.5 years. The relative risk of suicide attempts leading to hospitalization, completed suicide, and overall mortality during lithium vs. no-lithium, antipsychotic vs. no-antipsychotic, valproic acid vs. no-valproic acid, antidepressant vs. no-antidepressant and benzodiazepine vs no-benzodiazepine treatment was measured.
   Results: The use of valproic acid (RR=1.53, 95% Cl: 1.26-1.85, p < 0.001), antidepressants (RR=1.49, 95% Cl. 1.23-1.8, p < 0.001) and benzodiazepines (RR=149,95% CI 1.23-1.80, p < 0001) was associated with increased risk of attempted suicide. Lithium was associated with a (non-significantly) lower risk of suicide attempts, and with significantly decreased suicide mortality in univariate (RR=0.39, 95% CI: 017-0.93. p=0.03), Cox (HR=0.37, 95% Cl: 0.16-0.88, p=0.02) and marginal structural models (HR=0.31, 95% Cl: 0.12-0.79, p=0.02). Moreover, lithium was related to decreased all-cause mortality by 49% (marginal structural models).
   Limitations: Only high-risk bipolar patients hospitalized after a suicide attempt were studied. Diagnosis was not based on standardized diagnostic interviews; treatment regimens were uncontrolled.
   Conclusions: Maintenance therapy with lithium, but not with other medications, is linked to decreased suicide and all-cause mortality in high-risk bipolar patients. Lithium should be considered for suicide prevention in high-risk bipolar patients. (C) 2015 Elsevier By. All rights reserved,

TI Trends in suicide in a Lithuanian urban population over the period
   1984-2003
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID RISK-FACTORS; RATES; MORTALITY; INEQUALITIES; FINLAND
AB Background: Throughout the last decade of the twentieth century, Lithuania had the highest suicide rates in Europe among both men and women aged 25 - 64 years. The rates increased from 1986 until 1995, but later there was a slight decrease. This paper describes the trends in suicide deaths in urban population in Lithuania by gender, dates and suicide method over the period 1984 2003.
   Methods: Data from the regional mortality register were used to analyze suicide deaths among all men and women aged 25 - 64 years in Kaunas city, Lithuania over the period 1984 - 2003. Age-standardized death rates per 100,000 persons ( using European standard population) were calculated by gender, suicide method and dates. A joinpoint regression method was used to estimate annual percentage changes (EPACs) and to detect points where the trends changed significantly.
   Results: The frequency of death by suicide among males was 48% higher in 1994 - 2003 than in 1984 - 1993. The corresponding increase among females was 28%. The most common methods of suicide among men were hanging, strangulation and suffocation ( 87.4% among all suicide deaths). The proportions of hanging, strangulation and suffocation in males increased by 6.9% - from 83.9% to 89.7% - compared to a 24.2% increase in deaths from handgun, rifle and shotgun firearm discharges and a 216.7% increase in deaths from poisoning with solvents, gases, pesticides and vapors. Among females, the most common methods of suicide were hanging, strangulation and suffocation ( 68.3% of all suicide deaths). The proportion of hanging deaths among females increased during the time period examined, whereas the proportion of poisonings with solid or liquid substances decreased.
   Conclusion: Suicide rates increased significantly among urban men aged 25 - 64 years in Lithuania throughout the period 1984 - 2003, whereas among women an increasing but statistically insignificant trend was observed. There were changes in the suicide methods used by both men and women. Changes in the choice of method may have contributed to the changes in suicide rates.

TI A register-based study on excess suicide mortality among unemployed men
   and women during different levels of unemployment in Finland
SO JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID FINNISH MEN; FOLLOW-UP; HEALTH; EMPLOYMENT; NONALCOHOL; DENMARK
AB Background Suicide mortality is high among the unemployed, but the role of causation and selection models in producing employment status differences remains to be understood. This study analyses the association between unemployment and suicide during different levels of national unemployment adjusting for several factors that might explain or mediate the relationship.
   Methods The data comprised annual population-register and death-register information on 25-64-year-old Finns at the beginning of each year in the period 1988-2003; thus, forming 16 separate follow-up cohorts. Experience of unemployment was measured at baseline and during the previous year for each cohort. Suicide was followed for 12 months after each baseline giving a total of 7388 suicides.
   Results Overall, age-adjusted suicide mortality was two to three times higher among the unstably employed and almost fourfold among the long-term unemployed. Adjustment for social class and living arrangements had small effect on the HRs, but adjustment for household income per consumption unit decreased the differences by 13% and 31% among the long-term unemployed women and men, respectively. When the national unemployment level was high, excess suicide mortality among the unstably employed was lower than during low unemployment when those becoming unemployed might be more selected. No such differences were found among the long-term unemployed.
   Conclusion Long-term unemployment seems to have causal effects on suicide, which may be partly mediated by low income. As the effect of unstable employment is lower during the recessionary stage of the economic cycle some part of the excess suicide among the unstably employed is likely to be attributable to selection into unemployment.

AB Background: The Internet has facilitated the existence of extreme and pathological communities that share information about ways to complete suicide or to deliberately harm or hurt oneself. This material is user-generated and easily accessible. Aims: The present study analyzed the buffering effect of social belonging to a primary group in the situation of pro-suicide site exposure. Method: Cross-national data were collected from the US, UK, Germany, and Finland in spring 2013 and 2014 from respondents aged 15-30 years (N = 3,567). Data were analyzed by using linear regression separately for women and men for each country. Results: A higher level of belonging to a primary group buffered the negative association of pro-suicide site exposure with mental health, measured as happiness, although the results were not consistent in the subgroups. US male subjects showed a significant buffering effect of the sense of belonging to family while the belonging to friends had a buffering effect among four other subgroups: British female and male subjects and Finnish female and male subjects. Conclusion: The results underline the positive potential of primary groups to shield young people's mental health in the situation of pro-suicide site exposure.

AB Advanced paternal age is a risk factor for adverse health outcomes in the offspring. In a population-based birth cohort from Finland, 10,965 singleton offspring born in 1966 and alive at age 1 were followed to age 39. Hazard ratios were calculated, adjusting for maternal age, gender, paternal social class, and maternal parity. In females but not in males, increasing paternal age was associated with a linear increased risk of suicide (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04-1.24, p < 0.01) and all-causes mortality (HR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.01-1.10, p = 0.02). Increasing maternal age was associated with a significantly decreased risk of suicide (HR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.86-1.00, p = 0.04) and all-causes mortality (HR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.93-1, p = 0.02) in the entire cohort. For paternal age >= 30, the population attributable risk percentage was 13.7% for all deaths and 7.5% for suicides. Parental age at birth may affect suicide and all-causes mortality risk in the offspring in the general population. The causal pathways and specific disorders associated with this increased mortality are largely unknown.

AB Completed suicide has been reported as being linked to marital status, with being unmarried associated with a higher suicide rate as compared with being married or living with a partner.
   Data were obtained from the Italian Data Base on Mortality, collected by the Italian Census Bureau (ISTAT) and processed by the Italian National Institute of Health-Statistics Unit. The Italian population in the last Italian census (October 2001) was used to estimate age-standardized mortality rates from suicide by marital status (ICD-9 revision: E950-E959) and "natural" causes (ICD-9 revision: 0-280; 320-799). Rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using married individuals as a reference. All analyses were conducted separately for men and women and for three different age groups (25-44 years, 45-64 years and 65 years and over) for 2000-2002, the most recent years with data available. Logistic regression analysis was used to compare differences by marital status for suicide versus death from natural causes.
   Being married appears to be a protective factor for suicide, but the impact of being never-married, divorced/separated or widowed varies with age and gender. It is noteworthy that the differences between married and non-married women were less consistent than those among men, especially for elderly women. The results confirm that the protective impact of marriage is higher for suicide than for natural causes of death, and the comparison between the risks of suicide and natural causes of death reveals that the groups relatively more at risk for suicide are divorced/separated women, divorced/separated men (under the age of 64) and widowed men.
   Both among men and women, being unmarried, widowed or divorced/separated is associated with a higher suicide rate. This study, however, adds information on suicide mortality in specific age-groups compared to mortality from natural causes of death. Overall, these findings support the notion that marital status may dramatically influence the risk of suicide.

AB Purpose: To investigate the relationship between smoking and suicidality among adolescent psychiatric patients in Finland.
   Methods: Data from 157 patients (aged 12-17 years) admitted to inpatient psychiatric hospitalization between April 2001 and July 2002 were collected. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between regular daily smoking and suicidality. The data were adjusted for several sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.
   Results: The results showed over four-fold risk for definite and/or life-threatening suicide attempts among smoking adolescents in inpatient psychiatric facility compared with nonsmoking ones (OR 4.33, 95% CI 1.23-15.20). Also, the smoking adolescents had three times greater risk for occasional (OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.09-10.10) or frequent (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.08-10.10) self-mutilation. Suicidality was more common among girls than boys and among those adolescents who suffered from depression.
   Conclusions: Among teens hospitalized for psychiatric illnesses, daily smoking was significantly related to suicide attempts and self-mutilation, even after controlling for several confounding factors, including psychiatric diagnosis. (C) Society for Adolescent Medicine, 2004.

TI Sex, timing, and depression among suicide victims with schizophrenia
SO COMPREHENSIVE PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID TERM-FOLLOW-UP; DISCHARGE; PATIENT
AB Background: Schizophrenia and depression by themselves and especially in combination with each other are known to be important risk factors of suicide. An increased risk of suicide has also been reported for the period immediately after a psychiatric patient's discharge from the hospital. However, to the best of our knowledge, it remains unknown whether survival times differ between suicide victims with schizophrenia concomitantly with and those without depression.
   Objective: This study aimed to examine survival times from the discharge of last hospital treatment (irrespective of the kind of illness) to the day of death in suicide victims with schizophrenia with or without concomitant depression.
   Material and Method: A 16-year database of all suicides (1535 males, 342 females) committed during the years 1988-2003 in the province of Oulu in northern Finland, and information available from the national hospital discharge registers formed the basis of this study.
   Results: In male suicide victims with schizophrenia, the median survival time after final hospitalization was approximately I day in those with a history of depression and 90 days in those without depression (P =.005). The corresponding times for females were 50 and 24 days, respectively (P =.396). Using Cox regression analysis after adjusting for confounders, we noticed a statistically significant difference in survival times from last hospitalization to suicide between depressive and nondepressive male patients with schizophrenia (hazard ratio, 1.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-3.11), but not females (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.34-1.53).
   Conclusion: Concomitant depression was markedly linked with shorter survival time in male suicide victims with schizophrenia after last hospitalization. Psychiatric inpatient facilities appear to be in a key position to establish suicide prevention programs for patients with schizophrenia, especially those with depression. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB We assess (i) whether being married is a protective factor against socio-economic inequalities in suicide, and (ii) whether any such buffering effect varies between countries. We used the data from a European cross-national comparison project, a prospective follow-up of several European population censuses matched with vital statistics. The data encompass 99.5 million person-years aged 30 and above and, 25,476 suicides in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Turin, Madrid, Norway and Switzerland. Standardised rates were computed and logistic regressions were used to assess educational inequalities. Among the non-married, the lower educational group had an increased risk of dying of suicide compared to the higher group (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.45). Inequalities among the married were lower (OR = 1.29). In all countries or regions except Austria, the lower educational group had a higher risk of suicide mortality among the non-married than among the married. The buffering effect of being married was not observed for elderly individuals (65 and over). Among younger individuals, the buffering effect of being married on relative inequalities in suicide was stronger in Madrid, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland (but significant only for Denmark and Norway). There was no indication that countries with stronger welfare policies or lower divorce rate had a lower buffering effect. We conclude that being married protects against inequalities in suicide and that this protective effect is not affected by the level of social capital at the country level. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Prospective cohort studies on biological risk factors of completed suicide are scarce. We aimed to test which biological risk factors independently identify subjects at increased risk of suicidal death.
   Methods: In the prospective cohort of the Seven Countries Study, 5,321 middle-aged men from Finland, Serbia, Italy, and Greece were included. Completed suicide (ICD-8 codes E950-959) was assessed during 40 years of follow-up. Biological cardiovascular risk factors (including forced vital capacity [FVC] and height) were tested for their role as predictors in multivariable Cox models stratified by country.
   Results: There were 4518 deaths during follow-up, with 64 from suicide (1.4%). In univariable models, only FVC and height were strongly inversely related with suicide. Socio-economic status and being unmarried were potential confounders. In multivariable models taking these confounders into account, both a low FVC (0.30 for top vs. lowest quartile: 95% CI: 0.12-0.76: P=0.006 for trend) and a low FVC/height ratio (0.37 for top vs. lowest quartile; 95% CI: 0.17-0.82; P=0.004 for trend) were strongly inversely related with completed suicide.
   Limitations: Information oil proximal causes, such as prior Suicidal ideation, emotional distress and depression, was lacking at baseline.
   Conclusions: Poor respiratory function in middle-aged men was an independent risk factor for completed suicide. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The review is devoted to the analysis of data on the relationship between smoking and suicide. It is shown that smokers are much more likely to have chronic physical illnesses, mental disorders that can lead to depression and contribute to suicidal attempts. On the other hand, research results indicate that active smoking is associated with suicide and there is a correlation between a larger number of cigarettes smoked per day and higher suicide risks. In multivariate analyzes it was shown that a longer duration of smoking (>= 41 years vs. <= 10 years) was associated with higher suicide risks for men (odds ratio (OR) = 2.26). Quitting smoking was associated with lower suicide risks (OR = 0.37), which decreased with an increase in the duration of abstinence from tobacco. In a large population-based study on a cohort of 16,282 pairs of twins for 35 years, the impact on the suicide risk of the status and intensity of smoking, marital status, employment and socioeconomic status, the presence of mental and physical illnesses and a higher death rate from suicides among smokers, than those who refused to use tobacco or never smoked. The observed association is not associated with living conditions that increase the risk of suicide and not with the development of diseases caused by exposure to toxic components of tobacco smoke, in which depressive disorders that increase the risk of suicide develop. Chronic intoxication with components of tobacco smoke is an additional independent risk factor for suicide, the effect of which decreases with smoking cessation. In a multicenter study of the United States and Finland, an attempt was made to assess the contribution of TC to suicide, regardless of the indices of diagnosed and undiagnosed depression, excessive alcohol consumption, use of antidepressants, unemployment, marital status and other demographic characteristics. The authors believe that smoking increases the risk of suicide by 2.5 times. Smoking changes the changes in serotonergic signaling pathways, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which refers to neurotrophins - substances that stimulate and support the development of neurons. Possible pathogenesis of the effect of smoking on suicidal attempts is discussed: changes in synaptic activity and plasticity, serotonergic signaling pathways, neurotrophic brain factor, dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems.

AB Objective To investigate mortality in the non-pregnant fertile female population, and mortality during pregnancy and up to 1 year after the end of pregnancy, in Finland from 2001 to 2012 and compare the results with those of 1987-2000.
   Design Retrospective cohort study.
   Setting Finland. Population 10 427 deceased women of reproductive age (15-49).
   Methods Pregnancy outcomes were categorised into: ongoing pregnancy or birth, miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy and termination of pregnancy. Mortality was calculated per 100 000 pregnancies. The mortality rate of the non-pregnant female population of fertile age was calculated per 100 000 person-years, and the results were compared with those of 1987-2000.
   Main outcome measures Pregnancy-associated mortality during pregnancy and up to 1 year after the end of pregnancy. Mortality of non-pregnant, fertile-age, female population.
   Results The age-adjusted mortality rate during pregnancy and within 1 year after the end of pregnancy was 28.4/100 000 pregnancies, and it had significantly decreased compared with the period 1987-2000 [risk ratio (RR) 0.75 (95% CI, 0.65-0.88)]. Mortality in nonpregnant fertile-age females was 48.1/100 000 person-years. Mortality for diseases and medical conditions during and after pregnancy decreased by 26% [RR 0.74 (95% CI, 0.59-0.92)] and for external causes by 23% [RR 0.77 (95% CI, 0.62-0.95)]. The mortality rate for suicides was 3.3/100 000 in ongoing pregnancies and pregnancies ending in birth while it was 21.8/100 000 after termination of pregnancy and 10.2/100 000 among non-pregnant women.
   Conclusions In comparison with earlier decades, pregnancyassociated mortality has decreased in Finland.

   TRENDS; ANTIDEPRESSANTS; AVAILABILITY; RESTRICTIONS
AB Background: There is a lack of international research on suicide by drug overdose as a preventable suicide method. Sex-and age-specific rates of suicide by drug self-poisoning (ICD-10, X60-64) and the distribution of drug types used in 16 European countries were studied, and compared with other self-poisoning methods (X65-69) and intentional self-injury (X70-84).
   Methods: Data for 2000-04/05 were collected from national statistical offices. Age-adjusted suicide rates, and age and sex distributions, were calculated.
   Results: No pronounced sex differences in drug self-poisoning rates were found, either in the aggregate data (males 1.6 and females 1.5 per 100,000) or within individual countries. Among the 16 countries, the range (from some 0.3 in Portugal to 5.0 in Finland) was wide. 'Other and unspecified drugs' (X64) were recorded most frequently, with a range of 0.2-1.9, and accounted for more than 70% of deaths by drug overdose in France, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain. Psychotropic drugs (X61) ranked second. The X63 category ('other drugs acting on the autonomic nervous system') was least frequently used. Finland showed low X64 and high X61 figures, Scotland had high levels of X62 ('narcotics and hallucinogens, not elsewhere classified') for both sexes, while England exceeded other countries in category X60. Risk was highest among the middle-aged everywhere except in Switzerland, where the elderly were most at risk.
   Conclusions: Suicide by drug overdose is preventable. Intentional self-poisoning with drugs kills as many males as females. The considerable differences in patterns of self-poisoning found in the various European countries are relevant to national efforts to improve diagnostics of suicide and appropriate specific prevention. The fact that vast majority of drug-overdose suicides came under the category X64 refers to the need of more detailed ICD coding system for overdose suicides is needed to permit better design of suicide-prevention strategies at national level.

AB ObjectiveBreast cancer patients are associated with an increased risk for committing suicide. The purpose of this study was to study the trends in the incidence of suicide mortality and identify pertinent risk factors among patients with breast cancer.
   MethodsA retrospective examination of the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database between years 1973 and 2013 was performed.
   ResultsOverall, 474128 patients were identified of which 773 had committed suicide. There were no significant differences in the incidence of suicide mortality over the last 3 decades (1984-1993: 0.14%, 1994-2003: 0.16%, 2004-2013: 0.17%, P=0.173). On logistic regression, younger age (<30y: OR 6.34, 95% CI: 1.98-20.33, P=0.002; 30-49y: OR 10.64, 95% CI: 7.97-14.2, P<0.001; 50-69y: OR 4.7, 95% CI: 3.64-6.07, P<0.001), male sex (OR 4.34, 95% CI: 2.57-7.31, P<0.001), nonwhite-nonblack race (OR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.01-1.91, P=0.046), marital status (single: OR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.04-1.76, P=0.024; separated/divorced/widowed: OR 1.25, 95% CI: 1.01-1.55, P=0.043), undergoing surgery (OR 2.13, 95% CI: 1.23-3.67, P=0.007), and short-time elapsed from diagnosis (first year: OR 4.67, 95% CI: 3.39-6.42, P<0.001; second year: OR 2.35, 95% CI: 1.69-3.27, P<0.001) were independent risk factors of suicide mortality.
   ConclusionsThere have been no identifiable improvements in preventing suicide mortality in the United States. Younger age, male sex, race, marital status, and undergoing surgery are independent risk factors for committing suicide, especially in the first year after diagnosis.

AB Compared to the general Population, people with schizophrenia are at risk of dying prematurely Clue to suicide and due to different somatic illnesses. The potential role of antipsychotic treatment in affecting suicide rates and in explaining the increased mortality due to somatic disorders is highly debated.
   A recent study of death registers in Finland compared the cause-specific mortality in 66,881 patients versus the total population (5.2 million) between 1996 and 2006, suggesting that antipsychotic use decreased all-cause Mortality compared to no antipsychotic use in patients with schizophrenia, and that clozapine had the most beneficial profile in this regard (Tiihonen et al., 2009). The benefits of clozapine were conferred by significant protective effects for Suicide compared to perphenazine, whereas, a mixed group of 'other' antipsychotics, haloperidol, quetiapine and risperidone were reported to be associated with significantly higher all-cause mortality than perphenazine. By contrast, despite known differences in effects on cardiovascular Fisk factors, there were no significant differences between any of the examined antipsychotics regarding death due to ischemic heart disease. A number of methodological and conceptual issues make the interpretation of these findings problematic, including incomplete reporting of data, questionable selection of drug groups and comparisons, important unmeasured risk factors, inadequate control for potentially confounding variables, exclusion of deaths Occurring during hospitalization leading to exclusion of 64% of deaths on Current antipsychotics from the analysis, and survivorship bias due to strong and systematic differences in illness duration across the treatment groups.
   Well designed, prospective Mortality Studies, with direct measurement of and adjustment for all known relevant risk factors for premature mortality, are needed to identify risk and protective medication and patient factors and to, ultimately, inform clinical practice.

SO BMC PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID ANTIDEPRESSANTS; ASSOCIATION; PREVENTION
AB Background: In the period 1990-2006, strong and almost equivalent increases in sales figures of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were observed in all Nordic countries. The sales figures of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) dropped in Norway and Sweden in the nineties. After 2000, sales figures of TCAs have been almost constant in all Nordic countries. The potentially toxic effect of TCAs in overdose was an important reason for replacing TCAs with SSRIs when treating depression. We studied whether the rapid increase in sales of SSRIs and the corresponding decline in TCAs in the period 1990-98 were associated with a decline in suicide rates.
   Methods: Aggregated suicide rates for the period 1975-2006 in four Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) were obtained from the national causes-of-death registries. The sales figures of antidepressants were provided from the wholesale registers in each of the Nordic countries. Data were analysed using Fisher's exact test and Pearson's correlation coefficient.
   Results: There was no statistical association (P = 1.0) between the increase of sales figures of SSRIs and the decline in suicide rates. There was no statistical association (P = 1.0) between the decrease in the sale figures of TCAs and change in suicide rates either.
   Conclusions: We found no evidence for the rapid increase in use of SSRIs and the corresponding decline in sales of TCAs being associated with a decline in the suicide rates in the Nordic countries in the period 1990-98. We did not find any inverse relationship between the increase in sales of SSRIs and declining suicide rates in four Nordic

AB Background: Although mortality is a known complication of illicit drug use, robust epidemiological studies on drug-related mortality in Finland are scarce. We examined all deaths, specific causes of death, and trends in mortality among a large number of illicit drug users in Finland during a 14-year period.
   Methods: Details of 4817 clients who sought treatment for drug use at Helsinki Deaconess Institute between 1997 and 2008 were linked to national cause of death register to identify all deaths and causes of death. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated to compare all-cause deaths in our study cohort with those in the general population. Trends in mortality rates were assessed using Poisson (log-linear) regression.
   Results: A total of 496 deaths occurred during 41,567.5 person-years with crude mortality rate of 1193.2 per 100,000 person-years. Mean follow-up was 8.6 years and the mean age at death was 33.8 years. Most deaths (84.1%) occurred among male clients, 189 deaths occurred in the 25-34 age-group and all-cause SMR was 8.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 8.1-9.7]. Two-thirds (64.9%) were deaths from external causes and 35.1% from disease-related causes. The four leading causes of death were accidental poisoning/overdose (n = 165), suicide (n =108), mental and behavioural disorders (u =49) and circulatory system diseases (n = 45). Younger clients died from acute effects of drug use while older clients died more from chronic health conditions. A decline in annual rates was noted for all-cause mortality (P = 0.01), deaths from mental and behavioural disorders (P < 0.001) and suicides (P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: The four leading causes of death among illicit drug users are preventable. Overdose management training, drug education and other preventive measures could help reduce mortality. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Focusing on seasonality, gender, age, and suicide methods a Finnish nation-wide cohort-based study was carried out to compare suicide data between sighted, visually-impaired (WHO impairment level I-II, i.e., visual acuity >0.05, but <0.3) and blind (WHO impairment level III-V, i.e., visual acuity <0.05) victims. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) of age-and gender-matched populations from official 1982-2011 national registers were used. Group differences in categorical variables were assessed with Pearson's Chi-square or Fisher's Exact test and in continuous variables with Mann-Whitney U-test. Seasonality was assessed by Chi-square for multinomials; ratio of observed to expected number of suicides was calculated with 95% confidence level. Hanging, poisoning, drowning, but rarely shooting or jumping from high places, were preferred suicide methods of the blind. Mortality was significantly increased in the visually impaired (SMR = 1.3; 95% CI 1.07-1.61), but in gender-stratified analyses the increase only affected males (1.34; 95% CI = 1.06-1.70) and not females (1.24; 95% CI 0.82-1.88). Age-stratified analyses identified blind males of working age rather than older men (as in the general population) as a high risk group that requires particular attention. The statistically significant spring suicide peak in blind subjects mirrors that of sighted victims and its possible cause in the blind is discussed.

AB The current state of knowledge of genetic predisposition towards the suicidal behavior allows for a question whether genetic risk factors account for the variation in suicide rates through time and space. Accordingly, the presented study will attempt to tackle the genetics behind suicidal behavior from the perspective of the populational genetics, First, the variability of suicide rates across Europe is discussed. This is followed by a brief discussion of the J curve (on a map of Europe, the countries with a higher suicide rate form a so-called J curve, which starts in Finland and extends down to Slovenia), which maps on to the second principal component identified for European gene distribution, representing the ancestral adaptation to cold climates and the Uralic language dispersion. Furthermore, we will discuss whether the group of people living within the J-curve could share genes, which may not tolerate excessive amounts alcohol, the combination of which is more likely to end in suicidal behavior. Further along we list possible ways in which suicidal behavior could have been selected for genetically in populations and identify those specific populations in which it may have appeared. Finally, we point at other locations in the world where a similar interplay of genes and environment has probably occurred, Greenland being the best example of the malignant interaction of alcohol consumption and the trait-like characteristics, which might constitute the vulnerability to suicidal behavior.

AB Background: Several studies show a high mortality risk among patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).
   Objectives: In this study, mortality and underlying causes of death were analysed among patients with MS diagnosed between 1964-1993 in Finland (n = 1595).
   Methods: Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated for both genders. The follow-up was based on linkage to the national computerized Cause-of-Death Register of Statistics Finland.
   Results: Altogether, 464 deaths were recorded by the end of 2006. The SMR as compared with the general population among females was 3.4 (95% confidence interval 3.0-3.9) and among males 2.2 (1.9-2.6). In total, 270 patients (58%) died from MS; only one of these deaths occurred during the first 2 years after the MS diagnosis. Mortality was also increased for other natural causes of death (n = 160) in patients followed for more than 10 years (SMR 1.4, 1.2-1.7), with a significant increase in deaths from influenza (29, 6.0-85), pneumonia (4.7, 2.5-8.0) and gastrointestinal causes (4.4, 2.3-7.7). The SMR for violent causes was 1.2 (0.7-1.9) and for alcohol-related deaths 0.2 (0.02-0.7). The SMR for suicides was 1.7 (0.9-2.7).
   Conclusions: The MS population has an increased disease mortality, while the increase in the risk of accidents and suicides is not significantly increased among patients with MS in Finland.

AB Background Comprehensive overviews of the temporal changes in treated psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders during adolescence are scarce. We reviewed data from two national cohorts, 10 years apart, to establish the change in use of specialised services for psychiatric and neurodevelopmental diagnoses in Finland.
   Methods We compared the nationwide register-based incidence of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental diagnoses between the 12th birthday and 18th birthday of adolescents born in Finland in 1987 and 1997. Adolescents who emigrated or died before their 12th birthday and those with missing covariate data were excluded, as were those who, when aged 11 years, had lived in a municipality belonging to a hospital district with obviously incomplete data reports during any follow-up years in our study. Our primary outcomes were time to incident specialised service use for any psychiatric or neurodevelopmental disorder and for 17 specific diagnostic classes. We also investigated whether adolescents who died by suicide had accessed specialised services before their deaths.
   Findings The cumulative incidence of psychiatric or neurodevelopmental disorders increased from 9.8 in the 1987 cohort to 14.9 in the 1997 cohort (difference 5.2 percentage points [95% CI 4.8-5.5]) among girls, and from 6.2 in the 1987 cohort to 8.8 in the 1997 (2.6 percentage points [2.4-2.9]) among boys. The hazard ratio for the overall relative increase in neurodevelopment and psychiatric disorders in the 1997 cohort compared with the 1987 cohort was 1.6 (95% CI 1.5-1.8) among girls and 1.5 (1.4-1.6) among boys. Of the studied diagnostic classes, we noted significant (ie, p< 0.001) relative increases for ten of 17 diagnoses among girls and 11 among boys. Of the adolescents who died by suicide before age 18, only five of 16 in the 1987 cohort and two of 12 in the 1997 cohort had used specialised services in the 6 months before their death.
   Interpretation The large absolute rise in service use for psychiatric or neurodevelopmental disorders points to the need to deliver effective treatment to a rapidly increased patient population, whereas the relative increase in specific diagnoses should inform clinical practice. Despite increasing service use, identification of adolescents at risk of suicide remains a major public health priority.

AB Oejective
   To explore mortality rates and causes of death in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients in Finland compared with the general population.
   Methods
   All incident patients with JIA (age <16 years at the index day) during 2000-2014 were collected from the nationwide register maintained by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland and The National Population Registry identified three age-, sex-Nand residence-matched controls for each case. They were followed up together until 31st Dec 2015.
   Results
   Altogether 4,180 JIA patients (62% females) were identified. Mean age at diagnosis was 8.3 years. The average follow-up time was 6.6 years (IQR 3.1-10.5). The patients were compared with 12,511 controls. During 28,941 follow-up years, 11 JIA patients (6 females, 5 males) and 23 controls (12 females, 11 males) died. The mean age at death was 20.3 (range: 11-30) in JIA patients and 23.1 (range: 9-29) years in the control group, (p=0.17). Cumulative mortality in JIA was 0.6% (95% Cl 0.3-1.2) compared to 0.6% (95% Cl 0.4-1.0) in the controls; (hazard ratio 1.44, 95% Cl 0.70-2.95). Accidents were the most common (54%) cause of death in JIA, whereas suicide (39%) in the controls. Substance abuse and depression contributed more to deaths in the controls (39%) than in the JIA patients (10%), (p=0.053).
   Conclusion
   The mortality rate was not elevated in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

AB Background: Socioeconomic inequalities in mortality increased in several countries in the 1980s, but little is known about more recent trends. This study looks at how social class differences in mortality changed in Finland during 1981-1995, a period which saw drastic economic fluctuations. Methods: The study is based on the person records of the Finnish censuses of 1980, 1985 and 1990, to which the death records for 1981-1985, 1986-1990 and 1991-1995 respectively were linked. Men and women aged 35-64 years were classified into manual and non-manual classes on the basis of current or former occupation or the occupation of head of household. Results: Class differences in mortality increased during the 1980s among both men and women due to a more rapid decrease in cardiovascular mortality in the non-manual class and to a more rapid increase in mortality from alcohol-related causes of death, accidents and suicide in the manual class. In the 1990s, a period of severe economic recession, the increase in the relative mortality gap was clearly smaller than in the 1980s. This was due to the convergence between classes of trends for cardiovascular mortality and for mortality from alcohol-related causes, accidents and suicide. Conclusion: In Finland, economic recession slowed down rather than sped up the growth of relative inequalities among middle-aged men and women. Changes in mortality and socioeconomic inequalities in mortality result from a complex combination of different and even opposite trends in mortality from various causes of death. In the light of this complexity it seems unlikely that there exists any major single explanation for changes in inequalities in mortality.

AB Background: Excess mortality among patients with severe mental disorders has not previously been investigated in detail in large complete national populations.
   Objective: To investigate the excess mortality in different diagnostic categories due to suicide and other external causes of death, and due to specific causes in connection with diseases and medical conditions.
   Methods: In longitudinal national psychiatric case registers from Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, a cohort of 270,770 recent-onset patients, who at least once during the period 2000 to 2006 were admitted due to a psychiatric disorder, were followed until death or the end of 2006. They were followed for 912,279 person years, and 28,088 deaths were analyzed. Life expectancy and standardized cause-specific mortality rates were estimated in each diagnostic group in all three countries.
   Results: The life expectancy was generally approximately 15 years shorter for women and 20 years shorter for men, compared to the general population. Mortality due to diseases and medical conditions was increased two-to three-fold, while excess mortality from external causes ranged from three-to 77-fold. Mortality due to diseases and medical conditions was generally lowest in patients with affective disorders and highest in patients with substance abuse and personality disorders, while mortality due to suicide was highest in patients with affective disorders and personality disorders, and mortality due to other external causes was highest in patients with substance abuse.
   Conclusions: These alarming figures call for action in order to prevent the high mortality.

AB Purpose. - To investigate the relationship between heavy daily smoking and suicidality among adolescent psychiatric inpatients in Finland.
   Methods. - Data were collected from 411 patients (age 12-17 years) admitted to inpatient psychiatric hospitalization between April 2001 and July 2005. The number of daily cigarettes (> 15) and the time of first cigarette after waking up (within 30 min) were used as indicators of heavy daily smoking.
   Results. - After adjusting for psychiatric diagnoses an over twofold risk for suicide attempts was found among adolescents who smoked over 15 cigarettes a day. Additionally, if an adolescent also smoked the first cigarette immediately after waking up the risk was over threefold. Suicidal ideation was not associated with smoking behaviour.
   Discussion and conclusions. - Among adolescents with severe psychiatric illnesses, heavy daily smoking may increase the risk of suicidal behaviour independently of current psychiatric diagnosis. The degree of nicotine dependence of an adolescent should therefore be carefully assessed as part of psychiatric evaluation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Background: It is unknown if antidepressant treatment is associated with either increased or decreased risk of suicide.
   Objective: To estimate the risk of suicide, attempted suicide, and overall mortality during antidepressant treatments in a real-life setting with high statistical power.
   Design and Setting: A cohort study in which all subjects without psychosis, hospitalized because of a suicide attempt from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2003, in Finland, were followed up through a nationwide computerized database.
   Participants: A total of 15 390 patients with a mean follow-up of 3.4 years.
   Main Outcome Measures: The propensity score adjusted relative risks (RRs) during monotherapy with the most frequently used antidepressants compared with no antidepressant treatment.
   Results: In the entire cohort, fluoxetine use was associated with the lowest risk (RR, 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30-0.93), and venlafaxine hydrochloride use with the highest risk (RR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.01-2.57), of suicide. A substantially lower mortality was observed during selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.49-0.71; P < .001), and this was attributable to a decrease in cardiovascular- and cerebrovascular-related deaths (RR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.24-0.71; P = .001). Among subjects who had ever used any antidepressant, the current use of medication was associated with a markedly increased risk of attempted suicide (39%, P < .001), but also with a markedly decreased risk of completed suicide (-32%, P = .002) and mortality (-49%, P < .001), when compared with no current use of medication. The results for subjects aged 10 to 19 years were basically the same as those in the total population, except for an increased risk of death with paroxetine hydrochloride use (RR, 5.44; 95% CI, 2.15-13.70; P < .001).
   Conclusions: Among suicidal subjects who had ever used antidepressants, the current use of any antidepressant was associated with a markedly increased risk of attempted suicide and, at the same time, with a markedly decreased risk of completed suicide and death. Lower mortality was attributable to a decrease in cardiovascular- and cerebrovascular-related deaths during selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use.

AB Self-inflicted burns are rare in France, but they lead to major, often life-threatening complications. The authors reviewed medical data for patients hospitalized in a burn center from January 2004 to December 2008. Thirty-eight cases of self-inflicted burns were compared with 220 accidental burns. Women were predominantly affected (57.9%, n = 22). A psychiatric history (71%, n = 27) was more frequent in this population. The mean age of the victims was 38 years. The leading method of suicide was flame (94%, n = 36) associated with gasoline used as an accelerant (77.7%, n = 28). Mean total burn surface area (41.5%) and mortality (36.9%) were higher in the self-inflicted burn population. By recognizing epidemiological characteristics and patients at risk, we can better classify lesions related to self-immolation. It is important for the forensic physician to consult survival details to correlate these data with the results of autopsy.

AB This study provides an overview of homicide clearance in four West European countries: Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. Using data from the European Homicide Monitor, employing similar definitions and uniform coding schemes, this study allowed for unique cross-country comparisons in factors influencing differences in homicide clearance rates. Findings based on homicides occurring in the period 2009-14 revealed overall low homicide rates in all countries, with a wide variety in homicide clearance rates, ranging from 77 percent in the Netherlands to 98 percent in Finland. Results further showed that both event-based as well as victim-based characteristics significantly influenced the likelihood of homicide clearance, suggesting that homicide clearance rates can, for a large part, be attributed to the prevalent types of homicide in each of these European countries.

AB Aims. To estimate the relationship between joint heavy use of alcohol, cigarettes and coffee, and the risk of suicide in a general population with high rate of suicide. Design. Prospective cohort analyses. Setting. Finland. Participants. Data from 36 689 adult (age range 25-64 years) men and women who participated in the population surveys between 1972 and 1992. Measurements. The mortality of the cohort was monitored for a mean of 14.4 years, which yielded 169 suicides. Criteria for heavy use of each psychoactive substance were defined as follows: alcohol (>120 g/week), cigarettes ( greater than or equal to 21/day) and coffee (greater than or equal to seven cups/day). Findings. About half the men and 80% of the women did not use any of the psychoactive substances heavily. Every third man and every fifth woman used one substance heavily, and the prevalence for those who exceeded criteria for joint heavy use of two substances was 9% for men and 1% for women. Joint heavy use of all three substances was rare. The adjusted relative risk of suicide increased linearly with increasing level of joint heavy use of alcohol, cigarettes and coffee. Among subjects with heavy use of one substance the risk was 1.55 (95% CI = 1.10, 2.18), with joint heavy use of two substances 2.22 (95% CI = 1.37, 3.61), and with joint heavy use of all three substances 3.99 (95% CI = 1.80, 8.84) compared with no heavy use. Conclusions. Clustering of the heavy use of alcohol, cigarettes and coffee could serve as a new marker for increased risk of suicide.

AB We reviewed the 33 727 postmortem toxicology investigations performed in Finland over a period of 5 years (2009-2013) and identified those in which the antidepressant bupropion was detected. Cases positive for other antidepressant drugs were reviewed for comparison.
   The postmortem toxicological examination included, in all cases, the routine screening and quantification of hundreds of drugs and poisons using quality-controlled methods.
   Bupropion was detected in 65 cases. A large proportion of the bupropion-positive deaths resulted from suicide (55%). In fatal poisoning cases found positive for bupropion, the proportion of suicide was even higher (77%). The measured median bupropion postmortem blood concentration (0.69 mg/L) was markedly higher than the normal therapeutic range in plasma in the treatment of depression (up to 0.1 mg/L) and even higher in fatal bupropion poisonings (13 mg/L).
   Only 14% of the deceased positive for bupropion were estimated to be drug abusers. However, nearly all of the drug abuse cases were from the last year of the study (2013), indicating a recent increase of the use of bupropion among drug abusers and possibly even abuse of bupropion itself.
   Suicide victims positive for bupropion were younger than those who died with other antidepressant drugs in their blood. In addition, the percentage of fatal poisonings among bupropion-positive postmortem cases was higher than among the users of other antidepressant drugs. Suicide was significantly more common among the deceased positive for bupropion than among users of other antidepressant drugs.
   An unknown degree of bupropion degradation before the assay and post-mortem redistribution of bupropion may have impacted the measured levels. Nonetheless, all post-mortem concentrations of bupropion were elevated and especially high concentrations were detected in suicides. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: To analyze the causes of mortality among patients committed to compulsory forensic psychiatric hospital treatment in Finland during 1980-2009 by categorizing the causes of mortality into somatic diseases, suicides and other unnatural deaths.Materials and methods: The causes of mortality were analyzed among 351 patients who died during the follow-up. Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated as the ratio of observed and expected number of deaths by using the subject-years methods with 95% confidence intervals, assuming a Poisson distribution. The expected number of deaths was calculated on the basis of sex-, age- and calendar-period-specific mortality rates for the Finnish population.Results: The vast majority (249/351) of deaths were due to a somatic disease with SMR of 2.6 (mean age at death 61 years). Fifty nine patients committed suicide with a SMR of 7.1 (mean age at death 40 years). Four patients were homicide victims (mean age at death 40 years) and 32 deaths were accidental (mean age at death 52 years). The combined homicides and accidental deaths resulted in a SMR of 1.7.Conclusions: The results of this study point out that the high risk for suicide should receive attention when the hospital treatment and the outpatient care is being organized for forensic psychiatric patients. In addition, the risk of accidents should be evaluated and it should be assured that the patients receive proper somatic healthcare during the forensic psychiatric treatment and that it continues also in the outpatient setting.

AB Background: The influence of seasons on mood disorders is controversial. Objective: To examine monthly variations in admissions for mania and depressions including variations with sex and age and correlations with frequencies of suicides. Methods: All admissions for mania or depression (N = 4341) in a population of 1,800,000 with 35,285 admissions in the years 1992-1996 were analysed. All 14,503 suicides in Norway the years 1969-1996 were also analysed. Results: Admissions for depression had a significant monthly variation for women (chi(2) = 29.78, df = 11, P < 0.005) with the highest peak in November and for men (chi(2) = 19.69, df = 11, P < 0.05) with the highest peak in April. Among women increasing age correlated negatively with the range of monthly observed/expected ratios (r(s) = -0.943, N = 6, P < 0.01) and with a of maximal monthly observed/expected ratio (r(s) = -0.943, N = 6, P < 0.01). Among men suicides correlated with admissions for depression (r = 0.647, N = 12, P < 0.05) and mania (r = 0.678, N = 12, P < 0.05). Limitations: The time of admission to hospital are not identical to onset of affective episode. The study was done retrospectively. No sociocultural or physical environmental data were investigated.

AB BACKGROUND: Although schizophrenic patients have higher mortality than the general nonschizophrenic population, few studies have investigated acute care hospital mortality of schizophrenic patients.
   METHODS: To assess acute care hospital mortality of schizophrenic patients, we analyzed hospital mortality, the risk factors for hospital mortality, and the causes of death of schizophrenic patients admitted to an acute care hospital in Japan over an 18-year period.
   RESULTS: We identified 55 deaths among 1108 schizophrenic patients, for a mortality rate of 5.0%. The overall standardized mortality ratio was 1.29 (95% CI, 0.98-1.68) compared with nonschizophrenic hospitalized patients. Significant risk factors for mortality were malignant neoplasm, cardiovascular disease, and admission through the emergency department. The leading causes of death in acute care hospitalizations were suicide (14.5%), malignant lymphoma or leukemia (10.9%), stroke (9.0%), and sepsis (7.3%).
   CONCLUSIONS: There was a nearly significant trend toward increased mortality of schizophrenic patients receiving acute hospital care compared with that of nonschizophrenic patients. Because suicide was the most frequent cause of death, a focus on suicide prevention is needed in this population.

AB Background: To investigate monthly variation in depression, anxiety and their comorbidity (COM) in an epidemiologic study and their association to monthly variation in suicide rates. Methods: 60,995 participants of the Health Study of Nord-Trondelag County in 1995-97 rated themselves on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in all months except July. All 10,670 male and 3833 female suicides in Norway from 1969 through 1996 were included. Results: The prevalence of comorbid anxiety and depression was highest in spring (April, May) and in October (P < 0.01). There was a correlation between the monthly variation in the national suicide rate and monthly variation in comorbid anxiety and depression (r=0.72, df=11, p=0.01) and for male alone (r=0.67, df=11, p=0.03). There was also a significant monthly variation in the prevalence of depression (p < 0.001) and no monthly variation in the prevalence of anxiety. Limitations: Limited information about the third of the population who did not take part in the HUNT-2 Study. HADS based depression and anxiety cover psychological symptoms, not somatic and social ones. In relation to DSM-IV and ICD-10 defined anxiety disorders and depressions, the sensitivity and specificity of HADS caseness, give a considerable number of false-positive cases. Conclusions: Increased prevalence of comorbid depression and anxiety in males during spring, and its association with suicidality should have clinical importance, as identification and treatment could influence suicide rates.

AB Child and adolescent inpatient treatment has faced major changes since the year 2000, including shorter inpatient stays and a greater use of psychotropic drugs. This study explored changes and correlates of suicidal threats and suicide acts among inpatients, by comparing Finnish cross-sectional surveys from 2000 to 2011. A questionnaire that explored the background, diagnosis and treatment characteristics of inpatients was sent to all child and psychiatric wards in Finland. The data collection was carried out on specified days in 2000 and 2011. We received comprehensive data on 504 patients from 64/69 (93%) wards in 2000 and on 412 patients from 75/79 (95%) wards in 2011. The Spectrum of Suicidal Behaviour Scale was used to explore suicidality. The prevalence of suicidality did not change in this nationwide study: suicidal threat rates were 38% in 2000 and 37% in 2011, and suicide attempts in both years were 11%. The prevalence of suicidal acts was higher among girls and teenagers, while low general functioning, defined as Children's Global Assessment Scale scores of under 30, was associated with both suicidal threats and acts. Violent acts were associated with both suicidal threats and acts in 2000, but not in 2011. Despite changes in treatment practices and shorter inpatient stays, the prevalence of suicidality in child and adolescent inpatient treatment remained unchanged in Finland in 2000 and 2011.

AB Objective: There are no studies investigating the degree of nicotine dependence (ND) and suicidality among underage adolescents. Our aim was to investigate the relationship between ND,aid various forms of suicidal behavior among adolescent psychiatric inpatients in Finland.
   Methods: Data were collected from 508 patients (age, 12-17 years) admitted to inpatient psychiatric hospitalization between April 2001 and March 2006. The level of ND was assessed by the modified Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire. Information on adolescents' suicide attempts and self-mutilation as well as psychiatric Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Fourth Edition. diagnoses was obtained by using the Schedule for Affective Disorder and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children.
   Results: After adjusting for adolescents' age and psychiatric diagnoses, a more than 4-fold risk for suicide attempts (odds ratio [OR], 4.7; 95%, confidence interval [CI], 1.3-17.2) and self-mutilative behavior (OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 1.6-13.3) was found among female adolescents with a high level of ND compared to nonsmoking adolescent females. In addition, the risk for suicide attempts was only increased by a high level of ND, whereas the risk for self-mutilation was increased among females with mild ND as well. Among males, the level of ND was not associated with suicide attempts or self-mutilative behavior.
   Conclusions: The level of ND should be taken into account when evaluating adolescent suicidality. Further sex-specific studies with accurate measurements of nicotine and its metabolites in relation to various suicidal and self-destructive behaviors are needed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB Aim: To evaluate the frequencies of different agents used in self-poisonings and acute factors contributing to intoxication of patients aged 12-18 years in northern Finland. Material: Retrospective medical record review of all hospitalized patients during the period from January 1, 1991 to December 31, 2006. Outcome measures: Cause of the admission, contributing factors, readmissions within one year. Results: There were 309 admissions during the period, 54% were females. The leading cause of admission was alcohol, in 222 cases (71.8%). Hospitalizations related to alcohol consumption were associated with accidental poisoning in recreational use. There were no acute contributing factors in the majority of all patients. Over one-third of all intoxications were intentional self-harm, although previously diagnosed psychiatric diseases were rare. Conclusions: It is crucial to recognize adolescent psychiatric disorders in time and consult child and adolescent psychiatrist in case of poisoning.

DT Article
ID EXCESS MORTALITY; MENTAL-DISORDERS; SUICIDE; RISK; REGISTER; DEATH
AB Background. There are suggestions that mortality, especially that due to suicide, increases among schizophrenia patients during a period of declining psychiatric beds. We investigated the mortality of schizophrenia patients in the general population of Finland during the reduction of psychiatric beds during 1980-1996.
   Method. Patients hospitalized for schizophrenia before 31 December 1996, and alive on I January 1980 (n = 58 76 1) were identified via the National Hospital Discharge Register. General population data came from the National Population Register, and mortality data from the National Causes of Death Register. We calculated relative risks (RR) for total mortality, mortality due to natural causes (cancer, ischaemic heart disease, respiratory disease), unnatural causes (accident, homicide, suicide), and suicide.
   Results. Patients with schizophrenia had an increased mortality both from natural causes (RR 2-59, 95 % CI 2-55-2-63) and from suicide (RR 9-9, 95 % CI 9-43-10-30). The RR for both natural and unnatural deaths was highest among patients with < 5 years since onset of schizophrenia. Among them all-cause mortality rose in the 1990s, but decreased among patients with > 10 years from onset. Otherwise no major changes or linear trends were found in mortality during deinstitutionalization.
   Conclusions. Reduction of psychiatric beds did not generally increase the mortality of patients with schizophrenia. However, patients in their early years of illness experienced increased mortality after the steepest bed reduction. Improved recognition and treatment of somatic illness would benefit patients with schizophrenia.

AB Aims: Incidence and mortality rates of traumatic brain injury (TBI) were investigated by using the Northern Finland Birth Cohort. This cohort provides a valuable source of data from the population born in 1966 (n = 12,058) in the 2 northernmost provinces of Finland. Methods: The cohort was followed for 34 years, and data were gathered from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register and the Registry for Causes of Death by Statistics Finland. Results: The annual incidence of and mortality from TBI were 118 and 14/100,000, respectively. Case fatality was 12%. An estimated prevalence of TBI at the age of 34 years was 269/ 100,000. Peak occurrences were observed at the age of 6 - 7 years in both genders and at the age of 18 - 23 years in men. The proportion of TBI mortality out of total mortality was 12%. Young men aged 16 - 34 years had 10-fold proportionate mortality from TBI compared to boys aged <= 15 years. Alcohol drinking was associated with a particularly prominent number of intentional injuries in young men. Conclusion: Incidence and mortality rates of TBI vary according to age and gender. Peaks occur in children at the age of school entry and in men at the age of 18 - 23 years. Children have mild injuries, whereas the injuries of young men are frequently intentional and fatal and associated with alcohol drinking. Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB The present study examines the association of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) to suicidal behavior and mortality in 508 Finnish adolescents (aged 12-17 years) who required acute psychiatric hospitalization between April 2001 and March 2006. The Schedule for Affective Disorder and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children Present and Lifetime (K-SADS-PL) and the European Addiction Severity Index (EuropASI) were used to obtain information about ACEs, adolescents' suicidal behavior and psychiatric diagnoses. The cases of death were obtained from Statistics Finland. The results of our study indicated that, among girls, exposure to sexual abuse statistically significantly increased the risk of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) (OR, 1.8; 95 % CI, 1.0-3.2) and suicide attempts (OR, 2.3; 95 % CI, 1.0-4.5). The cumulative number of ACEs was also associated with an increased risk of NSSI (OR, 1.2; 95 % CI, 1.0- 1.4) and suicide attempts (OR, 1.2; 95 % CI, 1.0-1.4) in girls. Among all deceased adolescents, ACEs were most notable among those who had died due to accidents and injuries. Gender differences in the types of ACEs were noted and discussed.

AB Background: Filicide, the killing of one's child, is an extraordinary form of homicide. It has commonly been associated with suicide and parental psychiatric illness. In the research on filicide, nationwide studies with comparison groups, specific perpetrator subgroups, and assessment of possible risk factors have been called for. The purpose of the current study was to provide all that.
   Methods: In this nationwide register-based case-control study all filicide offenders who were in a forensic psychiatric examination in Finland 1995-2004 were examined and compared with an age-and gender matched control group of homicide offenders. The assessed variables were psychosocial history, index offence, and psychiatric variables as well as psychopathy using the PCLR.
   Results: Filicide offenders were not significantly more often diagnosed with psychotic disorders than the controls but they had attempted suicide at the crime scene significantly more often. Filicide offenders had alcohol abuse/dependence and antisocial personality less often than the controls. Filicide offenders scored significantly lower on psychopathy than the controls. Within the group of filicide offenders, the psychopathy items with relatively higher scores were lack of remorse or guilt, shallow affect, callous/lack of empathy, poor behavioral controls, and failure to accept responsibility.
   Conclusion: Since filicide offenders did not seem significantly more mentally disordered than the other homicide offenders, psychiatry alone cannot be held responsible for the prevention of filicide. Extensive international studies are needed to replicate our findings and provide more specific knowledge in order to enhance prevention.

TI Prevention of suicide with regulations aimed at restricting access to

AB Background Pesticide self-poisoning accounts for 14-20% of suicides worldwide. Regulation aimed at restricting access to pesticides or banning highly hazardous pesticides is one approach to reducing these deaths. We systematically reviewed the evidence of the effectiveness of pesticide regulation in reducing the incidence of pesticide suicides and overall suicides.
   Methods We did a systematic review of the international evidence. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase for studies published between Jan 1, 1960, and Dec 31, 2016, which investigated the effect of national or regional bans, and sales or import restrictions, on the availability of one or more pesticides and the incidence of suicide in different countries. We excluded other interventions aimed at limiting community access to pesticides. We extracted data from studies presenting pesticide suicide data and overall suicide data from before and after national sales restrictions. Two reviewers independently assessed papers for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We undertook a narrative synthesis of the data in each report, and where data were available for the years before and after a ban, we pooled data for the 3 years before and the 3 years after to obtain a crude estimate of the effect of the ban. This study is registered through PROSPERO, number CRD42017053329.
   Findings We identified 27 studies undertaken in 16 countries-five low-income or middle-income countries (Bangladesh, Colombia, India, Jordan and Sri Lanka), and 11 high-income countries (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, UK, and USA). Assessments largely focused on national bans of specific pesticides (12 studies of bans in six countries-Jordan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Greece [ Crete], South Korea, and Taiwan) or sales restrictions (eight studies of restrictions in five countries-India, Denmark, Ireland, the UK and the USA). Only five studies used optimum analytical methods. National bans on commonly ingested pesticides in five of the six countries studied, including four studies using optimum analytical methods, were followed by reductions in pesticide suicides and, in three of these countries, falls in overall suicide mortality. Greece was the only country studied that did not show a decrease in pesticide suicide following a ban. There were no high-quality studies of restricting sales to people for occupational uses; four of the seven studies (in three of the five countries studied-India, Denmark, and the USA) showed sales restrictions were followed by decreases in pesticide suicides; one of the two studies investigating trends in overall suicide mortality reported a fall in deaths in Denmark, but there were also decreases in suicide deaths from other methods.
   Interpretation National bans on highly hazardous pesticides, which are commonly ingested in acts of self-poisoning, seem to be effective in reducing pesticide-specific and overall suicide rates. Evidence is less consistent for sales restrictions. A worldwide ban on the use of highly hazardous pesticides is likely to prevent tens of thousands of deaths every year. Copyright (C) The Author(s).

AB Objective: This study analyzed gender-specific mortality of patients with a first episode of schizophrenic illness, particularly deaths from circulatory system diseases and suicide. Methods: This was a nationwide register- based five-year follow-up study of all patients with onset of schizophrenia between 1995 and 2001. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated by matching patients' data with the general Finnish population on age, gender, and place of residence. Results: During the five-year follow-up of 7,591 schizophrenia patients, 403 (5%) patients died. They had 4.45-fold higher mortality than the general population, and patients' mortality was significantly elevated in all age groups. The SMRs for all-cause mortality, circulatory system diseases, and suicides were higher for females than males in almost all age groups. The largest single unnatural cause of death was suicide. In natural causes of death, the SMR for ill-defined and unknown causes of death was almost 25. Total mortality, circulatory deaths, and suicides differed among the 20 hospital districts examined. Regional variations in SMRs were not associated with population characteristics or psychiatric health care resources of a hospital district. Conclusions: In this nationwide register-based study, excess mortality among persons with schizophrenia was clearly observed. Regional differences in mortality were evident, indicating a need for further research to understand the mortality gap and why it might vary regionally. (Psychiatric Services 61: 272-279, 2010)

AB Background: Lower mortality among migrants than in the general population has been found in many, but not in all, previous studies. The mortality of migrants has not been studied in Finland, which has a relatively small and recent migrant population.
   Methods: People who were born abroad and whose mother tongue is not Finnish were identified from the Finnish Central Population Register (n = 185 605). A Finnish-born control matched by age, sex and place of residence was identified for each case (n = 185 605). Information about deaths was collected from the Finnish Causes of Death Register. Cox proportional hazards model was used for assessing the association between migrant status and death in 2011-13.
   Results: The mortality risk was found to be significantly lower for migrants than for Finnish controls (adjusted hazard ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.72-0.84), both for migrant men (aHR 0.80, 95% CI 0.73-0.89) and women (aHR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70-0.88). The difference was statistically significant only among people who were not married and among people who were not in employment. There was variation by country of birth, but no migrant group had higher mortality than Finnish controls. No differences in mortality were found by duration of residence in Finland. The higher mortality of Finnish controls was largely explained by alcoholrelated conditions and external causes of death.
   Conclusions: The mortality risk of migrants is lower than of people who were born in Finland. Possible explanations include selection and differences in substance use and other health behaviour.

AB Our aim was to investigate the association between alcohol dependence and suicidal behavior among adolescent girls and boys suffering from conduct disorder (CD). The original study sample consisted of 387 adolescents (age 12-17) admitted to psychiatric inpatient care between April 2001 and May 2005. DSM-IV-based psychiatric diagnoses and variables measuring suicidal behavior were obtained from the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children-Present and Lifetime (KSADS-PL). Of the total study population, 59 adolescent girls and 82 boys had CD according to DSM-IV criteria. Of all adolescents with CD, 24 (40.7%) girls and 24 (29.3%) boys were suffering from alcohol dependence. Among girls with CD, alcohol dependence increased the risk for suicide attempts up to 3.8-fold (95% CI 1.1-13.4). Among boys with CD, alcohol dependence increased the risk for life-threatening suicide attempt over nine-fold (95% CI 1.2-80.1). In addition, the risk for self-mutilative behavior was as high as 3.9-fold (95% CI 1.1-13.8) among girls and 5.3-fold (95% CI 1.1-26.5) among boys. The results indicate that, among adolescents suffering from CD, the risk of suicidal behavior is considerably increased by co-morbid alcohol dependence, which should therefore be carefully taken into account in clinical work.

AB Background Lower mortality has been systematically found in married when compared with non-married, especially in men, but little is known about marital status differences in mortality from external causes. Furthermore, the role of cohabitation and partnership history in the formation of these differences and how they have been changed over time are poorly understood.
   Methods The incidence of fatal and non-fatal cases of accidents, violence and suicides by partnership history was analysed during 1991-1997 and 2001-2007 in a representative sample of the Finnish population aged 26-59 years. HRs were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models.
   Results Incidence rates in accidents, violence and suicides were generally lower in men and women living with a partner than those living alone. Current cohabitation and previous divorce increased the risk of all of these outcomes when compared with married without previous divorce. Higher incidence rates were found in men who had divorced 3 years ago or earlier when compared with those who had divorced later. Generally, these differences were larger in fatal than in non-fatal cases and significantly larger in men. There was little change in these differences between 1991-1997 and 2001-2007. These differences were partly explained by socioeconomic factors but remained statistically significant also after these adjustments.
   Conclusions Currently living without a partner and cohabitation and previous divorce increased the risk of accidents, violence and suicides. This indicates that also other mechanisms than immediate support from a partner are important in the formation of marital status differences in mortality.

ID EPIDEMIOLOGY; DEATHS
AB Background and Aims: Expanding violence may necessitate treatment of explosion victims, requiring a broadening of existing medical skills and knowlegde of injury mechanisms. The aim of the study was to assess the number, nature and injury pattern of fatal explosion incidents in Finland.
   Material and Methods: Retrospective analysis of explosion-related deaths from January 1985 to December 2004. Death certificates were obtained and reviewed.
   Results: Over the 20-year period from 1985 to 2004, only 61 inviduals died in Finland as a result of unintentional or unspecified explosion related events. A homemade bomb assault for unknown motives killed seven people in a suburb in 2002. The incidence was 5.7 cases per 10 000 000 person-years. Suicides using explosives were slightly more common; on average 4 cases per year (6.7 cases per 10 000 000 person-years). A small increase in the fatality trend was noticeable during the last years of the study period.
   Conclusions: The incidence of fatal explosion injuries is a minor problem, but a small increase can be seen during the last few years. Victims of such injuries required only minimal hospital resources, because in most cases they died at the scene. Our results suggest that efforts to prevent fatalities related to explosives or corresponding devices, or to reduce their number, should focus on prevention of intentions.

AB IMPORTANCE Although psychiatric inpatients are recognized to be at increased risk for suicide immediately after hospital discharge, little is known about the extent to which their short-term suicide risk varies across groups with major psychiatric disorders.
   OBJECTIVE To describe the risk for suicide during the 90 days after hospital discharge for adults with first-listed diagnoses of depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, substance use disorder, and other mental disorders in relation to inpatients with diagnoses of nonmental disorders and the general population.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This national retrospective longitudinal cohort included inpatients aged 18 to 64 years in the Medicaid program who were discharged with a first-listed diagnosis of a mental disorder (depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, substance use disorder, and other mental disorder) and a 10% random sample of inpatients with diagnoses of nonmental disorders. The cohort included 770 643 adults in the mental disorder cohort, 1 090 551 adults in the nonmental disorder cohort, and 370 deaths from suicide from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2007. Data were analyzed from March 5, 2015, to June 6, 2016.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Suicide rates per 100 000 person-years were determined for each study group during the 90 days after hospital discharge and the demographically matched US general population. Adjusted hazard ratios (ARHs) of short-term suicide after hospital discharge were also estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression models. Information on suicide as a cause of death was obtained from the National Death Index.
   RESULTS In the overall population of 1861194 adults (27% men; 73% women; mean [SD] age, 35.4 [13.1] years), suicide rates for the cohorts with depressive disorder (235.1 per 100 000 person-years), bipolar disorder (216.0 per 100 000 person-years), schizophrenia (168.3 per 100 000 person-years), substance use disorder (116.5 per 100 000 person-years), and other mental disorders (160.4 per 100 000 person-years) were substantially higher than corresponding rates for the cohort with nonmental disorders (11.6 per 100 000 person-years) or the US general population (14.2 per 100 000 person-years). Among the cohort with mental disorders, AHRs of suicide were associated with inpatient diagnosis of depressive disorder (AHR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4-2.8; reference cohort, substance use disorder), an outpatient diagnosis of schizophrenia (AHR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.2), an outpatient diagnosis of bipolar disorder (AHR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1), and an absence of any outpatient health care in the 6 months preceding hospital admission (AHR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.5).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE After psychiatric hospital discharge, adults with complex psychopathologic disorders with prominent depressive features, especially patients who are not tied into a system of health care, appear to have a particularly high short-term risk for suicide.

AB This study aimed to discover gender differences in filicide offenders' psychiatric diagnoses, history, and other mental health-related variables. This nationwide register-based study covered all filicide offenders (n=124) in Austria and Finland in 1995-2005. There were 79 female and 45 male offenders. Both genders had an equally challenged childhood. The filicidal fathers were older than the mothers, mean ages 37.5 and 31.6 years, respectively (p0.001). Filicidal fathers committed suicide at the crime scene more often than the mothers (38% vs. 15%, p0.05). Of the examined parents, fathers were diagnosed more often with substance abuse/dependence (39% vs. 2%, p0.001) and mothers with a psychotic disorder (35% vs. 13%, p0.05). During the year preceding the crime, 25 (32%) of the mothers and 13 (29%) of the fathers had sought help for mental health-related problems. Service providers need specific strategies to support parents in distress, especially when depressive symptoms are present.

AB The purpose of this retrospective study was to illustrate the differences in maternal and paternal filicides in Finland during a 25-year period. In the sample of 200 filicides [neonaticides (n = 56), filicide-suicides (n = 75), other filicides (n = 69)], the incidence was 5.09 deaths per 100,000 live births: 59 percent of filicides were committed by mothers, 39 percent by fathers, and 2 percent by stepfathers. The mean age of the maternal victims (1.6 y) was significantly lower than that of the paternal victims (5.6 y), but no correlation between the sex of the victim and the sex of the perpetrator was found, and the number of female and male victims was equal. The sample of other filicides (n = 65) was studied more closely by forensic psychiatric examination and review of collateral files. Filicidal mothers showed mental distress and often had psychosocial stressors of marital discord and lack of support. They often killed for altruistic reasons and in association with suicide. Maternal perpetrators also dominated in filicide cases in which death was caused by a single episode or recurrent episodes of battering. Psychosis and psychotic depression were diagnosed in 51 percent of the maternal perpetrators, and 76 percent of the mothers were deemed not responsible for their actions by reason of insanity. Paternal perpetrators, on the other hand, were jealous of their mates, had a personality disorder (67%), abused alcohol (45%), or were violent toward their mates. In 18 percent of the cases, they were not held responsible for their actions by reason of insanity. During childhood, most of the perpetrators had endured emotional abuse from their parents or guardians, some of whom also engaged in alcohol abuse and domestic violence. The purpose of this study was to examine the differences between maternal and paternal filicides in a sample of 200 cases in Finland. This report also provides a psychosocial profile of the perpetrator and victim in 65 filicides and a discussion of the influence of diagnoses on decisions regarding criminal responsibility.

AB Aim of the Study. To characterize suicide seasonality in the Odessa region, to estimate the relation of this phenomenon to day length and ambient temperature. Methods. The research is based on the analysis of 11220 cases of completed suicides in the city of Odessa and Odessa region in 2000-2016. Initial data are presented by the Odessa Regional Forensic Bureau. All data were processed statistically, previously being reduced to a single scale, taking into account the different number of days in the months of the year. To study the null statistical hypothesis about the equality of the proportions of suicides per month of the year, a binomial criterion with a two-sided critical region was used. Results. Suicides in Odessa region grow from March to August, the maximum is seen in May-June, while the minimum can be observed in December-February. Seasonality pattern in Odessa region is rather strongly marked. Thus, an average number of suicides in May for 58% exceeds that in December. The autumn peak (in October) is less pronounced and unstable. Recently two main pathophysiological hypotheses are proposed as an explanation of a phenomenon of the seasonality of suicidal behavior - about a role of a light and temperature factor. For the purpose of identification of differential influence of these factors correlation and the graphic coincidence of curves of suicides, longitudes of day and of a temperature within a year were estimated. An extremely high correlation between the daylight hours and the frequency of suicides was found (linear correlation coefficient r=0,97, significance value 1,3 . 10-7). It was also found that suicides are closest to average during the year (expected from the point of view of a null hypothesis) in March and September, i.e. around spring and autumn equinox. In all other months of the year, when the length of the day is less, the proportion of suicides is significantly less than expected; on the contrary, longer day hours are associated with higher than expected frequency of suicide. At the same time, an association with the temperature factor is also observed, and to a greater extent with the derivative of the monthly temperature, which reflects the rapidity of the change. More precisely, the derivative of the monthly temperature curve is shifted one month forward from suicides curve, which may be attributed to the provocative role of the temperature factor. Conclusion. The obtained data support the role of both factors and the imply the presence in the population of suicide completers two certain subpopulations, whose self-aggressive behavior is mainly dependent on the day length (which implies the role of serotonin/melatonin dynamics) or the ambient temperature (which implies the role of neural and humoral mechanisms of thermoadaptation). To confirm this hypothesis more studies are needed in the regions with a bigger contrast of summer and winter temperatures and in more northern and southern latitudes differing in the insolation pattern. Seasonal variations in the number of suicides in Odessa and the Odessa region for the period 2000-2016 are analyzed. All data were processed statistically, previously being reduced to a single scale, taking into account the different number of days in the months of the year. Suicides in the Odessa region grow from March to August, the maximum is seen in May-June. The autumn peak (in October) is less pronounced and unstable.

AB Background: Previous studies have shown that maternal grand multiparity may predict an increased risk of mental disorders in young adult offspring, but whether such effects persist throughout adulthood remains unknown. The current study examined if maternal grand multiparity predicts the risks of severe mental disorders, suicides, suicide attempts and dementias throughout adult life.
   Methods: Our study sample comprised 13243 Helsinki Birth Cohort Study 1934-1944 participants (6905 men and 6338 women). According to hospital birth records, 341 offspring were born to grand multiparous mothers. From Finnish national hospital discharge and causes of death registers, we identified 1682 participants diagnosed with mental disorders during 1969-2010.
   Results: Maternal grand multiparity predicted significantly increased risks of mood disorders (Hazard Ratio=1.64, p=0.03), non-psychotic mood disorders (Hazard Ratio=2.02, p=0.002), and suicide attempts (Hazard Ratio=3.94, p=0.01) in adult offspring. Furthermore, women born to grand multiparous mothers had significantly increased risks of any severe mental disorder (Hazard Ratio=1.79, p=0.01), non-psychotic substance use disorders (Hazard Ratio=2.77, p=0.02) schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders (Hazard Ratio=2.40, p=0.02), mood disorders (Hazard Ratio=2.40, p=0.002), non-psychotic mood disorders (Hazard Ratio=2.91, p<0.001), and suicide attempts (Hazard Ratio=5.05, p=0.01) in adulthood. The effects of maternal grand multiparity on offspring psychopathology risk were independent of maternal age and body mass index at childbirth, and of year of birth, sex, childhood socioeconomic position, and birth weight of the offspring. In contrast, no significant effects were found among men.
   Conclusions: Women born to grand multiparous mothers are at an increased risk of severe mental disorders and suicide attempts across adulthood. Our findings may inform the development of preventive interventions for mental disorders.

TI Polypharmacy With Antipsychotics, Antidepressants, or Benzodiazepines

   MONOTHERAPY; MEDICATION
AB Context: Polypharmacy is widely used in the treatment of schizophrenia, although it is believed to have major adverse effects on the well-being of patients.
   Objective: To investigate if the use of benzodiazepines, antidepressants, or multiple concomitant antipsychotics is associated with increased mortality among patients with schizophrenia.
   Design: Registry-based case linkage study.
   Setting: Academic research.
   Patients: We linked national databases of mortality and medication prescriptions among a complete nationwide cohort of 2588 patients hospitalized in Finland for the first time with a diagnosis of schizophrenia between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2007.
   Main Outcome Measures: Hazard ratios (HRs) were computed for all-cause mortality during the use of antipsychotics, antidepressants, or benzodiazepines in outpatient care, adjusting for the effects of sociodemographic and clinical variables, geographic location, and current and past pharmacological treatments.
   Results: Compared with antipsychotic monotherapy, concomitant use of 2 or more antipsychotics was not associated with increased mortality (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.51-1.44). Similarly, antidepressant use was not associated with a higher risk for mortality (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.28-1.16) and was associated with markedly decreased suicide deaths (HR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03-0.77). However, benzodiazepine use was associated with a substantial increase in mortality (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.13-3.22), and this was attributable to suicidal deaths (HR, 3.83; 95% CI, 1.45-10.12) and to nonsuicidal deaths (HR, 1.60; 95% CI, 0.86-2.97). In total, 826 of 904 patients (91.4%) who used benzodiazepines had purchased prescriptions that contained more than 28 defined daily doses, violating treatment guidelines.
   Conclusions: Benzodiazepine use was associated with a marked increase in mortality among patients with schizophrenia, whereas the use of an antidepressant or several concomitant antipsychotics was not. Antidepressant use was associated with decreased suicide deaths. The literature indicates that long-term use of benzodiazepines among patients with schizophrenia is more prevalent in other countries (eg, the United States) compared with Finland, which suggests that benzodiazepine use may contribute to mortality among this patient population worldwide.

AB Background and Aims: The death of any young individual is associated with the loss of many potentially fulfilling years of life. It has been suggested that the relative mortality of fracture patients may be higher in younger age groups than in older cohorts. We determined the mortality and causes of death in a cohort of 16- to 30-year-old patients that had been hospitalized for fractures. Material and Methods: We collected data using criteria based on the diagnosis code (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision), surgical procedure code (Nordic Medico-Statistical Committee), and seven additional characteristics of patients admitted to the trauma ward at the Central Finland Hospital between 2002 and 2008. Patients were then followed to ascertain their mortality status until the end of 2012. Standardized mortality ratios were calculated and causes of death were determined by combining our registry data with data provided by Statistics Finland. Results: During the study, 199 women and 525 men aged 16-30 years had sustained fractures. None of these patients died during the primary hospital stay. At the end of follow-up (mean duration 7.4 years), 6 women and 23 men had died. The standardized mortality ratio for all patients was 6.2 (95% Confidence Interval: 4.3-8.9). Suicides and intoxications comprised over half, and motor vehicle accidents and homicides comprised nearly a third of the post-fracture deaths. Conclusion: We found a concerning increase in mortality among young adults that had been hospitalized due to a fracture compared to the general population that had been standardized by age, sex, and calendar-period. Leading causes of death were suicides and intoxications or motor vehicle accidents and homicides, which may be indicative of depressive disorders or impulse control disorders, respectively. Identification of the underlying psychosocial problems may provide an opportunity for preventive interventions.

AB Background: Few studies have investigated risk factors for suicidal ideation and attempts, or possible variations in them, among representative samples of psychiatric patients with major depressive disorder.
   Method: As part of the Vantaa Depression Study in Vantaa, Finland, 269 patients with DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD), diagnosed by interview using semistructured World Health Organization Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry, version 2.0, and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Personality Disorders, were thoroughly investigated. Information was gathered on patients levels of depression, anxiety, hopelessness, perceived social support, social and occupational functioning, and alcohol use. Suicidal behavior was assessed by interviews, including the Scale for Suicidal Ideation, and by information from psychiatric records. Data were gathered from Feb. 1, 1997, to May 31, 1998.
   Results: During the current MDD episode, 58% of all patients had experienced suicidal ideation; among the 15% of the total who had attempted suicide, almost all (95%) had also had suicidal ideation. In nominal regression models predicting suicidal ideation, hopelessness, alcohol dependence or abuse, low level of social and occupational functioning, and poor perceived social support were found to be significant (p < .05) independent risk factors. High severity of depression and current alcohol dependence or abuse in particular, but also younger age and low level of social and occupational functioning, predicted suicide attempt.
   Conclusion: Suicidal ideation is prevalent and appears to be a precondition for suicide attempts among psychiatric patients with MDD. The risk factors for suicidal ideation and attempts locate in several clinical and psychosocial domains. While these risk factors largely overlap, the overall level of psychopathology of suicide attempters is higher compared with that in patients with ideation, and substance use disorders and severity of depression may be of particular importance in predicting suicide attempts.

AB Diet may affect mood and cognitive functions. Tryptophan and serine augmentation strategies have been applied for patients with mood or psychotic disorders. We studied the association between dietary intake of amino acids and low mood. We studied 29,133 men aged 50-69 years for 5-8 years in a population-based trial in Finland. Intake of amino acids was calculated from a diet history questionnaire completed by 27,111 men at baseline. Self-reports of depressed mood were recorded thrice a year, data on hospital treatment due to depressive disorders were derived from the national Hospital Discharge Register, and suicides were identified from death certificates. Participants were smokers at study entry. Strengths of our study include detailed data on food consumption, a substantial number of study participants, a long prospective follow-up time, and versatile data on indices of low mood. We found no association between the dietary intake of amino acids and self-report of depressed mood or risk of suicide. However, dietary intake of lysine and serine was associated with risk of hospital treatment due to major depressive disorder but these associations disappeared after excluding from analysis those who bad reported depressed mood at study entry. There is no consistent association between dietary intake of amino acids and low mood. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Background. A national study in Finland showed significantly higher death rates associated with abortion than with childbirth. Our objective was to examine this association using an American population over a longer period.
   Methods. California Medicaid records for 173,279 women who had an induced abortion or it delivery in 1989 were linked to death certificates for 1989 to 1997.
   Results. Compared with women who delivered, those who aborted had it significantly higher age-adjusted risk of death from all causes (1.62), from suicide (2.54), and from accidents (1.82), as well as a higher relative risk of death from natural causes (1.14), including the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (2.18), circulatory diseases (2.87), and cerebrovascular disease (5.46). Results are stratified by age and time.
   Conclusions. Higher death rates associated with abortion Persist over time and across socioeconomic boundaries. This may be explained by self-destructive tendencies, depression, and other unhealthy behavior aggravated by the abortion experience.

AB A season of birth effect in addictive disorders has scarcely been studied. As smoking is known to be a highly addictive behavior, we examined whether there exists an association between season of birth and smoking habits among the general population in the Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort (NFBC, n = 8,319). The birth month of each cohort member was categorized into one of the four seasons: spring (March-May), summer (June-August), autumn (September-November), or winter (December-February). Smoking habits of the cohort members were assessed by a postal questionnaire at the age of 31 yrs. Those who reported that they regularly smoked 11 or more cigarettes/day were regarded as heavy smokers. The association between season of birth and smoking was assessed with a logistic regression analysis: first, after controlling for early pregnancy-related and perinatal characteristics (Model 1) and second, after controlling for cohort members' hospital-treated psychiatric disorders, suicide attempts, adult educational level, and marital status (Model 2). Compared to males born in winter, the likelihood for heavy daily smoking was significantly increased, up to 1.3-fold, among males born in the autumn in both logistic regression models. However, among females the likelihood for heavy smoking was statistically significantly elevated among those born during any season other than winter. Season of birth may modify the development of dopaminergic or other neurotransmitter systems divergently among males and females. Altered expression of dopaminergic genes due to environmental climatic factors could explain the association between season of birth and heavy smoking. (Author correspondence: kaisa.riala@oulu.fi).

AB Objective: Intimate partner homicides (IPHs) continue to be widespread and constant over time when compared with other types of homicide. Yet research addressing IPH particularly within the European context, is limited. The question of whether perpetrators of partner-related violence differ from offenders of general violence has been raised in research. In light of inconsistent findings and ongoing debate, the aim was to identify sociodemographic and criminological characteristics in perpetrators and victims of IPH, and to determine whether they differ from other types of homicides in Sweden. Method: This retrospective study was based on national data of all male-perpetrated homicides (N = 211) in Sweden committed between 2007 and 2009. Characteristics of IPH (n = 46) and non-IPH (n = 165) were compared and analyzed by conducting bivariate and multiple logistic regressions. Results: Perpetrators of IPH were older, more likely to be employed, less likely to have been convicted, and had less persistent criminal histories. Perpetrators of IPH were also less likely to be intoxicated at the time of the offense; nonetheless, intoxication was a common feature among victims and perpetrators in both groups. Further, perpetrators of partner-related homicides are substantially more likely to commit suicide. Conclusion: The present study illustrates critical differences between IPH and non-IPH perpetrators. As hypothesized, IPH perpetrators were less socially disadvantaged, less likely to have past criminal offenses, and more likely to commit suicide following the homicidal act. This study demonstrates that perpetrators of IPH constitute a separate subtype and, conceptually, ought to be treated separately.

AB Driver fatalities in motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) encompass accidents, suicides, and natural deaths when driving. The objective of this study was to determine the significance of pathology and other autopsy findings for drivers in fatal MVCs. Forensic autopsy records of driver fatalities in southeast Norway between 2000 and 2014 were studied retrospectively. Data from individual police and collision investigation reports were also collected and analyzed. In 406 driver fatalities, the male/female ratio was 340/66; 9% died from natural causes, 9% were suicides, 65% were culpable accidental deaths, 14% were nonculpable deaths, and 3% were undetermined deaths. Head injuries and thoracic injuries were the most common causes of death. A seatbelt had been worn in 50% of the fatalities, and its prevalence did not differ between accidental deaths and suicides. Blood levels of alcohol and/or drugs that indicated impairment at the time of the collision were found in 40% (105/262) of all culpable accidental deaths but in 50% (64/127) of drivers aged up to 35 years. Pathology (most often cardiovascular disease) suggestive of sudden incapacitation before the collision was present in 24% (62/264) of drivers who were culpable in the accident and in 70% (46/66) of culpable drivers older than 55 years. A substantial proportion of drivers are killed in accidental collisions that may have occurred as a result of either alcohol/drug impairment or preexisting disease. Suicides and natural deaths both constitute significant proportions of MVC fatalities and may be misclassified unless a full inquest including an autopsy is performed.

TI Injury mortality in the European Union 1984-1993 - An overview
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE epidemiology; injury; mortality; trends
AB Background: Approximately 190,000 European Union (EU) citizens die annually as a result of an injury. In response, the European Commission identified accidents and injuries as a priority area for action in the field of public health in 1993. In 1984, the World Health Organization (WHO) Health for All targets were set in Europe to reduce unintentional injuries by 25% and reverse the rising trends in suicide by the year 2000. The aim of this study was to examine the trends in mortality due to externally caused physical injuries between 1984 and 1993 in the 15 countries which are currently members of the EU. Methods: Injury mortality data for all countries were obtained from the WHO and national government agencies. Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated for both unintentional and intentional injuries and examined over time. Results: Downward trends in age-standardized injury mortality due to unintentional injuries were identified in most countries. Marked variations were observed between countries, with low rates in the UK, The Netherlands and Sweden and high rates in Finland, Portugal and France. Age-standardized suicide rates decreased in most countries over the study period, with marked variations between countries. In general, countries in northern Europe experienced higher suicide rates than countries in southern Europe. Mortality rates due to homicide and other violent causes were low and relatively stable over the study period. Conclusions: Most countries appear to be on track to meet the WHO targets for unintentional injury mortality and suicide mortality. However, disparities between countries remain, for reasons that are unclear. While mortality data were valuable in describing the epidemiology of fatal injury in Europe, agreement on standardized practices of data collection, coding and analysis would improve the comparability of data between countries.

AB Our objective was to compare sociodemographic conditions and risky/health behaviors affecting Turkish or Middle Eastern versus ethnic Swedes and Finnish immigrant adolescents, respectively.
   All eligible adolescents 13-18 years old (3,216 pupils) in a medium-sized town in Sweden completed a validated in-depth questionnaire (Q90), with 165 questions.
   One hundred and one adolescents were Turkish or Middle Eastern immigrants, while 73 were immigrants from Finland, a neighboring country to Sweden. Turkish/Middle Eastern immigrants were more likely to attend a theoretical program in school, were rarely bullied, as compared to ethnic Swedes and Finns. Turkish/Middle Eastern girls used alcohol at a lower frequency, and reported less depression and sexual experiences than ethnic Swedish girls and Finns. A higher frequency of Finnish adolescents had been bullied and had vandalized, and Finnish adolescents were also determined to have used tobacco and cannabis and to be heavy drinkers more frequently than boys from Turkey/the Middle East.
   We concluded that adolescent immigrants from Turkey and the Middle East seem to be well adapted to Sweden and also have ambitions for a higher education. Differences in risky behaviors were particularly pronounced in comparisons with immigrants from Finland for both boys and girls.

AB Background Most prospective studies on the relationship between sense of coherence (SOC) and mental health have been conducted using subjective health indicators and short-term follow-ups. The objective of this prospective occupational cohort study was to examine whether a strong sense of coherence is a protective factor against psychiatric disorders over a long period of time.
   Methods The study was conducted in a multinational forest industry corporation with domicile in Finland. Participants were 8029 Finnish industrial employees aged 18-65 at baseline (1986). Questionnaire survey data on SOC and other factors were collected at baseline; records of hospital admissions for psychiatric disorders and suicide attempt were derived from the National Hospital Discharge Register, while records of deaths due to suicide were derived from the National Death Registry up until 2006.
   Results During the 19-year follow-up, 406 participants with no prior admissions were admitted to hospital for psychiatric disorders (n = 351) or suicide attempt (n = 25) or committed a suicide (n = 30). A strong SOC was associated with about 40% decreased risk of psychiatric disorder. This association was not accounted for by mental health-related baseline characteristics, such as sex, age, marital status, education, occupational status, work environment, risk behaviours or psychological distress. The result was replicated in a subcohort of participants who did not report an elevated level of psychological distress at baseline (hazard ratio = 0.59, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.86).
   Conclusions A strong SOC is associated with reduced risk of psychiatric disorders during a long time period.

   DEPRESSION; SCALE; INVENTORY; RISK
AB Background. Most national suicide prevention strategies set improved detection and management of depression in primary health care into a central position. However, suicidal behaviour among primary-care patients with depressive disorders has been seldom investigated.
   Method. In the Vantaa Primary Care Depression Study, a total of 1119 primary-care patients in the City of Vantaa, Finland, aged 20 to 69 years, were screened for depression with the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) questionnaire. Depressive disorders were diagnosed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I), and the 137 patients with depressive disorder were included in the study. Suicidal behaviour was investigated cross-sectionally and retrospectively in three time-frames: current, current depressive episode, and lifetime. Current suicidal ideation was measured with the Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI), and previous ideation and suicide attempts were evaluated based on interviews plus medical and psychiatric records.
   Results. Within their lifetimes, 37% (51/137) of the patients had seriously considered suicide and 17% (23/137) attempted it. Lifetime suicidal behaviour was independently and strongly predicted by psychiatric treatment history and co-morbid personality disorder, and suicidal behaviour within the current episode was predicted most effectively by severity of depression.
   Conclusions. Based on these findings and their convergence with studies of completed suicides, prevention of suicidal behaviour in primary care should probably focus more on high-risk sub-groups of depressed patients, including those with moderate to severe major depressive disorder, personality disorder or a history of psychiatric care. Recognition Of Suicidal behaviour should be improved. The complex psychopathology of these patients in primary care needs to be considered in targeting preventive efforts.

AB Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate mortality and causes of death in older patients with schizophrenia in comparison with the general population. The mortality of patients experiencing relapse was also compared with those in remission. Methods The study sample consists of patients (n?=?9461) over 65?years by the first of January 1999, with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (ICD-8, ICD-9: 295, ICD-10: F20, F25) as the main register diagnosis during the period 19691998. The sample was collected from nationwide registers in Finland and followed up between 1999 and 2008. Results Overall Standard Mortality Ratio (SMR) of the older schizophrenia patients was 2.69 [95% confidence interval, 2.622.76]. For natural causes of death, overall SMR was 2.58 (2.512.65; n?=?5301), and for unnatural causes of death, it was 11.04 (9.7512.47; n?=?262). The most common causes of death matched those in the general population. Of patients who died during follow-up, 31% (1709/5596) had at least one psychiatric hospitalization within 5?years before follow-up. The SMR for this group was higher (3.92; 3.734.11) than in those patients (2.37; 2.292.44) with no such treatment during that time. Conclusion All-cause mortality of older patients with schizophrenia was almost threefold that of general population. They died for similar reasons to the general population; however, deaths for unnatural causes were especially common (accidents and suicides). Those patients still experiencing relapses in older age have an increased risk of death compared with those with schizophrenia in remission. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

   Design: A cross-sectional study with retrospective data.
   Subjects: All patients (n=1647) aged 16 years and over who had sustained traumatic spinal cord injury during the period 1976-2005, who were admitted to Kapyla Rehabilitation Centre, Helsinki, Finland, participated in the study.
   Methods: Demographic and clinical data were collected from the registers of Kapyla Rehabilitation Centre. Cause-specific mortality was assessed using Statistics Finland's official cause-of-death register.
   Results: During the observation period (1976-2007) 419 patients died. The main causes of death were respiratory disease (28%), cardiovascular disease (21%), suicide (10%) and external causes (9.5%). The mean age at death was 55.5 years for men and 58.2 years for women. Ten-year survival was 97.9%. Mortality was significantly affected by age at onset of injury, neurological level and extent of lesion. Survival of traumatic spinal cord injury patients was approximately 50% that of the general population, and survival of the general population was 80% during the follow-up period.
   Conclusion: These results support the need for improvements in long-term rehabilitative care and regular follow-up of patients with traumatic spinal cord injury. The importance of psychosocial follow-up services must be emphasized.

AB Adolescents who later develop schizophrenia are likely to have problems with motor coordination and many adolescents with schizophrenia have self-injurious behaviour before treatment of first psychosis but association between injuries in adolescence and onset of psychotic disorder is unknown. The aim of this study was to describe what type of injuries psychotic individuals had during adolescence and in which age these injuries occurred. The study population consists of 155 members of the Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort with diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disease and 620 matched controls. All injuries which had occurred before onset of psychosis were extracted from Finnish Hospital Discharge Register. Individuals with psychotic disorder were more likely to have a history of severe injury. During the age 12-19, 11% of psychotic subjects and 5.3% of healthy controls had an injury (z=2.38; P=0.017)and the most common type of injury was fractures. Our findings suggest that severe injury in adolescence may be a predictor of psychosis. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Fatal childhood injuries in Finland, 1971-2010
SO INJURY PREVENTION
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; CHILDREN; DEATHS; TRENDS; RATES
AB Background Childhood injuries are a major public health problem worldwide, injuries being the leading cause of death and disability from early childhood through adolescence.
   Objective To examine the 40-year nationwide trends in the number and incidence of fatal injuries among children aged 0-14 years in Finland, a country with a white European population of 5.3 million.
   Methods Data were obtained from the Official Cause-of-Death Statistics of Finland during 1971-2010. The main categories for unintentional injury deaths were road traffic injury, water traffic injury, falls, drowning and poisoning. For intentional injury deaths, the main categories were suicide and homicide.
   Results In 1971, there were 109 fatal injuries involving girls and 207 involving boys, and in 2010, these numbers were 10 and 16. The corresponding incidence rates (per 100 000 children per year) were 20.1 and 2.3 (girls), and 36.7 and 3.5 (boys). The reduction in fatal injuries was mostly due to fewer unintentional injuries. The greatest decline occurred in the number of fatal motor vehicle injuries: from 57 (girls) and 92 (boys) in 1971 to 5 (girls) and 2 (boys) in 2010. Drownings followed a similar pattern. Violence-related deaths also showed a decreasing trend. In 1971, there were 14 intentional deaths in girls and 15 in boys, while in 2010 these numbers were 0 and 3, respectively.
   Conclusions This nationwide study confirms a decline in childhood injury deaths over the last four decades, with the greatest declines occurring in the number of fatal motor vehicle injuries, drownings and intentional injuries.

AB To evaluate the mortality of patients certified to be suffering from vibration syndrome in the Kyushu region of Japan, the cohort consisting of 838 vibration syndrome patients who had worked at local forestry offices was followed up, A total of 15,208 person-yrs of follow-up data from 1966 to 1996 was analyzed. The mortality of the population of Kumamoto Prefecture, a central part of Kyushu region, was used to estimate the expected number. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% Cls) for specific causes were calculated. 208 deaths were observed. The mortality from all causes was similar between in the cohort studied and in the general population. The remarkable differences were seen in leukemia (SMR 370, 95% CI 227-1000) and suffocation (SMR 269, 95% CI 140 to 518). The excess mortality from leukemia in the cohort studied is likely due to exposure to wood dust or gasoline during forestry work and Human T-cell Leukemia Virus type I infection. The increased mortality from suffocation is possibly attributable to suicide.

AB Background: Fatal head-on collisions between passenger cars and trucks are sometimes thought as self-inflicted death of the passenger car drivers.
   Methods: A total of 378 Finnish drivers of light motor vehicles (LMV) died in collisions with heavy vehicles between the years 2002-2011. These male and female drivers, who were considered as being at fault, and whose collisions with heavy vehicles occurred in the oncoming vehicle's lane, were explored in relation to information on their socio-demographics, physical and mental health condition and driving-related factors.
   Results: Cause of death of at-fault LMV drivers, as defined in medico-legal examination, was most commonly accidental (51%), followed by suicide (32%), undetermined intent (17%) and acute illness (0.3%). Ten-year time trend in rates of LMV drivers has remained stable (Annual Percentage Change, APC = 0.03; p = 0.983), the annual proportion varying between 14%-21%. However, a statistically significantly increasing time trend was observed in fatal accidents due to suicides (APC = 5.31, p = 0.028). Generally, at-fault LMV drivers were characterized as having mental health problems susceptibility to risk (44%), personal relationship problems (33%), long-term physical illness (68%) or medication (35%) or driving under influence of alcohol (24%). Male LMV drivers, compared to women, were more commonly unmarried, farm/wood/industrial workers and drove alone and without a planned destination. Female LMV drivers were, more commonly than men, widowed, third degree students, skilled workers, had long term mental illnesses/disturbances, drove with family member(s) and their fatal accidents occurred in winter.
   Conclusion: The findings give support to the recommendation that suicidal ideation must be considered when assessing fitness-to-drive. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The stresses and life changes associated with migration may have harmful long-term health effects, especially for mental health. These effects are exceedingly difficult to establish, because migrants are typically a highly selected group.
   Methods: We examined the impact of migration on health using "naturally occurring "historical events. In this article, we use the forced migration of 11% of the Finnish population after WWII as such a natural experiment. We observed the date and cause of death starting from 1 January 1971 and ending in 31 December 2010 for the cohort of 242,075 people. Data were obtained by linking individual-level data from the 1950 and 1970 population censuses and the register of death certificates from 1971 to 2010 (10% random sample). All-cause and cause-specific mortalities were modeled using Poisson regression.
   Results: Models with full adjustment for background variables showed that both all-cause mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01, 1.05), and ischemic heart disease mortality (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.08, 1.15) were higher in the displaced population than in the nondisplaced population. Suicide mortality was lower (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64, 0.92) in displaced than in the general population.
   Conclusions: In our long-term follow-up study, forced migration was associated with increased risk of death due to ischemic heart diseases. In contrast, lower suicide mortality was observed in association with forced migration 25 years or more.

AB Premature death is a serious public health concern. The primary objective of this study was to examine premature deaths in terms of potential years of life lost (PYLL) in a cohort of 4817 treatment-seeking illicit drug users. Clients' data were linked to the Finnish national cause-of-death register and the follow-up period ranged from 31 January 1997 to 31 December 2010. PYLL before 70 years was calculated for all deaths and cause-specific deaths by gender. We observed 496 deaths (417 males and 79 females) at the end of 2010. The mean age at death was 33.8 years, 34.3 years for males (range 18-68) and 31.4 years for females (range 16-53). Overall, 17,951 life years were lost; 14,898 among males and 3053 among females. The overall PYLL rate for males was more than twice that of females (513.0/1000 vs. 243.7/1000 person-years) but the mean PYLL was higher in females than males (38.6 vs. 35.7 years). Of the total PYLL, 34.8 % was due to accidental overdose, and 24.0 % to suicide. In both genders, accidental overdose and suicide were the two top-ranking causes of PYLL. Premature deaths among drug users are a potential loss to the society. Our findings suggest that measures targeting accidental overdose and suicide are top priorities for reducing preventable loss of life.

AB Relatively little is known about fatal motor vehicle accidents (FMVA) involving drivers with psychiatric disorders. In this study of all drivers killed in FMVAs in Finland between 1990 and 2011, we aimed to study drivers' death rate trends in FMVAs, with special focus on drivers with a history of psychiatric disorders. Prevalence of drivers' hospital treated psychiatric disorders, and characteristics of drivers with psychiatric disorders were also studied. For the purpose of this study, three national registers were accessed. Drivers' hospital treated psychiatric disorders were screened in a five-year period prior to death. Drivers with (n = 425) and without (n = 3856) psychiatric disorders were compared, female and male drivers separately. The main outcome measure was any psychiatric disorder in drivers within the five-year timescale. Socio-demographic factors, use of intoxicants and medication at the time of death, recent adverse life events, and drivers' physical and emotional states were used as covariates in the statistical analyses. During the study period, death rates increased for females with psychiatric disorders, and decreased for females without psychiatric disorders. Death rates for males with psychiatric disorders decreased between the years 1990-2000 and 2007-2011, and increased between the years 2000-2007. Death rates decreased over the whole study period in males without psychiatric disorders. Alcohol related disorders and affective disorders were the most prevalent hospital treated psychiatric disorders among drivers involved in FMVAs. Use of medications at the time of death, and committing suicide in traffic both associated with being a driver with psychiatric disorders involved in FMVAs for both genders. As FMVAs involving drivers with psychiatric disorders have increased, a more focused and detailed evaluation of the driving performance of drivers with psychiatric disorders is recommended. These evaluations should also be extended to drivers with non-psychotic disorders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Socio-economic differences in mortality
SO REVUE DU PRATICIEN

DT Article
AB The ranking and frequency of the different causes of death vary according to social categories. The largest disparities in mortality are observed, at first for causes linked to alcohol consumption; then for diabetes, respiratory diseases, lung cancer, cerebrovascular diseases, stomach cancer, suicide, accidents, myocardial infarction, intestine and pancreas cancer For most of the causes of death, there is an increase in time trends in the level of the over-mortality of the group "manual workers-clerical" in comparison with the group "high level professional workers". European comparisons outlined that France and Finland have the more marked social differences in mortality. For France, this trend concerns all the causes of death apart from cardiovascular diseases and violent deaths. The role of excessive alcohol consumption is outlined as an explanation of this specific position of France.

AB A retrospective autopsy study of fatal deliberate self harm (FDSH) was undertaken in the mortuary of Kasturba Hospital, Manipal, Southern India over a period of 12 years (1993-2004). Out of 1917 cases autopsied, 21.2% were deaths due to deliberate self harm (I)SH). The male sex (66.1%) and victims in the third decade of life (35.9%) predominated. More than two-thirds of the decedents were married. More fatalities were observed during the winter season (35.8%) and in the day time (62.2%). Dispair with life (61.9%) was the most common motive for FDSH. The majority of fatalities were due to poisoning (73.5%), where organophosphorous compounds topped the list (71.9%). About one-third of the victims survived for 18 to 24 hours after DSH.

TI Comparison of Clinical Characteristics of Intentional vs Accidental
   Drowning Patients
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID SUICIDE; ALCOHOL; FINLAND; DEATHS
AB Purposes: Drowning may happen by accident or as a method of committing suicide. The aim of this study was to determine some characteristics of drowning patients who committed intentionally.
   Methods: A retrospective review was performed on 462 patients who visited the emergency department complaining of drowning between January 1998 and October 2011. Of these patients, we only included the patients for whom the cause could be identified. Age, sex, cause, time of drowning, season, mechanism, cardiopulmonary resuscitation performance, body temperature, alcohol ingestion, history of previous suicide attempts, outcome, and other characteristics were collected.
   Results: A total of 380 patients were included. Among them, 282 (74.2%) had drowned themselves intentionally, and they were older than those who had drowned accidentally (median age, 35.0 years [25.0-49.0 years] vs 26.5 years [19.0-35.5 years], P<.001) and showed lower body temperature (below 34 degrees C, 32.1% vs 12.2%, P=.027). Ninety-four cases (33.3%) jumped off the river from a bridge, and 185 (65.6%) walked into the river from the riverside. In the intentional group, 59 (20.9%) had depressive disorder in their history. The rate of death showed no clinical difference (19.5% vs 16.3%, P=.487), but more males died in the accidental group (61.8% vs 93.8%, P=.015).
   Conclusions: Intentional drowning happened more in older subjects and presented lower initial body temperature. Walking from the riverside happened more often than jumping off a bridge. More males died of drowning regardless of intentionality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE Epilepsy; Mortality; Survival; Finland; Cohort studies
ID PEOPLE; COHORT; POPULATION; ADULTS; SURVIVAL; SEIZURES
AB To estimate long-term mortality by cause of death in a nationwide, register-based cohort of newly diagnosed patients with epilepsy (PWE). All noninstitutionalized Finnish PWE aged 10-74 years (n = 10,818) eligible for reimbursement for antiepileptic medication for the first time between 1990 and 1994 were identified in the database of Social Insurance Institution of Finland. Mortality was compared against a population-based reference cohort (n = 43,894). Hazard ratios (HR) and their 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) during a follow-up of 18 years were estimated using proportional hazards modeling. Potential years of life lost (PYLL) and excess fraction of causes of death attributable to epilepsy were estimated. PWE contributed 137,610 person-years of observation and there were 3,558 deaths. Mortality remained elevated up to 18 years post-diagnosis (HR 3.21, 95 % CI 3.07-3.35). Ischemic heart disease mortality in PWE was two-fold (HR 2.31, 95 % CI 2.09-2.54), and remained constantly elevated during entire follow-up in both men and women. Most premature mortality in terms of PYLL was attributable to brain cancer (17 %), other cancers (15 %), ischemic heart disease (11 %), as well as cerebrovascular diseases (10 %). The percentage of deaths in PWE statistically attributable to epilepsy was 3.9 % for accidents, 3.4 % for alcohol-related diseases, and 1.6 % for suicides. PWE had substantial excess mortality from non-communicable diseases, which did not disappear by 18 years. Diseases of the circulatory system and cancers, especially brain cancer, were the most important causes of death almost regardless of the mortality indicator.

   TRAUMA
AB Objective To test whether homicides in Finland vary according to moon phases.
   Design A time series study.
   Setting Finland.
   Participants 6808 homicides committed in 1961-2014.
   Outcome Daily numbers of homicides.
   Method The daily numbers of homicides were related to eight moon phases and the illuminated percentage of the moon disc using negative binomial regression. To identify lunar patterns, piecewise linear terms of lunar days were used, together with changes from one moon phase to another. Homicides were similarly regressed on quintiles of the illuminated percentage of the moon disc. A periodic term of length 29.53 days was included to detect cyclic patterns. The results were adjusted for sex, age, secular trend, distance from the moon, seasons, weekday, major holidays and temperature.
   Results During the full moon, 15% less homicides were committed than during the new moon (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.94) and 86% less during the lightest quintile of illumination compared with the darkest quintile (RR 0.14; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.50). Adjustments did not change the results. Piecewise linear regressions showed a significant decline in homicides at the full moon and a rise thereafter. The full moon drop in homicides was directionally similar for seasons, weekdays, sex, age and time periods, and it was particularly pronounced in the early part of period studied (1961-1974). Periodic regression showed a regular cyclic pattern of length 29.53 days (p similar to 0.035).
   Conclusions Contrary to current scientific opinion, an association exists between moon phases and homicides, and contrary to what has been previously assumed, homicides declined during the full moon, especially in earlier decades. However, the causality of the association remains elusive.

AB Aims: Our aim was to compare the weapons used in lethal or potentially lethal violence against parents according to the age (adolescent vs. adult) of the offender and victim (mother vs. father) of the offence. Method: All forensic psychiatric examination statements of male offenders who had offended violently against one of their parents during 1973-2004 in Finland (n=192) were reviewed retrospectively. Data on the weapons used by adolescent and adult offenders in relation to the sex of the victim, mental disorder, criminal responsibility and intelligence were gathered. Results: In the whole sample, sharp-edged weapons were the most commonly used weapons. Firearms were more commonly used in offences against fathers (i.e. patricidal offences) than against mothers (i.e. matricidal offences). Adolescent offenders were more likely to use firearms than adult offenders in violent acts against a parent. Among personality-disordered subjects, patricidal offenders used firearms more commonly than did matricidal offenders. Homicidal matricidal offenders had higher full-scale and verbal IQ scores as compared to homicidal patricidal offenders. The matricidal offenders using firearms were shown to be more intelligent as measured by full-scale and verbal scale IQs than the patricidal offenders using firearms. Conclusions: Consistent with the physical strength hypothesis, firearms are used more often in lethal or potentially lethal violence against parents by adolescents than by adults in Finland. As firearms legislation in Finland is currently under reform the study findings suggest that restriction of gun availability may have an influence on intrafamilial homicides, particularly those committed by adolescents.

AB This paper uses individual-level longitudinal data on working-age Finns to examine the health effects of economic fluctuations during a period of economic decline (1989-1996) and recovery (1997-2007) in Finland. We used a nationally representative, longitudinal sample formed by linking population, employment and mortality registers (n = 698,484; 7,719,870 person-years). We implemented a region fixed-effect model that exploits within-regional variations over time in the unemployment rate to identify the effect of economic fluctuations on mortality, controlling for individual employment transitions. Unemployment rates increased from 5.2 % in 1989 to 19.8 % in 1996, declining gradually thereafter and reaching 9.7 % in 2007. Results indicate that these large fluctuations in the economy had no impact on the overall mortality of most working age Finns. The exception was highly educated men, who experienced an increase of 7 % (Rate ratio = 1.07, 95 % confidence interval 1.04, 1.10) for every one-point increase in the regional unemployment rate during the period 1989-1996 due to increased mortality from cardiovascular disease and suicide. This increase, however, was not robust in models that used the employment to population ratio as measure of the economy. Unemployment rates were unrelated to mortality among females, lower educated men, and among any group during economic recovery (1997-2007). For most Finns, we found no consistent evidence of changes in mortality in response to contractions or expansions in the economy. Possible explanations include the weak impact of the recession on wages, as well as the generous unemployment insurance and social benefit system in Finland.

AB The 1990s 12-16% total autopsy rate in Denmark has until now declined to 4%, while in Finland, it has remained between 25 and 30%. The decision to proceed with a forensic autopsy is based on national legislation, but it can be assumed that the financing of autopsies influences the decision process. Only little is known about the possible differences between health economics of Finnish and Danish cause of death investigation systems.
   The aims of this article were to analyse costs and consequences of Finnish and Danish cause of death investigations, and to develop an alternative autopsy practice in Denmark with another cost profile.
   Data on cause of death investigation systems and costs were derived from Departments of Forensic Medicine, Departments of Pathology, and the National Police. Finnish and Danish autopsy rates were calculated in unnatural (accident, suicide, homicide and undetermined intent) and natural (disease) deaths, and used to develop an alternative autopsy practice in Denmark. Consequences for society were analysed.
   The estimated unit cost (sic) for one forensic autopsy is 3.2 times lower in Finland than in Denmark ((sic)1400 versus (sic)4420), but in Finland the salaries for forensic pathologists working at the National Institute for Health and Welfare are not included in the unit cost. The unit cost for one medical autopsy is also lower in Finland than in Denmark; (sic)700 versus (sic)1070. In our alternative practice in Denmark, the forensic autopsy rate was increased from 2.2% to 8.5%, and the medical autopsy rate from 2.4% to 5.8%. Costs per 10,000 deaths were estimated to be 50% (+/- 25%) higher than now; i.e. (sic)3,678,724 (2,759,112-4,598,336), but would result in a lower unit cost for forensic autopsies (sic)3,094 (2,320-3,868) and for medical autopsies (sic)749 (562-936). This practice would produce a higher accuracy of national mortality statistics, which, consequently, would entail higher quality in public health, an accurate basis for decision-making in health politics, and better legislative safety in society.
   The implementation of this alternative practice in Denmark requires that legislation demands that forensic autopsy be performed if causality between unnatural death and cause of death cannot be clarified or if cause of death remains unknown. The Danish Health and Medicines Authority should provide guidelines that request a medical autopsy in natural deaths where more information about disease as a cause of death is needed. Our study results warrant similar health economic analyses of different cause of death investigations in other countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aims: The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with suicidal ideation among young men exempted from compulsory military or civil service in Finland. Methods: The study involved a total of 356 men exempted from military or civil service. The research data were collected using questionnaires and register data. Results: One third of the young men exempted from compulsory military or civil service reported serious suicidal ideation. Of the men with serious suicidal ideation, one third had attempted suicide. Various childhood adversities and current stressful life events and problems were associated with suicidal ideation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the following factors were independently associated with suicidal ideation: maternal alcohol-related problems, changes in the family, discord with the boss over the past 12 months, and lack of social support. Accumulation of problems predicted suicidal ideation. Conclusions: Men exempted from compulsory military or civil service comprise an important target group in the prevention of suicide. In order to prevent suicidal behaviour among young men at risk, it is important to address the significance of social support and relationships, and likewise to be aware of early risk indicators such as maternal alcohol-related problems.

AB Background: Previous studies on mortality among anaesthesiologists in the Nordic countries have reported inconsistent results. In an effort to examine mortality patterns among Finnish anaesthesiologists, we compared anaesthesiologists and paediatricians with the general population.
   Methods: The year of birth and mortality data for anaesthesiologists and paediatricians deceased during the period 1996-2014 were assembled from the membership files maintained by the Finnish Medical Association. Data for the general population and causes of death were obtained from the database of Statistics Finland. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) for anaesthesiologists and paediatricians were calculated using the general population as a reference.
   Results: During the follow-up period, there were 62 deaths among anaesthesiologists and and 95 among peadiatricians. Anaesthesiologists had a lower mean age at death (66.9 years) than did peadiatricians (76.2 years). Standardized mortality ratios for both the groups were well below 1.0. The rate of suicides for anaesthesiologists was more than three times higher than that for paediatricians and more than five times higher for that of the general population.
   Discussion: We found no evidence of increased mortality for anaesthesiologists or paediatricians. The number of suicides among anaesthesiologists was higher than among paediatricians and the general population.

AB Mortality patterns among women with cosmetic breast implants have not been well characterized. We examined cause specific mortality among women who underwent cosmetic breast implantation at major public hospitals and private clinics in Finland from 1970 through 2000. Causes of death through 2001 were identified through the national mortality register. Expected numbers of deaths were calculated on the basis of mortality rates in the general female population, and standardized mortality ratios (SMR), i.e. ratios of observed to expected deaths, and 95% confidence inter-vats (CI) were calculated. Among the 2166 women with cosmetic breast implants, we observed 31 deaths versus 32.1 expected. Overall disease mortality was below expectation, mainly due to low mortality from diseases of the circulatory system (SMR, 0.28; 95% Cl, 0.03-1.02). Mortality from cancer was close to expectation. There was a statistically significant excess of suicide, based on 10 deaths, which was most pronounced during the first 5 years of follow-up (SMR, 4.26; 95% Cl, 1.56-9.26). In conclusion, although based on small numbers, women with cosmetic breast implants did not experience higher mortality overall than women in the general population. The high suicide risk supports other studies and warrants further detailed investigation.

AB Filicide is the act of killing one's own child. We propose a new classification of subtypes of filicide and make suggestions for helping its prevention. This binational, register-based study covers all cases of filicide and their perpetrators in Austria and Finland in the years 1995-2005. The following variables emerged as differentiating factors: gender, age of victim and offender, circumstances before and during the offence, the offender's socioeconomic and criminal background, and childhood conduct disorder. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify profiles. We found five: (1) Homicidal-Suicidal Fathers; (2) Violent Impulsive Parents; (3) Single Sober Parents; (4) Prosocial, Psychotic Parents; and (5) Infanticidal Mothers. We present suggestions for focused strategies of prevention for each group.

AB AimWe compared the course and outcome of schizophrenia in two groups: (i) hospitalised patients (HP) (n=5980) who were identified based on their first hospital admission for schizophrenia and (ii) outpatient-treated patients (OTP) who received disability pension because of schizophrenia but who had no hospital admissions for schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder before having been granted a disability pension for schizophrenia (n=1220). Outcomes were compared using data on mortality, psychiatric hospital utilisation, relapse rate and occupational functioning.
   MethodsA nationwide register-based 5-year follow-up study of all first-onset schizophrenia cases between 1998 and 2003 in Finland. The data were linked with the register information of hospital admissions, disability pensions and National Causes of Death Registers.
   ResultsWhen outcome of treatment was evaluated using mortality rate, relapses, hospital treatment and involuntary admissions as outcome measures, results indicated that OTP group had got along better with their illnesses than HP group. The mortality rates, number of psychiatric treatment days and relapse rate during the 5-year follow up were significantly lower in OTP group. Within the OTP group, there was a notable subgroup of never HP (n=737, 60.4%), who did not require any psychiatric hospitalisation during the 5-year follow up.
   ConclusionsPatients first identified as outpatients had better outcomes than patients first identified following a hospitalisation. Future studies are required to establish whether outpatient treatment is associated with more favourable prognosis, even after fully adjusting for severity of initial symptoms. The higher suicide mortality of hospital-treated patients suggests that hospital treatment of first-onset patients does not protect from suicide.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate all child homicides for the 25-year period, 1970-1994 in Finland and to analyse the specific characteristics of the filicide cases. A total of 292 child homicides occurred during this period. In 201 (69%) cases the offender was a parent or a stepparent of the child. Altogether, 173 (59%) of the victims were boys and 119 (41%) were girls. For the closer examination of the filicide cases we excluded the neonaticide and homicide-suicide cases. Consequently. we report on 70 filicide victims. Of these victims, 42 (60%) were boys and 28 (40%) were girls. Twenty six (37%) of the children were killed before the age of 1 year and 53 (79%) before the age of 5 years. The offender was the mother in 43 (61%) cases and the father or the stepfather in 26 (37%) cases. The victims of the mothers were younger than those of the fathers. The most frequent causes of death were head injuries, drowning and suffocation. The most common means of assault were battering, drowning and strangulation. One in two of the Fatally battered children had a documented history of previous abuse. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of the present study was to examine mortality due to avoidable and unavoidable causes, unnatural deaths, and mortality possibly related to the use of psychotropic drugs. Mortality of 253 long-stay psychiatric patients from Northern Finland were monitored over a 9-year period and characterized according to standardized mortality rates (SMRs). Deaths due to avoidable causes included about 30% of all deaths, SMRs being 1.9 times (males) and 3.2 times (females) higher than those of the general population. The risk of unnatural deaths was also elevated, with SMRs amounting to 3.9 in males and 8.5 in females. An increased mortality risk, possibly related to the use of psychotropic drugs, was noticed. The physical care of long-stay psychiatric patients seems not to reach the same level that the general population enjoys. Continuous attention to the physical health of psychiatric patients is important, but new strategies and specific intervention methods should not be neglected. The concept of "avoidable mortality" is a useful, but rarely used indicator of the quality of the medical care in psychiatric populations. However, the concept needs regular updates from the whole field of medicine. From the psychiatric point of view, it was suggested that suicides be regarded as avoidable deaths.

AB Euthanasia and its legalization are complex issues, which are intensely debated in many countries. In the debates, little attention is paid to the perceptions of nurses, despite their important role in providing health care for dying patients. This study aims to contribute to the ongoing debate by elucidating nurses' rarely explored perceptions of euthanasia and its legalization in Finland. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 17 registered nurses between November 2012 and January 2013 and analyzed by inductive content analysis. The participants expressed conflicting perceptions of euthanasia and its legalization related to professional identity, ethics, religious conviction, and work experience. Furthermore, nurses reported concerns arising from a lack of reliable information regarding euthanasia. Participants considered the legalization of euthanasia probable in coming years. The investigation of existing laws and practices in countries where euthanasia is already legal was seen as a helpful prerequisite for legalization in Finland. Drifting toward a "slippery slope'' was considered the biggest risk, while improving the ability to help patients in agony was regarded as a potentially positive outcome of the legalization of euthanasia. The results of this study highlight a need for more qualitative and quantitative research concerning nurses' attitudes toward euthanasia.

AB Background The impact of clinically diagnosed mental disorders on mortality in the general population has not been established.
   Aims To examine mental disorders for their prediction of cause-specific mortality.
   Method Mental disorders were determined using the 36-item version of the General Health Questionnaire and the Present State Examination in a nationally representative sample of 8000 adult Finns.
   Results During the 17-year follow-up period 1597 deaths occurred. The presence of a mental disorder detected at baseline was associated with an elevated mortality rate,The relative risk in men was 1.6 (95% confidence interval 13-1.8) and in women, 1.4 (95% CI 1.2-1.6). In men and women with schizophrenia the relative risks of death during the follow-up period were 3.3 (95% CI 2.3-4.9) and 2.3 (95% CI 1.3-3.8) respectively, compared with the rest of the sample. In both men and women with schizophrenia the risk of dying of respiratory disease was increased, but the risk of dying of cardiovascular disease was increased only in men with neurotic depression.
   Conclusions Schizophrenia and depression are associated with an elevated risk of natural and unnatural deaths.
   Declaration of interest This study was funded by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland.

AB Objective: To analyse changes in inpatient treatment for mood disorders during the period of de-institutionalisation, de-centralisation of service planning, economic recession, attempts to increase depression awareness and increasing biological treatment possibilities. A special interest is paid to whether de-institutionalisation at specialist level psychiatric care results in transfer of inpatient care into non-specialised institutions. Method: A register study of all inpatient treatment due to psychiatric disorders from four health care districts in Northern Finland, with a population of more than 600,000. Treatment undertaken by psychiatric hospitals and wards, primary care wards and medical and surgical wards in general hospitals are distinguished. Results: Inpatient treatment for mood disorders increased vastly in all kinds of health care institutions. The increase was due to growing inpatient treatment of depression. Limitations: The National Discharge Register does not include treatment episodes in private nursing homes or details about the contents of the treatment. Conclusion: Even during explicit active de-institutionalisation, other policies may have a greater impact on hospital use, resulting in unexpected changes in patient populations and service utilisation. In Finland, de-institutionalisation failed concerning mood disorders. The depression awareness policies during the 1990s increased inpatient use of depression across institutions.

AB Postpartum depression has been described as a thief that steals motherhood. It can result in tragedy and sometimes in headline-gripping maternal suicide or infanticide. Because one of the highest priorities for nursing is to continually advance the knowledge the underlies nursing practice, it is essential that we understand what nurse researchers have done to advance the knowledge base of postpartum depression. This integrative review is a two-part series for MCN that summarizes 141 postpartum depression studies conducted by nurse researchers from around the globe, including United States, Australia, Canada, China (Hong Kong, Taiwan), Finland, Iceland Sweden, Turkey, and Malaysia. Specific areas of postpartum depression to which nurse researchers have devoted their primary attention include epidemiology, risk factors, transcultural perspectives, instrument development, screening, interventions and mother-infant interactions.

AB Induced abortion is the most common surgical procedure performed on females of child-bearing age, including adolescent women. Consequently, pediatricians should be familiar with the short-term and long-term risks of induced abortion and also be able to compassionately discuss these risks with adolescents and involved family members. Some of the potential short- and long-term risks include increased mortality from suicide and other violence, as well as natural causes; increased risk of breast cancer; greater rates of substance abuse; and higher risk of morbidity and mortality for subsequent children due to premature births, especially very premature births. Patient education on the risks of induced abortion should be considered during anticipatory guidance discussions at well-child visits during the adolescent years.

AB In this study, we sought to determine what impact the banning of 3, 4- methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) had on the incidence of MDPV-positive findings and on user profiles in driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) and postmortem (PM) investigations in Finland. All MDPV-positive cases and a selection of corresponding court cases between 2009 and 2012 were examined. The median serum concentration of MDPV in DUID cases was 0.030 mg/L and in PM blood 0.12 mg/L. The number of MDPV-positive cases decreased both in DUID and PM investigations after the drug was banned. The decrease in the mean monthly numbers of MDPV-positive DUID cases was 51.1%. In court cases, MDPV was rarely mentioned until banned and frequently mentioned thereafter. Of the convicted, 37% were without a fixed abode, 98% had other charges besides that of DUID, and 13% appeared in the study material more than once. In MDPV-positive PM cases, the proportion of suicides was very high (24%). Research on new psychoactive substances is required not only to support banning decisions but more importantly to be able to provide a scientific assessment of the risks of these new substances to the public and potential users.

AB In addition to psychoses, antipsychotic drugs are nowadays also prescribed for other psychiatric disturbances, such as mood disorders. We wanted to find out whether there is any association between the use of antipsychotic drugs and suicidality in cases of psychotic and non-psychotic disorders. Our sample was the population-based Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort. Information on the use of prescribed drugs was collected in 1997 from the nationwide medication register and with a postal questionnaire (N?=?8218). The presence of suicidal ideation was assessed cross-sectionally using the Symptom Check List-25 questionnaire. We studied associations between suicidal ideation, adjusted for symptoms of depression and anxiety, and antipsychotic medication in different diagnostic groups (schizophrenia, other psychosis and no psychosis). Individuals receiving antipsychotic medication (n?=?70, 0.9%) had in general more suicidal ideation regardless of diagnostic group, although the associations diminished when taking other symptoms into account. There were no statistically significant differences between those taking typical and atypical antipsychotics. In the non-psychotic group, higher antipsychotic doses were associated with more suicidal ideation even when adjusted for symptoms of depression and anxiety (p?<?0.05). In the cases of schizophrenia or other forms of psychosis, no such associations were observed. Our results suggest that one should take suicidal ideation into account when prescribing antipsychotic medication, especially for off-label use. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Background: Immigrants is an important minority in many countries, but little is known how they are self-selected. We analysed differences in psycho-social and health behavioural factors between international migrants and non-migrants prior to migration in a large cohort of Finnish twins. Methods: A questionnaire was sent to Finnish twins in 1975 (response rate 89, N = 26555 twin individuals). Follow-up data on migration and mortality were derived from population registries in Finland and Sweden up to 31 March 2002. In 1998, another questionnaire was sent to Finnish twins migrated to Sweden and their co-twins (response rate 71%, N = 1534 twin individuals). The data were analysed using Cox and conditional logistic regression models. Results: Life dissatisfaction, higher alcohol use and smoking at baseline predicted future migration. In men additionally, unemployment, neuroticism and extroversion increased the probability to migrate. Similar associations were found for alcohol use in men and smoking in men and women within twin pairs discordant for migration. Twins also reported retrospectively that prior to migration the migrated twin had been less satisfied with his/her educational institution or job and was generally less satisfied with life, used more alcohol (men) and smoked more (women) than the co-twin stayed in Finland. Conclusion: Migrants are self-selected by health behavioural and personality factors, which may compromise their health. The special requirements of migrants should be recognized in health care.

AB Background: Despite the significant role of nurses in end-of-life care, their attitudes towards euthanasia are under-represented both in the current literature and the controversial debate that is ongoing in several countries.
   Research questions: What are the attitudes towards euthanasia among Finnish nurses? Which characteristics are associated with those attitudes?
   Research design: Cross-sectional web-based survey.
   Participants and research context: A total of 1003 nurses recruited via the members' bulletin of the Finnish Nurses Association and social media.
   Ethical considerations: Ethical approval was obtained from the Committee on Research Ethics of the university to which the authors were affiliated.
   Findings: The majority (74.3%) of the participants would accept euthanasia as part of Finnish healthcare, and 61.8% considered that Finland would benefit from a law permitting euthanasia. Most of the nurses (89.9%) thought that a person must have the right to decide on his or her own death; 77.4% of them considered it likely that they would themselves make a request for euthanasia in certain situations.
   Discussion: The value of self-determination and the ability to choose the moment and manner of one's death are emphasized in the nurses' attitudes towards euthanasia.
   Conclusion: A continuous dialogue about euthanasia and nurses' shared values is crucial due to the conflict between nurses' attitudes and current ethical guidelines on nursing.

   METAANALYSIS
AB Background: Disturbances in lipid metabolism have been linked to suicidal behaviour, but little is known about the association between suicide risk and abnormal glucose metabolism in depression. Hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia may increase the risk of depression and also the risk for suicide, we therefore studied associations between suicidal behaviour and disturbances in glucose metabolism in depressive patients who had been referred to depression nurse case managers.
   Methods: Patients aged 35 years and older (N = 448, mean age 51 years) who were experiencing a new depressive episode, who were referred to depression nurse case managers in 2008-2009 and who scored = 10 on the Beck Depression Inventory were enrolled in this study. The study was conducted in municipalities within the Central Finland Hospital District (catchment area of 274 000 inhabitants) as part of the Finnish Depression and Metabolic Syndrome in Adults study. The patients' psychiatric diagnoses and suicidal behaviour were confirmed by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Blood samples, for glucose and lipid determinations, were drawn from participants after 12 h of fasting, which was followed by a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) when blood was drawn at 0 and 2 h. Insulin resistance was measured by the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI) method.'
   Results: Suicidal ideation (49 %) and previous suicide attempts (16 %) were common in patients with major depressive disorder or dysthymia. Patients with depression and suicidal behaviour had higher blood glucose concentrations at baseline and at 2 hours in the OGTT. Glucose levels associated positively with the prevalence of suicidal behaviour, and the linearity was significant at baseline (p for linearity: 0.012, adjusted for age and sex) and for 2-hour OGTT glucose (p for linearity: 0.004, adjusted for age and sex). QUICKI levels associated with suicidal behavior (p for linearity across tertiles of QUICKI: 0.026). Total and LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels were also higher in those patients with suicidal behaviour. Multivariate analysis revealed that blood glucose levels, BDI scores and antidepressive medications associated with suicidal behaviour.
   Conclusion: Insulin resistance and disturbances in glucose and lipid metabolism may be more common in middle-aged depressive patients with suicidal behaviour.

DE Maternal death; maternal mortality; causes of death; assessment; enquiry
ID PREGNANCY-RELATED MORTALITY; NETHERLANDS; SUICIDES; FINLAND
AB Objective. To describe a method for identification, classification and assessment of maternal deaths in Denmark and to identify substandard care. Design. Register study and case audit based on data from the Registers of the Danish Medical Health Board, death certificates and hospital records. Setting. Denmark 2002-2006. Population. Women who died during a pregnancy or within 42 days after a pregnancy. Methods. Maternal deaths were identified by notification from maternity wards and data from the Danish National Board of Health. A national audit committee assessed hospital records of direct and indirect deaths. Main outcome measures. Maternal mortality ratio, causes of death and suboptimal care. Results. In the study period, 26 women died during pregnancy or within 42 days from direct or indirect causes, leading to a maternal mortality ratio of 8.0/100,000 live births. Causes of death were cardiac disease, thromboembolism, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, Streptococcus A infections, suicide, amniotic fluid embolism, cerebrovascular hemorrhage, asthma and diabetes. Conclusion. Our method proved valid and can be used for future research. Causes of death could be identified and learning points from the assessments could form the basis of focused education and guidelines. Future complementary 'near miss' studies and cooperation with other countries with comparable health systems are expected to improve the benefits of the enquiries, contributing to improved management of life-threatening conditions in pregnancy and childbirth.

AB Objective: Seasonal variations of violence have been the subject of some controversy. Norway, situated between latitudes 58 degrees and 72 degrees N, has considerable seasonal variations of light and provides a good opportunity for studies of seasonality.
   Method: The monthly numbers of police reports of violent incidents in 1991-1997 were obtained for the entire Norwegian population of 4,450,000 inhabitants and separately for each of seven Norwegian cities at different latitudes.
   Results: A total of 82,537 episodes of violence were recorded. There was a significant Variation in violent incidents between months, with a minimum daily frequency of 28.7 in March and a maximum daily frequency of 35.1 in lune. The frequency curve had one significant peak in May through June and another significant peak in October through November. The monthly frequency of violence correlated with the absolute value of monthly change in length of day from the previous month. In the seven cities the highest monthly ratio of observed to expected frequencies increased with latitude. With increasing latitude, the months with the largest increase in Violence came rater both in the spring and in the fall.
   Conclusions: There is a distinct pattern of seasonal variation in the frequency of violence that varies systematically with latitude. This pattern resembles the seasonal pattern of some forms of suicide, hospitalization for affective disorders, and mood and activity in the general population.

All 80,983 calls to a Red Cross Help-Line for children in 1991-1997 were included. In 22,698 calls, information about age, sex or issue could be identified. A monthly variation in frequency of calls with peaks in April and November and a correlation with the absolute values of monthly changes in length of day were found. Conversations concerning psychiatric suffering were more frequent in January or February and less frequent than expected in May/June and December. Conversations about sexuality correlated with the frequencies of births in the adult population 9 months later. A spring and fall peak in total calling and a winter peak in calls for depression, anxiety, pain and neglect were described. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Several previous reforms decentralized Finnish psychiatric services to a great extent. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health is outlining a proposal for Health Care Law, which makes an effort to centralize and reorganize healthcare. It is not yet possible to see what this will mean for the psychiatric services. In general, the health status of the Finnish population has improved. Although rates of suicides have declined considerably, rates of alcohol-related deaths have risen. Moreover, disability related to major depression has increased drastically, which has lead to a nationwide project called MASTO, which has the aim to improve early detection and treatment of depression. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health set up a work group, MIND 2009, to draft local working models for mental health and addiction services. To study the significance of psychotherapy in a private practice psychiatric context, the Finnish Psychiatric Association conducted a survey amongst its members. Most psychiatrists in private practice conduct psychotherapy.

AB Context The consumption of statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) in most Western countries has increased to the extent that it may affect all-cause and disease-specific mortality.
   Objective To analyze the association of statin use with all-cause and disease-specific mortality utilizing nationwide databases in a record linkage study in Finland.
   Methods The study population included all statin users in Finland who had purchased at least one prescription between 1997 and 2005. A control population matched for age, sex, and place of residence and without statin usage was selected. The study population consisted of 336 618 pairs of individuals, and the mean length of follow-up was 4.4 years. All-cause mortality and mortality caused by coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, other circulatory causes, cancer, unnatural causes, and suicide were analyzed. Persistence to treatment was calculated by varying adherence criteria between 20 and 80%.
   Results We observed association between all-cause, non-CHD and CHD and treatment with statins in statin user group. For CHD mortality, we observed a relationship between the persistence to statin treatment and a decreasing CHD mortality. For each 10% increase in adherence criteria, a 5% (2-8%) decrease in CHD mortality was observed within the range of 20% (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.32-2.02) to 80% (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.46-0.64).
   Conclusion In this nationwide study, long-term use of statins is associated with the reduction in CHD mortality. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

   We studied Finnish stainless steel production chain workers employed between 1967 and 2004, from chromite mining to cold rolling of stainless steel, divided into sub-cohorts by production units with specific exposure patterns. We obtained causes of death for the years 1971-2012 from Statistics Finland. We calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) as ratios of observed and expected numbers of deaths based on population mortality rates of the same region.
   Among 8088 workers studied, overall mortality was significantly decreased (SMR 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-0.84), largely due to low mortality from diseases of the circulatory system (SMR 0.71; 95% CI 0.61-0.81). In chromite mine, stainless steel melting shop and metallurgical laboratory workers, the SMR for circulatory disease was below 0.4 (SMR 0.33; 95% CI 0.07-0.95, SMR 0.22; 95% CI 0.05-0.65 and SMR 0.16; 95% CI 0.00-0.90, respectively). Mortality from accidents (SMR 0.84; 95% CI 0.67-1.04) and suicides (SMR 0.72; 95% CI 0.56-0.91) was also lower than in the reference population.
   Working in the Finnish ferrochromium and stainless steel industry appears not to be associated with increased mortality.

AB Objective: We compared official maternal mortality statistics with those from a special study covering all pregnancy-associated deaths in two European countries (Finland and France) and in two US states (Massachusetts and North Carolina) in 1999-2000 to characterize pregnancy-related deaths that are not included in official statistics.
   Study design: We linked the official ICD-10-based maternal mortality data for 84 deaths with study data on 404 pregnancy-associated deaths. Results: Of the pregnancy-associated deaths, 151 were pregnancy-related. We found 69 pregnancy-related deaths that had not been included as maternal deaths. and two deaths coded as maternal deaths that did not meet our definition for a pregnancy-related death. In total, 58 of these 69 deaths were from medical causes and I I were from external causes or injuries (10 postpartum depression-related suicides and one accidental drug poisoning). The unreported deaths due to medical causes included 27 direct, 15 indirect, and two direct/indirect pregnancy-related deaths and 14 possibly pregnancy-related deaths. The most common causes of the unreported deaths due to medical causes were intracerebral hemorrhage (7 deaths), peripartum cardiomyopathy (4), pulmonary embolism (4) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (4). Conclusions: The collection of data on pregnancy-related and pregnancy-associated deaths is useful for countries with low maternal mortality figures. The use of various data-collection methods may substantially increase the quality of maternal mortality statistics. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Advanced paternal age (APA) is associated with an increased mortality in the general population, and is a risk factor for schizophrenia. We aimed to test if APA is associated with increased mortality in people with nonaffective psychosis.
   Methods: Subjects with nonaffective psychosis who were born in Helsinki, Finland, between 1951 and 1960 (n = 529) were followed until June 2006 (age 46 to 55). Hazard ratios were calculated, adjusting for subject age, age of the other parent, and gender.
   Results: In females but not males, there was a significant increase in all-causes mortality (HR = 7.04, 95% CI L60-31.04, p = 0.01) and natural deaths (HR = 7.64, 95% CI 1.20-48.66, p = 0.03) in offspring of fathers age >= 40, after adjustment for potential confounders. In males but not females, there was a significant decrease in suicides (HR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.81-0.97, p = 0.01) with increasing maternal age (as a continuous variable). In the entire sample, there was also a trend for decreased all-cause mortality (HR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.92-1.01, p = 0.08) with increasing maternal age (as a continuous variable).
   Discussion: Both paternal and maternal age may affect mortality risk in offspring with psychosis. The specific disorders and pathway(s) associated with the increase in natural cause mortality remain to be determined. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID UNITED-STATES; PREGNANCY; MORTALITY; POPULATION; FINLAND; SWEDEN
AB IntroductionDespite the seriousness of the event, maternal deaths are substantially underreported. There is often a missed opportunity to learn from such tragedies. The aim of the study was to identify maternal deaths in the five Nordic countries, to classify causes of death based on internationally acknowledged criteria, and to identify areas that would benefit from further teaching, training or research to possibly reduce the number of maternal deaths.
   Material and methodsWe present data for the years 2005-2013. National audit groups collected data by linkage of registers and direct reporting from hospitals. Each case was then assessed to determine the cause of death, and level of care provided. Potential improvements to care were evaluated.
   ResultsWe registered 168 maternal deaths, 90 direct and 78 indirect cases. The maternal mortality ratio was 7.2/100 000 live births ranging from 6.8 to 8.1 between the countries. Cardiac disease (n = 29) was the most frequent cause of death, followed by preeclampsia (n = 24), thromboembolism (n = 20) and suicide (n = 20). Improvements to care which could potentially have made a difference to the outcome were identified in one-third of the deaths, i.e. in as many as 60% of preeclamptic, 45% of thromboembolic, and 32% of the deaths from cardiac disease.
   ConclusionDirect deaths exceeded indirect maternal deaths in the Nordic countries. To reduce maternal deaths, increased efforts to better implement existing clinical guidelines seem warranted, particularly for preeclampsia, thromboembolism and cardiac disease. More knowledge is also needed about what contributes to suicidal maternal deaths.

TI Sickness absence as a predictor of mortality among male and female

SO JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
LA English

ID SELF-RATED HEALTH; MIDDLE-AGED MEN; WORK
AB Objective: To determine the extent to which sickness absence is predictive of mortality.
   Design: Prospective cohort study. Data on medically certified long term absences (>3 days), self certified short term absences (1-3 days), and sick days were derived from employers' records and data on mortality from the national mortality register.
   Setting: 10 towns in Finland.
   Participants: 12 821 male and 28 915 female Finnish municipal employees with a job contract of five consecutive years. The mean follow up was 4.5 years.
   Main results: After adjustment for age, occupational status, and type of employment contract, the overall mortality rate was 4.3 (95% confidence intervals 2.6 to 7.0) and 3.3 (2.1 to 5.3) times greater in men and women with more than one long term absences per year than in those with no absence. The corresponding hazard ratios for more than 15 annual sick days were 4.7 (2.3 to 9.6) and 3.7 (1.5 to 9.1). Both these measures of sickness absence were also predictive of deaths from cardiovascular disease, cancer, alcohol related causes, and suicide. Associations between short term sickness absences and mortality were weaker and changed to non-significant after adjustment for long term sickness absence.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that measures of sickness absence, such as long term absence spells and sick days, are strong predictors of all cause mortality and mortality due to cardiovascular disease, cancer, alcohol related causes, and suicide.

   Denmark; Norway; Registry data
ID 2ND-GENERATION IMMIGRANTS; FOLLOW-UP; SWEDEN; HEALTH; 1ST-GENERATION;
   PREVALENCE; MIGRANTS; SUICIDE; CANCERS
AB Background: Immigration to the Nordic countries has increased in the last decades and foreign-born inhabitants now constitute a considerable part of the region's population. Several studies suggest poorer self-reported health among foreign-born compared to natives, while results on mortality and life expectancy are inconclusive. To date, few studies have summarized knowledge on mortality differentials by country of birth. This article aims to systematically review previous results on all-cause and cause-specific mortality by country of birth in the Nordic countries.
   Methods: The methodology was conducted and documented systematically and transparently using a narrative approach. We identified 43 relevant studies out of 6059 potentially relevant studies in August 2016, 35 of which used Swedish data, 8 Danish and 1 Norwegian.
   Results: Our findings from fully-adjusted models on Swedish data support claims of excess mortality risks in specific categories of foreign-born. Most notably, immigrants from other Nordic countries, especially Finland, experience increased risk of mortality from all causes, and specifically by suicide, breast and gynaecological cancers, and circulatory diseases. Increased risks in people from Central and Eastern Europe can also be found. On the contrary, decreased risks for people with Southern European and Middle Eastern origins are found for all-cause, suicide, and breast and gynaecological cancer mortality. The few Danish studies are more difficult to compare, with conflicting results arising in the analysis. Finally, results from the one Norwegian study suggest significantly decreased mortality risks among foreign-born, to be explored in further research.
   Conclusions: With new studies being published on mortality differentials between native and foreign-born populations in the Nordic countries, specific risk patterns have begun to arise. Regardless, data from most Nordic countries remains limited, as does the information on specific causes of death. The literature should be expanded in upcoming years to capture associations between country of birth and mortality more clearly.

ID ALCOHOL-RELATED MORTALITY
AB Background: The higher mortality among Finnish-speaking than Swedish-speaking Finns is well established and has been shown to be very persistent. However, the most recent comprehensive documentation on the language-group differential extends only to the mid-1980s. We study recent trends in sex- and age-specific language-group mortality from 1988 to 2004, focusing on the relative contribution of the main causes of death and differences in sociodemographic structure. Methods: The register data are based on an 11% sample of Finns aged >= 30 years at the end of 1987-which further includes an oversample of deaths covering 80% of all deaths in the period 1988-2004. Results: Finnish-speaking men had 19% and women 11% higher age-adjusted mortality rates than the Swedish speakers. Further adjustments for sociodemographic composition explained 47% and 36%, respectively, of these differences. Age group-specific analyses showed the steepest differences in the young and middle-aged groups (30-49 years) in both men and women. The cause-specific differences were most pronounced in alcohol-related diseases, suicide and other external causes, for which a slight increase in differentials was also observed. Conclusion: The relative difference in mortality between the two main language groups in Finland persists, with a slight narrowing of the gap among women. Moreover, the largest differences and indications of diverging trends were found among the youngest age groups. The causes of death in which the difference is greatest highlight the importance of health-related behaviour and cultural differences in lifestyle.

AB Opioids are important medications for pain and opioid maintenance treatment. Increasing use and abuse of prescription opioids has, however, caused worldwide concern. Our aim was to estimate the ratio between prescription opioid abuse and total use, based on representative postmortem toxicology. Our material included all the medico-legally examined deaths in Finland during 2010-2011 involving positive findings involving buprenorphine, codeine, fentanyl, methadone, oxycodone, or tramadol. We studied drug abuse by age group, with "abuse'' meaning licit opioids used illicitly as narcotics. Drug-abuse history, drug injecting, or laboratory findings of illicit drugs defined an abuser case. We then compared abuser cases and other opioid-related cases between the opioids with the number of fatal poisonings, accidents, suicides, alcohol findings, concomitant opioid use, and median postmortem blood opioid concentrations. Opioid findings numbered 2499 in 2088 cases. Drug abuse involved 545 opioid-positive cases, which in Finland represented 0.5% of those deceased. The proportion of abuser cases among all opioid-related cases for buprenorphine was 85.5%, for methadone 82.4%, for tramadol 29.4%, for codeine 16.3%, for fentanyl 14.5%, and for oxycodone 6.9%. Abuse in age-groups >60 was rare. Concomitant other opioid findings were more frequent in abuser- than in other cases for codeine, oxycodone, and tramadol, whereas alcohol findings were more frequent in buprenorphine, codeine, and fentanyl abuse. Buprenorphine and methadone were most often related to drug abuse. Every other opioid studied involved some abuse, and especially tramadol. Abuse and fatal poisonings were concentrated in men aged 20-49. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective Alcohol may be involved in 4050% of traumatic brain injuries (TBI). In Finland, the cutting of alcohol taxes by one third in 2004 resulted in a marked increase in per capita alcohol consumption. We investigated the consequences of increased alcohol consumption on the incidence of moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury among a defined population. Material and methods We identified all residents of Northern Ostrobothia with acute moderate-to-severe TBI admitted to Oulu University Hospital in 1999 and in 2007 as well as those who died on the scene without being admitted to the hospital. Alcohol involvement was recorded by similar methods and equally often during both years. Incidence rates were calculated as number of subjects per 100,000 population. Logistic regression was performed to determine which factors predicted fatal TBI and associated with alcohol-related TBI. Results No significant increase from 1999 to 2007 occurred in the incidence of alcohol-related moderate-to-severe TBIs among the population of Northern Ostrobothnia. The total number of alcohol-related TBIs were 61/135 (45.2%) in 2007 and 52/126 (41.3%) 1999. Fall-related TBIs were more frequent in 2007 than in 1999. Alcohol and older age predicted fatal outcome. Alcohol was significantly (P<0.001) more often present in fatal TBIs (83/156, 53.2%) than in non-fatal TBIs (30/105, 28.6%). Male sex, fall, suicide, and assault significantly associated with alcohol-related TBI. Conclusions The reduction in alcohol prices and the concomitant increase in alcohol consumption did not increase the incidence of alcohol-related moderate-to-severe TBI.

AB Background: Psychiatric disorders tend to be developmental, and longitudinal settings are required to examine predictors of psychiatric phenomena. Replicating and combining data and results from different birth cohorts, which are a source of reliable data, can make research even more valuable. The Finnish Psychiatric Birth Cohort Consortium (PSYCOHORTS) project combines birth cohorts in Finland. Aim: The aim of this paper is to introduce content, plans and perspectives of the PSYCOHORTS project that brings together researchers from Finland. In addition, we illustrate an example of data harmonization using available data on causes of death. Content: PSYCOHORTS includes eight Finnish birth cohorts. The project has several plans: to harmonize different data from birth cohorts, to incorporate biobanks into psychiatric birth cohort research, to apply multigenerational perspectives, to integrate longitudinal patterns of marginalization and inequality in mental health, and to utilize data in health economics research. Data on causes of death, originally obtained from Finnish Cause of Death register, were harmonized across the six birth cohorts using SAS macro facility. Results: Harmonization of the cause of death data resulted in a total of 21,993 observations from 1965 to 2015. For example, the percentage of deaths due to suicide and the sequelae of intentional self-harm was 14% and alcohol-related diseases, including accidental poisoning by alcohol, was 13%. Conclusions: PSYCOHORTS lays the foundation for complex examinations of psychiatric disorders that is based on compatible datasets, use of biobanks and multigenerational approach to risk factors, and extensive data on marginalization and inequality.

AB Aims: To assess to what extent alcohol-related mortality has changed by age, sex and education in Finland in 19872003, a period which saw two periods of economic growth, separated by a severe depression (19911995). Methods: A register-based follow-up study of all over 15-year-old Finnish men and women. Age, sex and education of the participants were measured at the time of the 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2000 censuses. Follow-up for mortality was for 1987--2003. The outcome measure was alcohol-related mortality, which was defined using information on the underlying and contributory causes of death. Results: Among men and women aged 45 years and over, the trends in alcohol-related mortality were associated with economic cycles. Among those aged less than 45 years, alcohol-related mortality decreased from the early 1990s, but intoxication-related accidents and violence still contributed largely to premature mortality. The unfavourable trend for older men resulted from an increase in mortality due to directly alcohol-attributable diseases, alcohol-related diseases of the circulatory system and accidents and violence, and for older women from an increase due to intoxication-related accidents and violence, and alcohol-attributable diseases. Alcohol-related mortality was higher in lower educational groups, and among women the educational gap widened towards the end of the study period. Conclusion: This study shows that trends in both economic conditions and per capita consumption of alcohol are not associated with trends in alcohol-related mortality in all population subgroups. In health policy more attention should be paid to divergent trends in gender, age and education specific alcohol-related mortality.

AB Background Deinstitutionalization has been accompanied by a decreasing continuity of care in a number of countries. This study evaluates the effects of the Dutch model for deinstitutionalizing mental health care. Methods Details of users and their use of community- and hospital-based services between 1990 and 1999 were retrieved from the Groningen case register. The time between discharge from the hospital and the first subsequent community-based contact was the primary indicator for changes in continuity of care. Results The total proportion of discharges from hospital-based mental health care followed within 6 months by community-based care increased by 11% due to the improved availability of day treatment and home treatment. In terms of median survival time, aftercare in the years 1998/1999 was delivered more than twice as fast as in the years 1990/1991. Conclusions Study results supported the hypothesis in Dutch deinstitutionalization policy that the continuity of mental health care would benefit as to its longitudinal dimension.

AB The purpose of this study is to compare women with cosmetic breast implants with Population controls to examine health-related quality of life. A questionnaire including quality-of-life questions was mailed to 399 Finnish women who had had cosmetic breast implants during the years 1973-2002. The response rate of the Study was 85. Results were compared with average Finnish women from a representative population sample. There were no differences in total score of health-related quality of life between women with breast implants and controls. Women with breast implants had lower health-related quality of life in dimensions of distress and sexual activity and partly also in dimensions of sleeping and mental function when compared with controls. On the other hand, operated women reported significantly less discomfort and symptoms than controls. Differences in health-related quality of life between women with breast implants and controls were largest in dimensions of distress, sexual activity, sleeping, and symptoms.

AB Previous research suggests different crime scene patterns reflect differences in the background characteristics of the offender. However, whether differences in crime scene patterns are related to offender psychopathology remains unclear. We hypothesise that schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depressive illness will each associate to a specific homicide crime scene pattern. Homicide data were obtained from the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental Illness. Our sample comprised 759 homicides committed by offenders in contact with mental health services in the year preceding the offence and with an available psychiatric report. We used joint correspondence analysis to examine patterns between different methods of homicide, circumstances of homicide, victim gender, and victim age groups. Three homicide patterns were identified: male conflict homicide, intimate female homicide, and child homicide. Additionally, each homicide pattern was associated with one or more mental illnesses. Results are discussed in terms of the possible role of psychopathology in offender profiling research.

AB Objectives: To estimate total and cause-specific mortality after international peacekeeping deployments among the Finnish military peacekeeping personnel in comparison to the general population of similar age and sex.
   Design: A register-based study of a cohort of military peacekeeping personnel in 1990-2010 followed for mortality until the end of 2013. Causes of death were obtained from the national Causes of Death Register. The standardised mortality ratio (SMR) for total and cause-specific mortality was calculated as the ratio of observed and expected number of deaths.
   Setting: Finland (peacekeeping operations in different countries in Africa, Asia and in an area of former Yugoslavia in Europe).
   Participants: 14 584 men and 418 women who had participated in international military peacekeeping operations ending between 1990 and 2010.
   Interventions: Participation in military peacekeeping operations.
   Main outcome: Total and cause-specific mortality.
   Results: 209 men and 3 women died after their peacekeeping service. The SMR for all-cause mortality was 0.55 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.62). For the male peacekeeping personnel, the SMR for all diseases was 0.44 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.53) and for accidental and violent deaths 0.69 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.82). The SMR for suicides was 0.71 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.92).
   Conclusions: Even though military peacekeeping personnel are working in unique and often stressful conditions, their mortality after their service is lower compared with the general population. Military peacekeeping personnel appear to be a selected population group with low general mortality and no excess risk of any cause of death after peacekeeping service.

AB Background: A season of birth tendency has been shown for several psychiatric disorders and suicidal behavior. Our aim was to examine the association between season of birth and self-mutilative behavior (SMB) among adolescent psychiatric inpatients. Methods: The study sample consisted of 508 (40.9% males) 12- to 17-year-old adolescents consecutively admitted to the Department of Psychiatry of Oulu University Hospital, Finland, between April 2001 and May 2006. The birth month of each adolescent was categorized into one of the four seasons: spring ( March-May), summer ( June August), autumn (September-November) or winter ( December-February). The information on SMB was based on the K-SADS-PL interview, which included an item on nonsuicidal physical self-damaging acts without intent to die. A total of 144 adolescents ( 27 males, 117 females) met the criteria for SMB. The association between season of birth and SMB was assessed with a logistic regression analysis after controlling for each adolescent's age, previous suicide attempts and DSM-IV-diagnosed psychiatric disorders. Results: The monthly distribution of births of adolescents with SMB differed statistically significantly from that observed in the general population of the same age. An association between season of birth and SMB was seen in girls, but not in boys. The likelihood for SMB was significantly increased ( adjusted OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.4-6.2) among girls born in autumn compared to those born in winter. Conclusions: Birth during autumn may predispose girls to SMB via dysfunctional serotonergic or other neurotransmitter systems. These findings may also be related to seasonal rhythms in parental mood and poor early care of the offspring. Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Objective To obtain more accurate calculations of maternal and pregnancy-related mortality ratios in Sweden from 1988 to 2007 by using information from national registers and death certificates. Design A national register-based study, supplemented by a review of death certificates. Setting Sweden, 1988-2007. Population The deaths of 27 957 women of reproductive age (1549 years). Methods The Swedish Cause of Death Register, Medical Birth Register, and National Patient Register were linked. All women with a diagnosis related to pregnancy in at least one of these registers within 1 year prior to death were identified. Death certificates were reviewed to ascertain maternal deaths. Maternal mortality ratio (the number of maternal deaths/100 000 live births, excluding and including suicides), and pregnancy-related mortality ratio (number of deaths within 42 days after termination of pregnancy, irrespective of cause of death/100 000 live births) were calculated. Main outcome measures Direct and indirect maternal deaths and pregnancy-related deaths. Results The maternal mortality ratio in Sweden, based on the current method of identifying maternal deaths, was 3.6. After linking registers and reviewing death certificates, we identified 64% more maternal deaths, resulting in a ratio of 6.0 (or 6.5 if suicides are included). The pregnancy-related mortality ratio was 7.3. A total of 478 women died within a year after being recorded with a diagnosis related to pregnancy. Conclusions By including the 123 cases of maternal death identified in this study, the mean maternal mortality ratio from 1988 to 2007 was 64% higher than reported to the World Health Organization.

AB Aims: To evaluate whether the presumed knowledge of physicians about healthier lifestyle decreases their risk of cancer and mortality, a retrospective cohort study of male and female physicians was conducted in Estonia. Methods: The cancer incidence and cause-specific mortality of 3,673 physicians (870 M. 2803 F) in Estonia was compared with the rates of the general population. Information on cancer cases and deaths in the cohort between 1983 and 1998 was obtained from the Estonian Cancer Registry and the mortality database of Estonia. Results: The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for all cancers was 1.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-1.48) in women and 0.92 (95% CI 0.73-1.13) in men. Female physicians had an elevated risk for breast cancer (SIR 2.03, 95% CI 1.62-2.51) and myeloid leukaemia (SIR 3.69, 95% CI 1.35-8.02). Male physicians had an excess of skin melanoma (SIR 4.88, 95% CI 1.58-11.38). A large deficit of lung cancer was observed (SIR 0.24, 95% CI 0.11-0.48). The very low all-cause mortality in the cohort (standardized mortality ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.50 0.61) was mainly due to large deficits in deaths from lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases and external causes. The suicide rate in the cohort was lower than in the general population. Conclusions: No health risks were observed in the cohort that could be linked to the occupational exposures of physicians. The pattern of cancer incidence and mortality seen in physicians in Estonia in similar to the pattern seen among professional classes in other countries.

AB Background Offending is known to be associated with various health problems and premature death, but previous studies on associations between offending and mortality have often been only with men, convicted offenders or highly selected samples. A more sensitive measure of offending may be preferable when trying to understand the extent of health disadvantages among people who offend.
   Aims The aim of this paper was to study the associations between investigated offending, death and causes of death in a nationally representative birth cohort.
   Methods A broad concept of offending was used such that people who had had any contact with the police because they had been suspected of crime were included. Offending data were obtained from the National Police Register for 5405 men and women born in Finland in 1981, spanning their ages 15-30 years; mortality data were received from Statistics Finland. Offending was classified into four categories by frequency: none, 1-4 different offence contacts, 5-27 and 28 or more. Causes of death were categorised into natural, accidents, suicide or homicide. Of the cohort, 2304 (43%) had offended and 57 (1.1%) had died. Associations between offending, mortality and causes of death were analysed, controlling for parental education level and family structure in childhood.
   Results The mortality rate was higher among offenders than non-offenders, increasing with rising frequency of offending. The most frequent offenders were nearly 30 times more likely to have died by age 30 than non-offenders (odds ratio 28.6, confidence interval 12.1-67.5); risk was higher for female than male offenders. Death among offenders was less likely to be from natural causes.
   Implications A heightened risk of premature death is the ultimate form of adverse outcome for offenders. Offenders' health is likely to need more attention as part of their overall management, for recidivists in particular. In our study, offenders' only certain criminal justice contact was with the police, so it may be that the police should take a greater role in signposting them towards health services. Offender treatment is needed not only to protect potential victims but also offenders themselves. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of death in HIV patients worldwide. Here we describe the epidemiology and outcome of HIV-TB co-infections in a high-income country with low TB incidence and integrated HIV and TB therapy according to European guidelines.
   Methods: This study was based on the HIV cohort of the Helsinki University Hospital which includes all HIV patients in the Helsinki region with a population of 1.5 million. Totally, 1939 HIV-positives who have been under follow-up between 1998 and 2015 were included.
   Results: TB was diagnosed in 53 (2.7%) of the HIV-patients. The TB incidence rate was higher in injecting drug users (IRR 3.15; 95% CI 1.33-7.52) and heterosexuals (IRR 3.46; 95% CI 1.64-7.29) compared to men having sex with men. The incidence rate was also higher in those born in Sub-Saharan Africa (IRR 3.53; 95% CI 1.78-7.03) compared to those born in Finland. There was a significant reduction in the total TB incidence rate of 59% per 6-year period between 1998 and 2015 (p < 0.001). In injecting drug users there was a reduction in incidence rate from 1182 to 88 per 100,000 (p < 0.001) and in people born in Sub-Saharan Africa from 2017 to 195 per 100,000 (p < 0.001). Among the 53 HIV-TB co-infected cases, one female and 15 males died during follow up. HIV was the primary cause of death in five patients but none of the deaths were caused by TB.
   Conclusion: The incidence rate of tuberculosis among HIV-positives in Finland has been declining between 1998 and 2015. Among injecting drug users, the reduction is probably explained by harm reduction interventions and care in comprehensive care centers in Helsinki. The increased coverage of antiretroviral therapy is probably another main reason for the decline in TB incidence rates. Despite good treatment results for both HIV and TB, the all-cause mortality among Finnish males with HIV-TB was high, and common causes of death were intoxications and suicides.

AB Although our knowledge of the relationship between migration and health in women is increasing, we still have a limited knowledge of the migration and health of women of reproductive age. A cross-sectional analysis of a simple random sample of 10,661 women aged 20-49 in Sweden in 1980-1985 and 9585 such women in 1992-1997 was carried out to assess their health. The risk factors for self-reported, poor health and psychosomatic complaints for female refugees and women from Finland, Southern Europe, Western countries and Sweden were examined. Country of birth was a significant risk factor for poor self-reported health and psychosomatic complaints, with women from Southern Europe, female refugees and Finnish women being at higher risk in this respect than Swedish women. The increased risk remained significant after adjustment for demographic and socio-economic factors. Swedish-born women, female refugees, and Finnish women reported poorer health and had more psychosomatic complaints (not Finns) in the 1990s than in the 1980s.

SO BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective To study the association between prescribed antipsychotic drugs and outcome in schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in the community.
   Design Prospective cohort study using national central registers.
   Setting Community care in Finland.
   Participants Nationwide cohort of 2230 consecutive adults hospitalised in Finland for the first time because of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, January 1995 to December 2001.
   Main outcome measures Rates of discontinuation of drugs (all causes), rates of rehospitalisation, and mortality associated with monotherapy with the 10 most commonly used antipsychotic drugs. Multivariate models and propensity score methods were used to adjust estimates of effectiveness.
   Results Initial use of clozapine (adjusted relative risk 0.17, 95% confidence interval 0.10 to 0.29), perphenazine depot (0.24, 0.13 to 0.47), and olanzapine (0.35, 0.18 to 0.71) were associated with the lowest rates of discontinuation for any reason when compared with oral haloperidol. During an average follow-up of 3.6 years, 4640 cases of rehospitalisation were recorded. Current use of perphenazine depot (0.32, 0.22 to 0.49), olanzapine (0.54, 0.41 to 0.71), and clozapine (0.64, 0.48 to 0.85) were associated with the lowest risk of rehospitalisation. Use of haloperidol was associated with a poor outcome among women. Mortality was markedly raised in patients not taking antipsychotics (12.3, 6.0 to 24.1) and the risk of suicide was high (37.4, 5.1 to 276).
   Conclusions The effectiveness of first and second generation antipsychotics varies greatly in the community. Patients treated with perphenazine depot, clozapine, or olanzapine have a substantially lower risk of rehospitalisation or discontinuation (for any reason) of their initial treatment than do patients treated with haloperidol. Excess mortality is seen mostly in patients not using antipsychotic drugs.

AB The aim of this study is a next step of our previous, initial, publications - to explore the links between monthly death number (total, and for the major death causes and each gender) with levels of monthly cosmophysical activity in a long-term, big cohort observation.
   Methods. Death number during 180 consecutive months from the National Registry of Lithuania for years 1990-2004 were studied. A total of 630 205 deaths were analyzed (333 035 males). For comparison, monthly indices of solar activity, geomagnetic activity, and cosmic ray activity and year and month (1-12) of the study were used. The cosmophysical data were obtained from space research centers in the USA, Russia, and Finland.
   Statistics. Pearson correlation coefficients (r) and their probabilities (P) between compared parameters were calculated. A multivariate model of prediction was designed.
   Results. It was a significant correlation between total monthly death number and indices of cosmic ray activity and, inverse, of solar activity; in men stronger than in women. Monthly geomagnetic activity was significantly correlated with traffic accidents, ischemic heart disease/stroke ratio, suicide victim number Deaths from stroke, noncardiovascular causes, suicide, traffic accidents were related with cosmic ray activity and, inverse, with solar activity.
   Relationship of ischemic heart disease/stroke ratio to year of observation showed additional evidence for the growing role of stroke in cardiovascular mortality.
   Conclusions. Monthly death number is linked to cosmic ray activity, and inverse, to solar activity. Central place of stroke-related deaths in cardiovascular mortality is emerging. Geomagnetic activity, in monthly account, plays a relatively minor role.
   We presume that forces antagonistic to cosmic ray activity, like solar activity and geomagnetic activity, can prevent some negative biologic effects of cosmic ray.

AB Background: Excess mortality of depression is established for various causes of death, but evidence is scarce on alcohol-related causes. It also remains unclear whether the magnitude of the excess varies by social factors. This study aimed to quantify the contribution of alcohol-related causes of death and to assess modifying effects of socioeconomic position, employment status, and living arrangements in the excess mortality of depression.
   Methods: A 14% sample of community-dwelling Finns aged 40-64 at the end of 1997 was assessed for depression, using register data on psychiatric hospital care and antidepressant use in 1996-1997. Depressed in-patients (n=897), out-patients using antidepressants (n=13,658), and non-depressed individuals (n=217,140) were followed up for cause-specific mortality in 1998-2007, distinguishing between alcohol- and non-alcohol-related deaths, and testing for variation in the excess mortality according to baseline social factors.
   Results: Depressed in- and out-patients had significant excess mortality for suicide (age-adjusted rate ratios RR=3.77 for men and RR=6.35 for women), all accidental and violent causes (RR=3.47 and RR=4.43), and diseases (RR=1.67 and RR=1.41). Of the excess, alcohol-related causes accounted for 50% among depressed men and 30% among women. Excess mortality varied little by social factors, particularly in non-alcohol-related causes. Where variation was significant, the relative excess was larger among those with higher socioeconomic position and the employed. Absolute excess was, however, larger among those with lower socioeconomic position, the unemployed, and the unpartnered.
   Limitations: Depression was measured indirectly by hospital and antidepressant use.
   Conclusions: The results highlight the major role of alcohol in depression mortality. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE macro indicators; Europe; alcohol; drug; suicide; mental health care
ID SUICIDE
AB Background This paper reports the findings of an analytical comparison of several macro indicators collected routinely from institutional sources in Europe. Methods We carried out a review of macro indicators capable of providing a synthetic description of mental health status and the availability of psychiatric care in European countries. These were collected routinely from sources such as WHO, OECD, EUROSTAT, and IMS. The evaluation of temporal trends in each nation permits subsequent comparisons between countries. Results In all European countries, a decreased trend of suicides was observed in the period 1980 - 2000, with the exception of Ireland and ( partially) of Spain. In Ireland, the increased trend was particularly strong, with a high risk in young and adult males. Portugal and Greece had respectively the highest and the lowest rates of undetermined causes of death. Most countries that were high consumers of alcohol in the initial period of observation had a rate above the national mean until 1980, after which consumption decreased. Most nations that were low consumers in 1960 had rates below the mean until 1980, when the rates progressively increased. However, a general decrease of alcohol-related deaths was apparent in all countries. Mortality associated with mental disorder increased, most clearly during the mid 1980s. The number of psychiatrists per 100,000 inhabitants ranged from 3.6 in Spain to 17.5 in Finland; of child psychiatrists, from 0.9 in Germany to 5.1 in Portugal. Psychiatric beds ranged from 0.4 per 1,000 inhabitants in Italy and Spain to 1.3 in Ireland. Nine countries showed a trend towards a reduction in psychiatric beds, whilst in a further five countries no change was observed. Rates of long-stay patients varied from 9.5 in the UK to 84 in Belgium, with a generally decreasing trend. The use of outpatient facilities differed markedly between countries, although there was a general increase over time. Official data were scarce in relation to the sale of psychotropic drugs. IMS data indicated increasing consumption in all European countries for antidepressant and antipsychotic medication. Conclusions The official data resources available for European countries seem to indicate some discrepancies, probably relating to methods of recording. Better co-ordination in the collection of data about mental health status in the European Union and an improvement of the quality in available services is needed.

AB Major findings of the Survey of Living Conditions in the Arctic (SLiCA) are: (1) A combination of traditional activities and cash employment is the prevailing lifestyle of Arctic indigenous peoples; (2) family ties, social support of each other, and traditional activities have a lot to do with why indigenous people choose to remain in Arctic communities; (3) well-being is closely related to job opportunities, locally available fish and game, and a sense of local control. Well-being and depression (and related problems like suicide) are flip sides of the same coin. Improving well-being may reduce social problems; and, (4) health conditions vary widely in the Arctic: three-in-four Greenlandic Inuit self-rate their health as at least very good compared with one-in-two Canadian and Alaska Inuit and one-in-five Chukotka indigenous people. Findings are based on 7,200 interviews in a probability sample of Inupiat settlement regions of Alaska, the four Inuit settlement regions of Canada, all of Greenland, and the Anadyrskij, Anadyr, Shmidtovs, Beringovskij, Chukotskij, Iujl'tinskij, Bilibinskij, Chaunskij, Providenskij, Uel'Kal' districts of Chukotka. Indigenous people and researchers from Greenland, Russia, Canada, the United States, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland collaborated on all phases of the study.

AB Background. Previous studies have shown an elevated risk for self-harm in adolescents from ethnic minorities. However, potential contributions to this risk from socio-economic factors have rarely been addressed. The main aim of this article was to investigate any such effects.
   Method. A national cohort of 1009 157 children born during 1973-1982 was followed prospectively from 1991 to 2002 in Swedish national registers. Multivariate Cox analyses of proportional hazards were used to estimate the relative risk of hospital admission for self-harm. Parental country/region of birth was used as proxy for ethnicity.
   Results. Youth with two parents born outside Sweden (except those from Southern Europe) had higher age- and gender-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of self-harm than the majority population (HR 1.6-2.3). The HRs decreased for all immigrant groups when socio-economic factors were accounted for but remained significantly higher for immigrants from Finland and Western countries and for youth with one Swedish-born and one foreign-born parent.
   Conclusions. Socio-economic factors explain much of the variation by parental country of birth of hospital admissions for self-harm in youth in Sweden.

AB Objective To determine whether there is seasonal variation (by season and month of year) in homicides among young children.
   Study design Homicide deaths in children <= 5 years (n = 797), as identified in death certificates from 5 states (Indiana, Ohio, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Washington), were analyzed for a seasonality effect in the years 1999-2006. Season and month of calendar year were used as categorical variables. A chi(2) goodness of fit test was used to compare observed and expected proportions of homicides for the entire population. Stratified analyses of children dying before age 2 years and those dying between 2 and 5 years of age were also conducted.
   Results The occurrence of homicide was proportional to the time interval in each category (P = .05). For the total population, there was no statistically significant variation between the expected and observed percentage of homicides by either season or month of calendar year (P = .46 and P = .74, respectively). For the stratified analyses, there was no statistically significant variation between expected and observed percentages of homicides by either season or month of calendar year for either population.
   Conclusion There is no seasonality to child homicides by month of year or season of year among young children in the examined population. (J Pediatr 2010;157:144-7).

AB Purpose of Review(1) To develop a framework for understanding the holistic effects of climate change on the Saami people; (2) to summarize the scientific evidence about the primary, secondary, and tertiary effects of climate change on Saami culture and Sapmi region; and (3) to identify gaps in the knowledge of the effects of climate change on health and well-being of the Saami.
   Recent Findings The Saami health is on average similar, or slightly better compared to the health of other populations in the same area. Warming climate has already influenced Saami reindeer culture. Mental health and suicide risk partly linked to changing physical and social environments are major concerns.
   Summary The lifestyle, diet, and morbidity of the Saami are changing to resemble the majority populations posing threats for the health of the Saami and making them more vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Climate change is a threat for the cultural way of life of Saami. Possibilities for Saami to adapt to climate change are limited.

AB Background Although buprenorphine therapy has proved to be successful in opioid maintenance treatments, the drug is also widely abused in many countries by intravenous injection or sniffing ("snorting"). In Finland, buprenorphine is the most important abused opioid causing fatal poisonings.
   Purpose To evaluate the drug and alcohol findings as well as the cause and manner of death in all buprenorphine-related post-mortem cases for the age group 14-44 years in Finland from 2000 to 2008.
   Method This was a retrospective analysis of data on opioid-associated deaths in the Finnish comprehensive postmortem toxicology database based on medico-legal autopsies, case background information and laboratory analyses.
   Results Buprenorphine was found in 29% of all 1,363 opioid-positive cases, and buprenorphine poisoning was the cause of death in 182 cases out of 391 buprenorphine-positive cases (47%). In these fatal poisonings, the blood buprenorphine/norbuprenorphine concentration ratio was significantly higher than in cases with other causes of death. The manner of death in buprenorphine poisonings that were almost exclusively accidental differed significantly from other buprenorphine-related cases, which also involved diseases and suicides. Death was immediate in 10% of fatal buprenorphine poisonings, was delayed, during sleep, in 52%, and followed an unknown course of events in 38%. In immediate poisonings, the median blood buprenorphine concentration (3.0 mu g/l) was significantly higher than that in delayed poisonings (1.2 mu g/l). In most buprenorphine poisonings (92%), no opioids other than buprenorphine were involved, but benzodiazepines and alcohol were found in 82 and 58% of cases, respectively. The median concentrations of opioids and benzodiazepines in buprenorphine poisonings were in the therapeutic range. Only one fatal poisoning was found in which neither alcohol nor drugs other than buprenorphine were found.
   Conclusion A fatal buprenorphine poisoning is typically accidental, and the average victim is a 27-year-old male addict. Circumstantial and environmental factors seem to be crucial in determining the outcome of the poisoning.

AB Although growing evidence supports an association between allergy, allergens and depression, it remains unknown if this relationship is between "states" (possible triggers) or "traits" (possible vulnerabilities). We hypothesized that patients with recurrent mood disorders who are sensitized to tree pollen (as determined by allergen specific IgE antibodies), in comparison to those who are not sensitized, would report larger negative changes in mood during exposure to tree pollen in spring. We also hypothesized that differences between high and low tree pollen periods in self reported allergy symptoms would correlate positively with differences in self reported depression scores. We present 1-year preliminary data on the first 51 patients with unipolar or bipolar disorder (age: 19-63 years, 65% female, twelve patients were tree-pollen IgE positive). Ratings of mood and allergic disease status were performed once during the peak airborne pollen counts and once during the period of low airborne pollen counts, as reported by two local pollen counting stations. Linear regression models were developed to examine associations of changes in depression scores (dependent variable) with tree pollen sensitization, changes in the allergy symptom severity score, adjusted for gender and order of testing. We did not confirm the hypothesized relationship between a specific tree pollen sensitization and changes in mood during tree pollen exposure. We did confirm the hypothesized positive relationship between the changes in allergy symptoms and changes in subjects' depression scores (adjusted p < 0.05). This result is consistent with previous epidemiological evidence connecting allergy with depression, as well as our recent reports of increased expression of cytokines in the prefrontal cortex in victims of suicide and in experimental animals sensitized and exposed to tree pollen. A relationship between changes in allergy symptom scores and changes in depression scores supports a state-level rather than only trait-level relationship, and thus lends optimism to future causality-testing interventional studies, which might then lead to novel preventative environmental interventions in mood disorders.

AB Background: There are no great differences in the symptom profiles of depression between the genders in observer rating scales, but women self-report more symptoms. Objective: To compare gender differences in symptom profiles of clinical depression in primary care with a short self-report depression scale and an observer-rated scale for social functioning. Methods: A sample of 436 primary care patients aged 18-64 years were screened using the Depression Scale (DEPS) and interviewed using the Present State Examination (PSE). Level of social functioning was also assessed. Sum scores and single items of DEPS were compared between men and women in the groups of both depressive and non-depressive patients, and the interactions between gender and depression were analysed. Results: Depressive men scored poorer on both instruments. Feeling that everything is an effort and feeling worthless were typical for depressive men. Feeling blue was more typical for non-depressive women than for non-depressive men.
   Conclusion: In this sample of primary care patients, there were differences in the symptom profiles of depression between men and women. Depressive men more commonly had serious symptoms than depressive women. Clinically, male depression deserves more attention. The psychosocial profile of public primary care patients in Finland warrants further research.

AB Several epidemiological studies have reported seasonal patterns in both violent and self-destructive behaviour. However, a few studies on hospital violence have found contradictory results. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there was any seasonal variation of violence in a forensic psychiatric hospital providing care for persons suffering from psychotic disorders and violent or self-destructive behaviour. Seasonal variation of the prevalence of seclusion and restraint was also investigated. Reports of violent incidents and seclusion and restraint statistics from between 2007 and 2012 were examined with Poisson regression analysis. There was significant variation in the prevalence of seclusion and restraint between months (p < 0.001), and between seasons (p < 0.001). Monthly prevalence of seclusion and restraint was the lowest in January compared to other months. In comparison, the prevalence of seclusion and restraint was lower in winter than in other seasons. In a hospital with persons suffering from psychotic disorders, no significant variation of violence or self-destructive behaviour was found, similarly as in the society. By contrast, the prevalence of seclusion and restraint showed marked seasonality. Variation in the prevalence of seclusion and restraint was not consistent with the variance in violence, which implies that the use of coercive measures is related to seasonal variation among staff.

AB BACKGROUND: Drowning is a preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. We studied drowning deaths in Isfahan Province, focusing on the activity victims were involved in and the setting of the incident.
   METHODS: Retrospective analysis was done on all drowning deaths referred to Legal Medicine Organization of Isfahan province over a period of 5 years from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2006.
   RESULTS: During these 5 years, 355 persons suffered fatal drowning in Isfahan province. The annual incidence rate was 1.6 per 100000 population (2.6 & 0.4 for males and females, respectively). Mean age was 21.99 +/- 14.86 and M/F ratio was 6.5:1. Most victims were 15-24 and 5-14 years of age (172 and 62 decedents, 3.0 and 1.8 per 100000 population/year, respectively). Most incidents occurred in natural settings, of which rivers, canals, lakes and ponds were the most common sites, respectively. The most frequently connected activity was swimming and wading, followed by accidental fall into water. The manner of death was found as following: 85.1% accidental, 1.7% suicidal, 0.3% homicidal and 12.9% undetermined.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the drowning related mortality in Isfahan province is comparable to developed countries, effective prevention of drowning with better programming and policies might reduce its rate.

AB In many western societies health professionals play a powerful role in people's experiences of dying. Religious professionals, such as pastors, are also confronted with the issues surrounding death and dying in their work. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the ways in which death-related topics, such as euthanasia, are constructed in a given culture are affected by the views of these professionals. This qualitative study addresses the ways in which Finnish physicians and religious professionals perceive and describe euthanasia and conceptualises these descriptions and views as social representations. Almost all the physicians interviewed saw that euthanasia does not fit the role of a physician and anchored it to different kinds of risks such as the slippery slope. Most of the religious and world-view professionals also rejected euthanasia. In this group, euthanasia was rejected on the basis of a religious moral code that forbids killing. Only one of the religious professionals - the freethinker with an atheist world-view - accepted euthanasia and described it as a personal choice, as did the one physician interviewed who accepted it. The article shows how the social representations of euthanasia are used to protect professional identities and to justify their expert knowledge of death and dying.

AB Unemployment is strongly associated with mortality on the individual level. The reasons for this association are not fully established. The authors estimated the effects of unemployment and workplace downsizing on mortality during periods of low (1989) and high (1994) unemployment in Finland. They used prospective population registration data containing detailed socioeconomic and demographic information on two cohorts aged 35-64 years at the beginning of 1989 (N = 87,317) and 1994 (N= 72,419) followed up for mortality in 1990-1997 and 1995-2002, respectively. Unemployment was found to be associated with a 2.38-fold increase in the hazard of mortality after 1989 and with a 1.25-fold increase after 1994. No excess mortality was observed among those who, at baseline, were employed at workplaces that had experienced large reductions in employment. Furthermore, the association between unemployment and mortality was weaker among those working in establishments that had been strongly downsized. By showing that, in the context of either a high level of unemployment or rapid downsizing, the effects of unemployment on mortality are modest, this study provides strong evidence of unaccounted confounding. Individual-level studies may thus overestimate the causal effects of unemployment on mortality.

AB The article presents a quantitative look at the European homicide research published in selected main international journals in the field of social science criminology (SSC) since 2000. Building on our previous, mainly narrative work (Kivivuori et al., 2012), we use search string targeting article titles in selected SSC journals. The aim is to capture the basic features and patterns of homicide research conducted by scholars affiliated with European institutions and departments. Research activity is then examined in terms of its quantity, patterns and trends, with attention to theoretical approaches and emphases. Our analyses suggest that European homicide research is increasing, is relatively concentrated to specific countries with strong homicide research traditions, and shows a rising percentage of female scholars. In terms of method and substance, qualitative and mixed methods appear to be ascendant, and research increasingly focuses on sub-types of homicide rather than on homicide in general. The most frequent topic of special homicide research is intimate partner homicide, with genocide and homicide-suicide studies also drawing European attention. The theoretical traditions of SSC-based homicide research are nearly always acknowledged and often explicitly developed. Social control theory emerges as the most discussed and ascendant theory. In addition to narrative commentary of emerging themes, we describe the 'uses of theory' in European homicide research, and detect a fruitful tension between nomothetic and idiographic approaches.

AB Little is known about mortality among firesetters. However, they hold many risk factors associated with elevated mortality. This study aimed to investigate mortality rates and patterns in the course of a 39-year follow-up of a consecutive sample (n=441) of pretrial male firesetters evaluated in a forensic psychiatric unit in Finland. For each firesetter, four controls matched for age, sex and place of birth were randomly selected from the Central Population Register. Mortality data was obtained from the Causes of Death statistics. By the end of the follow-up period, 48.0% of the firesetters and 22.0% of the controls had died (OR 2.47, 95% CI 2.00-3.05). Altogether, 24.1% of the firesetters and 17.6% of the control subjects had died of natural causes (OR 1.49, 95% Cl 1.16-1.92), whereas 20.9% and 3.8% respectively, died an unnatural death (OR 6.71, 95% CI 4.79-9.40). Alcohol-related deaths were more frequent among firesetters than controls. Our findings confirm that fire-setting behavior is associated with high mortality. More attention must be paid to the treatment of suicidality, psychiatric comorbidities and alcohol use disorders within this group both during and after their sentences.

AB Objective
   To investigate the putative association between isotretinoin treatment and depressive symptoms or suicidal ideation among Finnish male military conscripts.
   Methods
   Consecutive acne patients were enrolled into an uncontrolled, prospective 12-week follow-up study conducted at the Central Military Hospital, Helsinki, Finland. Of the 135 patients prescribed isotretinoin, 126 (93.3%) completed the follow-up. Depression and suicidal ideation were investigated with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) at baseline, weeks 4-6, and weeks 10-12.
   Results
   BDI mean score was low at baseline and declined further significantly (p < 0.001) during the follow-up from 3.0 (SD 3.948) to 1.8 (SD 3.783) among patients on isotretinoin. Moreover, the proportion of patients with clinically significant depressive symptoms (BDI >= 10) declined non-significantly from 7.1 % to 3.2 %. Suicidal ideation was reported by 17 (13.5 %) patients at baseline and 9 (7.1%) patients at the end of the follow-up (NS). During the follow-up, one non-depressed patient attempted suicide while intoxicated by alcohol.
   Conclusion
   On group level, isotretinoin seems not to be typically associated with treatment-emergent depression or suicidal ideation among young men. However, the possibility that individual patients may be susceptible for mood effects of isotretinoin as a rare idiosyncratic reaction can not be excluded.

AB The aims of the present study were to determine the current prevalence of personal car usage for holiday trips among Finnish conscripts and to analyze conscripts' fatal road accidents. The data included questionnaire data collected from 259 young conscripts at a garrison in southeastern Finland and data on 46 fatal road accidents caused by conscripts during the years 1991-2004, extracted from the national database of fatal road accidents studied in depth. The questionnaire data showed that one-third (35.9%) of young Finnish conscripts had used personal cars to travel to or from the garrison in the preceding 2 months. More than one-half of them reported driving while fatigued (a majority reported several occasions of such driving). In addition to those driving themselves, 41.6% of the conscripts rode at least occasionally as a passenger in a car driven by a fellow conscript. Analysis of the fatality data showed that one-half of the conscripts' fatal accidents occurred on the way to or from the garrison or while on duty. Falling asleep was the main cause of all conscripts' accidents (34.8%), with the largest proportion occurring when departing for leave (42.9%). Haste (including speeding) was the second greatest factor contributing to accidents occurring on the way to or from the garrison (26.1%), whereas drunk driving (22.7%) and suspected suicides (18.2%) were typical of accidents occurring on leave.

AB This study investigated how the level of school performance is associated with suicidal behavior and psychiatric disorders among adolescent psychiatric inpatients aged 12-17 years.
   Data were collected from 508 adolescents (300 girls, 208 boys; age 12-17 years) admitted to inpatient psychiatric hospitalization between April 2001 and March 2006. Information on the adolescents' school performance, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and self-mutilation as well as psychiatric DSM-IV diagnoses was obtained using the Schedule for Affective Disorder and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children.
   An elevated risk of suicidal ideation (OR = 3.6, 95% CI 1.3-10.2, P = 0.017) and of psychotic disorders (OR = 3.2, 95% CI 1.0-10.0, P = 0.048) was observed among male adolescents performing well in school. In addition, adolescents with poor school performance had an increased likelihood of substance-related disorder both in boys (OR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-6.1, P = 0.027) and girls (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.2-5.1, P = 0.011).
   Our findings indicate that psychotic inpatient male adolescents performing well in school are at an elevated risk of suicidal ideation. Although good school performance is often considered a marker of high intelligence and good general ability, symptoms of major psychiatric disorders and suicidality need to be taken very seriously among adolescents performing well in school.

AB The detrimental effects of substance abuse on the individual and on society are well known. Health care resources must target where they are most needed This study investigated (1) whether the increased risk of being hospitalized for alcohol abuse and drug abuse among certain immigrant groups is present in the next generation and (2) whether having one parent born in the host country (i.e., Sweden) has a protective effect on the risk of being hospitalized for alcohol abuse and drug abuse among second-generation immigrants. In total, 2,243,546 persons aged 20-39 years were followed from I January 1992 until 31 December 1999 for first hospital admission due to alcohol abuse or drug abuse. A Cox regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios for each diagnosis group. When the Swedish majority population was used as reference, the highest risks of alcohol abuse and drug abuse were found among first- and second-generation Finns, after adjustment for income. Among second-generation Finns with one parent born in Sweden, the increased risk of being hospitalized for alcohol abuse and drug abuse was lower than among second-generation Finns with both parents born in Finland. Health care resources need to target certain groups of first- and second-gene ration immigrants.

DE arctic; adaptation; disequilibrium; subsistence; migration
ID TRADITIONAL ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE
AB This special issue of Cross-Cultural Research presents four papers each of which in their own way addresses the question of how Arctic populations tackle the high levels of unpredictability and risk associated with their environment. It takes as a starting point the evidence for and against aspects of disequilibrium between humans, animals, and their environment. The authors consider both contemporary and historical Indigenous Arctic populations and the dynamics of human-animal relations in the context of an ever-changing socioecology of the Arctic. Three overarching sources of disequilibrium are identified: (a) disruption in existing ecological networks due to climate and environmental upheaval, (b) effects of sociopolitical change (including migration and disease), and, finally, (c) changes to subsistence strategies. Based on contemporary field studies from across the Arctic, including the Ust'-Avam and Samoyed from the Taimyr Region in Russia, Sami in Finland, Yukagir and Chukchi from Siberia, and the historic Thule community from Greenland, the authors illustrate how, despite apparent disequilibria, there is nevertheless notable resilience evident in the coupling of human-environmental systems. Documenting past and present changes in local livelihoods, subsistence patterns, and sociocultural practices helps us understand the wider context in which these cultures persist. It also allows us to explore what factors are significant in supporting the long-term resilience of Indigenous communities, especially in the context of challenges, such as high levels of addiction, depression and suicide, facing contemporary arctic societies.

AB Background: The incidence of depression is expected to increase over the next 20 years, and many people will have to deal with it. It has been reported that up to 40% of university students experience levels of depression. Several negative consequences are associated with depression symptoms, such as memory impairment, suicide, and substance abuse. Recently, researchers have been studying possible associations between depression and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which may modify depression symptoms. The aim of the present study was to find an association between PUFA levels and depression among Iranian postgraduate students in Malaysia.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2011 with 402 Iranian postgraduate students who were studying in Malaysia. The participants included 173 (43%) women and 229 (57%) men, and the mean age of the participants was 32.54 +/- 6.22 years.
   Results: After adjustment for several potential confounders including sex, age, BMI, PUFAs, MUFAs, and SFAs, monthly expenses, close friends, living in campus, smoking, education, and marital status in a logistic regression model, an inverse relationship was found between depression symptoms and the dietary intake of PUFAs.
   Conclusion: We found an inverse association between PUFA intake and depression symptoms in Iranian postgraduate students in Malaysia. We, therefore, concluded that long-term intake of PUFAs may modify or prevent depression symptoms.

AB Objective The mortality of psychiatric patients is higher than that of the general population. Earlier studies have typically focused on specific diagnostic categories or causes of death. The aim of this study was to assess the overall mortality in acute psychiatric hospital patients covering all diagnostic groups, with special emphasis on substance abuse. Methods The sample consisted of all 18-64-year old patients (n = 3,835) treated or evaluated in the acute wards of the Department of Psychiatry at Tampere University Hospital between the years 1999 and 2003, who were followed-up until the end of the year 2005. We assessed the various causes of death according to background variables in bivariate and multivariate analyses and calculated the standardized mortality ratios (SMRs). Results During the study period 379 subjects died (9.9% of the sample). Mortality among men was almost twice as high as among women. Of all deaths, 45.6% were considered to be alcohol or drug related. SMR covering all subjects was 6.55. The SMRs for unnatural causes were higher than those for natural causes. The highest SMRs for unnatural causes of death were found in patients with mood disorders patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Use of coercive measures was associated with increased mortality. Conclusion Mortality among Finnish psychiatric acute hospital patients is considerably higher than in general population. Excessive alcohol consumption plays a major role in causing excess deaths that could be potentially avoided.

DT Article

ID PREGNANCY-RELATED MORTALITY; UNITED-STATES; FINLAND; WOMEN
AB Background: The magnitude of maternal mortality is underestimated as deaths occurring beyond the traditional 42-day time period after the pregnancy ending ('late death') have not been reported routinely in Australia.
   Aims: The aims of this study were to undertake a data linkage study to improve the ascertainment of maternal deaths and to determine the number of deaths occurring 43-365 days after the pregnancy ended ('late maternal death').
   Methods: Data from the New South Wales Midwives Data Collection were linked with the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare National Death Index. Australian identified pregnancy-related deaths were then coded as direct, indirect and incidental to the pregnancy.
   Results: During the period 1994-2001, 173 maternal deaths were identified. Of these, 97 were classified as occurring up to 42 days of the pregnancy ending, 15 (15.5%) of which were previously unknown to the maternal mortality committee. In addition, 76 deaths were classified as occurring between 43 and 365 days after the pregnancy ended. The majority (70 of 76) of these late deaths were only identified through the linkage study. Most (73 of 76) of these deaths were classified as indirect maternal deaths with the most common causes of deaths suicide (n = 23), cardiac disorders (n = 16) or accident/violence (n = 16).
   Conclusions: The ascertainment of maternal and late maternal mortality was enhanced through data linkage of birth and mortality data. Data linkage is a viable method for monitoring late maternal deaths.

AB Background: While numerous studies have documented the high comorbidity of major depressive disorder (MDD) with individual mental disorders, no published study has reported overall current comorbidity with all Axis I and II disorders among psychiatric patients with MDD, nor systematically investigated variations in current comorbidity by socio-demographic factors, inpatient versus outpatient status, and number of lifetime depressive episodes.
   Method: Psychiatric outpatients and inpatients in Vantaa, Finland, were prospectively screened for an episode of DSM-IV MDD, and 269 patients with a new episode of MDD were enrolled in the Vantaa Depression MDD Cohort Study. Axis I and II comorbidity was assessed via semi-structured Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry, version 2.0, and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R personality disorders interviews.
   Results: The great majority (79%) of patients with MDD suffered from 1 or more current comorbid mental disorders. including anxiety disorder (57%), alcohol use disorder (25%), and personality disorder (44%), Several anxiety disorders were associated with specific Axis II clusters, and panic disorder with agoraphobia was associated with inpatient status. The prevalence of personality disorders varied with inpatient versus outpatient status., number of lifetime depressive episodes. and type of residential area, and the prevalence of substance use disorders varied with gender and inpatient versus outpatient status.
   Conclusion: Most psychiatric patients with MDD have at least 1 current comorbid disorder. Comorbid disorders are associated not only with other comorbid disorders, but also with sociodemographic factors, inpatient versus outpatient status, and lifetime number of depressive episodes. The influence of these variations on current comorbidity patterns among MDD patients needs to be taken account of in treatment facilities.

AB Background The use of antidepressants, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), has been questioned due to poor efficacy and safety. We examined whether young violent offenders were more likely antidepressant users prior to their first violent offence than other young persons.
   Methods The study is a follow-up of children born in Finland in 1987 (n= 59 120), linking national registers to each other using personal identity codes. Data on psychotropic drug use came from a register of reimbursed drugs and data on crimes from a register on court convictions (after the age of 14 years). Participants were followed until the age of 18 years, and for some analyses until the end of the follow-up (mean 21 years). To adjust for differences in background characteristics, regression analyses for antidepressant use were made, using the no-conviction group as the reference.
   Results Proportions of young people convicted by the age of 18 years were: 5% of boys (1.7% for violent crimes) and 1% (0.5%) of girls. Antidepressant use (both overall and for SSRIs) prior to violent crime was more common among those convicted than among those without convictions. Among boys with repeated violent crimes, it was also more common than among boys with non-violent crimes. Adjustment for differences in background characteristics decreased the associations between antidepressant use and violent crime, but did not eliminate them.
   Conclusions The results add further evidence for caution in prescribing antidepressants among young persons. It also calls for a reanalysis of violence measures in the original trial data.

AB This study aims to analyse mental symptoms, psychotropic drug use and alcohol consumption, in immigrant women born in Finland, the other Nordic countries, Eastern Europe, Western Europe and countries outside Europe, compared with Swedish-born women, and furthermore, to study if age at immigration may have an influence. All women (n = 10,766) aged 50 - 59 years and living in the Lund area of southern Sweden received a postal invitation to a health survey named the Women's Health in Lund Area; 64.2% (n = 6917) participated. The participants answered a questionnaire including prevalence of mental symptoms during the past 3 months, regular use of psychotropic drugs, alcohol consumption during an average week, country of birth and age at immigration. Severe mental symptoms were more common among most immigrant groups compared with native Swedes, but the association to country of birth was not significant after adjustment for possible confounders. Regular use of hypnotics was more common among Nordic immigrants only (odds ration, OR = 4.4). East European and non-European immigrants less often were alcohol consumers (OR = 1.6 and OR = 3.8). Heavy drinking was more common among non-Nordic immigrants who immigrated at a younger age than at an older age. Furthermore, it was found that although East European and non-European immigrants had a higher educational level, they were less often gainfully employed compared with native Swedes. In middle-aged women, country of birth as well as age at immigration are important factors to consider in relation to alcohol consumption, but these factors may be of less importance considering mental health.

AB The purpose of this study was to describe the impact of peer support on post-traumatic stress disorder in parents who have experienced the death of a child, the factors associated with the parents' post-traumatic stress reactions and the parents' experiences of peer support. The research data comprise the responses of parents who participated in a family weekend organised by Child Death Families Finland (KAPY). The data were collected 2 weeks before (n = 110) and 2 weeks after (n = 73) the family weekend by a questionnaire consisting of items designed to identify the relevant background variables and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), a self-report measure for assessing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Statistical methods were applied in the data analysis. No statistically significant differences were observed in the parents' stress reactions 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after the family weekend. The stress reactions, on the other hand, had a statistically significant association with the self-perceived health of the parents, the age at which their child had died and the time that had elapsed since the death. Two-thirds of the parents regarded the peer support provided during the family weekend as supportive or very supportive. The parents also regarded the support provided during the weekend as important, although the support had no statistically significant impact on their stress reactions. One can draw the conclusion that the parents experienced the family weekend and the peer support provided during it as supportive.

AB Introduction: To obtain reliable information on nicotine and drug use through a population-based study, the prevalence of nicotine use in deceased young adults was studied in the Finnish postmortem toxicology database for a 3-year period. The nicotine user and non-nicotine user groups were compared by alcohol, drug, and drug-of-abuse findings and by the manner of death.
   Methods: Nicotine users were identified based on detection of nicotine, cotinine, and/or trans-3'-hydroxycotinine in urine from a population-based sample of deceased young adults aged 15-34 years at the time of death (n = 1,623, similar to 60% of all fatalities). Background information from case referrals was used to distinguish the abuse of medicines from their therapeutic use. The manner of death was taken from death certificates.
   Results: Nicotine use was more common in young adults (75%) than among all cases in the database (55%). There were twice as many ethanol-positive cases in nicotine users (60%) than in non-nicotine users (30%). Nicotine use was common (70%-79%) among individuals on antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and/or hypnotics and sedatives. The proportion of nicotine users was also high among the drugs-of-abuse positive cases (85%). There were fewer deaths that were classified as natural in the nicotine users group.
   Conclusions: Among deceased young adults, nicotine use was two to three times as common as has been estimated for the corresponding living population (20%-30%). Nicotine use was also strongly associated with substance abuse and mental illnesses requiring pharmacotherapy. This group of young adults usually cannot be reached by traditional health surveys.

AB Background
   People with mental disorders evince excess mortality due to natural and unnatural deaths. The relative life expectancy of people with mental disorders is a proxy measure of effectiveness of social policy and health service provision.
   Aims
   To evaluate trends in health outcomes of people with serious mental disorders.
   Method
   We examined nationwide 5-year consecutive cohorts of people admitted to hospital for mental disorders in Denmark, Finland and Sweden in 1987-2006. In each country the risk population was identified from hospital discharge registers and mortality data were retrieved from cause-of-death registers. The main outcome measure was life expectancy at age 15 years.
   Results
   People admitted to hospital for a mental disorder had a two-to threefold higher mortality than the general population in all three countries studied. This gap in life expectancy was more pronounced for men than for women. The gap decreased between 1987 and 2006 in these countries, especially for women. The notable exception was Swedish men with mental disorders. In spite of the positive general trend, men with mental disorders still live 20 years less, and women 15 years less, than the general population.
   Conclusions
   During the era of deinstitutionalisation the life expectancy gap for people with mental disorders has somewhat diminished in the three Nordic countries. Our results support further development of the Nordic welfare state model, i.e. tax-funded community-based public services and social protection. Health promotion actions, improved access to healthcare and prevention of suicides and violence are needed to further reduce the life expectancy gap.

AB In a series of 202 postmortem toxicology cases, the CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genes were genotyped, and the concentrations of amitriptyline (AT) and six metabolites were analyzed. The polymorphic CYP2D6 and CYP209 genes encode enzymes participating in the metabolism of several potentially toxic drugs, and mutations in these genes may lead to adverse drug reactions, possibly even intoxications. AT was chosen as the substrate of interest because it is mainly metabolized by these enzymes, is considered relatively toxic, and ranks among the major causes of fatal drug poisoning in Finland. Our objective was to evaluate genetically determined interindividual variation in conjunction with metabolite ratios of drugs found in toxicological analysis in a series of medicolegal autopsies.
   Positive correlations were found between the proportion of trans-hydroxylated metabolites and the number of functional copies of CYP2D6 and between the proportion of demethylated metabolites and the number of functional copies of CYP2C19. None of the accidental or undetermined AT poisonings coincided with the CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 genotype which predicts a poor metabolizer phenotype. However, an unusually high femoral blood concentration of AT, 60 mg/l, was found in one suicide case with no functional CYP2D6 genes. Our study shows a concordance of AT metabolite patterns with CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 Genotypes in the presence of confounding factors typical for postmortem material. This result demonstrates the feasibility of postmortem pharmacogenetic analysis and supports the dominant role of genes in drug metabolism. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aims The risk of alcohol-related disorders in first- and second-generation rants in Sweden were investigated and compared with the Swedish majority population to assess how alcohol habits are modified over generations in a new society.
   Design Register study based on multivariate analyses of demographic data, including information on country of birth, from the Swedish Population and Housing Census of 1985 linked to data on hospital admissions for alcohol-related disorders during 1990-99 in the National Hospital Discharge Register.
   Participants The study population consisted of a national cohort of 1.25 million youth born 1968-79 and 1.47 million adults born 1929-65. Results First- and second-generation immigrants from Finland had higher relative risks (RRs) for hospital admission because of an alcohol-related disorder compared to the Swedish majority population (socio-economic adjusted RRs 2.1 and 1.9, respectively), while first-generation immigrants born in southern Europe, the Middle East and other non-European countries had lower risks. Second-generation immigrants with heritage in southern Europe, the Middle East and other non-European countries had socio-economic adjusted RRs that were higher relative to the first generation immigrants but lower relative to the Swedish majority population. Intercountry adoptees had the highest adjusted RR (2.5).
   Conclusions Patterns of alcohol abuse in the country of origin are strong determinants of alcohol-related disorders in first-generation immigrants. The patterns in second-generation immigrants are influenced by parental countries of origin as well as patterns in the majority population. The Finnish minority and intercountry adoptees are of particular concern in prevention.

AB Background: We examined mortality in schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD) and non-schizophrenic psychosis (NSSD) compared to individuals without psychosis, and whether perinatal factors predict mortality.
   Methods: Within Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (n = 10 933; 203 with SSD, 178 with NSSD), mortality was followed until end of 2011 by national register. Wantedness of pregnancy, mother's antenatal depression, smoking and age, parity, paternal socio-economic status (SES) and family type at birth were examined as predictors of mortality.
   Results: Mortality was higher in SSD (hazard ratio (HR) 3.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.38-5.45) and NSSD (4.05; 2.65-6.17) compared to persons without psychoses after adjustment for gender. HR for natural death was 2.01 (0.82-4.91) in SSD and 4.63 (2.43-8.80) in NSSD after adjustment for gender. Corresponding figures for unnatural deaths were 4.71 (2.94-7.54) and 2.94 (1.56-5.55), respectively. Among non-psychotic persons, mother's depression, smoking and low SES predicted mortality after adjustment for gender and parental psychoses (and SES), whereas among psychosis those whose father was a farmer had lower risk of mortality compared to those with high SES.
   Conclusions: Individuals with SSD had a higher risk of unnatural death and individuals with NSSD of natural and unnatural deaths. Perinatal factors seem to be more important predictors of mortality in individuals without psychoses than with psychoses. According to population-based long follow-up data, it is important to pay attention to somatic morbidity behind natural causes of death in psychoses and to prevent suicides in order to prevent excess mortality.

AB Background: Animal studies have revealed seasonal patterns in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) monoamine (MA) turnover. In humans, no study had systematically assessed seasonal patterns in CSF MA turnover in a large set of healthy adults.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Standardized amounts of CSF were prospectively collected from 223 healthy individuals undergoing spinal anesthesia for minor surgical procedures. The metabolites of serotonin (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, 5-HIAA), dopamine (homovanillic acid, HVA) and norepinephrine (3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, MPHG) were measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Concentration measurements by sampling and birth dates were modeled using a non-linear quantile cosine function and locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS, span = 0.75). The cosine model showed a unimodal season of sampling 5-HIAA zenith in April and a nadir in October (p-value of the amplitude of the cosine = 0.00050), with predicted maximum (PCmax) and minimum (PCmin) concentrations of 173 and 108 nmol/L, respectively, implying a 60% increase from trough to peak. Season of birth showed a unimodal 5-HIAA zenith in May and a nadir in November (p = 0.00339; PCmax = 172 and PCmin = 126). The non-parametric LOESS showed a similar pattern to the cosine in both season of sampling and season of birth models, validating the cosine model. A final model including both sampling and birth months demonstrated that both sampling and birth seasons were independent predictors of 5-HIAA concentrations.
   Conclusion: In subjects without mental illness, 5-HT turnover shows circannual variation by season of sampling as well as season of birth, with peaks in spring and troughs in fall.

AB Background Studying drugged drivers gives complementary information about mortality of drug users, which mainly has been studied among opioid abusers. The aim of this study was to analyse mortality rates and causes of death among drivers under the influence of drugs (DUID) in Finland and compare them with the general Finnish population during 1993-2006.
   Methods Register data from 5832 DUID suspects apprehended by the police were studied, with a reference group (n = 74 809) drawn from the general Finnish population. Deaths were traced from the National Death Register. Survival and differences in mortality hazards were estimated using Kaplane-Meier plots and Cox regression models.
   Results The hazard of death was higher among male (HR 9.6, CI 8.7 to 10.6) and female (HR 9.1, CI 6.4 to 12.8) DUID suspects compared to the reference population. Among male DUID suspects, cause-specific hazards were highest for poisoning/overdose, violence and suicide. 24% of DUID suspects and 8% of reference subjects were under the influence of drugs/alcohol at the time of death. Poly-drug findings indicated excess in mortality among drugged drivers. Hazard of death was higher among male DUID suspects who had findings for benzodiazepines only (HR 10.0, CI 8.4 to 11.9) or benzodiazepines with alcohol (HR 9.6, CI 8.2 to 11.2), than with findings for amphetamines (HR 4.6, CI 2.7 to 7.6).
   Conclusion DUID suspects had an increased risk of death in all observed causes of death. Findings for benzodiazepines indicated excessive mortality over findings for amphetamines. Preventive actions should be aimed especially at DUID subgroups using benzodiazepines.

AB Background: Detecting patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) is important, and feasible screening instruments are needed. Aims : To investigate our Finnish translation of the McLean Screening Instrument for Borderline Personality Disorder (MSI-BPD) as a screen for BPD among psychiatric outpatients, its psychometric and screening properties, and feasibility in improving the recognition of BPD. Methods : We screened 302 consecutive psychiatric outpatients at the Department of Psychiatry at the Helsinki University Central Hospital in Finland for BPD using the Finnish MSI-BPD. Of the patients, 69 (23%) were assigned to a random sample that was stratified according to the number of screens returned to the outpatient clinics, and further stratified into the three strata, high scores deliberately enriched, according to the MSI-BPD scores. Finally, a stratified random sample of 45 patients was interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II) by the interviewers blind to the patients' MSI-BPD scores. Results : One third (29%) of 302 screened patients had a positive MSI-BPD. The internal consistency of the MSI-BPD was good (Cronbach's alpha = 0.77). Of the 45 patients interviewed with the SCID-II, 11 (24%) were found to have BPD, five (46%) of whom a previously clinical diagnosis. In a ROC analysis, the optimal cut-off score was 7. Conclusions: The translated MSI-BPD was found to be a feasible screen for BPD in Finnish psychiatric outpatient care. Further studies investigating the clinical utility of MSI-BPD in larger clinical samples are warranted.

AB Background: A large proportion of premature deaths in Russia since the early 1990s, following the transition from communism, have been attributed to hazardous drinking. Little is known about the correlates of alcohol consumption. We present new data on the consumption of alcoholic beverages among middle-aged and older Russians and identify socio-demographic, socio-economic, and life-course correlates of frequent drinking.
   Methods: Within the framework of the PrivMort project, conducted in 30 industrial towns in the European part of Russia, we acquired information on the frequency of drinking among 22,796 respondents and 57,907 of their surviving and deceased relatives. We fit three-level mixed-effects logistic regression models of frequent drinking in which respondents' relatives, aged 40 and over, are nested in their families and towns.
   Results: Deceased male relatives consumed alcohol significantly more often, while deceased female relatives consumed alcohol significantly less often than the respondents of corresponding gender. In a multivariable analysis, we found that individuals' education, communication with family members, labour market status, history of unemployment, and occupational attainment are all significant correlates of frequent drinking in Russia. These associations are stronger among men rather than among women.
   Conclusion: There are significant differences between frequency of drinking among surviving and deceased individuals and frequent drinking is associated with a wide array of individual socio-demographic, socio-economic, and life course factors that can partially explain high alcohol consumption in post-communist Russia.

AB Background: To investigate seasonal variations in telephone calls to a help-line for children, and their correlation to changes in length of day, latitude and age. Method: 691,787 calls to the Red Cross Help-Line in Norway for children in the three-year period 1996-1998 were included. Results: Monthly frequencies of calls deviated significantly from an expected even distribution (chi(2)=9446.34, df=11, P<0.0001). The frequency curve for calls peaked in April and October and had its lowest level in July and December. Variation was pronounced: the mean number of daily calls varied between 436 in July and 886 in April. There was a strong and positive correlation between the number of calls and the change in length of day across the year (r(s)=0.76, N=12, P<0.01). Increasing latitude correlated positively with the range of the monthly observed/expected ratios of calls (r(s)=0.79, N=7, P<0.05). The frequency of calls was largest among children 12 to 14 years of age. Age correlated negatively with the range of monthly observed/expected ratios of calls (r=-0.94, N=12, P<0.001). Limitations: Social and cultural factors could not be explored in the design used in the present study. Conclusions: The frequency of calls from children correlates positively with change in length of day (i.e., maximal in spring and fall), and the magnitude of the seasonal variation correlates positively with latitude and negatively with age. Knowledge of seasonal variation in requests for help may have value in planning services for children. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Monthly binding densities (B-max) of [H-3]citalopram to the platelet serotonin transporter (SERT) was measured longitudinally over 1 year in a control group of 18 healthy Finnish male volunteers. Single platelet samples were also analysed from 33 men who were incarcerated for violent crimes during the same calendar year. A statistically significant seasonal variation in SERT B-max was observed in both data sets, and bi-monthly floating averages for SERT B a, were calculated and then fit to an annual sinusoidal curve for both groups. The B-max for platelet [H-3]citalopram binding showed a statistically significant (p=0.001) seasonal variance between a winter (January-February) maximum of 1590 fmol/mg protein and a summer (July-August) minimum of 1216 fmol/mg protein for the control group, with an R-2 of 70% for the annual sinusoidal curve fit. A statistically significant (p = 0.007) seasonal variance was also observed between a winter (January-February) maximum of 1980 fmol/mg protein and an autumnal (August-September) minimum of 1234 fmol/mg protein for the violent offenders, again with an R-2 of 70% for the annual sinusoidal curve fit. This observation lends additional support to the idea that violent human behavior and impulsivity may be directly linked to values of SERT Bmax, which can be affected by various psychoactive drugs and also varies with the natural change of seasons.

AB Aim: We investigated the associations between clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR), psychotic-like symptoms and suicidality among adolescent psychiatric patients.
   Methods: The sample consisted of 54 CHR and 107 non-CHR psychiatric patients aged 15-18 in Helsinki, Finland, who were assessed at the beginning of their psychiatric treatment with the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS). Current suicidality was measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (item 9), while lifetime suicidality was evaluated from all available data, including patient files. The participants were followed for 2.8-8.9 years via the national hospital discharge register, with the follow-up outcome being intentional self-harm. Data on suicides were also gathered from the Causes of Death statistics.
   Results: Only 30.5% of the adolescents had no suicidal ideation at the beginning of their treatment. CHR risk state and SIPS-assessed delusions, suspiciousness, and hallucinations were associated with higher current suicidality. Of the 154 adolescents with register follow-up, there were five (3.2%) with intentional self-harm resulting in hospital treatment, all female. CHR status was not associated with self-harm. Current suicidality, familial risk of psychosis, and SIPS decreased expression of emotions were associated with self-harm during follow-up. In a Cox regression analysis model among girls, only decreased expression of emotions remained a significant predictor of intentional self-harm. Baseline suicidality measures were not associated with transitions to psychosis.
   Conclusions: CHR status was associated with higher current suicidality but did not predict follow-up intentional self-harm in treatment-seeking adolescents. Decreased expression of emotions may indicate higher risk of intentional self-harm in adolescent treatment-seeking girls.

   EPISODE; SCALE
AB Background. Despite the need for rational allocation of resources and cooperation between different treatment settings, clinical differences in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) between primary and psychiatric care remain obscure. We investigated these differences in representative patient populations from primary care versus secondary level psychiatric care in the city of Vantaa, Finland.
   Method. We compared MDD patients from primary care in the Vantaa Primary Care Depression Study (PC-VDS) (n=79) with psychiatric out-patients (n=223) and in-patients (n=46) in the Vantaa Depression Study (VDS). DSM-IV diagnoses were assigned by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders (SCID-I in PC-VDS) or Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN in VDS), and SCID-II interviews. Comparable information was collected on depression severity, Axis I and II co-morbidity, suicidal behaviour, preceding clinical course, and attitudes towards and pathways to treatment.
   Results. Prevalence of psychotic subtype and severity of depression were highest among in-patients, but otherwise few clinical differences between psychiatric and primary care patients were detected. Suicide attempts, alcohol dependence, and cluster A personality disorder were associated with treatment in psychiatric care, whereas cluster B personality disorder was associated with primary care treatment. Patients' choice of the initial point of contact for current depressive symptoms seemed to be independent of prior clinical history or attitude towards treatment.
   Conclusions. Severe, suicidal and psychotic depression cluster in psychiatric in-patient settings, as expected. However, MDD patients in primary care or psychiatric out-patient settings may not differ markedly in their clinical characteristics. This apparent blurring of boundaries between treatment settings calls for enhanced cooperation between settings, and clearer and more structured division of labour.

DE fatal drug poisonings; forensic toxicology; medico-legal cause-of-death
   determination; cause-of-death coding; mortality statistics
ID DEATH CERTIFICATION; VALIDATION
AB The entire fatal drug poisoning panorama in Finland is considered in terms of three categories: accidental, self-inflicted and undetermined (whether accidental or with intent to harm) deaths. The study material consisted of all 500 deaths in 1997 that medical examiners, after examination(s) at the Forensic Toxicology Division (FTD) of the Department of Forensic Medicine, University of Helsinki, officially certified as resulting from drug poisoning. These deaths were matched with data on the same deaths registered at Statistics Finland (SF), the national mortality statistics office. The SF register included 72 additional instances of deaths resulting from drug poisoning. In all but two of these cases, the cause-of-death determination was based on a medico-legal inquest with autopsy and forensic toxicological examination(s) and was certified, in most of the cases, as due to the alcohol component in multiple-toxicant combinations. Reclassifying these deaths at SF to the category of drug component is in accordance with current International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) regulation of coding "to the medicinal agent when combined with alcohol"; the principle and practice, which is recommended to be amended to equalize the status of alcohol and drug when explicitly stated by a forensic examiner as the principal toxicant in combined poisonings.
   With regard to manner-of-death, the agreement rates between medico-legally proven deaths from drug poisoning and those registered at SF were 79.8% for accidents, 98.5% for suicides and 0% (nil) for undetermined deaths, at the level of three-character external cause codes (E-code). All deaths originally certified as undetermined were re-assigned, most frequently to the category of accidental death. Since within an advanced and sophisticated medico-legal system, a medical examiner's evidence-based statement, even when the conclusion reached is undetermined (as to intent), should be taken as a compelling argument, the practice of reclassification cannot be considered advisable because assembled information is lost.
   Concerning the assigned drug-specific groups, the agreement according to the manner-of-death between certifications and registrations was fairly good. From among the accidents, however, opioid poisonings were re-assigned in 11 (29.7%) cases, mostly to the drug abuse/dependence categories, i.e. they were considered as natural deaths by the statistics office. The drug-specific observations were possible only by using the codes from the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification of drugs. This is why the incorporation of ATC codes into the ICD system, whenever reasonable, is recommended. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background Recent studies report increased risks of both cancer and mortality in paediatric onset inflammatory bowel disease (pIBD) but the reproducibility of this is unknown. Aim To estimate the risk of cancer and mortality in the Danish and Finnish pIBD population in a 23-year period compared to the general population. Methods The pIBD population was defined as individuals registered in the national patient registries with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) or IBD-unclassified before their 18th birthday from 1992 to 2014. This cohort was cross referenced with the national cancer and mortality registries identifying all pIBD patients who subsequently developed cancer and/ or died and followed up to the end of 2014. Risk estimates are presented as standardised incidence ratios calculated based on incidence figures from the populations. Results Six thousand six hundred and eight-nine patients with pIBD were identified (median age at follow-up 22.3 years; median follow-up: 9.6 years [interquartile range: 4.8-16.0]). Seventy-two subsequently developed cancer and 65 died. The standardised incidence ratio of cancer in general was 2.6 (95% CI: 1.8-3.7) and 2.5 (95% CI: 1.8-3.4) in CD and UC, respectively. The standardised mortality ratios were 2.2 (95% CI: 1.4-3.4) and 3.7 (95% CI: 2.7-5.0) in CD and UC, respectively. The leading causes for mortality were cancer, suicide and infections. Conclusions We found an increased risk of cancer and mortality in pIBD. This underlines the importance of cancer surveillance programs and assessment of mental health in the standard of care in adolescent pIBD patients.

AB Background We compared mortality inequalities by occupational class in Japan and South Korea with those in European countries, in order to determine whether patterns are similar. Methods National register-based data from Japan, South Korea and eight European countries (Finland, Denmark, England/Wales, France, Switzerland, Italy (Turin), Estonia, Lithuania) covering the period between 1990 and 2015 were collected and harmonised. We calculated age-standardised all-cause and cause-specific mortality among men aged 35-64 by occupational class and measured the magnitude of inequality with rate differences, rate ratios and the average inter-group difference. Results Clear gradients in mortality were found in all European countries throughout the study period: manual workers had 1.6-2.5 times higher mortality than upper non-manual workers. However, in the most recent time-period, upper non-manual workers had higher mortality than manual workers in Japan and South Korea. This pattern emerged as a result of a rise in mortality among the upper non-manual group in Japan during the late 1990s, and in South Korea during the late 2000s, due to rising mortality from cancer and external causes (including suicide), in addition to strong mortality declines among lower non-manual and manual workers. Conclusion Patterns of mortality by occupational class are remarkably different between European countries and Japan and South Korea. The recently observed patterns in the latter two countries may be related to a larger impact on the higher occupational classes of the economic crisis of the late 1990s and the late 2000s, respectively, and show that a high socioeconomic position does not guarantee better health.

TI Childhood deaths from external causes in Estonia, 2001-2005
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH

DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; INJURIES; ABUSE; UNDERASCERTAINMENT; FATALITIES;
   MORTALITY
AB Background: In 2000, the overall rate of injury deaths in children aged 0-14 was 28.7 per 100000 in Estonia, which is more than 5 times higher than the corresponding rate in neighbouring Finland. This paper describes childhood injury mortality in Estonia by cause and age groups, and validates registration of these deaths in the Statistical Office of Estonia against the autopsy data.
   Methods: The data on causes of all child deaths in Estonia in 2001-2005 were abstracted from the autopsy protocols at the Estonian Bureau of Forensic Medicine. Average annual mortality rates per 100,000 were calculated. Coverage (proportion of the reported injury deaths from the total number of injury deaths) and accuracy (proportion of correctly classified injury deaths) of the registration of causes of death in Statistical Office of Estonia were assessed by comparing the Statistical Office of Estonia data with the data from Estonian Bureau of Forensic Medicine.
   Results: Average annual mortality from external causes in 0-14 years-old children in Estonia was 19.1 per 100,000. Asphyxia and transport accidents were the major killers followed by poisoning and suicides. Relative contribution of these causes varied greatly between age groups. Intent of death was unknown for more than 10% of injury deaths. Coverage and accuracy of registration of injury deaths by Statistical Office of Estonia were 91.5% and 95.3%, respectively.
   Conclusion: Childhood mortality from injuries in Estonia is among the highest in the EU. The number of injury deaths in Statistical Office of Estonia is slightly underestimated mostly due to misclassification for deaths from diseases. Accuracy of the Statistical Office of Estonia data was high with some underestimation of intentional deaths. Moreover, high proportion of death with unknown intent suggests underestimation of intentional deaths.
   Reduction of injury deaths should be given a high priority in Estonia. More information on circumstances around death is needed to enable establishing the intent of death.

ID ACOUSTIC TRAUMA; INJURIES; TINNITUS; EAR
AB Objective - On 11 October, 2002, in the Myyrmanni shopping mall, Vantaa city, Finland, an explosion by a suicide bomber killed 7 people and injured at least 160, 44 of whom had ear trauma. We investigated the acute and subacute otologic consequences of the explosion.
   Material and Methods - Otologic examination of the 29 patients treated for ear trauma at the ENT clinic of the University Hospital of Helsinki was performed during the first month after the explosion, and a questionnaire was completed regarding subjective aural symptoms. Symptoms occurring directly after the explosion and for up to 1 month afterwards were assessed.
   Results - Of the 29 patients, 66% had tinnitus as the initial symptom, 55% hearing loss, 41% pain in the ears and 28% sound distortion. Tinnitus and hearing loss in combination were experienced by 12 patients ( 41%). Eight patients who had been situated < 10 m from the center of the explosion had a rupture of the tympanic membrane. This supported the initial evaluation by the authorities that the bomb had consisted of ≈3 kg ammonium nitrate, equivalent to ≈ 0.5 kg of trinitrotoluene. It was estimated that some kind of ear injury was likely for individuals situated < 70 m from the center of the explosion.
   Conclusions - People often think that tinnitus and hearing impairment are naturally occurring phenomena after blast exposure, and if their symptoms resolve they do not seek medical advice. However, some of them may have substantial hearing impairment, particularly at high frequencies. Otologic consultation, or at least an audiometric screening test to exclude hearing impairment, should be performed regardless of symptoms, on the basis of exposure data only. Some symptoms, such as tinnitus and hearing loss, may be permanent consequences of a blast injury and their effect on quality of life may be substantial.

AB Introduction. Women with a history of placental abruption have an increased later morbidity, but not much is known of the later mortality. Material and methods. Data on women with placental abruption (index cohort) between 1969 and 2005 (n = 7805) were collected from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register and the Finnish Medical Birth Register. A matched reference cohort consisted of women without placental abruption (n = 23 523). The causes of death were retrieved from the Cause-of-Death Register. Cause-specific mortality was compared by hazard ratios (HR). Standardized mortality ratios were calculated to compare both cohorts with the general female population. The main outcome measure was subsequent mortality. Results. By the end of 2013 there were 395 deaths in the index cohort and 863 deaths in the reference cohort. The overall mortality was increased in the index cohort compared with the reference cohort [HR 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24-1.57]. The index cohort had an increased risk of death from respiratory tract malignancies (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.05-2.82), alcohol-related causes (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.25-2.72), and external causes (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.19-2.22), especially suicide (HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.07-2.74). The mortality from cardiovascular diseases did not differ. The standardized mortality ratio was increased in the index cohort compared with the general Finnish female population (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.24), especially for respiratory tract malignancies (HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.16-2.64). The index cohort women tended to die younger than referent women (p < 0.001). Conclusions. Overall mortality among women with a history of placental abruption is increased. These women tend to die younger than referent women do.

AB Background: The relation between scoring for hopelessness/helplessness and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) in healthy study subjects (HSS) and in patients with benign breast disease (BBD) and breast cancer (BC) has not been compared in a prospective study. We, therefore, investigated hopelessness and helplessness scores versus the MADRS in 115 patients. Patients and Methods: In the Kuopio Breast Cancer Study, 115 women with breast symptoms were evaluated for hopelessness and helplessness, and for the MADRS before any diagnostic procedures were carried out. Results: In the self-rating score (SRS), hopelessness/helplessness versus the MADRS were highly significantly positively correlated in the HSS, BBD and BC groups. In the SRS, the weighted kappa values for hopelessness/helplessness versus the MADRS in the HSS, BBD and BC groups were also statistically significant. There was also a significant positive correlation in the examiner-rating score (ERS) for hopelessness versus the MADRS in the HSS, BBD and BC groups and for helplessness versus the MADRS in the HSS, BBD and BC groups. The unweighted kappa values in the ERS for hopelessness versus the MADRS were statistically highly significant for the HSS, BBD and BC groups and those for helplessness versus the MADRS in the HSS and BBD groups were statistically significant. Conclusion: A new finding with clinical relevance in the present work is the agreement between hopelessness/helplessness scores and MADRS in the SRS and ERS. In the breast cancer diagnostic unit, the identification of hopeless/helpless persons is essential in suicide prevention and it is important to assess and treat hopelessness/helplessness even though an individual may report few depressive symptoms.

AB Background: Two school shootings with altogether 18 victims took place in Finland in November 2007 and September 2008. Homicides and suicides are both associated with the copycat phenomenon. The aim of the present study was to characterize adolescent copycats who had threatened to carry out a school massacre.
   Methods: The nation-wide study evaluated 77 13- to 18-year-old adolescents who were sent for adolescent psychiatric evaluations between 8.11.2007 and 30.6.2009, one of the reasons for evaluation being a threat of massacre at school. The medical files of the copycats were retrospectively analysed using a special data collection form. Data on demographics, family-and school-related issues, previous psychiatric treatment and previous delinquency, current symptoms, family adversities and psychiatric diagnoses were collected. The severity of the threat expressed and the risk posed by the adolescent in question were evaluated. The Psychopathy Checklist Youth Version was used to assess psychopathic traits.
   Results: All of the copycats were native Finns with a mean age of 15.0 years. Almost two thirds of them had a history of previous mental health treatment before the index threat. Almost two thirds of the copycats suffered from anxiety and depressive symptoms, and almost half of the sample expressed either suicidal ideation or suicidal plans. Behavioural problems including impulse control problems, aggressive outbursts, the destruction of property as well as non-physical and physical violence against other persons were common. The diagnosis groups highlighted were behavioural and emotional disorders, mood disorders as well as schizophrenia-related disorders. The prevalence of pervasive developmental disorders was high. Only one of the copycats was assessed as expressing high traits of psychopathy.
   Conclusion: The copycats with school massacre threats were characterized with a high prevalence of mental and behavioural disorders. Like actual school shooters, they showed psychotic symptoms and traumatic experiences, but unlike the shooters, the copycats were not psychopathic.

TI Use of psychotropic drugs before pregnancy and the risk for induced
   abortion: population-based register-data from Finland 1996-2006
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID MENTAL-HEALTH; YOUNG-WOMEN; DATA QUALITY; ANXIETY; TERMINATION;
   DEPRESSION; SERVICES; SUICIDES; OUTCOMES; GROWTH
AB Background: Some, though not all studies have reported an increased risk for mental health problems after an induced abortion. Problems with design and data have compromised these studies and the generalisation of their results.
   Methods: The Finnish Medication and Pregnancy database (N = 622 671 births and 114 518 induced abortions for other than fetal reasons) in 1996-2006 was utilised to study the use of psychotropic drugs in the three months before a pregnancy ending in a birth or an induced abortion.
   Results: In total 2.1% of women with a birth and 5.1% of women with an induced abortion had used a psychotropic medicine 0-3 months before pregnancy. Psychotropic drug users terminated their pregnancies (30.9%) more often than other pregnant women (15.5%). Adjustment for background characteristics explained one third of this elevated risk, but the risk remained significantly increased among users of psychotropic medicine (OR 1.94, 95% confidence intervals 1.87-2.02). A similar risk was found for first pregnancies (30.1% vs. 18.9%; adjusted OR 1.53, 95% confidence intervals 1.42-1.65). The rate for terminating pregnancy was the highest for women using hypnotics and sedatives (35.6% for all pregnancies and 29.1% for first pregnancies), followed by antipsychotics (33.9% and 36.0%) and antidepressants (32.0% and 32.1%).
   Conclusions: The observed increased risk for induced abortion among women with psychotropic medication highlighs the importance to acknowledge the mental health needs of women seeking an induced abortion. Further studies are needed to establish the impact of pre-existing differences in mental health on mental health outcomes of induced abortions compared to outcomes of pregnancies ending in a birth.

AB Background: Nurses' voices remain unheard in most debates about euthanasia, although their crucial role in the euthanasia process is widely acknowledged. Moreover, in Canadian euthanasia law, nurses have a more active role, which further highlights the need for knowledge about nurses' attitudes towards their role in the euthanasia process. Research questions: What are Finnish nurses' attitudes towards their potential role in the euthanasia process? Which characteristics are associated with those attitudes? Research design: Cross-sectional web-based survey. Participants and research context: 1003 nurses, recruited via social media and the members' bulletin of the Finnish Nurses Association. Ethical considerations: Ethical approval was obtained from the Committee on Research Ethics of the university to which the first author was affiliated. Findings: The great majority (85.2%) of nurses felt that their perspective should be considered in decision-making related to euthanasia. Furthermore, most of the participants (74.7%) reported willingness to participate in the euthanasia process if it were legal, and 88.6% agreed that a nurse should be present when euthanasia is performed if the patient wishes so. Furthermore, over half agreed that some of the preparatory tasks were part of their job description. However, a minority (32.9%) agreed with a possible obligation to participate based on their profession. Nurses' age, religiosity and educational level influenced their attitudes in the current results. Discussion: Despite the strong agreement on decision-making concerning euthanasia and participation in the euthanasia process, obligation to participate based on the profession was rejected by most participants. Nurses regarded themselves as consultants in the decision-making process, which may indicate their unwillingness to share the responsibility for the decision itself. Conclusion: Specific safety mechanisms should be considered to protect nurses who refuse to be involved in the euthanasia process due to harm that involuntary participation might cause.

AB Depression and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are closely associated, but the mechanisms underlying this connection are unclear. Regardless of the low cholesterol levels observed in depression, a small particle size of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), as well as elevated apolipoprotein B (ApoB) levels, are related to increased CVD risk, even when levels of LDL cholesterol are low. We examined the association between elevated depressive symptoms and compositional changes in serum LDL particles in a sample of 2,456 middle-aged Finnish men. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the 18-item Human Population Laboratory Depression Scale, and the study population was divided into two groups (elevated depressive symptoms, n = 269; non-depressed, n = 2,187). The levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), and ApoB were determined. The LDL-C/ApoB ratio, a marker of compositional changes in LDL particle size, was calculated. The group with elevated depressive symptoms had lowered levels of serum TC (P = 0.028) and LDL-C (P = 0.008). No differences were observed in the LDL-C/ApoB ratio. The likelihood for belonging to the group with elevated depressive symptoms increased 10% for each 0.5 mmol/l decrease in the levels of TC (P = 0.002) or LDL-C (P = 0.001) in regression models adjusted for age, examination years, marital and socioeconomic status, energy expenditure, body mass index, CVD history, alcohol consumption, smoking, and the use of lipid-lowering, antidepressant and antipsychotic medications. Our findings suggest that greater small-particle LDL levels are not associated with depression, and are thus unlikely to underlie the association between cardiovascular risk and depression.

AB Objective: Little is known about whether economic crises widen health inequalities. Japan experienced more than 10 years of economic recession beginning in the 1990s. The question of whether socioeconomic-based inequality in self-rated health widened after the economic crisis was examined.
   Design, setting and participants: Repeated cross-sectional survey design. Two pooled datasets from 1986 and 1989 and from 1998 and 2001 were analysed separately, and temporal change was examined. The study took place in Japan among the working-age population (20-60 years old). The two surveys consisted of 168 801 and 150 016 people, respectively, with about an 80% response rate.
   Results: The absolute percentages of people reporting poor health declined across all socioeconomic statuses following the crisis. However, after controlling for confounding factors, the odds ratio ( OR) for poor self-rated health (95% confidence intervals) among middle-class non-manual workers (clerical/sales/service workers) compared with the highest class workers (managers/administrators) was 1.02 ( 0.92 to 1.14) before the crisis but increased to 1.14 ( 1.02 to 1.29) after the crisis ( p for temporal change = 0.02). The association was stronger among males. The adjusted ORs among professional workers and young female homemakers also marginally increased over time. Unemployed people were twice as likely to report poor health compared with the highest class workers throughout the period. Self-rated health of people with middle to higher incomes deteriorated in relative terms following the crisis compared with that of lower income people.
   Conclusions: Self-rated health improved in absolute terms for all occupational groups even after the economic recession. However, the relative disparity increased between the top and middle occupational groups in men.

AB Background/Aim: The relation between suicidal ideation versus hopelessness/helplessness in healthy study subjects (HSS) and in patients with benign breast disease (BBD) and breast cancer (BC) has not been compared to date in a prospective study. We, therefore, investigated suicidal ideation versus hopelessness/helplessness in 115 patients. Patients and Methods: In the Kuopio Breast Cancer Study, 115 women with breast symptoms were evaluated for hopelessness and helplessness versus suicidal/pessimistic thoughts before any diagnostic procedures were carried-out. Results: In the self-rating score (SRS), hopelessness and the helplessness versus pessimistic thoughts were significantly correlated in the HSS, BBD and BC groups. In the SRS, the weighted kappa-values for hopelessness versus pessimistic thoughts in the BBD group were also statistically significant. There was also a significant positive correlation in the examiner-rating score (ERS) in the hopelessness versus pessimistic thoughts in the HSS, BBD and BC groups, as well as in the ERS, in the helplessness versus pessimistic thoughts in the HSS and BBD groups. In SRS, the hopelessness and the helplessness versus suicidal thoughts were significantly correlated in the HSS, BBD and BC groups. There was also a significant positive correlation in the ERS in the hopelessness versus suicidal thoughts in the HSS, BBD and BC groups, as well as in the ERS, in the helplessness versus suicidal thoughts in the BBD group. Conclusion: A new finding with clinical relevance in the present work is the agreement between hopelessness/helplessness versus suicidal/pessimistic thoughts in the self-rating and examiner-rating. In the breast cancer diagnostic Unit, the identification of suicidal ideation is essential in suicide prevention and it is important to assess and treat depression even though a subject reports little suicidal ideation.

AB Objectives: We conducted a population based study aiming at finding predictors of mortality in psychotic disorders and evaluating the extent to which sociodemographic, lifestyle and health-related factors explain the excess mortality. Methods: In a nationally representative sample of Finns aged 30-70 years (n = 5642), psychotic disorders were diagnosed using structured interviews and medical records in 2000-2001. Information on mortality and causes of death was obtained of those who died by the end of year 2013. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate the mortality risk. Results: No people with affective psychoses (n = 36) died during the follow-up, thus the analysis was restricted to non-affective psychotic disorders (NAP) (n = 106). Adjusting for age and sex, NAP was statistically significantly associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 2.99, 95% CI 2.03-441) and natural-cause mortality (HR 2.81, 95% CI 1.85-4.28). After adjusting for sociodemographic factors, health status, inflammation and smoking, the HR dropped to 2.11 (95%CI 1.10-4.05) for all-cause and to 1.98 (95% CI 0.94-4.16) for natural-cause mortality. Within the NAP group, antipsychotic use at baseline was associated with reduced HR for natural-cause mortality (HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07-0.96), and smoking with increased HR (HR 3.54, 95% CI 1.07-11.69). Conclusions: The elevated mortality risk in people with NAP is only partly explained by socioeconomic factors, lifestyle, cardio-metabolic comorbidities and inflammation. Smoking cessation should be prioritized in treatment of psychotic disorders. More research is needed on the quality of treatment of somatic diseases in people with psychotic disorders.

SO EPIDEMIOLOGY

ID NEW-ZEALAND; HEALTH INEQUALITIES; VALUE-JUDGMENTS
AB Background: Holistic depiction of time-trends in average mortality rates, and absolute and relative inequalities, is challenging.
   Methods: We outline a typology for situations with falling average mortality rates (m down arrow; e.g., cardiovascular disease), rates stable over time (m-; e.g., some cancers), and increasing average mortality rates (m up arrow; e.g., suicide in some contexts). If we consider inequality trends on both the absolute (a) and relative (r) scales, there are 13 possible combination of m, a, and r trends over time. They can be mapped to graphs with relative inequality (log relative index of inequality [RII]; r) on the y axis, log average mortality rate on the x axis (m), and absolute inequality (slope index of inequality; SII; a) as contour lines. We illustrate this by plotting adult mortality trends: (1) by household income from 1981 to 2011 for New Zealand, and (2) by education for European countries.
   Results: Types range from the "best" m down arrow a down arrow r down arrow (average, absolute, and relative inequalities all decreasing; southwest movement in graphs) to the "worst" m up arrow a up arrow r up arrow (northeast). Mortality typologies in New Zealand (all-cause, cardiovascular disease, nonlung cancer, and unintentional injury) were all m down arrow r up arrow (northwest), but variable with respect to absolute inequality. Most European typologies were m down arrow r up arrow types (northwest; e.g., Finland), but with notable exceptions of m-a up arrow r up arrow (north; e.g., Hungary) and "best" or southwest m down arrow a down arrow r down arrow for Spain (Barcelona) females.
   Conclusions: Our typology and corresponding graphs provide a convenient way to summarize and understand past trends in inequalities in mortality, and hold potential for projecting future trends and target setting.

AB Background: We evaluated the occurrence of postnatal depression in general and during different seasons as part of a larger longitudinal mother-child follow-up study. Method: One hundred and eighty-five mothers, from the maternity wards of University Hospital of Oulu, Finland, completed a self-rating depression scale, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) twice: first at hospital 2-7 days after delivery and the second time at home 4 months after the delivery. Different psychosocial variables were mapped out to avoid any confounding factors. The year was divided in two separate ways: first, three different time periods were selected by the amount of sunlight: dark (October- January), intermediate (February, March, August, September) and light (April-July), and second, the year was divided by seasons. The results were analysed by the chi(2)- test for multinomials. Results: Sixteen percent (16.2) of mothers were scored as being depressed using 13 as a cut-off point immediately after the infant was born. Thirteen percent (13.0) were depressed measured 4 months postpartum. There was more mild depression in the autumn (ratio observed/expected 1,62; 95% confidence interval 1.05-2.19) immediately after delivery, using 10 as a cut-off, and less depression in the spring (0.27; 0.00-0.62) measured at home later, using 13 as a cut-off. When using classification by the amount of light there was more depression during the dark time (1.58; 1.05-2.11) immediately postpartum. Limitations: The group sizes and the amount of sample sizes collected within each month are quite small. Conclusions: It should be borne in mind that seasonal changes and alterations in the amount of light might influence the occurrence of postnatal depression. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Under-treated depression may be especially harmful in early adulthood. The aims of this study are to describe treatments received for depressive disorders, to define factors associated with treatment adequacy and dropouts from treatment in a Finnish general population sample of young adults.
   Methods: A nationally representative two-stage cluster sample of 1894 Finns aged 19 to 34 years was sent a questionnaire containing several mental health screens. All screen positives and a random sample of screen negatives were invited to participate in a mental health assessment including a SCID interview. Case records from mental health treatments for the same sample were obtained for the final diagnostic assessment. Based on all available information, receiving antidepressant pharmacotherapy for at least two months with at least four visits with any type of physician or at least eight sessions of psychotherapy within 12 months or at least four days of hospitalization were regarded as minimally adequate treatment. Treatment dropout was rated if the treatment strategy was assessed to be adequate according to the case records but the patient discontinued the visits.
   Results: Of participants with depressive disorders (n = 142), 40.9% received minimally adequate treatment. In multiple logistic regression models, substance use disorder and female gender were associated with at least one visit with a physician, while having major depressive disorder was associated with visits with a physician at least 4 times a year. Women had higher odds of having received any psychotherapy and psychotherapy lasting for at least 8 sessions in a year. Low education and a history of suicide attempt were associated with increased odds of treatment dropout. None of the factors explained the final outcome of minimally adequate treatment.
   Conclusions: Treatment adequacy in the present study was better than previously seen, but more efforts are needed to provide adequate treatment for young adults, especially those with low education and suicidality.

AB Objective: This study searched for gender differences in filicidal offense characteristics and associated variables.
   Methods: In this binational register-based study all filicide perpetrators (75 mothers and 45 fathers) and their crimes in Austria and Finland 1995-2005 were examined for putative gender differences. The assessed variables were associated with the offense characteristics, the offenders' socioeconomic and criminal history, and related stressful events.
   Results: Mothers had previously committed violent offenses less often than fathers (5% vs. 28%, p < 0.001) and they were less often employed (27% vs. 49%, p < 0.05). Mothers' victims were on average younger than those of fathers; median ages of the victims were 3.4 and 6.1 years, respectively (p < 0.001). Fathers were more often intoxicated during the offense (11% vs. 42%, p < 0.001) and also used shooting as the method of operation more often than mothers (5% vs. 27%, p < 0.001). Mothers used drowning, criminal negligence, and poisoning more often than fathers. Fathers' motives were more impulsive in nature (13% vs. 41%, p < 0.001). After the killing, mothers tried to get rid of the body more often than fathers (25% vs. 7%, p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Fathers who commit filicide may represent at least two subgroups, the one not unlike the common homicide offender; the other, the overloaded, working and suicidal father. Mothers may include several types of offenders, one of which is the neonaticide offender. More detailed descriptions and, therefore, more research are needed.
   Practice implications: Distressed parents and families need support and health care personnel, social work and other officials need to be alert to notice fatigued parents' signs of despair, especially when several stressful experiences amass. Straightforward enquiry to the situation and even practical and psychological help may be needed for enhanced protection of children. The role of employers should also be discussed in relation to the welfare of working parents. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article

   SUICIDE; RISK; STRESS; ABUSE; HOSPITALIZATION; CONSEQUENCES
AB Background: Bereavement by spousal death and child death in adulthood has been shown to lead to an increased risk of mortality. Maternal death in infancy or parental death in early childhood may have an impact on mortality but evidence has been limited to short-term or selected causes of death. Little is known about long-term or cause-specific mortality after parental death in childhood.
   Methods and Findings: This cohort study included all persons born in Denmark from 1968 to 2008 (n = 2,789,807) and in Sweden from 1973 to 2006 (n = 3,380,301), and a random sample of 89.3% of all born in Finland from 1987 to 2007 (n = 1,131,905). A total of 189,094 persons were included in the exposed cohort when they lost a parent before 18 years old. Log-linear Poisson regression was used to estimate mortality rate ratio (MRR). Parental death was associated with a 50% increased all-cause mortality (MRR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.43-1.58). The risks were increased for most specific cause groups and the highest MRRs were observed when the cause of child death and the cause of parental death were in the same category. Parental unnatural death was associated with a higher mortality risk (MRR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.71-2.00) than parental natural death (MRR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.24-1.41). The magnitude of the associations varied according to type of death and age at bereavement over different follow-up periods. The main limitation of the study is the lack of data on post-bereavement information on the quality of the parent-child relationship, lifestyles, and common physical environment.
   Conclusions: Parental death in childhood or adolescence is associated with increased all-cause mortality into early adulthood. Since an increased mortality reflects both genetic susceptibility and long-term impacts of parental death on health and social well-being, our findings have implications in clinical responses and public health strategies.

TI 11-year follow-up of mortality in patients with schizophrenia: a
   population-based cohort study (FIN11 study)

   SUICIDE; TRIAL
AB Background The introduction of second-generation antipsychotic drugs during the 1990s is widely believed to have adversely affected mortality of patients with schizophrenia. Our aim was to establish the long-term contribution of antipsychotic drugs to mortality in such patients.
   Methods Nationwide registers in Finland were used to compare the cause-specific mortality in 66 881 patients versus the total population (5.2 million) between 1996, and 2006, and to link these data with the use of antipsychotic drugs. We measured the all-cause mortality of patients with schizophrenia in outpatient care during current and cumulative exposure to any antipsychotic drug versus no use of these drugs, and exposure to the six most frequently used antipsychotic drugs compared with perphenazine use.
   Findings Although the proportional use of second-generation antipsychotic drugs rose from 13% to 64% during follow-up the gap in life expectancy between patients with schizophrenia and the general popullation did not widen between 1996 (25 years), and 2006 (22.5 years). Compared with current use of perphenazine, the highest risk for overall mortality was recorded for quetiapine (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.41, 95% CI 1.09-1.82), and the lowest risk for clozapine (0.74, 0.60-0.91; p=0.0045 for the difference between clozapine vs perphenazine, and p<0.0001 for an other antipsychotic drugs). Long-term cumulative exposure (7-11 years) to any antipsychotic treatment was associated with lower mortality than was no drug use (0.81, 0.77-0.84). In patients with one or more filled prescription for an antipsychotic drug, an inverse relation between mortality and duration of cumulative use was noted (HR for trend per exposure year 0.991; 0.985-0.997).
   Interpretation Long-term treatment with antipsychotic drugs is associated with lower mortality compared with no antipsychotic use. Second-generation drugs are a highly heterogeneous group, and clozapine seems to be associated with a substantially lower mortality than any other antipsychotics. Restrictions on the use of clozapine should be reassessed.

AB Background The aims of the study were: (1) to identify the prevalence of ideation and acts of deliberate self-harm in 18-year-old boys; (2) to report the use of mental health services among these boys; (3) to identify risk factors assessed at age 8 and (4) to identify associated cross-sectional factors at age 18 of self-reported ideation and acts of deliberate self-harm. Methods The participants in this community-based 10-year follow-up study consisted of 2,348 boys born during 1981. At baseline, three informant sources were used: parents, teachers and the children themselves. The questionnaires used were the Rutter Parents Scale, the Rutter Teacher Scale and the Children's Depressive Inventory. At follow-up, boys' psychopathology, adaptive functioning and substance use were studied using the Young Adult Self-Report questionnaire. Further questions about demographic factors and life events were added at both stages. Results The prevalence of ideation of deliberate self-harm was 4.0%, and of acts 2.2%, during the preceding 6 months. Of the subjects who reported ideation, 9.7%, and of those who reported acts, 16.0%, had used mental health services during the previous year. Self-reported depressive symptoms at age 8 predicted ideation and acts of deliberate self-harm 10 years later. Suicidal boys' problems in many life areas were linked with suicidal tendency through psychiatric symptoms, especially anxious/depressed symptoms and aggressive behaviour. Conclusions The connection between selfreported depressive symptoms at age 8 and ideation and acts of deliberate self-harm at age 18 is a good reason to already pay special attention to children's own intimations of distress in elementary school. It is likely that an effective way to prevent suicidality among adolescents is to search for and treat psychiatric problems among young people. Self-reported screening questionnaires used, e. g. in school health-care, may provide an opportunity to recognize these problems.

AB Background: There is a growing interest in examining death rates associated with different pregnancy outcomes for time periods beyond one year. Previous population studies, however, have failed to control for complete reproductive histories. In this study we seek to eliminate the potential confounding effect of unknown prior pregnancy history by examining mortality rates associated specifically with first pregnancy outcome alone. We also examine differences in mortality rates associated with early abortion and late abortions (after 12 weeks).
   Material/Method: Medical records for the entire population of women born in Denmark between 1962 and 1991 and were alive in 1980, were linked to death certificates. Mortality rates associated with first pregnancy outcomes (delivery, miscarriage, abortion, and late abortion) were calculated. Odds ratios examining death rates based on reproductive outcomes, adjusted for age at first pregnancy and year of women's births, were also calculated.
   Results: A total of 463,473 women had their first pregnancy between 1980 and 2004, of whom 2,238 died. In nearly all time periods examined, mortality rates associated with miscarriage or abortion of a first pregnancy were higher than those associated with birth. Compared to women who delivered, the age and birth year adjusted cumulative risk of death for women who had a first trimester abortion was significantly higher in all periods examined, from 180 days (OR=1.84; 1.11 <95% CI <3.71) through 10 years (1.39; 1.22 <95% CI <1.61), as was the risk for women who had abortions after 12 weeks from one year (OR=4.31; 2.18 <95% CI <8.54) through 10 years (OR=2.41; 1.56 <95% CI <2.41). For women who miscarried, the risk was significantly higher for cumulative deaths through 4 years (OR=1.75; 1.34 <95% CI <2.27) and at 10 years (OR=1.48; 1.18 <95% CI <1.85).
   Conclusions: Compared to women who delivered, women who had an early or late abortion had significantly higher mortality rates within 1 through 10 years. A lesser effect may also be present relative to miscarriage. Recommendations for additional research are offered.

AB Background: Pharmacoepidemiological studies assessing the associations between psychotropic drug use and adverse events in the elderly frequently employ automated pharmacy databases as the source of exposure data. However, information on the validity of these databases for estimating psychotropic drug exposures in elderly people is scarce.
   Objective: This study evaluated the validity of the Finnish Prescription Register for estimating current exposures to psychotropic drugs in elderly people. Furthermore, the potential change in the validity over time was determined.
   Methods: This was a population-based intervention study (GeMS; Geriatric Multidisciplinary Strategy for the Good Care of the Elderly) conducted between 2004 and 2007. Initially, 1000 randomly selected persons aged >= 75 years living in the City of Kuopio, Finland, in November 2003 were invited to participate in the study. Of these, 716 agreed to participate at baseline (2004) and 570 were still available for 3-year follow-up (2007). The validity of the Prescription Register was assessed by comparing it with the self-reported information collected by interviews in 2004 and in 2007 in the GeMS study. Using the self-reported data as a reference standard, sensitivity, specificity and Cohen's x statistic (measure of inter-rater agreement for qualitative [categorical] items) with 95% confidence intervals were computed for different categories and subcategories of psychotropic drugs, applying fixed-time windows of 4, 6 and 12 months.
   Results: In 2007, the sensitivity varied between psychotropic categories and subcategories, being generally highest with the 12-month time window (0.57-0.96). The specificity was highest with the 4-month time window (0.94-0.99), showing a slight tendency to decrease with an extended time window. The sensitivity and specificity were highest for antidepressants and antipsychotics, followed by benzodiazepines. The agreement was almost perfect (kappa = 0.81-1.00) or substantial (kappa = 0.61-0.80) for all categories and subcategories of psychotropic drugs. Few differences in validity were observed between the two years.
   Conclusion: Using self-reported data as a reference standard, the Prescription Register provides valid information on current exposures to antidepressants and antipsychotics in elderly people if the time window is selected with adequate consideration. However, the validity is lower for benzodiazepines, suggesting that other sources of information should be considered when performing pharmacoepidemiological studies.

ID SUDDEN-DEATH; FOLLOW-UP; SCHIZOPHRENIA; INPATIENTS
AB Background According to several studies, mortality in psychiatric patients is higher than in the general population, but cause-specific mortality analyses in long-stay psychiatric patients have not been studied very much. Individual follow-ups have been called for in order to identify possible treatment deficiencies and to make recommendations for clinical practices. In this study, mortality of long-stay psychiatric patients has been monitored for the years 1992-2000 and contrasted with that prevalent in the general population. Method Data on psychiatric patients (N = 253) who were treated without a break for at least 6 months during 1992 in the Department of Psychiatry at Oulu University Hospital were linked with the National Death Register. Standardised mortality rates (SMRs) were determined according to gender, age groups, and different causes of death. Results Of the total study population, 80.2 % had schizophrenia,5.1 % other functional psychoses, 9.5 % organic mental disorders, 2.4 % personality disorders and 2.8 % mood disorders. Sixty-nine (27.3 %) of the patients (aged 31-88 years) had died before the end of the year 2000. The all-cause death risk for both males and females was four times that of the general population. The mortality risk was over ten-fold for males and almost 30-fold for females in the youngest age group (25-34 years), with suicides explaining about 75 % of these deaths. SMRs were found to decrease at older age, mortality thus approaching that of the general population. Diseases of the circulatory system were the most common single cause of death in both genders and mortality due to that cause exceeding mortality in the general population nearly 3.6-fold. However, the probability of death was highest (SMR 17.5) in connection with diseases of the digestive system. Increased risks of death due to respiratory complications (SMR 9.3), accidents (SMR 5.1) and neoplasms (SMR 2.1) were also noted. The overall death rates did not differ in relation to social class or professional education. Conclusions Long-stay psychiatric patients were found to die from the same natural causes as the rest of the general population. However, the mortality risk of the long-stay psychiatric patients compared with that of the general population was notably higher, despite ongoing improvements in medical care and facilities. Inadequately organised somatic care and the prevailing culture of "non-somatic" treatment in psychiatry were suggested to, at least in part, explain this phenomenon. Attention ought to increasingly focus on somatic examinations and various health educational programmes specially designed for psychiatric patients and involving matters like healthy diet, smoking cessation and physical exercise. These practices should be a regular part of any patient's treatment programme. Also, the need to recognise factors associated with a patient's psychiatric disorder that could limit that patient's ability to communicate somatic symptoms and/or even lead to a refusal by that patient to have somatic diseases treated was seen as essential for providers of psychiatric services.

AB Background: The mortality rate of young offenders is high. Furthermore, mortality in young offenders is associated with psychiatric and substance use disorders. The primary aim of this national register-based follow-up study was to investigate the mortality rate of Finnish delinquents who underwent a forensic psychiatric examination between 1980 and 2010. As delinquency is not a solid entity, we further aimed to compare the risk of premature death among different subgroups of the delinquents; violent versus non-violent offenders, offenders with alcohol use disorders versus those with no such diagnoses, offenders with schizophrenia spectrum disorders versus conduct-and personality-disordered offenders, under-aged versus young adult offenders, and, finally, boys versus girls.
   Methods: We collected the forensic psychiatric examination reports of all 15- to 19-year-old offenders who were born in Finland and had undergone the examination between 1.1.1980 and 31.12.2010 (n = 606) from the archives of the National Institute of Health and Welfare and retrospectively reviewed them. For each delinquent, four age-, gender- and place of birth-matched controls were randomly selected from the Central Population Register (n = 2424). The delinquents and their controls were followed until the end of 2015. The median follow-up time was 23.9 years (interquartile range 15.3-29.5). We obtained the mortality data from the causes of death register. Deaths attributable to a disease or an occupational disease were considered natural, and those attributable to an accident, suicide or homicide were considered unnatural.
   Results: By the end of the follow-up period, 22.1% (n = 134) of the delinquents and 3.4% (n = 82) of their controls had died (OR 8.11, 95% CI 6.05-10.86, p < 0.001). Among boys, 22.0% (n = 121) of the delinquents and 3.7% (n = 81) of the controls had died (OR 7.38, 95% CI 5.46-9.95, p < 0.001). Male delinquents' risk of unnatural death was almost 11-fold, of natural death more than twofold, and of unclear death more than fourfold compared to that of their controls. No girls had natural or unclear deaths, but 23.6% (n = 13) of the delinquents and 0.5% (n = 1) of the controls had died due to unnatural causes (OR 67.79, 95% CI 8.63-532.00, p < 0.001). The violent delinquents' risk of premature death was twice that of the non-violent delinquents. The other comparisons demonstrated no statistically significant differences between subgroups.
   Conclusions: Even though the Finnish correction system prefers psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation over criminal sanctions, and the national health care system offers developmental-phase-specific psychiatric care, the mortality rate of delinquents, especially of those with a history of violent offences, is high. The excess mortality of offenders can be regarded as a specific public-health inequity that calls for more effective intervention procedures than those used thus far.
