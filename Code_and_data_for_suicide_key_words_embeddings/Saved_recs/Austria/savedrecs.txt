AB Objectives and methods: The epidemiology of suicide in Austria, 1990-2000, was investigated.
   Results: In comparison with 1980-1990, an overall decrease in the incidence of suicide was found. The annual averages for male, female, and total suicide rates were 32.2, 11.0, and 21.3, respectively, representing decreases of 17.6%, 25.7%, and 19.3%. Decreases were observed in all age groups except for males aged 80-84 years, where the suicide rate was 123.5 (15.1% increase), and for males aged 85 years or over, where the rate was 148.9 (25.4% increase). Hanging is still the most frequently used suicide method in Austria, despite steady decreases during recent decades. During the 1990s, hanging was used in 47.5% of male suicides and 34.8% of female cases. Shooting is the next most common method for male suicides (23.5% of cases) and has become more frequent for both sexes.
   Conclusions: The main findings reveal that the decrease in suicide incidence in Austria is greater for females than for males, reflecting the increased suicide risk within the oldest male age groups. This population subgroup should thus be a particular target for suicide-prevention efforts in Austria. A further aim within a national strategy for suicide prevention should be to stop the increased use of shooting as a suicide method.

AB Previous epidemiological analyses indicated a decreasing trend of suicide rates for 10-19-year-olds in Austria for the period 1970-2001. However, data from the new millennium are missing. This epidemiological update reports on youth suicide in Austria, covering the period 2001-2014 in order to inform suicide preventive interventions targeting adolescents.
   The data on registered suicides among Austrian minors (10-19 years) and the population size were obtained from Statistics Austria. Chi-squared tests were used to analyze the associations between the suicide methods used and sex, as well as between suicide methods and Austrian federal states. Spearman correlations were calculated to assess time trends in the suicide rates. One-way ANOVA was used to investigate annual suicide rates of age groups 10-14, 15-19, and 10-19 years across the nine Austrian federal states.
   The total average suicide rate for Austrian minors was 4.57 per 100,000. The male-female ratio was 3.5:1. The total youth suicide rate and male suicide rate significantly declined from 2001 to 2014, whereas there were no significant changes in female rates. More than one third of suicides among Austrian youth occurred through hanging, whereas jumping in front of a moving object was the second-most common suicide method. A spring peak was found, with most suicides occurring in April and May.
   Suicide rates among minors in Austria continue to decrease. The present findings help to inform the ongoing implementation of the National Austrian Suicide Prevention Plan (SUPRA).

AB Introduction Research on suicide in childhood and early adolescence is sparse. We investigated suicide cases of children and young adolescents in terms of prevalence, gender differences, suicide methods and monthly distribution during a period of 32 years. Methods Registered suicides aged 14 or younger occurring between 1970 and 2001 (n = 275) in Austria were studied. Results The mean suicide rate for 10 to 14-year-olds was 1.4 per 100,000 with a male-female ratio of 3.1:1. The total child and young adolescent suicide rate and boys' suicide rates decreased over the study period. However, there was no significant fluctuation in girls' suicide rates. Hanging was the predominant suicide method in both genders. Use of this method decreased steadily over the study period, whereas the percentage of suicides by other methods, i.e., jumping and firearms suicides increased. Greater number of suicides in children and young adolescents was observed during the months of April/May and October/November. Conclusion Suicide rates of children and young adolescents in Austria are on the decrease, in accordance with a reported decrease in the general suicide rate in Austria.

AB Objectives: Shooting as method of suicide has increased considerably in Austria over recent decades and represented 23.5% of all suicides among men during the period 1990-2000. It is thought that the availability of guns could lead to their use in acts of suicide, and therefore we investigated the numbers of gun licenses (which constitutes ownership of guns and permission to carry a gun) in the nine Austrian counties and their correlation with suicides by shooting and other methods.
   Methods: We studied registered suicides, including the method used, between 1990 and 2000 in Austria and the numbers of gun licenses held in the nine counties of Austria in the same period.
   Results: We found a strong correlation between the average gun license rate for the period 1990-2000 and suicides by shooting (r = 0.967), and only very weak correlation, and for some of the years under investigation a negative correlation, with other methods of committing suicide (r = 0.117) and the suicide rate in general (r = 0.383).
   Conclusions: As shooting as a method of suicide has increased in Austria in recent decades, and is a highly lethal method, the finding that the shooting suicide rate is related to the extent of gun ownership deserves attention, especially as there is evidence that restriction of gun ownership is an important factor in suicide prevention.

AB Suicide prevention in custody is hampered by the lack of funds and professional staff. In order to evaluate the prison suicide phenomenon, a study was conducted evaluating all suicides that occurred in Austrian prisons between 1975 and 1997 (n = 220). Ln addition to evaluating the number of male versus female suicides, the preferred suicide methods were studied, as n ell as suicide risk of different circumstances of custody. Suicide rates of distinguishable, important subgroups of prisoners were calculated. The suicide rate fur prisoners on remand was 236.0 per 100,000, and for offenders classified as mentally ill it was 205.4 per 100,000. That is about 8 times higher than the suicide rate in Austria's general population (1975-1997: 24.6 per 100,000). The suicide rate for sentenced offenders was 81.3 per 100,000, about twice the suicide rate in Austria's general male population. We recommend that psychologists or psychiatrists concentrate on the suicide prevention of high-risk offenders after screening the newly admitted offenders for their propensity to suicide.

AB Objectives: There is convergent evidence from adoption, family, geographical, immigrant, molecular genetic, twin and, most recently, surname studies of suicide for genetic contributions to suicide risk. Surnames carry information about genetic relatedness or distance and, in patrilineal surname systems, are a close substitute for Y-chromosome markers and haplotypes, since surname transmission is similar to the transmission of the nonrecombining part of the Y chromosome. This study investigated whether differences in regional suicide rates correspond to the genetic structure of the Austrian population.
   Methods: Differences in district-level standardized suicide rates 1988-94 between the five major surname regions identified for Austria were analyzed. The surname regions used in the analysis reflect the contemporary population structure and closely follow the natural borders found in the topography of Austria, less so its administrative division into nine states.
   Results: Surname region accounted for a significant (P < 0.001) and substantial (38%) portion of the variance in district-level suicide rates. Adjusting the suicide rates for a set of five social and economic indicators that are established ecological correlates of suicide prevalence (income, and rates of the divorced, unemployed, elderly and Roman Catholics) left the results essentially unchanged.
   Conclusions: Regional differences in suicide rates within Austria correspond to the genetic structure of the population. The present evidence adds to related findings from geographical and surname studies of suicide that suggest a role for genetic risk factors for suicidal behavior. Genetic differences between subpopulations may partially account for the geography of suicide. Study limitations and directions for future research are discussed.

AB Multifaceted evidence (family. twin, adoption, molecular genetic, geographic, and surname studies of suicide) suggests genetic risk factors for suicide. The migrant study design is also informative in this context, but underused. In particular, immigrant studies of suicide with a continental European host country are unavailable. The correspondence of suicide prevalence among 22 immigrant groups in Austria (1970-2006) with those of the homelands during the same period was analyzed. Immigrant and homeland suicide rates were significantly positively associated. Controls for age of suicide victim, immigrant group size, national pride, and quality of life in the homelands left the finding essentially unchanged. This correspondence of immigrant and country-of-birth suicide rates is consistent with the assumption of population differences in the prevalence of genetic risk factors for suicide, for which there is emerging evidence.

AB Suicide rates of male and female physicians are about 3-5 times higher compared with the general public. Detailed studies about medical student suicides in the United States exist but similar current data from German speaking countries are lacking.
   In this study suicide among medical students in Germany, Austria and Switzerland was analyzed using Medline and Google search engines and information from insurance companies, public institutions, statistical agencies and leading scientists in Germany, Austria and Switzerland was requested. The incidence of suicide among medical students at the Medical University of Innsbruck was also examined.
   In publications from German speaking countries some medical student suicides are mentioned but current statistics were not available. Between 2006 and 2011 the Tyrolean State Police in Austria registered 14 suicides by students of all disciplines. At Innsbruck Medical University (approximately 2,800 medical students) it was found that 6 medical students committed suicide between June 2007 and June 2012 (rate 36 per 100,000).
   The suicide risk of medical students at the Medical University of Innsbruck appears to be increased. Because of a lack of comparable data it is not possible to show whether these observations can be extrapolated to other universities. It appears that there was no single special event which triggered suicide by the medical students but a combination of individual risk factors and the environment was involved. However, this problem receives insufficient attention.

AB Background Suicides of the elderly (persons aged 65 and older) make up a large proportion of total suicides. Since suicide rates of the elderly are highest in western populations, addressing them as a risk group in prevention plans has been recommended. In order to assess possible approaches to prevention strategies, this study examines high-risk groups of the elderly.
   Methods We examined official statistics on suicides that occurred in Austria between 1970-2004 (18,101 Suicides of the elderly). We analyzed time trends and differences in suicide methods as well as in age groups and both genders of the elderly.
   Results Three major high-risk groups were identified: elderly male suicides by firearms; elderly female suicides by poisoning, which occur more often with increasing age; and suicides of both genders by jumping from heights.
   Conclusion Besides conducting treatment of psychiatric disorders of the elderly, restricting the means to commit suicide may help to prevent it among the elderly. Such specific prevention strategies should be implemented in national suicide prevention plans for the high-risk groups identified in this study. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Knowledge about suicide might be positively correlated with local suicide prevalence. This hypothesis was tested with a sample of 107 medical and social science undergraduates from Estonia, a country with a high suicide rate, using Hubbard and McIntosh's 1992 Revised Facts on Suicide Quiz. Compared (independent-groups t tests),with a sample of undergraduates from Austria, which has a markedly lower suicide rate, Estonians presented significantly higher overall knowledge about suicide (d=0.39), particularly concerning demographic and epidemiological facts about suicide (d=0.77) but not pertaining to clinical and interpersonal knowledge contents (d= -0.06). Study limitations and suggestions for extension of this preliminary inquiry are discussed.

ID MORTALITY; PATTERNS; IMPACT; RATES; HOMICIDE
AB Background This article investigates suicide rates from 2000 to 2010 in Austria, a country with now average rates that had started to decline in the mid-80s.
   Results Rates declined in the observed period, to an average of 26.1 per 100,000 persons for men, 8.2 for women, and 16.9 in the general population. The decrease was found in all age-groups, but more marked in women, with a reduction by 26.3 % compared with the previous decade than in men (20.0 % reduction). Hanging still is the most common method, 49.1 % for men and 35.0 % for women, although also on the decline. Furthermore, person years of lost life were calculated, also reflecting a decrease from 40,702 years in 2000 to 29,883 in 2010. Altogether, 372,551 years of life were lost by suicide in Austria in the period 2000-2010, 277,998 years among men and 94,553 years among women.
   Conclusions Concerning the still observed increase in old age-groups and the huge amount of lost life years, it is argued that implementation of the National Suicide Prevention Programme for Austria is strongly needed.

DE Maternal death; Suicide; Pregnancy and postpartum period
AB Suicide is one of the leading causes of maternal death during pregnancy and the first postpartum year. This retrospective investigation aimed at characterizing suicides in Austria during pregnancy and the first postpartum year between 2004 and 2017. We identified 10 suicides of pregnant/ postpartal women in that period, all of whom used violent methods, resulting in a maternal suicide rate of 0.89 per 100,000 birth events. The comparably low number of found suicides is arguably attributable to methodological issues in identifying perinatal suicides. Hence, a more comprehensive inquiry into perinatal deaths and further improvements in perinatal mental health care are called for.

AB Objective: Although incarceration is a high-risk situation for suicide all over the world, hardly any results have been published concerning the situation of custodial suicide in German-speaking countries. Methods: We investigated the case notes of all suicides occuring in Austrian prisons between 1975 and 1996 (n=207). Beside an evaluation of gender and preferred methods of suicide the suicide risk of different circumstances of custody was studied. Suicide rates of distinguishable, important subgroups of prisoners were calculated using the official statistical data of the Ministry of justice. Results: The suicide rate for people on remand and offenders classified as mentally ill was 231/100 000 vs. 191/100 000, that was about eight times higher than the suicide rate in Austria's general population. The suicide rate for sentenced offenders was 80/100 000, about three times as high as the suicide rate in Austria's general population (1980 - 1990: 26.4/100 000). The suicide risk increased with the length of the announced sentence. Conclusions: The suicide rate in custody was highest for prisoners on remand and mentally ill offenders. Female offenders had a high suicide risk, too. The common assumption that the suicide risk in jails and prisons is highest shortly after admission should be confirmed based on better methodology or be reconsidered.

LA English
DT Article
ID INTERNET; INFORMATION; PREVENTION; WEB
AB Objective: The Internet provides a variety of resources for individuals searching for suicide-related information. Structured content-analytic approaches to assess intercultural differences in web contents retrieved with method-related and help-related searches are scarce.
   Method: We used the 2 most popular search engines (Google and Yahoo/Bing) to retrieve US-American and Austrian search results for the term suicide, method-related search terms (eg, suicide methods, how to kill yourself, painless suicide, how to hang yourself), and help-related terms (eg, suicidal thoughts, suicide help) on February 11, 2013. In total, 396 websites retrieved with US search engines and 335 websites from Austrian searches were analyzed with content analysis on the basis of current media guidelines for suicide reporting. We assessed the quality of websites and compared findings across search terms and between the United States and Austria.
   Results: In both countries, protective outweighed harmful website characteristics by approximately 2:1. Websites retrieved with method-related search terms (eg, how to hang yourself) contained more harmful (United States: P < .001, Austria: P < .05) and fewer protective characteristics (United States: P < .001, Austria: P < .001) compared to the term suicide. Help-related search terms (eg, suicidal thoughts) yielded more websites with protective characteristics (United States: P = .07, Austria: P < .01). Websites retrieved with US search engines generally had more protective characteristics (P < .001) than searches with Austrian search engines. Resources with harmful characteristics were better ranked than those with protective characteristics (United States: P < .01, Austria: P < .05).
   Conclusions: The quality of suicide-related websites obtained depends on the search terms used. Preventive efforts to improve the ranking of preventive web content, particularly regarding method-related search terms, seem necessary. (C) Copyright 2014 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

ID MAJOR PUBLIC HOLIDAYS; SEASONALITY; BEHAVIOR
AB Background: Contrary to the myth that suicides increase around Christmas, multiple studies reveal that suicide rates decrease towards Christmas and return back to normal or even peak in the beginning of the new year. We aimed to replicate this effect for Austria. Methods: The analyses were based on the official suicide statistics 2000-13 using Poission regression and Bayesian changepoint analysis. We also investigated changes of suicide rates during other major holidays and weekends. Seasonal effects were controlled for by using restricted control periods. Results: Suicide rates declined before Christmas and were minimal on December 24th, remained low until the end of the year, peaked on New Year's day, but remained at average level in New Year's week. In contrast, suicide rates increased in the week after Easter and on Mondays/Tuesdays after weekends. No significant effects were found in the week after Whitsun and summer holidays. Conclusion: Compared with other holidays, Christmas time is clearly associated with fewer suicides in Austria, too, and may even counteract the 'broken promise' effect. This finding may help clarifying common myths in suicide prevention and may enhance the proper timing of preventive efforts.

TI The gap between suicide characteristics in the print media and in the

AB Background: Programmes to educate media professionals about suicide are increasingly established, but information about which suicide cases are most likely to be reported in the mass media is sparse. Methods: We applied binomial tests to compare frequencies of social characteristics of all domestic suicides in the 13 largest Austrian print media in 2005 with frequencies of suicide characteristics in the population. Additionally, each reported suicide case was linked to its respective entry in the suicide database. We performed a logistic regression analysis, with presence of an article as outcome, and sex of the suicide case, age, religious affiliation, family status, conduction of an autopsy and location of the suicide as explaining variables. Time of the year and federal state where the suicide happened was controlled for. Results: Binomial tests showed that suicides involving murder or murder attempt were over-represented in the media. Reporting on mental disorders was under-represented. In the regression analysis, the likelihood of a report was negatively associated with the age of suicide cases. Foreign citizenship was a further predictor of a suicide report. The methods of drowning, jumping, shooting and rare methods were more likely to be reported than hanging, which is the most frequent suicide method in Austria. Conclusions: Suicide characteristics in the media are not representative of the population. The identified discrepancies provide a basis for tailor-made education of mass media professionals.

AB Background: Filicide is the tragic crime of murdering one's own child. Previous research has found that the offending parents are commonly depressed and that suicide is often associated as an actual act or an intention. Yet, filicide is an underreported crime and previous studies have been strained with methodological problems. No comprehensive international studies on filicide have been presented in the literature until now.
   Methods: This was a descriptive, comprehensive, register-based study of all filicides in Austria and Finland during 1995-2005. Filicide-suicide cases were also included.
   Results: Most of the perpetrators were the biological mothers; in Austria 72%, in Finland 52%. Suicide followed filicide either as an attempt or a fulfilled act in 32% and 54% of the cases in Austria and Finland, respectively. Psychotic mood disorders were diagnosed for 10% of the living perpetrators in Austria, and 12% in Finland. Non-psychotic depression was diagnosed in 9% of surviving perpetrators in Austria, 35% in Finland.
   Conclusion: The data from the two countries demonstrated that filicide is such a multifaceted and rare phenomenon that national data from individual countries seldom offer sufficient scope for its thorough study. Further analyses are needed to produce a complete picture of filicide.

ID URBAN JAIL; INMATES
AB The absolute and relative frequency of suicides in jails and prisons in Austria over the 50 years from 1947 to 1996 is described. Important legislational changes regarding the criminal justice system are discussed with regard to possible consequences for the incidence of prisoners' suicides. Within the five decades a significant increase in the absolute numbers of jail and prison suicides was evident in spite of the considerable decrease in the total inmate population. Therefore, the suicide rate of inmates of correctional facilities increased significantly. Possible reasons for this phenomenon are discussed in relation to changes of the criminal law.

AB Background: Studies have shown that suicidal individuals who use the Internet for suicide-related purposes are more suicidal than nonsuicide-related users, but evidence from European countries is lacking. Aims: We assessed differences between suicidal individuals who go online for suicide-related purposes and other suicidal individuals in Austria. Method: Participants were 53 individuals aged between 18 and 24 years who felt suicidal in the past year and completed an anonymous online survey. Results: Individuals who went online for suicide-related purposes were more suicidal, and more depressed, compared with individuals who did not use the Internet for suicide-related purposes. There were no large differences with regard to social anxiety and perceived barriers for help-seeking between the two groups. Conclusion: This study finds that suicidal online users are more depressed and suicidal than nonusers in a sample from Central Europe. Online interventions to combat depression and suicidality need to be strengthened to reach out to this important target population.

AB This study investigated the prevalence of suicidal behavior and psychological distress in university students across 12 nations. A total of 5,572 university students from 12 countries were surveyed about suicide ideation, suicide attempts, and psychological distress by means of a self-administered questionnaire. Almost 29% of the samples reported having contemplated suicide and 7% reported attempting suicide. Of the total sample, 51.1% scored above the General Health Questionnaire-123 cut-off points, 41.6% above the GHQ-124 cut-off points, and 33.8% scored above the GHQ-125 cut-off points. While odds of suicide ideation were elevated in Austria and the UK, reduced ORs were detected for China, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Turkey. Similarly, while odds of suicide attempt were high in Jordan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, and to some extent in Turkey, reduced ORs were observed for Austria, China, Italy, Japan and the United States. Elevated ORs for psychological distress were seen in Japan, Jordan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Turkey but reduced ORs were noted in Austria, China, Iran, Italy, and the United States. Psychological distress was strongly associated with reports of suicide ideation and attempts. Suicide ideation, suicide attempt, and psychological distress are common in university students but their rates vary depending on the sociocultural context. Due attention should be devoted to the mental health needs of young adults enrolled in higher educational institutions and more cross-cultural research is warranted to better understand the etiology of the observed intersocietal variations in suicidal behavior and psychological distress.

AB Objectives: To investigate whether suicide risk in Tyrol/Austria was increased for cancer patients as compared to the general population and whether subgroups at excess risk could be defined.
   Study Design and Setting: Cohort design based on all malignant cancer cases diagnosed in Tyrol between 1991 and 2010 and excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer. Entry date was date of diagnosis of the index cancer; exit date was either date of suicide or date of death for reasons other than suicide or end of follow-up (Dec 31, 2011). Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were computed in the classical way after adjustment for sex, age and year of follow-up.
   Results: For all cancer sites except nonmelanoma skin cancer, we observed a SMR of 1.86 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.57-2.19]. Suicide risk was greatest during the first 6 months after diagnosis with an SMR of 4.74 (95% CI, 3.27-6.66) and was more than fivefold in cases with advanced Stage IV. We observed the greatest excess risk for suicide in patients with head and neck cancers (13 suicides; SMR, 4.73; 95% CI, 2.52-8.09) and lung cancer (14 suicides; SMR, 4.16; 95% CI, 2.27-6.98).
   Conclusion: In our study population in Tyrol/Austria, we observed a twofold suicide risk in cancer patients as compared with the general population, with the excess risk concentrated in the period shortly after diagnosis and in patients with poor prognosis. Therefore, psychooncological care should be intensified in this group of patients. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: We analyzed the quality of suicide reporting in youth magazines and assessed potential copycat effects following media reports on suicide. Method: We obtained suicide-related articles from five Austrian and German youth magazines published between 1996 and 2008. Reported sex, suicide (attempt) methods, suicide motives, the portrayal of suicide in a positive or negative light, accusations of blame and consistency with media recommendations for the reporting of suicide were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The suicide frequency among adolescents in Austria was compared 2 weeks before and after the publication of reports on suicide and suicide attempts. Results: 59 articles were identified, most of which had been published in the magazine Bravo. There was an overrepresentation of suicide among girls and an underrepresentation of attempted suicide. The frequency of specific suicide and suicide attempt methods was consistent with epidemiological distributions of suicide methods. Fall from height was most frequently described for girls and hanging for boys. Regarding motives for suicide, factors like psychiatric diseases were underrepresented. Girls who died by suicide were often positively described in articles, but boys were more often negatively described. Parents were frequently blamed as being guilty of their child's suicidal behaviour, in particular when reporting on suicide attempts. Photos, suicide notes and details concerning method were frequently described. There was no indication of a Werther effect following reporting. Conclusions: The identified discrepancies between epidemiologic data regarding suicidal behaviour in adolescents and media reporting in youth media constitutes an important basis for suicide prevention in the community.

AB Objectives: The first documented conference on suicide among school pupils was held by the Viennese Psychoanalytical Society in 1910, yet since then research on youth suicide in Vienna and Austria has been sparse. We investigated cases of suicide among Viennese minors over a period of 57 years in terms of prevalence, gender differences, suicide methods and monthly distribution.
   Methods: We studied registered suicides among Viennese youths aged 19 or younger occurring between 1946 and 2002 (n = 683).
   Results: The total suicide rate and the rates for male and female suicides among Viennese minors decreased over the period studied. The mean suicide rate was 6.2 per 100,000 (statistics on suicides per 100,000 were available only for the period 1953-2002), with a male-female ratio of 2.1:1. The predominant suicide method was domestic gas until its detoxification in Vienna. From 1976 jumping from a height became the most common suicide method of Viennese minors; it was also the predominant method among females, whereas hanging was the predominant method among males. Since 1996 the percentage of firearm suicides among males has doubled, and jumping suicides among females have tripled. A greater number of suicides among minors took place during the months of January, June, October and December.
   Conclusions: Suicide rates of Viennese minors are on the decline, corresponding to a reported decrease in the general suicide rate in Austria. In view of an observed recent increase in firearm suicides among males and jumping suicides among females aged 19 and younger, further monitoring as well as legal and environmental prevention measures are needed.

ID NEW-YORK-CITY; PREVENTING SUICIDE; SYSTEMS; USERS
AB Suicidal behavior on the subway often involves young people and has a considerable impact on public life, but little is known about factors associated with suicides and suicide attempts in specific subway stations. Between 1979 and 2009, 185 suicides and 107 suicide attempts occurred on the subway in Vienna, Austria. Station-specific suicide and suicide attempt rates (defined as the frequency of suicidal incidents per time period) were modeled as the outcome variables in bivariate and multivariate Poisson regression models. Structural station characteristics (presence of a surveillance unit, train types used, and construction on street level versus other construction), contextual station characteristics (neighborhood to historical sites, size of the catchment area, and in operation during time period of extensive media reporting on subway suicides), and passenger-based characteristics (number of passengers getting on the trains per day, use as meeting point by drug users, and socioeconomic status of the population in the catchment area) were used as the explanatory variables. In the multivariate analyses, subway suicides increased when stations were served by the faster train type. Subway suicide attempts increased with the daily number of passengers getting on the trains and with the stations' use as meeting points by drug users. The findings indicate that there are some differences between subway suicides and suicide attempts. Completed suicides seem to vary most with train type used. Suicide attempts seem to depend mostly on passenger-based characteristics, specifically on the station's crowdedness and on its use as meeting point by drug users. Suicide-preventive interventions should concentrate on crowded stations and on stations frequented by risk groups.

TI Lithium in drinking water and suicide mortality
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID BIPOLAR DISORDER; HEART-DISEASE; MOOD; RISK; DEPLETION; EXPOSURE
AB Background
   There is some evidence that natural levels of lithium in drinking water may have a protective effect on suicide mortality.
   Aims
   To evaluate the association between local lithium levels in drinking water and suicide mortality at district level in Austria.
   Method
   A nationwide sample of 6460 lithium measurements was examined for association with suicide rates per 100 000 population and suicide standardised mortality ratios across all 99 Austrian districts. Multivariate regression models were adjusted for well-known socioeconomic factors known to influence suicide mortality in Austria (population density, per capita income, proportion of Roman Catholics, as well as the availability of mental health service providers). Sensitivity analyses and weighted least squares regression were used to challenge the robustness of the results.
   Results
   The overall suicide rate (R(2)=0.15, beta=-0.39, t=-4.14, P=0.000073) as well as the suicide mortality ratio (R(2)=0.17, beta=-0.41, t=-4.38, P=0.000030) were inversely associated with lithium levels in drinking water and remained significant after sensitivity analyses and adjustment for socioeconomic factors.
   Conclusions
   In replicating and extending previous results, this study provides strong evidence that geographic regions with higher natural lithium concentrations in drinking water are associated with lower suicide mortality rates.

AB Background: Care-dependency constitutes an important issue with regard to the approval of end-of-life decisions, yet attitudes towards assisted suicide and euthanasia are understudied among care-dependent older adults. We assessed attitudes towards assisted suicide and euthanasia and tested empirical correlates, including socio-demographics, religiosity, physical illness, psychological distress and social isolation.
   Methods: A nationwide cross-sectional survey among older care allowance recipients (50+) in private households in Austria was conducted in 2016. In computer-assisted personal interviews, 493 respondents were asked whether or not they approved of the availability of assisted suicide and euthanasia in case of long-term care dependency and whether or not they would consider using assisted suicide or euthanasia for themselves. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess the impact of potential determinants of attitudes towards assisted suicide and euthanasia.
   Results: About a quarter (24.8-26.0%) of the sampled care-dependent older adults approved of the availability of assisted suicide and euthanasia respectively indicated the will to (hypothetically) make use of assisted suicide or euthanasia. Attitudes towards assisted suicide were most favourable among care-dependent older adults living in urban areas, those who did not trust physicians, those who reported active suicide ideation, and individuals with a strong fear of dying. With regard to euthanasia, living alone, religiosity and fear of dying were the central determinants of acceptance.
   Conclusions: Positive attitudes towards and will to (hypothetically) use assisted suicide and euthanasia were expressed by a substantial minority of care-dependent older adults in Austria and are driven by current psychological suffering and fear of the process of dying in the (near) future. Community-based psychosocial care should be expanded to address psychological distress and fears about end-of-life issues among care-dependent older adults.

AB This study aimed to investigate whether the risk of increased suicide occurrence after reports on suicide is associated with the social characteristics of the reported suicides and whether this varies with similarity between the reported suicides and suicides in the population. We collected reports on all 179 individual suicides named in the 13 largest Austrian nationwide newspapers from 1996 to 2006. Information on social status and sociodemographic characteristics of the reported suicides, on certainty of labelling the death as a suicide, and on the suicide methods applied were extracted from the articles. We conducted logistic regression analyses, with the increase of post-report suicides within 28 days after the reports as dependent variable. In model 1, the increase of suicides that matched the reported individual suicide with regard to age group, sex and suicide method was used as outcome variable. In model 2, the increase of suicides that were different from the reported suicide with regard to these characteristics was the outcome. In model 3, the post-report increase of total suicides was the dependent variable. Celebrity status of the reported suicide, age of the reported suicide between 30 and 64 years, and definitive labelling as a suicide were associated with an increased risk of a post-report increase of similar suicides; criminality (i.e. the individual was reported as suspected or convicted of crime) of the reported suicide was associated with a lower risk of a post-report increase. In dissimilar suicides, none of the variables was associated with a post-report increase of suicides. Celebrity status of the reported suicide was the only predictor of a post-report increase of total suicides. The findings support the hypothesis that social variables of reported suicides impact the risk of post-report copycat behaviour. Evidence of copycat effects seemed to be strongest in suicides that were similar to the respective model with regard to age group, sex, and suicide method. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: A suicide awareness campaign was initiated in the Austrian federal state of Styria to increase help-seeking behavior in the population. Billboards were shown throughout Styria depicting joyful everyday-life situations with a focus on social and family connectedness, and promoting the Telephone Emergency Service, a crisis hotline. Aims: The present study investigated the impact of this campaign on the utilization of the crisis hotline and on suicide rates. Method: Phone calls and suicide rates in the study region 3 months before the campaign were compared with rates 3 months after the campaign. The changes were contrasted with the characteristics of phone calls and the suicide rate in a comparable control region. Results: There were significantly more phone calls in the study region after the awareness campaign compared to the control region, which was similar to seasonal trends in nonintervention years, and there was no increase of suicide-related phone calls. The proportion of suicide-related phone calls referring to family problems decreased after the initiation of the campaign. Suicide rates did not change. Conclusion: The campaign may have had some minor immediate impact on the utilization of the Telephone Emergency Service, but it did not seem to motivate suicidal individuals, especially those with family problems, to call.

AB Methods of suicide have received considerable attention in suicide research. The common approach to differentiate methods of suicide is the classification into "violent" versus "non-violent" method. Interestingly, since the proposition of this dichotomous differentiation, no further efforts have been made to question the validity of such a classification of suicides. This study aimed to challenge the traditional separation into "violent" and "non-violent" suicides by generating a cluster analysis with a data-driven, machine learning approach. In a retrospective analysis, data on all officially confirmed suicides (N = 77,894) in Austria between 1970 and 2016 were assessed. Based on a defined distance metric between distributions of suicides over age group and month of the year, a standard hierarchical clustering method was performed with the five most frequent suicide methods. In cluster analysis, poisoning emerged as distinct from all other methods - both in the entire sample as well as in the male subsample. Violent suicides could be further divided into sub-clusters: hanging, shooting, and drowning on the one hand and jumping on the other hand. In the female sample, two different clusters were revealed - hanging and drowning on the one hand and jumping, poisoning, and shooting on the other. Our data-driven results in this large epidemiological study confirmed the traditional dichotomization of suicide methods into "violent" and "non-violent" methods, but on closer inspection "violent methods" can be further divided into sub-clusters and a different cluster pattern could be identified for women, requiring further research to support these refined suicide phenotypes.

AB Background The availability of firearms in homes and at aggregate levels is a risk factor for suicide and homicide. One method of reducing access to suicidal means is the restriction of firearm availability through more stringent legislation.
   Aims To evaluate the impact of firearm legislation reform on firearm suicides and homicides as well as on the availability of firearms in Austria.
   Method Official statistics on suicides, firearm homicides and firearm licences issued from 1985 to 2005 were examined. To assess the effect of the new firearm law, enacted in 1997, linear regression and Poisson regressions were performed using data from before and after the law reform.
   Results The rate of firearm suicides among some age groups, percentage of firearm suicides, as well as the rate of firearm homicides and the rate of firearm licences, significantly decreased after a more stringent firearm law had been implemented.
   Conclusions Our findings provide evidence that the introduction of restrictive firearm legislation effectively reduced the rates of firearm suicide and homicide. The decline in firearm-related deaths seems to have been mediated by the legal restriction of firearm availability. Restrictive firearm legislation should be an integral part of national suicide prevention programmes in countries with high firearm suicide rates.

DE evaluation; guidelines; mass media; prevention; suicide
ID UNEMPLOYMENT; ASSOCIATION; PREVENTION
AB Objective: Media guidelines for reporting on suicides are a widely used means of preventing imitative suicides, but scientific accounts of their impact on suicide numbers are sparse. This report provides an evaluation of the Austrian guidelines that were introduced in 1987 as a natural experiment.
   Methods: The impact of the guidelines was tested by applying an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and a linear regression model. In addition to a nationwide evaluation, Austria was divided into three areas according to regional differences in coverage rates of the collaborating newspapers and the impact of the intervention was tested for each area separately. Main outcome measures were the overall annual suicide numbers, and the numbers of Viennese subway suicides that were exceptionally newsworthy for the mass media. In order to test intermediate impacts, also quantitative and qualitative changes in media reporting after the introduction of the guidelines were analysed.
   Results: There was some evidence of a nationwide impact of the guidelines, calculated as a significant reduction of 81 suicides (95% confidence interval: -149 to -13; t = -2.32, df = 54, p < 0.024) annually. This effect was particularly due to a significant reduction in the area with the highest coverage rates of the collaborating newspapers. Viennese subway suicides showed a highly significant level shift (t = -4.44, df = 19, p < 0.001) and a highly significant trend change (t = -4.20, df = 19, p < 0.001) after the introduction of the guidelines. These effects corresponded to significant changes in the quality and quantity of media reporting.
   Conclusions: The present results clearly support the hypothesis that the media guidelines have had an impact on the quality of reporting as well as on suicidal behaviour in Austria, and stress the importance of collaborating with nationwide, but also with regional media to achieve efficacy. Further research is needed to provide an international insight into this public health issue.

AB Objective: Evidence shows that access to mental health services may have an impact on mental health outcomes such as suicide rates. This small-area analysis examined whether the availability of professionals providing mental health treatment in Austria had an effect on regional suicide rates. Methods: A hierarchical Bayesian model accounting for spatially correlated random effects using an intrinsic conditional autoregressive prior that incorporated the neighborhood structure of districts and that assumed a Poisson distribution for the observed number of suicides was used to estimate the effects of access to mental health care (population density of general practitioners, psychiatrists, and psychotherapists) in Austria. Results: Regional socioeconomic factors were correlated with the density of psychiatrists and psychotherapists. Only the number of psychotherapists per 10,000 population had a significant effect on suicide rates (relative risk [RR]=.97, 95% confidence interval [CI]=.94-.997, and absolute risk reduction [ARR]=-.62, CI=-1.20 to -.11); however, after adjustment for socioeconomic factors (in particular urbanicity as indicated by population density, average income, and proportion of non-Catholics), the observed effects were no longer significant. In the final model, only the socioeconomic component remained significant (RR=.94, CI=.88-.99), and ARR=-1.17, CI=-2.34 to -.05). Conclusions: The availability of specialized mental health service providers was associated with regional socioeconomic factors, and these factors appeared to be stronger predictors of suicide rates than the availability of providers. Therefore, suicide prevention efforts need to acknowledge that availability of services is only one aspect of access to care; a more influential factor is whether availability satisfies local demand.

AB Background: Restriction of access to suicide methods has been shown to effectively reduce suicide mortality rates.
   Aims: To examine how the global economic crisis of 2008 and the firearm legislation reform of 1997 affected suicide and homicide mortality rate within Austria.
   Methods: Official data for the years 1985-2016 for firearm certificates, suicide, homicide, unemployment rates and alcohol consumption were examined using auto regressive error and Poisson regression models.
   Results: Firearm certificates, total suicide mortality rate, suicide and homicides by firearms, and the fraction of firearm suicides/homicides among all suicides/homicides decreased after the firearm legislation reform in 1997. However, significant trend changes can be observed after 2008. The availability of firearm certificates significantly increased and was accompanied by significant changes in trends of firearm suicide and homicide rates. Concurrently, the total suicide mortality rate in 2008, for the first time since 1985, stopped its decreasing trend. While the total homicide rate further decreased, the fraction of firearm homicides among all homicides significantly increased.
   Conclusion: The initially preventative effect of the firearm legislation reform in Austria in 1997 seems to have been counteracted by the global economic downturn of 2008. Increased firearm availability was associated with corresponding increases in both firearm suicide and firearm homicide mortality. Restrictive firearm legislation should be an imperative part of a country's suicide prevention programme. Although firearm legislation reform may have long-lasting effects, societal changes may facilitate compensatory firearm acquisitions and thus counteract preventive efforts, calling in turn again for adapted counter-measures.

AB Background: Suicide-epidemiological research on short-term effects of elections on national/regional suicide and parasuicide incidence has yielded contradictory evidence. Reversing the cause-effect relationship of this line of research we investigated whether preceding regional suicide rates are related to subsequent election results. Methods: For Austria's 121 districts, we regressed averaged standardized suicide rates for the preceding period (1988-1994) on political parties' subsequent electoral gains/losses (1999-to-1995) while controlling for a set of 12 domain-relevant psychosocial/economic indices. Results: Stepwise weighted multiple regression led to a significant model. The 1999-to-1995 electoral gains/losses of two opposition parties, together with the population variation caused by migration balance and by births/deaths balance, accounted for a substantial part (30%) of the variability in preceding district-level suicide rates. Various other social indices failed to contribute further substantial increments to this model. Conclusions: This finding suggests that variations in preceding regional suicide incidence might be mirrored in subsequent changes in voting behavior. A speculative post hoc explanation for the finding is offered: on a community level, suicide's aftermath might produce socially and politically alienated survivors of suicide who co-shape swings towards opposition parties in subsequent general elections. The finding calls for more research on suicide's long-term aftermath. Limitations: Within-country replicability and cross-national generalizability await further investigation. At present, the factor/mechanism accounting for this finding is neither well-established nor has been directly tested. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The press may have contributed to suicide as a mass phenomenon during the nineteenth century. There is limited knowledge on how the press reported on suicide. We utilized a content analysis of suicide news during the time period of suicide rate's strong increase in Austria (1855, 1865, 1875, 1885), assessing variables related to the responsible reporting on suicide (RRS). Analyses indicate that the press showed low levels of RRS and the quantity of low-quality reporting increased during the observation period. Although causal claims should be made with caution, the findings are consistent with the idea of a long-term Werther effect.

ID LINEAR-REGRESSION MODELS; DRINKING-WATER; RISK; RATES
AB Suicide, the tenth leading cause of death worldwide, is a complex phenomenon. Models aiming to explain the interaction of ambient variables such as socioeconomic factors, lithium content of drinking water and altitude are poorly developed. While controlling for several risk factors, this research bridges two different, but complementary research lines by investigating statistically the relationship on suicide mortality between lithium levels in drinking water in response to altitude above sea level. Besides regression models with main effects, a multiplicative interaction model between lithium and altitude has been developed providing estimates at the district-level for Austria where spatial autocorrelation was accounted for through spatial filtering. The correlation results showed a negative association between lithium levels and altitude. The regression confirmed a negative association of lithium levels and suicide mortality. Altitude was found to be positively associated with suicide mortality. On the other hand, lithium effects on suicide mortality were found to be moderated by altitude. In lower altitude regions the effect turned out to be negatively related to suicide mortality, while lithium had a positive association in high-altitude regions. These results provide evidence for the fact that the relationship between lithium, altitude and suicide rates is more complex than hitherto assumed. Further research on the effects of ambient variables such as low levels of lithium on suicide is needed and particularly the lithium-altitude interaction is worth further investigation to understand possible underlying neurochemical processes.

AB Objectives: Belief in lunar effects on abnormal or deviant human behavior ("moon madness") is old, common, perpetuated by the media and notably widespread among health professionals, and may thus have public health consequences. This study investigated lunar effects on one particular outcome (completed suicide) for which the literature appears unsettled, owing to some recent reports with positive findings.
   Methods: The timing of all 65,206 suicides (46,451 men; 18,755 women) officially registered in Austria between 1970 and 2006 was analyzed with respect to the phases of the moon. This was the first such study based on national data conducted outside the USA, with the database comprising the second-longest study period and the second-largest sample ever investigated in this subject area.
   Results: Observed proportions of both male and female suicide occurrence did not deviate from expected proportions during the new, crescent, full, and decrescent moon quarters or from those expected for 3-day windows centered around new and full moon, relative to the interphase. Subgroup analysis (by sex and year), additionally conducted for demonstration purposes, yielded results conspicuously resembling those of related studies with positive findings; namely, sporadically emerging significant findings that were entirely absent in the overall analysis and directionally erratic, thus suggesting they were spurious (false positive).
   Conclusions: This large-sample evidence strongly suggests no lunar effects on the timing of completed suicide. Scattered previous evidence in support of such effects in all likelihood was spurious; that is, was due to statistical type 1 errors or erroneously taking calendrical periodicities of suicide occurrence that are real as evidence for lunar effects.

AB Objective: International surveys found an increase of mentally disordered individuals in correctional institutions. As a consequence, suicides and suicide rates in jails and prisons are increasing. Mental health services and criminal justice authorities have identified this problem, but there is a lack of knowledge concerning risk factors for inmate suicides and practicable prevention.
   Method: A literature research was conducted through,medline" searching for studies addressing the problem of jail and/or prison suicide. Subsequently, results of relevant surveys were compared and depicted in several tables.
   Results: Suicide rates in correctional facilities significantly exceed those in the general male population. Suicide rates in custody have been increasing within the last decades. Pre-trial prisoners have the highest suicide risk within the total prison population. Long-term sentences, singlecell use, mental illness, substance abuse and a history of suicidality are associated with an increased suicide risk.
   Discussion: The impact of suicide prevention strategies and future directions of research in this high-risk setting are highlighted.

AB Recent research suggests that search volumes of the most popular search engine worldwide, Google, provided via Google Trends, could be associated with national suicide rates in the USA, UK, and some Asian countries. However, search volumes have mostly been studied in an ad hoc fashion, without controls for spurious associations. This study evaluated the validity and utility of Google Trends search volumes for behavioral forecasting of suicide rates in the USA, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Suicide-related search terms were systematically collected and respective Google Trends search volumes evaluated for availability. Time spans covered 2004 to 2010 (USA, Switzerland) and 2004 to 2012 (Germany, Austria). Temporal associations of search volumes and suicide rates were investigated with time-series analyses that rigorously controlled for spurious associations. The number and reliability of analyzable search volume data increased with country size. Search volumes showed various temporal associations with suicide rates. However, associations differed both across and within countries and mostly followed no discernable patterns. The total number of significant associations roughly matched the number of expected Type I errors. These results suggest that the validity of Google Trends search volumes for behavioral forecasting of national suicide rates is low. The utility and validity of search volumes for the forecasting of suicide rates depend on two key assumptions ("the population that conducts searches consists mostly of individuals with suicidal ideation", "suicide-related search behavior is strongly linked with suicidal behavior"). We discuss strands of evidence that these two assumptions are likely not met. Implications for future research with Google Trends in the context of suicide research are also discussed.

AB Suicide is one of the most important causes of death in prison around the world. In France, suicide rate for prisoners is 18.5 suicides per 10,000 inmates: seven times more common than in the general population.
   Among the risk factors identified in the literature, those most strongly associated with suicide in prison are physical isolation in custody, psychiatric history and history of suicide attempts.
   The prevention of suicide in prison involves several measures including treatment of psychiatric disorders, improvement of living conditions in custody, social support of prisoners and use of specific tools and programs by prison supervisors.
   No program for prevention of suicidal recurrence has ever been implemented. We propose to adapt "VigilanS", a program already applied in the general population, to the prison population.

Data from 1,093 medical and psychology undergraduates from Austria (382 men and 711 women; M age 25.0 yr., SD=6.6) indicated an almost perfectly reversed pattern of beliefs about suicide seasonality compared with the actual seasonal distribution. The vast majority of respondents believed the peak to be located in late autumn and early winter and the trough occurring in late spring and the summer months. Implications for education and practice are discussed.

AB Objectives: Seasonal spring peaks of suicide are well described in epidemiological studies, but their origin is poorly understood. More recent evidence suggests that this peak may be associated with the increase in the duration of sunshine in spring. We investigated the effect of number of sunshine hours per month on suicide rates in Austria between 1996 and 2006.
   Methods: Suicide data, differentiated by month of suicide, sex, and method of suicide (violent vs nonviolent methods), were provided by Statistics Austria. Data on the average number of sunshine hours per month were calculated from 39 representative meteorological stations (provided by the Austrian Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics). For statistical analysis, analysis of variance tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and Pearson correlation tests were used.
   Results: A total of 16 673 suicides with a median of 126 +/- 19.8 suicides per month occurred in the examined period. A clear seasonal pattern was observed, with suicide frequencies being highest between March and May and lowest between November and January (df = 11, F = 5.2, P < .0001) for men (df = 11, F = 4.9, P < .0001) and women (df = 11, F = 2.4, P = .008). The average number of sunshine hours per month was significantly correlated with the number of suicides among both sexes (r = .43, P < .0001), violent methods (r = .48, P < .0001) but not with nonviolent methods (r = .03, P = .707).
   Conclusions: This study shows that seasonal changes in sunshine account for variations in the number of suicides and especially violent suicides. We propose that sunshine, via interactions with serotonin neurotransmission, may trigger increased impulsivity and promote suicidal acts. However, because of the hypothesis-generating design of this study, more research is needed to further clarify the role of sunshine in triggering neurobiologic changes, which might contribute to suicidal behavior.

AB Objective The aim of this multicenter study was to investigate the differences in personality traits, particularly Neuroticism, in three clinical samples and three student samples in Austria and Italy and their impact on suicide. Methods In total, 1,043 people (410 psychiatric inpatients and 633 university students) were tested in three regions of Europe: central Italy, northeast Italy, and eastern Austria. Psychiatric diagnoses were evaluated using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, and the following instruments were used: Sociodemographic Questionnaire, Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale-B, Symptom-Checklist-90-Standard, and Big Five Inventory. Results The study found that the intensity of Suicidal Ideation was associated with the personality traits of Neuroticism, Anxiety, and Extraversion but also with Depression. Conclusions In conclusion, without the presence of Depression symptoms, neuroticism was a protective factor against Suicidal Ideation, whereas neuroticism when comorbid with Depression symptoms increased suicide risk in psychiatric patients. In all three regions, the clinical samples had higher scores for Neuroticism and for Depression symptoms than the student sample and consequently higher scores for Suicide. Furthermore, we demonstrated an interaction between gender and culture on personality traits, supporting the hypothesis that the distribution of self-reported personality traits is organized geographically.

AB The objective of this study is to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of suicides in commuting railway environments. Data on suicides in Stockholm commuting railway from 2006 to 2013 was analysed. The study sets out to identify significant clusters in suicides then evaluate whether commuting railway environments affect variations in suicide rates. Fieldwork inspection, spatial cluster techniques (NNHC and Getis-Ord statistics) and regression models underlie the methodology of study. Findings show no seasonality was observed in suicide cases, but winter months concentrate a larger share of events. Suicides do not occur evenly throughout the day but tend to take place more often in weekdays. Modelling findings shows that suicide rates increase with speed trains and decrease where barriers along tracks are installed. Although high speed trains are still a motive of concern for suicide prevention, findings call for a whole railway-approach to safety - one that extends maintenance beyond the platforms and stations' vicinities.

AB The marked variation regarding the suicide rate in 34 European countries is well described by regressing the national suicide rate on the capital cities' latitudes and on an interaction term of squared latitude multiplied with longitude. The interaction term explains 40.8% and 29.1% of men's and women's suicide rate, respectively, and latitude explains a further significant increment of 10.9% and 10.6% variance of men's and women's suicide rate, respectively. This regression model quantifies the Finno-Ugrian suicide hypothesis of Kondrichin and of Marusic and Farmer. The European countries highest in suicide rate constitute a contiguous, J-shaped belt, spanning from Finland to Austria. This area maps onto the second principal component identified for European gene distribution, representing ancestral adaptation to cold climates and the Uralic language dispersion. Thus, population differences in genetic risk factors may account for the spatial pattern in European suicide rates.

AB Purpose of review This article reviews recent literature dealing with inmate suicide and suicide prevention programmes.
   Recent findings Inmate suicide is a major public health and correctional challenge. From an initial start just 30 years ago, the current literature shows a broadening international interest. Combinations of institutional factors, inmate vulnerabilities, poor coping skills, and certain conditions of confinement (such as isolation) have been consistently found to increase the risk of suicide among incarcerated offenders. These key elements have been well articulated in suicide prevention practices, which are now more widely available than ever before.
   Summary Mounting experience with comprehensive suicide prevention programmes shows that they can be feasibly implemented even in large and complex jail systems with considerable success. Despite these achievements, correctional facilities have been slow to embrace suicide prevention programmes or to address the mental health needs of their charges. Consequently, progress in this area has been halting, often as an outgrowth of a legal challenge, and at the expense of many preventable deaths.

AB We assess (i) whether being married is a protective factor against socio-economic inequalities in suicide, and (ii) whether any such buffering effect varies between countries. We used the data from a European cross-national comparison project, a prospective follow-up of several European population censuses matched with vital statistics. The data encompass 99.5 million person-years aged 30 and above and, 25,476 suicides in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Turin, Madrid, Norway and Switzerland. Standardised rates were computed and logistic regressions were used to assess educational inequalities. Among the non-married, the lower educational group had an increased risk of dying of suicide compared to the higher group (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.45). Inequalities among the married were lower (OR = 1.29). In all countries or regions except Austria, the lower educational group had a higher risk of suicide mortality among the non-married than among the married. The buffering effect of being married was not observed for elderly individuals (65 and over). Among younger individuals, the buffering effect of being married on relative inequalities in suicide was stronger in Madrid, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland (but significant only for Denmark and Norway). There was no indication that countries with stronger welfare policies or lower divorce rate had a lower buffering effect. We conclude that being married protects against inequalities in suicide and that this protective effect is not affected by the level of social capital at the country level. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: To identify weather factors associated with an increased risk of suicide. In a number of prior studies an influence of meteorological conditions on the incidence of suicide or attempted suicide has been suggested.
   Method: Official data on the suicide cases of the state of Tyrol, Austria, assessed over a period of 6 years (n = 702) were correlated with a number of meteorological factors assessed at eight weather stations.
   Results: The risk of committing suicide was significantly higher on days with high temperatures, low relative humidity or a thunderstorm and on days following a thunderstorm. The multiple logistic regression analysis left 'temperature' and 'thunderstorm on the preceding day' as significant factors, even after adjustment for sociodemographic and geographical variables.
   Conclusion: Within the interaction of psychological and environmental influences in the development of suicidal ideation and behaviour, specific meteorological conditions may additionally contribute to the risk of suicide in predisposed individuals.

AB Previous studies indicate that homosexual or bisexual individuals are at a higher risk of attempting suicide compared to heterosexuals. To overcome biases in these studies, more rigorous definitions of "suicide attempts" and the assessment of multiple dimensions of sexual orientation are needed. In addition, studies from the German speaking region are sparse, especially those not recruiting participants from the gay or lesbian communities. We solicited self-reported suicide attempts among 1,382 Austrian adults recruited through structured snowball sampling from students' social networks. Suicide attempts were more frequently reported by those participants with homosexual or bisexual fantasies, partner preference, behavior, and self-identification, compared to their heterosexually classified counterparts. This was true for any dimension of sexual orientation and for suicide attempts with intent to die or suicide attempts that required medical treatment. Our Austrian study confirmed existing evidence that homosexual and bisexual individuals are at an increased risk for attempting suicide. This should be considered in suicide preventive efforts.

DE Lithium; Suicide rate; Spatial regression models; Austria
ID AQUATIC INVERTEBRATES; PHARMACEUTICALS; MOOD
AB Background: Lithium as a substance occurring naturally in food and drinking water may exert positive effects on mental health. In therapeutic doses, which are more than 100 times higher than natural daily intakes, lithium has been proven to be a mood-stabilizer and suicide preventive. This study examined whether natural lithium content in drinking water is regionally associated with lower suicide rates.
   Methods: Previous statistical approaches were challenged by global and local spatial regression models taking spatial autocorrelation as well as non-stationarity into account. A Geographically Weighted Regression model was applied with significant independent variables as indicated by a spatial autoregressive model.
   Results: The association between lithium levels in drinking water and suicide mortality can be confirmed by the global spatial regression model. In addition, the local spatial regression model showed that the association was mainly driven by the eastern parts of Austria.
   Conclusions: According to old anecdotic reports the results of this study support the hypothesis of positive effects of natural lithium intake on mental health. Both, the new methodological approach and the results relevant for health may open new avenues in the collaboration between Geographic Information Science, medicine, and even criminology, such as exploring the spatial association between violent or impulsive crime and lithium content in drinking water.

ID BEHAVIOR; CUSTODY
AB Background: Besides some cases reported by the media in recent years about pison inmates who committed suicide, hardly anything is known concerning social, criminological and psychiatric characteristics of suicide victims in jails and prisons in Austria. It therefore seems necessary to evaluate jail and prison suicides in order to establish effective means of prevention. Methods: A study was conducted evaluating all suicides in Austrian prisons between 1975 and 1999. In addition to nationality, education and working status, other indicators of social integration and psychiatric history of suicide victims were studied. Results: 220 personal files of 250 suicides were available. During the observation period the suicide rate of imprisoned foreigners decreased slightly (mean 106.6/100,000), whereas the suicide rate of Austrian citizens increased significantly (mean 172.0/100,000). Of all suicide victims, 41% had neither finished school nor had they any professional education. 44% were unemployed before incarceration, 50% did not work while incarcerated. A high frequency of suicidal behavior amongst suicide victims before committing suicide (49% suicide attempts, 37% suicide threats), and a high prevalence of mental disorders (37% psychopharmacological treatment, 48.6% were assessed by a psychiatrist) could be detected. Conclusions: Screening instruments should be applied which are easy to handle for prison officers and indicate the appropriate management of inmates at a high suicide risk.

AB Purpose. - Suicide rates in correctional institutions have been increasing during the last decades. There has been little interest in whether suicidal ideation and intent has been documented by non-medical prison staff (reports of attempted suicide, suicide threats, self-harm), and whether these signs of suicidality had the consequence of adequate intervention efforts.
   Methods. - The personal files of inmates who committed suicide in the 29 Austrian jails and prisons during the last 25 years (1975-1999) were included. We analysed personal characteristics, criminological data, circumstances of custody and information about psychiatric disorders and treatment.
   Results. - Of a total of 250 suicides, 220 personal files were available and included. Suicide attempts were known in 50% of all suicides and 37% had expressed suicidality. In >20%, non-medical staff had documented signs of suicidality, but no further preventive action (e.g. referral to psychiatric care) had taken place.
   Conclusion. - Signs of suicidality play an important role in vulnerability profiles for jail and prison suicides and should have the minimal consequence of further psychiatric care. (C) 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Background: During the last 20 years Austrian psychiatric services underwent fundamental changes, as a focus was set on downsizing psychiatric hospitals. Little is known about how restructuring of mental health services affected patients with major depression and suicide rates.
   Methods: Monthly hospital discharges from all hospitals in Austria with the diagnosis of unipolar major depression as primary reason for inpatient treatment were obtained for the time period between 1989 and 2008. These data were correlated with relevant parameters from the general health system, such as number of hospital beds, suicide rate, density of psychotherapists and sales of antidepressants.
   Results: While the number of psychiatric beds was reduced by almost 30%, the total annual numbers of inpatient treatment episodes for depression increased by 360%. This increase was stronger for men than for women. Further on this development was accompanied by a decrease in the suicide rate and an improvement in the availability of professional outpatient mental health service providers.
   Limitations: Only aggregated patient data and no single case histories were available for this study. The validity of the correct diagnosis of unipolar major depression must be doubted, as most likely not all patients were seen by a clinical expert.
   Conclusions: Our data show that although inpatient treatment for unipolar major depression dramatically increased, reduction of psychiatric beds did not lead to an increase of suicide rates. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives The answer to the question whether suicide rates are higher in urban than in rural areas may have changed over the years. This study analyzes the longitudinal trends of rural and urban suicides in Austria from 1970 to 2005. The most recent decade, 1995-2005 was also investigated cross-sectionally in terms of age groups, gender, suicide methods and family status. Methods Official suicide statistics were calculated in a Poisson regression model to determine trends in suicide rates according to gender in rural and urban regions as well as the ratios of rural- to urban-suicide rates. Population density levels were used as a measure of urbanization. Differences in suicide rates across the rural-urban categories were investigated in terms of genders, age groups, suicide methods and family status using Spearman correlations. Results The ratio of rural to urban suicide rates has continuously increased in both genders over the past 35 years, indicating a growing risk in rural areas. Suicide methods used in rural and urban areas vary significantly and suicide rates among men, but not women, were found to decrease with increasing urbanicity. Conclusion In line with recent findings from other western countries, we showed a growing gap between rural and urban suicide rates. This suggests a need for rural-specific suicide prevention efforts, especially aimed at the male rural population.

AB Objective: Multifaceted evidence (family, twin, adoption, molecular genetic, geographic and surname studies of suicide) suggests genetic risk factors for suicide. Migrant studies are also informative in this context, but underused. In particular, a meta-analysis of the associations of immigrant (IMM) and country-of-birth (COB) suicide rates is unavailable.
   Method: Thirty-three studies, reporting IMM suicide rates for nearly 50 nationalities in seven host countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, England, the Netherlands, Sweden and the USA), were retrieved.
   Results: Total-population IMM and COB suicide rates were strongly positively associated (combined rank-order correlation across 20 eligible studies: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.56-0.73, P < 10(-9)). The effect generalized across both sexes, host countries and study periods.
   Conclusion: Following the logic of the migrant study design of genetic epidemiology, the correspondence of IMM and COB suicide rates is consistent with the assumption of population differences in the prevalence of genetic risk factors for suicide.

AB Background: Suicide rates increased substantially in many countries during the 19th century. Little is known about news coverage on suicide in this period and its relationship to suicide rates. Aims: To test whether there was a covariation between the quantity of reporting and suicide rates and whether the press relied on sensational reporting. Method: A content analysis of Austrian news coverage between 1819 and 1944 was conducted and compared with contemporary findings. Results: There were similar corresponding troughs and peaks in both time series, indicative of covariation.The analysis revealed that variations in the quantity of reporting predicted the following year's suicide rates, a pattern consistent with a long-term Werther effect. Conversely, suicide rates did not predict future values of the quantity of reporting. Furthermore, the press substantially overrepresented "vivid" firearm suicides compared with other more "pallid" methods such as drowning, indicative of sensational reporting. Limitations: The causal order of the quantity of reporting and suicide rates should be interpreted with caution. Conclusion: The press may have contributed to the establishment of suicide as a mass phenomenon in the 19th century.The contemporary comparison is indicative of temporal stability.

AB Objective The assessment and estimation of suicidal risk constitutes a serious and difficult task for any mental health professional. If we add to this the challenges that may be presented by a specific population at higher risk with little possibilities for thorough psychiatric evaluation, the task appears even more complicated.
   Method The "Viennese Instrument for Suicidality in Correctional Institutions" ("VISCI") presented here is based on the results of a case control study including all suicides in all Austrian jails and prisons between 1975 and 1999 and on research on literature examining suicide prevention in general and prison population in particular,
   Results Sensitivity and specifity of VISCI are presented.
   Conclusions As suicide rates in custody are higher than in the general population, and these rates have been increasing within the last 20 years, the screening of offenders newly admitted to prison for their propensity to suicide is necessary to give a better estimation of the suicide risk and hopefully to stop further increase of suicide rates in jails and prisons.

ID JAIL
AB Suicides in correctional institutions occur more frequently than in the general population. Inmate suicide rates have been increasing in many countries during the last decades, possibly reflecting a selection of highly endangered individuals with a high prevalence of mental disorders. This study investigates all suicides in all correctional institutions of Austria during the last 25 years. Methods: All available personal files of inmates who had committed suicide in the 29 Austrian prisons between January 1st, 1975, and December 31st, 1999, were analysed. Beside personal characteristics and circumstances of custody, information concerning psychiatric disorders and the inmate's history of suicidal behavior was included. Results: 220 personal files of 250 suicides were available and included. Half of all suicides had a history of attempted suicide and 37% had expressed suicidality. Referral to psychiatric consultants was known in 48.6% and about 37% received psychopharmacological treatment. Based on these frequent signs of psychiatric illness and vulnerability, possible implications of these results for psychiatric services of the correctional system to improve suicide prevention are discussed. Conclusions: Obvious signs of suicidality play an important role in vulnerability profiles for jail and prison suicides. Any signs of suicidality (st. p. attempted suicide, verbal suicide threat, self-harm) should have the consequence of further psychiatric care.

AB Background: To investigate changes in TBI mortality in Austria during 1980-2012 and to identify causes for these changes.
   Methods: Statistik Austria provided data (from death certificates) on all TBI deaths from January 1980-December 2012. Data included year/month of death, age, sex, residency of the cases and mechanism of accident. Data regarding the size of the age groups was obtained from Statistik Austria. Mortality rates (MR; deaths/10(5) population/year) were calculated for male vs. female patients and for different age groups. Changes in mechanisms of TBI were evaluated.
   Results: The MR decreased from 28.1 to 11.8 deaths/10(5) population/year. Traffic-related TBI deaths decreased from 62% to 9%. This caused a significant decrease in TBI deaths in younger age groups. Fall-related TBI deaths (mostly geriatric cases) remained unchanged. Falls became the leading cause; its rate increased from 22% to 64% of all TBI deaths. Thus, the mean age of fatal TBI cases increased by 20 years and the rate of cases aged <60 years decreased from 71% to 28%. Another important cause was suicide by firearms; its rate increased from 10% to 23% of all TBI deaths.
   Conclusions: These findings warrant better prevention of falls in the elderly and of suicides.

AB Background: Educating the public about suicide is an important component of suicide prevention. So far, little is known about whether common misconceptions of suicide are related to individual tabloid newspaper use. Aims: This study aimed to investigate associations of time spent reading tabloids with endorsement of suicide myths, suicide-related knowledge, and with stigmatizing attitudes toward suicidal individuals. Method: In this cross-sectional online survey, we assessed suicide-related knowledge and stigmatizing attitudes toward suicidal individuals among 456 study participants in Austria together with their endorsement of five common suicide myths (e.g., "suicidal individuals do not communicate their intent"). Furthermore, we assessed participants' time spent reading tabloids. Results: Multivariate analyses controlling for gender, age, education, and the time spent reading broadsheet newspapers and watching television indicated that participants*time spent reading tabloids was associated with higher endorsement of suicide myths as well as with a lower level of suicide-related knowledge and a higher level of stigmatizing attitudes toward suicidal individuals. Limitations: Due to the study's cross-sectional design, causality concerning these associations could not be assessed. Conclusion: The present findings confirm that readers of tabloids are an important target group for suicide education efforts.

AB Previous research has shown for the most part positive correlations between intelligence and suicide prevalence on the national level. However, this study found proxies for regional intelligence in Australia (international average domain scores from the PISA 2000 study) to be significantly negatively correlated with the total, male, and female suicide rates of the different administrative divisions of Australia, and this finding was independent of regional wealth. A research synthesis of the current results and those from similar studies of other countries (positive correlations for Austria, Belarus, The British Isles, Denmark, and The Netherlands; inconclusive findings for France, Germany, and the USA) was conducted. This synthesis of research findings showed that positive ecological correlations of intelligence with suicide rate were more likely observed for nations with higher suicide rates and poorer general living conditions, whereas there was no relation with national IQ.

AB Objective: Time of in-patient treatment and the first weeks after hospital discharge have repeatedly been described as periods of increased suicide risk. This study compared demographic, clinical and suicide related factors between in-patient, post-discharge and not recently hospitalized suicides.
   Methods: Suicide data from the Tyrol Suicide Register were linked with registers of three psychiatric hospitals in the state of Tyrol, Austria. Suicide cases then were categorized as in-patient suicides, post-discharge suicides (suicide within 12 weeks after discharge) or never/not within 12 weeks before death hospitalized suicides. Data were collected between 2004 and 2011.
   Results: Of the total of 711 cases, 30 were in-patient, 89 post-discharge and 592 not recently hospitalized suicides. The three groups differed with regard to male-to-female ratio (lower in both hospitalized groups), marital status, suicide method used (jumping in in-patients, hanging in not recently hospitalized suicides), history of attempted suicide and suicide threats (highest in in-patients) and whether suicides had been in psychiatric or general practitioner treatment shortly before death. In most variables with significant differences there was a gradual increase/decrease with post-discharge suicides taking the middle place between the two other groups.
   Conclusions: The three suicide populations differed in a number of variables. Varying factors appear to influence suicide risk and choice of method differently in in-patient, post-discharge and not hospitalized suicides. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Suicidal behaviour is a significant public health problem. Suicide alone represents the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Suicide is a complex phenomenon and may be the result of an interaction of biological, psychological and socioeconomic factors. Although there are many differences in suicide rates between different countries in the world, some studies reported huge differences of suicide rates between different regions within the same country as well. The studies that investigated the regional differences in suicide rates were gathered in the present article. The studies revealed that depression frequently remained unidentified and thus untreated and could contribute to high regional suicide rates. It could be speculated that access to services, which increases the possibility of diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders, could have an impact on regional suicide rates. Thus the availability of services may be relevant in explaining geographical variations in suicide incidence. Many studies reported that suicide was a major public health issue of particular concern among rural populations, which experienced a consistently higher suicide rate than urban areas considering the availability of psychiatric services, was typically less available in rural regions. As suggested in some studies, it seems that socioeconomic factors outweighed climatic factors in explaining regional differences in the suicide rate but further research is needed.

AB This paper presents three different models of the legal regulation of assisted suicide in European countries. First, the current legal regime governing assisted suicide in the Netherlands is described where both euthanasia and assisted suicide have been legalised. This section also includes some empirical data on euthanasia and assisted-suicide practices in the Netherlands, as well as a comparison with the current legal legislation in Belgium and Luxembourg. Next, Switzerland is presented as a country where euthanasia is punishable by law but assisted suicide is legally allowed, provided it is not carried out with selfish motives. This section also focuses on the assisted-suicide related case law of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights. Last, the current legal situation regarding assisted suicide in Austria and Germany is described. While the Austrian Penal Code explicitly prohibits assisted suicide, assistance with suicide is not specifically regulated by the German Penal Code. However, medical doctors are not allowed to assist suicides according to the professional codes of conduct drawn up by the German medical associations under the supervision of the health authorities.

TI Suicide Seasonality: Complex Demodulation as a Novel Approach in
   Epidemiologic Analysis
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article

AB Background: Seasonality of suicides is well-known and nearly ubiquitous, but recent evidence showed inconsistent patterns of decreasing or increasing seasonality in different countries. Furthermore, strength of seasonality was hypothesized to be associated with suicide prevalence. This study aimed at pointing out methodological difficulties in examining changes in suicide seasonality.
   Methododology/Principal Findings: The present study examines the hypothesis of decreasing seasonality with a superior method that allows continuous modeling of seasonality. Suicides in Austria (1970-2008, N = 67,741) were analyzed with complex demodulation, a local (point-in-time specific) version of harmonic analysis. This avoids the need to arbitrarily split the time series, as is common practice in the field of suicide seasonality research, and facilitates incorporating the association with suicide prevalence. Regression models were used to assess time trends and association of amplitude and absolute suicide numbers. Results showed that strength of seasonality was associated with absolute suicide numbers, and that strength of seasonality was stable during the study period when this association was taken into account.
   Conclusion/Significance: Continuous modeling of suicide seasonality with complex demodulation avoids spurious findings that can result when time series are segmented and analyzed piecewise or when the association with suicide prevalence is disregarded.

AB The available literature on the risk of suicides related to the Holocaust (1939-1945) and its aftermath differs in its time periods, in the countries investigated, and in the robustness of its sources. Reliable information seems to indicate that the risk of suicide for Jews in Nazi Germany and Austria during the pre-war period (1933-1939) was elevated, while information on suicide during the internment in the concentration camps is fraught with problems. The latter derives from the Nazis' decision to hide the statistics on the inmates' causes of death, and from the prevailing life conditions that impeded separation between self-inflicted death and murder. Reliable studies conducted in Israel among refugees who entered pre-state Israel, 1939-1945, and post-World War II survivors reaching Israel (1948 on), show a mixed picture: suicide rates among the former were higher than comparison groups, while the latter group shows evidence of resilience.

AB High suicide rates in jail, lock-up or prison settings have given rise to a debate about whether suicides result chiefly from the type of people confined, or from the types of places they are confined in, the types of confinement. This is summarily framed by the terms of an associated debate in criminology, between importation and deprivation theory. This paper describes the importation versus deprivation theory, concerning the circumstances in Austrian prisons and jails. The article reports on all completed suicides over the period from 1947 to 1999 (n = 410). The increase of suicide rates in Austrian jails and prisons is significant over the last fifty years. While the rate was stable between 1947 and 1975, we have a significantly increasing rate since 1975. In 1975 there was an important legislational reform of the criminal law in Austria. The implications of this reform are discussed in the light of the importation/deprivation theory.

AB According to de Catanzaro's ( 1981) evolutionary theory of human suicide, a threshold intelligence is necessary for suicidality. A corollary deducible from this assertion is that intelligence and suicide mortality should be positively related. The present study tested de Catanzaro's corollary within a country. Using district-level IQ data of the entire non-institutionalized Austrian male year-of-birth cohort of 1969 who survived up to compulsory military conscription, including IQ testing in 1987 (n = 55474), the subsequent ( 1987 - 2001) district-level cohort loss due to suicide mortality was investigated. Across 99 Austrian districts, the regional IQ was weakly but statistically significantly, positively related to the regional standardized suicide rate as well as to the regional percentage of mortality due to suicide in this very cohort, when these relations were controlled for likely confounders ( male divorce and unemployment rates and male net income), but not statistically reliable without these controls. It is argued that the most parsimonious interpretation of these aggregate-level findings remains that intelligence level and suicide mortality are positively related.

AB Background: Suicide rates among police officers may be high because of strong occupational stressors. Aims: This study examined the suicide rate and suicide characteristics among police officers in the Federal Austrian Police Force. Methods: All suicides among policemen during the period 1996-2006 were analyzed retrospectively on the basis of personalized police record files from all Austrian police departments. Information on sex, age, marital status, children, region, method and place of suicide, suicide notes, position, and length of service was extracted from these files. The general Austrian population, adjusted for sex and age composition, served as the comparison group. Results: The suicide rate among male police officers was 30.2/100,000 (SD 11.0), which was comparable to the suicide rate in the adjusted general population (30.5/100,000; SD 2.9). The female police officer suicide rate was 1.8/100,000, while the corresponding suicide rate of the adjusted female general population was 12.5/100,000 (SD 1.7). Firearms were the most frequent suicide method (77.8%), and the incidence of suicide notes was 30.8%. Conclusions: Suicide rates among police officers seem comparable to those of the age-adjusted general population. Given the healthy-worker effect, these results still suggest an increased risk of suicide among police officers. These findings should stimulate further research on stressors and risk factors for suicide among officers and should also encourage departments to increase awareness regarding suicidal signs among officers.

TI Role of media reports in completed and prevented suicide: Werther
   <i>v</i>. Papageno effects
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
AB Background
   Media reporting of suicide has repeatedly been shown to trigger suicidal behaviour. Few studies have investigated the associations between specific media content and suicide rates. Even less is known about the possible preventive effects of suicide-related media content.
   Aims
   To test the hypotheses that certain media content is associated with an increase in suicide, suggesting a so-called werther effect, and that other content is associated with a decrease in suicide, conceptualised as a Papageno effect. Further, to identify classes of media articles with similar reporting profiles and to test for associations between these classes and suicide.
   Method
   Content analysis and latent class analysis (LCA) of 497 suicide-related print media reports published in Austria between 1 January and 30 June 2005. Ecological study to identify associations between media item content and short-term changes in suicide rates.
   Results
   Repetitive reporting of the same suicide and the reporting of suicide myths were positively associated with suicide rates. Coverage of individual suicidal ideation not accompanied by suicidal behaviour was negatively associated with suicide rates. The LCA yielded four classes of media reports, of which the mastery of crisis class (articles on individuals who adopted coping strategies other than suicidal behaviour in adverse circumstances) was negatively associated with suicide, whereas the expert opinion class and the epidemiological facts class were positively associated with suicide.
   Conclusions
   The impact of suicide reporting may not be restricted to harmful effects; rather, coverage of positive coping in adverse circumstances, as covered in media items about suicidal ideation, may have protective effects.

AB Railway suicide is a significant public health problem. In addition to the loss of lives, these suicides occur in public space, causing traumatization among train drivers and passengers, and significant public transport delays. Prevention efforts depend upon accurate knowledge of clustering phenomena across the railway network, and spatial risk factors. Factors such as proximity to psychiatric institutions have been discussed to impact on railway suicides, but analytic evaluations are scarce and limited. We identify 15 hotspots on the Austrian railway system while taking case location uncertainties into account. These hotspots represent 0.9% of the total track length (5916 km/3676 miles) that account for up to 17% of all railway suicides (N = 1130). We model suicide locations on the network using a smoothed inhomogeneous Poisson process and validate it using randomization tests. We find that the density of psychiatric beds is a significant predictor of railway suicide. Further predictors are population density, multitrack structure and-less consistently-spatial socioeconomic factors including total suicide rates. We evaluate the model for the identified hotspots and show that the actual influence of these variables differs across individual hotspots. This analysis provides important information for suicide prevention research and practice. We recommend structural separation of railway tracks from nearby psychiatric institutions to prevent railway suicide.

AB An unequal distribution of suicides over months and seasons has been a consistent finding in epidemiological surveys on suicide. Jails and prisons are a high-risk setting for suicide all over the world. The high prevalence of both outward and self-directed violence in prison populations indicates dysfunctional central serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission and, therefore, could account for an unequal distribution of suicides over months and seasons due to underlying bioclimatic factors. Within a total survey of suicides in the Austrian penitentiary system, the weekly, monthly and seasonal distribution of custodial suicides between 1947 and 1999 was studied. After an explorative comparison of suicide distribution over weekdays, months and seasons of the year by chi(2)-tests, a harmonic Poisson regression model was per-formed to detect seasonality of suicides. No unequal distribution of suicides was evident over the 53-year period. A limitation of this study was its sample size of 412, a low number compared with population-based samples, where a spring suicide peak was consistently found. An explanation for lacking seasonality could be that bioclimatic factors are less relevant in urban, industrialized areas, where jails and prisons usually are located. One of the core characteristics of penal institutions is the limited possibility for communication and social interaction. This social isolation is independent of seasonal changes. If the individual's possibilities for social interactions are limited, the influence of seasonal changes in social activities may be less relevant. This could explain the absence of seasonal changes in custodial suicide incidence. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The field of suicide prevention has been enriched by research on the association between spirituality and suicide. Many authors have suggested focusing on the various dimensions of religiosity in order to better understand the association between religion and suicidal risk, but it is unclear whether the relationship between spirituality and suicidality differs between countries with different cultures, life values, and sociohistorical experiences. To explore this, the aim of this multicenter study was to investigate the possible relationship between suicide and spirituality in Italy and Austria. In the two countries, two different groups of subjects participated: psychiatric patients and university students. The patients were evaluated with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. In addition, the following measures were used: a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale-B, the Symptom-Checklist-90-Standard, and the Multidimensional Inventory for Religious/Spiritual Well-Being. Our results confirmed the multifactorial nature of the relation between suicide risk and the various religious/spiritual dimensions, including religious/spiritual well-being and hope immanent. However, regional differences moderated this relationship in both the clinical and nonclinical samples.

AB Background: For several decades, the question of whether personal suicidality is reflected in individual music preferences has been the subject of debate in suicide research. Despite many studies investigating the relationship between music use and suicidal behavior, it is still unclear whether suicide risk is reflected in individual music preferences. Aims: The present study aimed to assess whether music preferences are reflected in suicide risk factors. Method: We assessed suicidal ideation, depression, and hopelessness among 943 participants in a cross-sectional online survey. Participants provided up to five examples of their favorite music. We conducted a content analysis and coded all reported songs as suicide-related, coping-related, or unrelated to suicide. Results: Multivariate analyses controlling for gender, age, education level, and amount of daily music use indicated associations of preferences for suicide-related songs with suicidal ideation and depression. Limitations: Limitations of the present study include the use of a convenience sample and a cross-sectional design, the small number of participants with preferences for coping-related songs, and the relatively small effect size of the associations found. Conclusion: Music preferences appear to reflect suicide risk factors, with individuals who prefer suicide-related songs scoring higher in terms of suicidal ideation and depression.

DE suicidal behavior in old age; free will and autonomy; suicide prevention
AB Depression often accompanied by suicidal behavior or recurring thoughts about suicide, is one of the most common psychic impairments in old age. Statistics in Austria tell us clearly: Suicidal candidates among the elderly are likely to succeed. Especially in men, suicide has become a significant cause of death. In an age where traditional family structures are beginning to fall apart, and where the elderly increasingly feel to be a "burden" to society, unable to find their place, we tend to look at suicide more and more as a voluntary and autonomous decision, thus rationalizing it as in: "This life I would not want to live either". But is it permissible for physicians to consider a patient, who has acted suicidal, to be "not ill," or to have acted "with good reason"? The present paper shall critically revisit the concept of "rational suicide." What I hope to illuminate is the tension between medical care for, and autonomy of the patient that physicians have to negotiate in their work.

AB A divergence in earlier multiple sclerosis (MS) mortality rates observed within Europe, prompted us to determine the MS mortality rate in Austria and several European countries. Our aim was to examine the temporal and geographical variations within Austria and to determine future MS mortality rates based on a projection model. MS mortality data set, differentiated by age groups, sex, and region at death for the period 1970-2001 were obtained. Prognostic MS mortality trends for the period 2002-2020 were estimated using the simultaneous multiple cause-delay (SIMCAD) method. Our findings indicate a decline (47%) in the MS mortality rate from 1.41 (1970-79) to 0.96 (1980-89) and 0.70 (1990-2001) per 100 000 in Austria during the 32-year period observed. Conversely, the scenarios of our projection for the period 2002-2020, reveal an increasing MS mortality rate. The median age at death because of MS increased with 0.7 years for men and 2.9 years for women during the observed period (1970-2001). Austria, like many other European countries, has experienced a decreasing MS mortality rate over the last three decades. An increased MS mortality rate is however expected over the next decades in Austria. This increase will be most prominent in the elderly population cohorts because of demographic shifts.

TI Lithium in drinking water and suicide mortality: interplay with lithium
   prescriptions
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID RISK; PHARMACEUTICALS; PREVENTION; DISORDERS; RATES
AB Background
   Little is known about the effects of lithium intake through drinking water on suicide. This intake originates either from natural rock and soil elution and/or accumulation of lithium-based pharmaceuticals in ground water.
   Aims
   To examine the interplay between natural lithium in drinking water, prescribed lithium-based pharmaceuticals and suicide in Austria.
   Method
   Spatial Bayesian regressions for males, females and pooled suicide mortality rates were estimated.
   Results
   Although the expected inverse association between lithium levels in drinking water and suicide mortality was confirmed for males and for total suicide rates, the relationship for females was not significant. The models do not indicate that lithium from prescriptions, assumed to accumulate in drinking water, is related to suicide risk patterns either as an individual effect or as a moderator of lithium levels in drinking water. Gender-specific differences in risk factors and local risk hot spots are confirmed.
   Conclusions
   The findings do not support the hypotheses that lithium prescriptions have measureable protective effects on suicide or that they interact with lithium in drinking water.

AB "Suicidal tendencies in everyday-life discourse: Popular interpretations of suicide in the 20th century". Starting with gender specific suicide rates, this essay analyzes popular interpretations of suicide in the 20th century in german-speaking countries. Under the term suicidal tendencies, all thoughts, notices, attempts and committed suicides are summarized. In a first step it will be shown that suicide was for both men and women a topic of autobiographical writing. They used the German term "Selbstmord" in a neutral way without judging the deed morally. After this the insignificance of religion for populate interpretations of suicide will be demonstrated. The next chapter analyzes the scope of popular explications of suicidal tendencies. Focusing on "Social relations" popular explanations resembled psychoanalytic ones. That was not the case for pathologizing medico-psychiatric explanations, that did not enter everyday-life discourse. Instead, these explanations followed a polythetic and polysemic logic that will be analyzed in the third step with a methodologically extended discourse analysis. Finally, genderspecific explanations will be presented. Popular interpretations endowed meaning for the surviving to comprehend the suicide as legitimated means to cope with life and crisis management. The essay is based on 155 unpublished, so called popular autobiographies from Germany (without GDR), Austria and Switzerland. They were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively.

ID LAY THEORIES; BELIEFS; FACTS
AB Psychometric properties and correlates of the German form of Lester and Bean's 1992 Attribution of Causes to Suicide Scale, of 18 items tapping into lay theories of suicide (intrapsychic problems, interpersonal conflicts, and societal forces as causes), were investigated in a sample of the general population in Austria (n = 156). The three attributional dimensions presented moderate internal consistencies and the 18 items appeared to be factorially orderly, as indicated by exploratory factor analysis. Previous results were replicated, with positive interrelations among all three dimensions, but these were largely confined to men. Societal causes of suicide were significantly less frequently endorsed than intrapsychic or interpersonal causes. Respondents' sex, intelligence, and knowledge about suicide were unrelated, and scores on the Big Five personality factors and social desirability were largely unrelated to the three dimensions. Endorsing intrapsychic causes to suicide was correlated with advanced age, religiosity, and conservative political orientation, and the three dimensions entertained meaningful associations with locus of control (internality, social externality, and fatalistic externality). All observed demographic and attitudinal correlates were, however, of modest magnitude. Implications of the findings and directions for further inquiry are discussed.

AB The pattern of geographic variation in European suicide rates in the high-risk group of individuals aged 65 years and over was investigated, in order to provide a further test of the Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis, i.e. the assumption that genetic differences between populations may partially account for spatial differences seen in the suicide prevalence. National suicide rates (average of 1970-2002) of the elderly from 34 European countries were regressed on geographic position terms, i.e. capital cities' latitude and longitude, along with transformations (e.g. squared latitude) and interaction terms (e.g. latitude multiplied with longitude) of these, which statistically modeled various possible geographic gradients in the suicide rates. In these regression models, the strongest and statistically significant predictor of elderly suicide rates was an interaction term of squared latitude multiplied with longitude, indicating that suicide rates increased to the northeast. This accounted for 13.8% (total), 20.8% (males) and 11.6% (females) of the cross-national variance in elderly suicide rates. No further geographic position term accounted for a significant increment of further variance in suicide rates over and above this predictor. Controls for national quality of living conditions and alcohol consumption rates left these results essentially unchanged. Replicating previous evidence based on suicide rates of the general population, suicide rates of the elderly show a northeastern gradient across Europe. This J-shaped belt of high-suicide-rate countries spans from Central Europe (Austria, Hungary and Slovenia) to Northeastern Europe (Finland and the Baltic countries). There are early historical and genetic communalities among the populations inhabiting this area, but, in terms of culture, recent history, political systems and socioeconomic factors, there is great diversity between these countries. The current findings thus add to cumulated empirical evidence consistent with the Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis.

AB Purpose: This cross-cultural study investigated the prevalence of suicidal behavior and attitudes towards suicide and reactions to suicidal individuals in 320 Austrian and 326 Turkish medical students.
   Methods: Data were collected using a self-report questionnaire consisting of sections on demographic information, suicidal behavior, current mood, religiosity, attitudes towards suicide, and reactions to suicidal individuals.
   Results: More Austrian (37.8%) than Turkish (27.3%) students reported life-time, past 12-month, or current suicidal ideation, while more Turkish (6.4%) than Austrian (2.2%) students reported life-time or past 12-month suicide attempts. Austrian students had more permissive and liberal attitudes towards suicide, while those of Turkish students were more rejecting. Conversely, attitudes of Turkish medical students towards an imagined suicidal close friend were more accepting than those of Austrian medical students. Comparisons of suicidal versus nonsuicidal students showed that those reporting suicidal ideation or suicide attempts generally were more accepting of suicide and viewed suicide as a solution to a greater extent than the nonsuicidal group.
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that cultural factors play a role in observed country differences in suicidal ideation and behavior and in attitudes towards suicide and reactions to suicidality among Austrian and Turkish medical students.

This study analyzed the beliefs held in 8 samples (total N=1224) of various types (psychology, medical, and various undergraduates, psychology graduates, and the general population) from 6 countries located on 3 continents (Austria, Canada, Malaysia, Romania, United Kingdom, and the USA). Endorsement rates for the existence of genetic risk factors for suicide ranged from 26% and 30% (Austrian psychology undergraduates and general population) to around 50% (psychology undergraduates in the USA and United Kingdom). In the 8 samples, respondents' sex, age, religiosity, political orientation, and other demographic variables were, for the most part, unrelated, but overall knowledge about suicide throughout was related positively to endorsement rates. Consistent with previous research, across a considerable variety of sample types and cultural settings there was no evidence for a clear majority believing in genetic bases for suicide.

TI Validity of suicide statistics in Europe in relation to undetermined

AB Background The suicide rate is a macro indicator of the population's psychosocial wellbeing and an evaluation criterion of the effectiveness of suicide prevention strategies. A high level of injury deaths of undetermined intent (UD) is usually discussed in connection with the validity of suicide statistics. An effort is made to develop a criterion to characterise the quality of suicide statistics.
   Methods Standardised rates of suicides (X60-X84) and UD (Y10-Y34) by the International Classification of Disease version 10 as an average for the past five available years were taken from the WHO European mortality database. Rate ratios were computed by dividing rates of UD by suicide rates.
   Results There is considerable variation in suicide and UD rates among countries. The highest overall rates of UD were registered in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, and the lowest in Greece, Spain and Italy. The EU-15 average UD rate of 1.97 and the rate ratio of 0.194 UD to suicides were combined into a '2-20 benchmark', in which the primary indicator is 2.0 UD cases per 100 000 and the secondary indicator is the proportion of UD to suicides 0.20 (20%), which enables countries to be clustered according to the quality of suicide statistics. The following countries satisfied the benchmark: Greece, Norway, Spain, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Austria, Italy, Romania, Hungary, Ireland and Finland.
   Conclusion This study used the developed '2-20 benchmark' in Europe to assess suicide registration quality in a particular country, to compare the relative position of countries, and to set a target for those European countries that have not yet achieved the benchmark.

AB This paper analyzed gender-specific reporting differences in Austrian newspapers on suicidal behavior related to portrayals of and language about suicidal motives in order to shed light on cultural scripts that may both reflect and shape gender stereotypes in a country where conservative gender-role models dominate. A total of 126 Austrian print-media reports on female suicidal behavior were compared to 381 reports on male suicidal behavior. The linguistic text analysis program LIWC was used to compare the use of language indicative of emotions, assess text complexity and detect indicators of social processes in the stories.
   Mental illness as a motive for suicide was more prevalent in reports on women's suicidal behavior and was often portrayed in a stigmatizing manner. Consistent with Austria's prevalent conceptions of gender-role functions, stories about female suicidal behavior contained more words indicating sociability and more references to other persons, and motives for female suicide were often linked to family situations. Words indicating anger were more prevalent in articles on male behavior, and male suicidal behavior was contextualized as stemming from breakups and spousal rejection. Articles on female suicide contained more tentative wording, and the language used to portray women's suicidal behavior was more complex. These findings are consistent with a script that conforms to sociable, mentally disturbed women and angry, rejected men. This script reflects sexist cultural attitudes relevant to public education efforts.

   Hypothesis in the United States

   METAANALYSIS; LONGITUDE; LATITUDE
AB There is now convergent evidence from classic quantitative genetics (family, twin, and adoption studies) and molecular genetic studies for specific genetic risk factors for suicidal behavior. This emerging research field has recently been supplemented by geographical studies concerned with the Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis (FUSH), which states that population differences in genetic risk factors may partially account for conspicuous geographical patterns seen in suicide prevalence. In particular, the European high-suicide-rate nations constitute a contiguous, J-shaped belt, spanning from Finland to Austria. This area maps onto the second principal component identified for European gene distribution, most likely reflecting a major migration event of the past (i.e., the ancestral adaptation to cold climates and the Uralic language dispersion) still detectable in modern European populations. The present research tested the hypothesis in the United States. Consistent with the hypothesis, available historical (1913-1924 and 1928-1932) U.S. state suicide rates were uniformly positively associated with available state proportions of reported American ancestries from European high-suicide-rate countries (Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, and the Ukraine). However, contrary to the hypothesis, available contemporary (1990-1994) suicide rates were uniformly negatively associated with these ancestry proportions. The findings of this first test outside Europe are therefore conflicting. A proposal based on the geographical study approach is offered to further the progress of investigations into the genetics of suicide.

AB IMPORTANCE It has been observed that suicidal behavior is influenced by sunshine and follows a seasonal pattern. However, seasons bring about changes in several other meteorological factors and a seasonal rhythm in social behavior may also contribute to fluctuations in suicide rates.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects of sunshine on suicide incidence that are independent of seasonal variation.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective analysis of data on all officially confirmed suicides in Austria between January 1,1970, and May 6, 2010 (n = 69 462). Data on the average duration of sunshine per day (in hours) were calculated from 86 representative meteorological stations. Daily number of suicides and daily duration of sunshine were differentiated to remove variation in sunshine and variation in suicide incidence introduced by season. Thereafter, several models based on Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Correlation of daily number of suicides and daily duration of sunshine after mathematically removing the effects of season.
   RESULTS Sunshine hours and number of suicides on every day from January 1, 1970, to May 6, 2010, were highly correlated (r = 0.4870; P < 10(-9)). After differencing for the effects of season, a mathematical procedure that removes most of the variance from the data, a positive correlation between number of suicides and hours of daily sunshine remained for the day of suicide and up to 10 days prior to suicide (r(maximum) = 0.0370; P < 10(-5)). There was a negative correlation between the number of suicides and daily hours of sunshine for the 14 to 60 days prior to the suicide event (r(minimum) = -0.0383; P < 10(-5)). These effects were found in the entire sample and in violent suicides.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Duration of daily sunshine was significantly correlated with suicide frequency independent of season, but effect sizes were low. Our data support the hypothesis that sunshine on the day of suicide and up to 10 days prior to suicide may facilitate suicide. More daily sunshine 14 to 60 days previously is associated with low rates of suicide. Our study also suggests that sunshine during this period may protect against suicide.

AB The prevalence of suicidal behavior and the nature of attitudes toward suicide differ in Austria and Turkey. To see if there were differences in disclosure, 351 Turkish and 310 Austrian students answered questions about disclosing suicidal thoughts. More Austrian than Turkish students reported suicidal ideation and believed that suicidal people disclose their plans, but suicidal disclosures were equally common in the two groups. Compared to Austria, suicidal disclosures in Turkey met with more positive social reactions that may facilitate a successful social support process. These findings imply that prevention efforts should reduce the stigma around suicidal disclosures.

AB Background: Previous studies suggest that troubled romantic relationships are associated with higher risk factors for mental health. However, studies examining the role of relationship satisfaction in suicide risk factors are scarce. Aims: We investigated differences in risk factors for suicide between individuals with high relationship satisfaction, individuals with low relationship satisfaction, and singles. Furthermore, we explored patterns of experiencing, and dealing with, conflicts in the relationship and examined associations with suicide risk factors. Method: In this cross-sectional study, we assessed relationship status, relationship satisfaction, specific types of relationship conflicts, and suicide risk factors (i.e., suicidal ideation, hopelessness, depression) with questionnaires among 382 individuals in Austria. Results: Risk factors for suicide were higher among singles than among individuals in happy relationships, but lower among those with low relationship satisfaction. Participants reporting a high number of unsolved conflicts in their relationship had higher levels of suicidal ideation, hopelessness, and depression than individuals who tend to solve issues with their partner amicably or report no conflicts. Conclusion: Relationship satisfaction and relationship conflicts reflect risk factors for suicide, with higher levels of suicidal ideation, hopelessness, and depression reported by individuals who mentioned unsolved conflicts with their partner and experienced low satisfaction with their relationship.

AB This paper reports on the preliminary results of a research project (supported by the Oesterreichische Nationalbank) about Austrian economists under the Nazi regime from 1938 to 1945. The biographies of nearly 200 economists were collected who had close relations to Austria and who were affected in some way or another by the politics of the Third Reich: some as perpetrators, followers or opportunists, others as victims who were persecuted, forced to emigrate or who even lost their lives. To illustrate the diverse fate of Austrian economists after the Anschluss, a brief account is given of three economists who belonged to different economic "schools" and who were affected by the Nazi regime in very different ways: Friedrich Gottl-Ottlilienfeld, an NS party member and adherent of the German Historical School; Friedrich Otto Hertz, a sociologist and economist, who was forced into emigration twice; and Karl Schlesinger, a banker with remarkable theoretical contributions to economics who committed suicide on the day the German Wehrmacht invaded Austria.

AB Previous references suggesting a high mortality of propofol addiction in medical personnel were mostly based on surveys of the heads of medical departments or case reports; therefore, a questionnaire was sent to 48 forensic medicine departments in Germany, Austria and Switzerland concerning the number of autopsies carried out between 2002-2112 on medical personnel with the suspicion of abuse of propofol or other analgesics. The response rate was 67%. In 16 out of the 32 responding departments 39 deaths (27 males) were observed with previous connections to anesthesiology, intensive care or emergency departments of which 22 were physicians, 13 nurses, 2 other personnel and 2 were unknown. Propofol was the major cause of death in 33 cases (85%), in 8 cases including 7 with propofol, an unintentional accident was recorded and 29 were determined to be suicide. In 14 cases chronic abuse was denied but actually excluded by toxicological analysis in only 2 cases. In 11 cases involving suicide the question of abuse was not investigated. This survey confirmed previous data about the central role of propofol for the fatal outcome of addiction and suicide of anesthetists and other medical personnel. A dual prevention strategy with low-threshold offers for persons at risk and strategies for early detection is urgently needed including a stricter control of dispensing, improvement in forensic medical documentation and the use of toxicological investigations in every case of suspected abuse.

AB Inadequate pain management of cancer patients remains a striking problem despite impressive scientific progress in the knowledge at the pathophysiology, pathogenesis and therapy of pain. Our paper focuses on three topics: 1. physician-related barriers, 2. patient-related barriers, and 3. society- and tradition-related barriers as well as government regulations. It is imperative to overcome these barriers, especially since legal regulations for pain management were embodied into statutory regulations in Austria two years ago.

AB Durkheim conceived of suicide as a product of social integration and regulation. Although the sociology of suicide has focused on the role of disintegration, to our knowledge, the interaction between integration and regulation has yet to be empirically evaluated. In this article we test whether more egalitarian gender norms, an important form of macro-regulation, protects men and women against suicidality during economic shocks. Using cross-national data covering 20 European Union countries from the years 1991 to 2011, including the recent economic crises in Europe, we first assessed the relation between unemployment and suicide. Then we evaluated potential effect modification using three measures of gender equality, the gender ratio in labour force participation, the gender pay gap, and women's representation in parliament using multiple measures. We found no evidence of a significant, direct link between greater gender equality and suicide rates in either men or women. However, a greater degree of gender equality helped protect against suicidality associated with economic shocks. At relatively high levels of gender equality in Europe, such as those seen in Sweden and Austria, the relationship between rising unemployment rates and suicide in men disappeared altogether. Our findings suggest that more egalitarian forms of gender regulation may help buffer the suicidal consequences of economic shocks, especially in men.

TI Determinants of Public Attitudes towards Euthanasia in Adults and

SO PLOS ONE

AB Background
   Euthanasia remains a controversial topic in both public discourses and legislation. Although some determinants of acceptance of euthanasia and physician-assisted death have been identified in previous studies, there is still a shortage of information whether different forms of euthanasia are supported by the same or different sub-populations and whether authoritarian personality dispositions are linked to attitudes towards euthanasia.
   Methods
   A large, representative face-to-face survey was conducted in Austria in 2014 (n = 1,971). Respondents faced three scenarios of euthanasia and one of physician assisted death differing regarding the level of specificity, voluntariness and subject, requiring either approval or rejection: (1) abstract description of euthanasia, (2) abstract description of physician-assisted suicide, (3) the case of euthanasia of a terminally-ill 79-year old cancer patient, and (4) the case of non-voluntary, physician assisted death of a severely disabled or ill neonate. A number of potential determinants for rejection ordered in three categories (socio-demographic, personal experience, orientations) including authoritarianism were tested via multiple logistic regression analyses.
   Results
   Rejection was highest in the case of the neonate (69%) and lowest for the case of the older cancer patient (35%). A consistent negative impact of religiosity on the acceptance across all scenarios and differential effects for socio-economic status, area of residence, religious confession, liberalism, and authoritarianism were found. Individuals with a stronger authoritarian personality disposition were more likely to reject physician-assisted suicide for adults but at the same time also more likely to approve of physician-assisted death of a disabled neonate.
   Conclusion
   Euthanasia in adults was supported by a partially different sub-population than assisted death of disabled neonates.

AB The role of childhood gender role nonconformity (CGNC) and childhood harassment (CH) in explaining suicidality (suicide ideation, aborted suicide attempts, and suicide attempts) was examined in a sample of 142 lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults and 148 heterosexual adults in Austria. Current and previous suicidality, CGNC, and CH were significantly greater in LGB participants compared to heterosexual participants. After controlling for CGNC, the effect of sexual orientation on CH diminished. CGNC correlated significantly with current suicidality in the LGB but not in the heterosexual group, and only non-significant correlations were found for CGNC with previous suicidality. Controlling for CH and CGNC diminished the effect of sexual orientation on current suicidality. Bayesian multivariate analysis indicated that current suicidality, but not previous suicidality, depended directly on CGNC. CH and CGNC are likely implicated in the elevated levels of current suicidality among adult LGB participants. As for previous suicidality, the negative impact of CGNC on suicidality might be overshadowed by stress issues affecting sexual minorities around coming out. The association of CGNC with current suicidality suggests an enduring effect of CGNC on the mental health and suicide risk of LGB individuals.

AB Objectives: Convergent evidence from a multitude of research designs (adoption, family, genome-scan, geographical, immigrant, molecular genetic, surname, and twin studies of suicide) suggests genetic contributions to suicide risk. The present account provides a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the twin studies on this topic.
   Methods: A total of 32 studies (19 case reports, 5 twin register-based studies, 4 population-based epidemiological studies, 4 studies of surviving co-twins) located through extensive literature search strategies are summarized and discussed here. This literature corpus was published between 1812 and 2006 in six languages and reports data from 13 countries.
   Results: A meta-analysis of all register-based studies and all case reports aggregated shows that concordance for completed suicide is significantly more frequent among monozygotic than dizygotic twin pairs. The results of co-twin studies rule out exclusively psychosocially based explanations of this pattern. Population-based epidemiological studies demonstrate a significant contribution of additive genetic factors (heritability estimates: 30-55%) to the broader phenotype of suicidal behavior (suicide thoughts, plans and attempts) that largely overlaps for different types of suicidal behavior and is largely independent of the inheritance of psychiatric disorders. Nonshared environmental effects (i.e. personal experiences) also contribute substantially to the risk of suicidal behavior, whereas effects of shared (family) environment do not.
   Conclusions: The totality of evidence from twin studies of suicide strongly suggests genetic contributions to liability for suicidal behavior. To further research progress in this area, an extensive discussion of design limitations, shortcomings of the literature and further points is provided, including sources of bias, gaps in the literature, errors in previous reviews, age and sex effects and twin-singleton differences in suicide risk, and notes from a history-of-science view.

ID SUICIDE MORTALITY; DRINKING-WATER; RATES
AB Therapeutic dosages of lithium are known to reduce suicide rates, which has led to investigations of confounding environmental risk factors for suicide such as lithium in groundwater. It has been speculated that this might play a role in the potential relationship between suicide and altitude. A recent study in Austria involving geospatial analysis of lithium in groundwater and suicide found lower levels of lithium at higher altitudes. Since there is no reason to suspect this correlation is universal given variation in geology, the current study set out to investigate the relationship between altitude and lithium in groundwater in the United States of America (USA). The study utilised data extracted from the National Water-Quality Assessment programme implemented by the United States Geological Survey that has collected 5,183 samples from 48 study areas in USA for the period of 1992 to 2003. Lithium was the trace-element of interest and 518 samples were used in the current analyses. Due to uneven lithium sampling within the country, only the states (n = 15) with the highest number of lithium samples were included. Federal information processing standard codes were used to match data by county with the mean county altitude calculated using altitude data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. The study was controlled for potential confounding factors known to affect levels of lithium in groundwater including aquifer, aquifer type, lithology, water level and the depths of wells. The levels of lithium in groundwater, increased with altitude (R-2 = 0.226, P < 0.001) during the study period. These findings differ from the Austrian study and suggest a need for further research accounting also for the impact of geographical variation.

AB Epilepsy is a devastating condition with a considerable increase in mortality compared to the general population. Few studies have focused on cause-specific mortality which we analyse in detail in over 4,000 well-characterized epilepsy patients. The cohort comprised of epilepsy patients a parts per thousand yen18, treated between 1970 and 2009 at the epilepsy clinic of Innsbruck Medical University, Austria, and living in the province of Tyrol, Austria. Epilepsy diagnosis was based on ILAE guidelines (1989); patients with brain tumor were excluded. Deceased patients and causes of death (ICD-codes) were obtained via record linkage to the national death registry. We computed age-, sex-, and period-adjusted standardized mortality rates (SMR) for 36 diagnoses subgroups in four major groups. Additional analyses were performed for an incidence cohort. Overall cohort: 4,295 patients, 60,649.1 person-years, 822 deaths, overall SMR 1.7 (95 % CI 1.6-1.9), highest elevated cause-specific SMR: congenital anomalies [7.1 (95 % CI 2.3-16.6)], suicide [4.2 (95 % CI 2.0-8.1)], alcohol dependence syndrome [3.9 (95 % CI 1.8-7.4)], malignant neoplasm of esophagus [3.1 (95 % CI 1.2-6.4)], pneumonia [2.7 (95 % CI 1.6-4.2)]. Incidence cohort: 1,299 patients, 14,215.4 person-years, 267 deaths, overall SMR 1.8 (95 % CI 1.6-2.1), highest elevated cause-specific SMR congenital anomalies [10.8 (95 % CI 1.3-39.3)], suicide [6.8 (95 % CI 1.4-19.8)], alcohol dependence syndrome (6.4 [95 % CI 1.8-16.5)], pneumonia [3.9 (95 % CI 1.8-7.4)], cerebrovascular disease at 3.5 (95 % CI 2.6-4.6). Mortality due to mental health problems, such as suicide or alcohol dependence syndrome, malignant neoplasms, and cerebrovascular diseases was highly increased in our study. In addition to aim for seizure freedom, we suggest improving general health promotion, including cessation of smoking, lowering of alcohol intake, and reduction of weight as well as early identification of psychiatric comorbidity in patients with epilepsy.

TI Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE): a randomized

AB Background: There have been only a few reports illustrating the moderate effectiveness of suicide-preventive interventions in reducing suicidal behavior, and, in most of those studies, the target populations were primarily adults, whereas few focused on adolescents. Essentially, there have been no randomized controlled studies comparing the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and cultural adaptability of suicide-prevention strategies in schools. There is also a lack of information on whether suicide-preventive interventions can, in addition to preventing suicide, reduce risk behaviors and promote healthier ones as well as improve young people's mental health.
   The aim of the SEYLE project, which is funded by the European Union under the Seventh Framework Health Program, is to address these issues by collecting baseline and follow-up data on health and well-being among European adolescents and compiling an epidemiological database; testing, in a randomized controlled trial, three different suicide-preventive interventions; evaluating the outcome of each intervention in comparison with a control group from a multidisciplinary perspective; as well as recommending culturally adjusted models for promoting mental health and preventing suicidal behaviors.
   Methods and design: The study comprises 11,000 adolescents emitted from randomized schools in 11 European countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden serving as the scientific coordinating center. Each country performs three active interventions and one minimal intervention as a control group. The active interventions include gatekeeper training (QPR), awareness training on mental health promotion for adolescents, and screening for at-risk adolescents by health professionals. Structured questionnaires are utilized at baseline, 3- and 12-month follow-ups in order to assess changes.
   Discussion: Although it has been reported that suicide-preventive interventions can be effective in decreasing suicidal behavior, well-documented and randomized studies are lacking. The effects of such interventions in terms of combating unhealthy lifestyles in young people, which often characterize suicidal individuals, have never been reported. We know that unhealthy and risk-taking behaviors are detrimental to individuals' current and future health. It is, therefore, crucial to test well-designed, longitudinal mental health-promoting and suicide-preventive interventions by evaluating the implications of such activities for reducing unhealthy and risk behaviors while concurrently promoting healthy ones.

TI Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide: what about in Europe?
SO GAZZETTA MEDICA ITALIANA ARCHIVIO PER LE SCIENZE MEDICHE

DT Review
DE Euthanasia; Assisted suicide; Legal liability; Europe
ID OF-LIFE PRACTICES; CHILDREN; TRENDS
AB INTRODUCTION: End-of-life legislation, because of its bioethical, medico-legal, and judicial implications, is heatedly disputed in Europe and throughout the world, engendering a variety of legal end-of-life care options in different countries. We thought it could be interesting to compare the Italian law with current European legislation regulating end-of-life matters.
   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic search of the Medline, Cochrane Central, Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases was conducted using the search words: "euthanasia", "law", "Europe", and "assisted suicide". The search word "euthanasia" was entered singly or in combination with each of the other search terms.
   EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: To date, only three countries in Europe (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) have legalized euthanasia, and four countries (Switzerland, France, Austria, Germany) permit only assisted suicide. Acceptance by the general public of euthanasia and assisted suicide increased in 11 of 13 European countries between 1981 and 2008, in parallel with a decrease in religiosity (except for Italy and Holland) and an increase in secularization. There was also a trend toward a correlation between an increase of the value of self-determination in important life issues and an increase in acceptance of euthanasia.
   CONCLUSIONS: This review shows that end-of-life decisions constitute a challenge for political governance and bioethical deliberation in modern liberal democracies. It appears that in certain situations, euthanasia is perceived more as a means to reduce health care costs rather than an ethical question regarding self-determination.

AB Objective: Few studies have investigated gender-specific excess mortality in suicidal patients. The objective of this study was to examine the risk of dying from all causes of death in male and female suicidal patients.
   Method: This study included 4140 patients who received psychiatric treatment in two Austrian hospitals after non-fatal suicidal behavior between 1989 and 2001. Mortality was prospectively assessed for a maximum follow-Lip period of 17 years (1989-2005). Gender-specific standardized mortality ratios were calculated for all causes of death. Rate ratios were used to assess gender differences.
   Results: Males but not females had an elevated risk to die from "natural" causes of death. Mortality from "unnatural" causes of death, particularly suicide, was elevated in both genders. The female suicide risk markedly exceeded the risk for males. In both genders, mortality caused by substance use disorders was considerably elevated.
   Conclusion: Significant Lender differences in the excess mortality of suicidal patients underline the need for gender-specific research in psychiatry. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: For pathological gambling (PG), a 12-month prevalence rate of up to 0.66% has been reported. Multiple financial, occupational and relationship problems and losses, humiliation of the person and the environment are possible side effects and may lead to hopelessness, suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. Suicide attempt rates among pathological gamblers of between 4% and 40% and suicidal ideation of between 12% and 92% have been reported.
   Aim: This study aims at assessing the prevalence of suicide attempts in PG and at elucidating differences between the patients with and without suicide attempt history (SAH) in a large nationwide Austrian sample.
   Methods: Between 2002 and 2011, the Austrian Society for the Research of Non-Substance Related Addiction collected 862 questionnaires of pathological gamblers undergoing outpatient and inpatient treatment for PG in Austria.
   Results: (a) Of all pathological gamblers, 9.7% had an SAH. (b) The SAH group suffered significantly more from a comorbid disorder and was more often in previous inpatient treatments. (c) The SAH patients had a longer time of an abstinence period in their PG career.
   Discussion: One in 10 pathological gamblers has an SAH, demonstrating the relevance of suicidality in this population. Significant differences for several parameters were found for PG with and without SAH. However, a regression analysis only explained 15% of the variance. This suggests that suicidality must be considered in pathological gamblers in general. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background Research on attitudes towards end-of-life decisions (ELDs) contextually most often refers to the very end of life, that is, to situations of terminally ill patients or severe pain, but it is rarely applied to the broader context of long-term care dependency in old age.
   Methods In a representative survey among older Austrians (50+, n=968), respondents were asked about their approval of assisted suicide and euthanasia (EUT) when requested by an older, severely care-dependent person. The influence of sociodemographics, care-related experiences and expectations, religiosity, trust, locus of control and concerns regarding constrictions of old age on the approval of both these ELDs was assessed through logistic regression analyses.
   Results 42% and 34% of the respondents approved assisted suicide and EUT, respectively, in case of care dependency. Non-religious individuals, less trusting respondents and those concerned about constrictions associated with old age were more likely to approve both these ELDs.
   Conclusions Widespread concerns regarding long-term care dependency in old age should be addressed in information campaigns, and public discourse about ELDs should pay more attention to situations of long-term care dependency.

AB Background: traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant public health problem. Developed countries report a significant increase of TBI in older adults in the past decades. The objective of this study was to investigate the changes in TBI-related mortality in older Austrians (65 years or older) between 1980 and 2012 (33 years) and to identify possible causes for these changes.
   Methods: data from Statistics Austria on mortality in Austria between 1980 and 2012 were screened and data on TBI-related mortality in adults aged 65 and older were extracted and analysed, based on the diagnostic codes of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th and 9th revision. Mortality rates were calculated for 5-year age groups; standardized mortality rates were calculated for the total. Mechanism of injury was analysed for all events, both sexes and individual age groups.
   Results: between 1980 and 2012, 16,204 people aged 65 or older died from TBI in Austria; 61% of these were male. Fatal TBI cases and mortality rates increased in the oldest age groups (80 years or older). Half of the fatal TBI cases were caused by falls, 22% by traffic accidents and 17% by suicides. Rate of fall-related fatal TBI increased and rate of traffic accident-related fatal TBI decreased with age.
   Conclusion: preventive measures introduced in the past decades in the developed countries have contributed to a decrease in traffic injuries. However, falls in the older population are on the rise, mainly due to ageing of the population, throughout the reported period. It is important to take preventive measures to stop the epidemics of fall-related TBIs and fatalities in older adults.

AB Objective: Common mental disorders are strong risk factors for suicide attempt. We compared common mental disorder patients with and without suicide attempt regarding health care utilization and psychiatric medication, assessed gender differences and identified how psychotropic medication of attempters is associated with subsequent rehospitalization. Methods: We used administrative claims data of 22,276 common mental disorder patients with inpatient care in Lower Austria between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2011. Suicide attempters (cases, n = 615) and non-attempters (controls, n = 21,661) were compared regarding specific healthcare utilization by calculating mean differences of time-dependent contact probabilities and psychiatric medication (i.e. prescribed defined daily doses) +/- 0.5 years around their suicide attempt (cases)/common mental disorder diagnosis (controls). Cluster analysis was used to group suicide attempters according to their psychiatric medication. The risk of rehospitalization 0.5-3 years after the attempt was calculated with regression analysis controlling for sex, age and morbidity-related factors. Results: Contacts with general practitioners were lower for attempters than non-attempters (mean difference of contact probabilities over observation period, males = -0.05, 95% confidence interval = [-0.07, -0.03]; females: mean difference = -0.04, 95% confidence interval = [-0.05, -0.03]). Regarding psychiatrists, female attempters had markedly higher contact probabilities after the attempt compared to female non-attempters (mean difference = 0.02, 95% confidence interval = [0.007, 0.04]); male attempters had lower contact probabilities before the attempt compared to male non-attempters (mean difference = -0.01, 95% confidence interval = [-0.004, -0.02]). Attempters had higher dosages of psychiatric medication across the entire period. Antidepressant and antipsychotic medication peaked at the time of common mental disorder diagnosis/attempt. Benzodiazepine prescriptions were considerably higher for male attempters than their female counterparts and were constantly elevated for male attempters across the observation period. A cluster of attempters with long-term benzodiazepine prescriptions had an increased risk of rehospitalization (adjusted odds ratio = 2.4, 95% confidence interval = [1.1, 5.5]). Conclusion: Despite lower contact probabilities, common mental disorder patients with suicide attempt are prescribed more psychiatric medication, particularly benzodiazepines, with an elevated risk of rehospitalization. Strong sex differences were found.

AB This study is the first to explore the twin influences of online propaganda and news media on Islamists. We conducted 44 in-depth interviews with cognitively and behaviorally radicalized Islamist prisoners in Austria as well as former Islamists in Germany and Austria. We found that online propaganda and news media had interdependent influences on Islamists' rejections of non-Muslims and Western politics, as well as on their willingness to use violence and commit suicide. Cognitively radicalized individuals were influenced by propaganda that blamed non-Muslims for opposing Islam; this was reinforced by online mainstream news reports of right-wing populism and extremism that propagandists selectively distributed via social media. Among behaviorally radicalized individuals, exposure to propaganda and news reports depicting Muslim war victims contributed to the radicalized individuals' willingness to use violence. Moreover, propaganda and media reports that extensively personalized perpetrators of violence strengthened radicalized individuals' motivations to imitate the use of violence.

AB Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important cause of preventable deaths. The goal of this study was to provide data on epidemiology of TBI in Austria.
   Data on all hospital discharges, outpatients, and extra- as well as in-hospital deaths due to TBI were collected from various sources for the years 2009-2011. Population data (number of male/female people per age-group, population of Austrian cities, towns, and villages) for 2009-2011 were collected from the national statistical office. Incidence, case fatality rate(s) (CFR), and mortality rate(s) (MR) were calculated for the whole population and for age groups.
   Incidence (303/100,000/year), CFR (3.6 %), and MR (11/100,000/year) of TBI in Austria are comparable with those from other European countries. We found a high rate of geriatric TBI. The ratio between male and female cases was 1.4:1 for all cases, and was 2.2:1 for fatal cases. The most common mechanism was falls; traffic accidents accounted for only 7 % of the cases. Males died more frequently from traffic accidents and suicides, and females died more frequently from falls. CFRs and MRs increased with increasing age. CFRs were higher in patients from less populated areas, and MRs were lower in cases who lived closer to hospitals that admitted TBI.
   The high rate of geriatric TBI warrants better prevention of falls in this age group.

AB Aim of the Study Existing research on attitudes in the general population regarding end-of-life decisions has included neither old age long-term care dependency nor worries regarding age(ing). The aim of this study is to present first results from a recent survey on this topic.
   Methods A nationally representative cross-sectional survey of the population aged 50+ was conducted in Austria (n = 968) in 2015.
   Results 29.0 % of the respondents indicated not wanting to live on as a severely care-dependent older person. In the case of an older care-dependent person, 48.5 % approved of forgoing life-sustaining treatment, 41.7 % of assisted suicide and 34.1 % of euthanasia if requested. Worries about old age and ageing were widespread (53.7-83.0 %) and highly worried respondents were more inclined to support assisted suicide and euthanasia compared to those less worried.
   Conclusions Worries and negative stereotypes regarding age(ing) and long-term care dependency should be addressed by information campaigns.

AB BACKGROUND: Many studies have shown that mortality increases with decreasing level of education. This paper aims to identify those causes of death that contribute most to educational mortality differentials in Austria, and to reveal those causes of death for which the relative differentials are higher-than-average.
   METHODS: Individual-level 1991 census and death registry records for the entire Austrian population were linked for a follow-up period of one year. Mortality differentials were measured using the regression-based Relative Index of Inequality (RII).
   RESULTS: Causes of death contributing most to educational mortality disparities among men were lung cancer (13%), digestive diseases (13%), ischemic heart disease (12%) and the category 'other circulatory diseases' (11%); among females, corresponding conditions were all circulatory diseases combined (58%) and 'other neoplasms' (14%). Compared to all-cause mortality differential among men (RII = 0.72), larger relative disparities were observed for alcohol-associated deaths (RII = 1.71), followed by digestive and respiratory diseases (RII = 1.21 and 1.07, respectively), stomach and lung cancer (RII = 1.04 and 1.08, respectively), injuries (RII = 1.15) and suicides (RII = 0.97). Among females, disparities that were considerably larger than for all-cause mortality (RII = 0.46) were identified for diabetes (RII = 1.35), injuries (RII = 1.12), cerebrovascular disease (RII = 0.94), respiratory diseases (RII = 0.84) and ischemic heart disease (RII = 0.75). For causes of death combined that are amenable to medical intervention, the differentials were surprisingly large (RIImales = 0.57; RIIfemales = 0.48), given that Austria has a comprehensive, social health-care system.
   CONCLUSION: Efforts to reduce high death rates among the less-educated for identified diseases that contribute largely to overall mortality disparity could increase average life expectancy and improve the general health status of the Austrian population.

AB Current methodologies employed in collecting data for suicide research present several limitations. In this article, we describe a novel method and tool to prospectively study suicidal behavior and its related risk and protective factors in different countries. This tool is a web-based database, which will initially be developed and piloted by suicide research groups from Austria, Brazil, Chile, France, Italy, Mexico, Spain, Sweden, and the US. The database will develop and integrate research tools key to collaboration, permit exploration of ethical considerations, and provide a universal interface in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, and German that will make it possible to incorporate new groups from different countries to the network. The common database resulting of this cross-national effort will allow researchers to share and compare data across countries in a large sample of patients. Using anonymous electronic records of patients, we will: 1) determine the impact of risk and protective factors (viz. aggression and religious affiliation) in different socio-cultural environments; 2) develop a clinical model of suicidal behavior that integrates the multiple dimensions implicated; 3) try differentiating the effects of biological, environmental, and cultural factors on suicidal behavior, and 4) offer the global psychiatric research community a tool that will standardize assessment across nations, allowing for better generalization.

TI Atypical suicides or the first undiagnosed autoerotic deaths in Europe?
SO JOURNAL OF FORENSIC AND LEGAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Auto-erotic death; Asphyxiophilia; Suicide; History
AB Autoerotic accidental deaths (AAD) are increasingly reported deaths occurring during solitary sexual rituals used to enhance sexual excitement. The majority of these fatalities involve hanging or other form of self-inflicted asphyxia. The German medical literature, with the first recognized AAD published in the early 1900s, has antedated by decades the first significant AAD reports (1950-1953) in English. Early contributions in languages other than English and German are mostly overlooked in current AAD reviews, although AAD were recognised in some European countries as early as the 1940s and 1950s. For a variety of reasons, it is likely that, before the description of the first AAD in the medical literature, some asphyxia deaths have been classified as suicides with peculiar features, instead of as accidents resulting from life-threatening sexual practices. In the present study, we review and comment on three such atypical asphyxia deaths investigated in central Europe (Austria, Italy, Switzerland) during the period 1821 to 1927. The retrospective analysis of these cases revealed some circumstantial and individual features which nowadays could be linked to AAD, and disclosed the reluctance of medical examiners to analyse their motivational, and possibly sexual, background. The medico-legal approach to some autopsy findings of these cases also illustrates some controversial diagnostic issues regarding mechanical asphyxia, issues recurrently debated during the 19th century.

AB BACKGROUND: Severe depression is associated with an extensive economic burden on both the patient and society.
   OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness in Austria of escitalopram compared with citalopram in the management of severe depression (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score greater than or equal to30).
   METHODS: A decision model incorporated treatment paths and associated direct resource use (psychiatric hospitalization, medications, general practitioner and psychiatrist visits, treatment discontinuation, suicide attempts) associated with managing severe depression and the indirect cost of work absenteeism over a 6-month period. Main outcomes were clinical success (remission at 6 mo) and cost (2002 Euros equals similar to1.25 US) of treatment. The analysis was performed from the Austrian societal and Social Healthcare Insurance System (SHIS) perspectives. Clinical input data were derived from a meta-analysis of 8-week randomized clinical trials. Costs were derived from standard Austrian price lists or from the literature.
   RESULTS: Six months after the start of treatment, the overall clinical success remission rate was higher for escitalopram (53.7%) than for citalopram (48.7%). From the SHIS perspective, the total expected cost per successfully treated severely depressed patient was 924 (32.1%) lower for escitalopram (2879) compared with citalopram (3803). From the societal perspective, the total expected cost per successfully treated severely depressed patient was 1369 (24.4%) lower for escitalopram (5610) than for citalopram (6979). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the model was robust and that, even if citalopram had no acquisition cost, escitalopram remained the dominant strategy for both perspectives.
   CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with escitalopram was the dominant strategy. These data suggest that escitalopram is a cost-effective antidepressant compared with citalopram in the management of severe depression in Austria.

SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL HISTORY

DT Article
AB From the onset, moral statistics were influenced by religious discourse. During the nineteenth century, Adolf Wagner discovered the "One Law" of sociology: Protestants always kill themselves more often than Catholics. Deployed by his colleague, the Baltic nationalist theologian Alexander von Oettingen, it became a moral-statistical plank in the modernity thesis and supported a Prussian master narrative of history. Accordingly, it justified the unification of Germany according to the small German model of a Kulturnation excluding Catholic Austria. This interpretation, in turn, influenced subsequent generations of German sociologists, who described modernity in idealist and spiritual terms. In this, they differed from the more mechanistic and materialist theories of French sociologists, in particular Emile Durkheim.

DE Rudolf Kronfeld; Oral pathology; Histopathology; Anti-Semitism; Medical
   emigration; National Socialism
AB The physician Rudolf Kronfeld (1901-1940) is undoubtedly one of the pioneering and most influential representatives of modern histopathology and oral pathology. Already at a young age he became a protagonist of the renowned, internationally leading "Vienna School".
   Kronfeld's outstanding professional significance stands in a peculiar contrast to the research situation to date: His curriculum vitae, but also his family background - and here in particular the fate of his family members in the Third Reich - have received little attention so far.
   Thus, the present study attempts to shed light on Kronfeld's life and work and, in particular, the complex implications of his Jewish background. It is based on archival sources and a systematic re-analysis of the relevant specialist literature.
   The analysis demonstrates that Kronfeld's early emigration was driven in part by the anti-Semitism that was tangible in Vienna in the 1920s. The last years of his life were considerably burdened by a serious illness and by repressive experiences which his Jewish family members and companions underwent after the "Anschluss" of Austria into Nazi Germany. Both essential events presumably contributed significantly to Kronfeld's sudden suicide in 1940, at the height of his professional success.

AB Filicide is the act of killing one's own child. We propose a new classification of subtypes of filicide and make suggestions for helping its prevention. This binational, register-based study covers all cases of filicide and their perpetrators in Austria and Finland in the years 1995-2005. The following variables emerged as differentiating factors: gender, age of victim and offender, circumstances before and during the offence, the offender's socioeconomic and criminal background, and childhood conduct disorder. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify profiles. We found five: (1) Homicidal-Suicidal Fathers; (2) Violent Impulsive Parents; (3) Single Sober Parents; (4) Prosocial, Psychotic Parents; and (5) Infanticidal Mothers. We present suggestions for focused strategies of prevention for each group.

AB The present study investigated the chronology of media attention, public attention, and actual vaccinations during a recent measles outbreak in Austria. The analysis indicated that initial news coverage about the measles outbreak (the first wave of media attention) sparked public attention and led to additional heavy news coverage about measles (the second wave of media attention). The observed patterns of public and media attention reflect typical issue-attention cycles, as revealed by previous research. As a supplement to previous studies, the present study links media and public attention with a consecutive increase in the number of vaccinations, thereby supporting the notion of an issue-attention-action cycle. Additional curve-fitting analyses showed that the day-by-day variations in media and public attention resembled sharp, short-term "spotlight effects," whereas consequences on vaccination behavior represented a broader, long-term "echo effect." Above and beyond the theoretical contributions, we discuss practical implications: Surveilling the development of media and public attention in the immediate aftermath of a measles outbreak may be a cost-effective strategy to predict future patient load, thereby helping to effectively allocate resources for vaccination programs. A thorough understanding of the issue-attention-action cycle contributes to this aim.

AB The closeness to medical profession and the attitude towards euthanasia
   Periodically debates on the legalization of active euthanasia are conducted in the Austrian media. In contrast to most European and North American countries, these debates are not based on local empirical data, because until now no studies on respective attitudes and values exist. In this study notion towards active euthanasia of (1) medical lays, (2) medical students and medical specialists in psychiatry, surgery and internal medicine are explored by means of a semistructured questionnaire. We found that increasing closeness to the medical profession is associated with an increasing refusal of active euthanasia. Among the medical specialists, specialists in internal medicine, who, after the legalization, would be most involved in decision-making processes as well as in the execution of active euthanasia, showed the greatest reservation concerning this question.

AB Queering Medicine addresses the role of medicine and psychology in transgender healthcare against a historically heavily charged relationship between transgender persons and professionals. Improved and adequate professional care for transgender persons will only be succesful when prejudices and traditional convictions about the gender dichotomy will be overcome. It is crucial for a professional and respectful relationship with transgender persons that medicine and psychology learn to accept gender individuality and diversity. This article also describes terminology, and briefly depicts the historical background of transgender medicine. Moreover recommended proceedings for Germany, Austria and Switzerland are described and critically appraised. Also, special attention is paid to the recently released German S3-guideline on ,Gender incongruence, genderdysphoria and trans-health'. Last but not least role and duties of endocrinologists dealing with transgender persons is illuminated.

AB Mass media reports attribute the occurrence of decomposed or mummified corpses in a domestic setting mainly to an increasing social isolation of elderly people. Not much is known about the demographic and medical conditions under which individuals are found months or even years after death in their homes.
   For this study, autopsy reports of individuals found dead and mummified or decomposed between 1993 and 1997 with those from 1963 to 1967 were retrospectively analyzed.
   Between 1993 and 1997, a total number of 320 individuals were found decomposed at home compared to 412 such cases between 1963 and 1967. The proportion of individuals older than 64 years was significantly higher during the 1990s study period. Furthermore, the proportion of deaths attributable to natural causes was significantly lower during the 1990s, whereas the rate of suicides was nearly three times higher.

AB An estimated 800 000 suicide deaths occur worldwide. The global suicide rate is 11.4 per 100 000 population; 15.0/100 000 for males and 8.0/100 000 for females. Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year olds. In a collaborative effort to reduce the high rates of suicide and mental health problems among youth across Europe, the European Union 7(th) Framework funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. SEYLE is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to promote mental health and healthy lifestyles, while preventing psychopathology and suicidal behaviours among adolescents. The epidemiological data on 11,110 pupils in the age group 14-16 years, with a mean age of 14.8 years (SD +/- 0.8), who were recruited from 168 schools across 10 European Union countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden as the coordinating centre showed the following prevalences: alcohol use (13.4%), smoking (30.9%), physical inactivity (32.8%), pathological Internet use (4.4%) and sleeping on average 7.7 hours per night. In terms of reproductive health, the prevalence of sexual debut was 18.8% for the total sample. Pupils aged >= 16 years had a higher prevalence (38%) of sexual debut compared to those aged <= 15 years (13.2%). Males had a higher prevalence (21.3%) than females (16.9%). Three clusters of adolescents were identified: 57.8% with low frequency of all risk-behaviours; 13.2% with high frequency of all risk behaviours; and 29% so-called `invisible' risk group, which did not show any striking externalised risk behaviours, but scored positive for high use of Internet/TV/videogames, sedentary behaviour and reduced sleep. When comparing pupils in the `invisible' risk group with those in the high-risk group, similar prevalence rates of anxiety (8% vs. 9.2%), subthreshold depression (33.2% vs. 34%), depression (13.4% vs. 14.7%) and suicidal thoughts (42.2% vs. 44%) were observed. Pupils meeting the criteria of depression and subthreshold depression were 10.5% and 32%, respectively. Prevalence rates for anxiety and subthreshold anxiety was 5.8% and 29.2%, respectively. Lifetime prevalence of deliberate self-injurious behaviours (D-SIB) was 27.6%, with higher rates reported for occasional D-SIB (19.7%) compared to repetitive D-SIB (7.8%). Suicidal ideation was present in approximately one third of the sample (32.3%). More than four percent (4.2%) of the sample reported attempting suicide during their lifetime, with a significantly higher prevalence among girls (5.1% vs. 3.0%, p<0.05). In comparing the effectiveness of the three active SEYLE interventions, based on three specific preventive strategies directed towards teachers and school staff, professionals and pupils in comparison to a control group, the intervention empowering pupils, called the Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) showed significant results in preventing new cases of suicide attempts, severe suicidal ideation with plans and depression. More than a 50% reduction of incident cases of suicide attempts (OR: 0.45 [0.24 - 0.85]; p=0.014), and of incident cases of severe suicidal ideation and plans (OR: 0.50 [0.27 - 0.92]; p=0.025), as well as a significant reduction by 30% of incident cases with moderate to severe depression (OR: 0.71 [0.52- 0.97]; p=0.031) was observed.

AB This study investigated the impact of film dramas on the emotional and cognitive state of recipients, as well as mediating effects of different modes of film reception. Furthermore, associations between the modes of reception and individual favored coping strategies were examined. One hundred fifty nondepressive and nonsuicidal adults living in Austria watched one of three films featuring the death of the main character. Data on the viewers' mood, inner tensions, self-esteem, life satisfaction, depression, suicidal tendencies, attitudes toward suicide, predominantly used modes of reception, and preferred coping strategies were collected with questionnaires that were handed out before and after seeing the movie. Results indicated that drama viewing was linked to both negative and positive effects: on the one hand, to a deterioration of mood as well as an increase of inner tensions and depression scores, and on the other hand, to a rise in self-esteem and life satisfaction as well as a drop in suicidal tendencies. The more a subject was involved in the film, the more pronounced were the negative impacts and the smaller were the positive reactions. The viewers' preferred coping strategies were partly associated with the modes of reception: the more an individual preferred to seek social support when facing a problem, the more he or she identified with the drama's protagonist and tried to find behavior patterns in the movie to improve his or her own life.

AB In the late 19th century, Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria, undertook to strengthen, on the basis of scholarly principles, the weakened inner cohesion of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy and publish a 20 volume series, in German and in Hungarian, "The Austro-Hungarian Monarchy in word and picture", or "Kronprinzenwerk" ("The Crown Prince's Work"), as it was known. The series attempted to provide scientific argumentation to prove the spiritual unity of the peoples living in Central Europe and their difference from other groups. After the volumes were published, as a result of monumental changes that occurred in the early 20th century, new literatures were born in Central and Eastern Europe, the old ones entered a new phase and the highest levels of world literature. The last representatives of the era, however, did not follow the earlier examples and the collectivism and shared homeland consciousness suggested by the Monarchy and turned towards subjectivism. They uncovered previously untouched depths of the soul and of language in their works, fighting old age, death, suicide, fear, depression, inexpressibility, and the feeling of helplessness.

AB This study aimed to discover gender differences in filicide offenders' psychiatric diagnoses, history, and other mental health-related variables. This nationwide register-based study covered all filicide offenders (n=124) in Austria and Finland in 1995-2005. There were 79 female and 45 male offenders. Both genders had an equally challenged childhood. The filicidal fathers were older than the mothers, mean ages 37.5 and 31.6 years, respectively (p0.001). Filicidal fathers committed suicide at the crime scene more often than the mothers (38% vs. 15%, p0.05). Of the examined parents, fathers were diagnosed more often with substance abuse/dependence (39% vs. 2%, p0.001) and mothers with a psychotic disorder (35% vs. 13%, p0.05). During the year preceding the crime, 25 (32%) of the mothers and 13 (29%) of the fathers had sought help for mental health-related problems. Service providers need specific strategies to support parents in distress, especially when depressive symptoms are present.

AB Using two new scales, this study examined beliefs in genetic determinism and attitudes towards psychiatric genetic research in student samples from Austria, Malaysia, Romania, and the United Kingdom. For both constructs, effects of culture were detectable, whereas those related to key demographics were either small and inconsistent across samples (political orientation and religiosity) or zero (sex and age). judged from factorial dimensionality and internal consistency, the psychometric properties of both scales were satisfactory. Belief in genetic determinism had lower prevalence and corresponded only modestly to positive attitudes towards psychiatric genetic research which had higher prevalence. The correlations of both constructs with a preference of inequality among social groups (social dominance orientation) were modest and inconsistent across samples. Both scales appear appropriate for cross-cultural applications, in particular for research into lay theories and public perceptions regarding genetic vs environmental effects on human behavior, mental disorders, and behavioral and psychiatric genetic research related to these.

   POPULATION; FACILITIES
AB Objective: Delinquent juveniles are at extreme risk for suicide with death rates 4 times higher than in the general population. Whereas psychopathologic risk factors for suicidal behavior in nonforensic adolescent populations are well defined, psychopathologies associated with suicidality in delinquent juveniles are not yet clear. The objective of this study was to determine genderspecific psychopathologic profiles associated with suicidality in detained juveniles.
   Method: The Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument-Second Version, the Youth SelfReport, and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for children and adolescents used to investigate juveniles in an Austrian pretrial detention facility. The study sample sisted of all juveniles entering the system between March 2003 and January 2005. Of the 370 gible participants, 319 completed the study (53 girls and 266 boys; age range, 14 to 21 years; mean = 16.67, SD = 1.45 years).
   Results: We found significantly higher prevalence rates of both current (p < .0 1) and lifetime (p < .001) suicidality in girls than in boys. Suicidal boys exhibited more psychopathology and a wider range of psychopathology compared to nonsuicidal boys. For suicidal girls, psychopathologies appeared more circumscribed (all relevant p values < .04). Using signal detection. methods, major depressive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and social phobia identified boys at highest risk of suicidality, while a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder identified girls at highest risk.
   Conclusions: Suicidality levels are high in delinquent adolescents, especially in girls. Psychopathologic risk factors seem to be gender specific in this population. Not only depression, but also psychopathologies that usually do not arouse strong suspicion for an association with suicidal behavior, i.e., social phobia and ADHD in boys and PTSD in girls, might increase suicide risk. Further research in other countries is needed to replicate our results with respect to sociocultural influences.

AB Background A regulatory signal suggested that sertindole was associated with a 10-fold increased risk of death. This observational study aimed to identify deaths and their causes in patients treated with sertindole.
   Methods Sertindole-treated patients in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Hungary, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom were identified and their vital status ascertained. Eventual cause of death and patient and treatment characteristics were ascertained. A nested case-control study compared on-treatment cardiac or unexplained deaths with randomly selected survivors matched on age and gender for potential risk factors.
   Results Eight thousand six hundred eight patients were identified as having initiated treatment with sertindole, for a total 3819 person-years exposure. Thirty-five had died since (all-cause mortality rate 0.92 per 100 person-years exposed). Of these, 15 (43%) had been previously reported to the regulatory authorities. Eight deaths were suicides, of which 2 (25%) had been previously reported; 11 were cardiac deaths, of which 8 (73%) had been reported. On average, patients who died because of cardiac disorders were older, and patients who committed suicide were younger than the other patients who died. The nested case-control study revealed that patients receiving sertindole were at a higher risk of premature cardiac or unexplained death if they had hypertension or other cardiovascular disorders associated with diabetes or metabolic disorder.
   Conclusion Overall and cardiovascular death rates were similar or lower than those observed in premarketing clinical trials. There was a very high reporting rate of all-cause and cardiovascular deaths that could have contributed to the regulatory alert. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Objective To compare the drowning mortality rates and proportion of deaths of each intent among all drowning deaths in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in 2012-2014.
   Design A population-based cross-sectional study.
   Setting 32 OECD countries.
   Participants Individuals in OECD countries who died from drowning.
   Main outcome measures Drowning mortality rates (deaths per 100000 population) and proportion (%) of deaths of each intent (ie, unintentional intent, intentional self-harm, assault, undetermined intent and all intents combined) among all drowning deaths.
   Results Countries with the highest drowning mortality rates (deaths per 100000 population) were Estonia (3.53), Japan (3.49) and Greece (2.40) for unintentional intent; Ireland (0.96), Belgium (0.96) and Korea (0.89) for intentional self-harm; Austria (0.57), Korea (0.56) and Hungary (0.44) for undetermined intent and Japan (4.35), Estonia (3.70) and Korea (2.73) for all intents combined. Korea ranked 12th and 3rd for unintentional intent and all intents combined, respectively. By contrast, Belgium ranked 2nd and 15th for intentional self-harm and all intents combined, respectively. The proportion of deaths of each intent among all drowning deaths in each country varied greatly: from 26.2% in Belgium to 96.8% in Chile for unintentional intent; 0.7% in Mexico to 57.4% in Belgium for intentional self-harm; 0.0% in nine countries to 4.9% in Mexico for assault and 0.0% in Israel and Turkey to 38.3% in Austria for undetermined intent.
   Conclusions A large variation in the practice of classifying undetermined intent in drowning deaths across countries was noted and this variation hinders valid international comparisons of intent-specific (unintentional and intentional self-harm) drowning mortality rates.

AB Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are of special concern in the pediatric and adolescent population because of high incidence, mortality, and potential years of life lost (PYLL). Knowledge on causes and mortality trends is essential for effective prevention. The aim of this study was to analyze the long-term trends and causes of TBI-related mortality between 1980 and 2012 in the pediatric and adolescent populations of Austria. Death certificate data on TBI-related deaths of children and adolescents 0-19 years of age and exact population numbers were obtained from the Austrian Statistical Office. Five age groups were created. Mortality trends and causes of TBI were analyzed. PYLL were used to indicate the public health impact. Of 5319 identified TBI-related deaths, 75% were male victims. The annual mortality rates per 100,000 between 1980 and 2012 decreased from 25 to 2.6 in males, from 8.5 to 1.0 in females, and from 16.9 to 1.8 in the total population. Those 15-19 years of age had the highest mortalities, followed by 0-2 years of age. Over 80% of deaths were caused by accidents, inflicted TBIs were most common in those 0-2 years of age, and traffic accidents in those 15-19 years of age. In the studied period, 295,793 PYLL could be attributed to TBIs. Measures to prevent traffic accidents contributed significantly to the decrease of mortality and PYLL, especially in 15-to 19-year-old men. Causes and trends of TBI-related mortality exhibit age-group-specific patterns, and this knowledge could contribute to planning further preventive action to reduce TBI fatalities in the studied population.

AB Background: In recent decades, the general public has become increasingly receptive toward a legislation that allows active voluntary euthanasia (AVE). The purpose of this study was to survey the current attitude towards AVE within the Austrian population and to identify explanatory factors in the areas of socio-demographics, personal experiences with care, and ideological orientation. A further objective was to examine differences depending on the type of problem formulation (abstract vs. situational) for the purpose of measuring attitude.
   Methods: A representative cross-sectional study was conducted across the Austrian population. Data were acquired from 1,000 individuals aged 16 years and over based on telephone interviews (CATI). For the purpose of measuring attitude toward AVE, two different problem formulations (abstract vs. situational) were juxtaposed.
   Results: The abstract question about active voluntary euthanasia was answered negatively by 28.8%, while 71.2% opted in favour of AVE or were undecided. Regression analyses showed rejection of AVE was positively correlated with number of adults and children in the household, experience with care of seriously ill persons, a conservative worldview, and level of education. Mean or high family income was associated with lower levels of rejection. No independent correlations were found for variables such as sex, age, political orientation, self-rated health, and experiences with care of terminally ill patients. Correlation for the situational problem formulation was weaker and included fewer predictors than for the abstract question.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that factors relating to an individual's interpersonal living situation and his/her cognitive convictions might be important determinants of the attitude toward AVE. If and to the extent that personal care experience plays a role, it is rather associated with rejection than with acceptance of AVE.

AB Background Compared to their indigenous peers, migrant children and adolescents are at increased risk for mental health problems. The aim of our study was to compare psychological disorders of children and adolescents with Turkish migration background and their native Austrian peers. Methods We analysed 302 children and adolescents aged between 7 and 18 years. The sample consisted of 100 Austrian and 100 Turkish outpatients with mental health problems, and 102 healthy controls, 52 with Austrian and 50 with Turkish background, recruited from various Viennese local child and youth centres. Results Native patients had more frequently externalizing problems (42.1%) compared to the Turkish-speaking sample (28%). However, in the control group, Turkish-speaking children and adolescents had higher levels of internalizing, depressive and anxiety symptoms compared to their native peers. Conclusions We found noticeable differences in psychological problems among children and adolescents with and without migration background. We assume that migration-related stress factors are responsible for these differences. Also, children and adolescents with migration background seek for psychological help less frequently than their indigenous peers.

AB Within the field of veterinary medicine the gender distribution has changed, since most graduates are now females. Studies show that female veterinarians represent a vulnerable group for stress and stress-related illnesses. The goal of the study was to identify typical profiles of stress management strategies and to clarify if vets are well-equipped to cope with occupational stressors. Within a cross-sectional design 78 female veterinarians from Austria and Germany were surveyed using a self-report test-battery assessing twenty different coping styles. Statistical analysis included one sample t-tests and Cohen's d as a concurrent effect size measure. The results showed that female veterinarians are significantly more likely to use negative coping styles for their stress e.g., rumination (t(74) = 6.733, p = < 0.001, d = 0.726) or escapism (t(72) = 2.173, p = 0.033, d = 0.281) when compared to the norm population. Amongst other studies these findings contribute to a systematic diagnosis which is necessary for the development and implementation of standardized stress management interventions for the veterinary education and training e.g., courses for improving communication and stress management skills and regular supervision or intervision (exchange with professional peers). Due to existing stigmatization concerning mental health, low-barrier counseling services should be provided for veterinarians who already feel stressed.

AB Background: Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a subtype of recurrent depressive or bipolar disorder that is characterized by regular onset and remission of affective episodes at the same time of the year. The aim of the present study was to provide epidemiological data and data on the socioeconomic impact of SAD in the general population of Austria.
   Methods: We conducted a computer-assisted telephone interview in 910 randomly selected subjects (577 females and 333 males) using the Seasonal Health Questionnaire (SHQ), the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ), and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Telephone numbers were randomly drawn from all Austrian telephone books and transformed using the random last digits method. The last birthday method was employed to choose the target person for the interviews.
   Results: Out of our subjects, 2.5% fulfilled criteria for the seasonal pattern specifier according to DSM-5 and 2.4% (95% CI = 1.4-3.5%) were diagnosed with SAD. When applying the ICD-10 criteria 1.9% (95% CI = 0.9-2.8%) fulfilled SAD diagnostic criteria. The prevalence of fall-winter depression according to the Kasper-Rosenthal criteria was determined to be 3.5%. The criteria was fulfilled by 15.1% for subsyndromal SAD (s-SAD). We did not find any statistically significant gender differences in prevalence rates. When using the DSM-5 as a gold standard for the diagnosis of SAD, diagnosis derived from the SPAQ yielded a sensitivity of 31.8% and a specificity of 97.2%. Subjects with SAD had significantly higher scores on the SDS and higher rates of sick leave and days with reduced productivity than healthy subjects.
   Conclusions: Prevalence estimates for SAD with the SHQ are lower than with the SPAQ. Our data are indicative of the substantial burden of disease and the socioeconomic impact of SAD. This epidemiological data shows a lack of gender differences in SAD prevalence. The higher rates of females in clinical SAD samples might, at least in part, be explained by lower help seeking behaviour in males. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

SO ISRAEL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL

DT Editorial Material
DE Holocaust; antisemitism; gastroenterology; medical history; medical
   ethics
AB It is common knowledge that in addition to the slaughter of millions of innocent civilians, Nazism caused direct damage to patient care by euthanasia of the handicapped, gruesome human experimentation, and ethnic cleansing of German medical schools. In gastroenterology, 53 prominent academicians living in Nazi-occupied Europe were persecuted by the Nazis. Prior studies analyzed this persecution as it related to gastroenterologists rather than to patient care. This study reports, however, that Nazi persecution led to a delay of more than one generation in the clinical application of major inventions by these gastroenterologists. These included flexible fiberoptic endoscopy, which was delayed from 1930 to 1957. Fiberoptic transmission was invented by Heinrich Lamm in 1930. Lamm was exiled from Nazi Germany in 1936, and this technique was clinically applied to endoscopy by Hirschowitz only in 1957. Another innovation was fecal occult blood testing for early colon cancer detection, which was devised by Ismar Boas before 1938. Boas committed suicide under Nazi oppression in 1938 and this modality was clinically applied by Greegor only in 1967. The acceptance of refugees from Nazi Germany or Austria into America or into the future State of Israel helped mitigate some of this damage. For example, eight eminent academic gastroenterologists who fled Nazi-occupied countries to then mandatory Palestine made major contributions to the development of academic gastroenterology in the soon-to-be established State of Israel.

AB Social and economic policies are inextricably linked with population health outcomes in Europe, yet few datasets are able to fully explore and compare this relationship across European countries. The European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) survey aims to address this gap using microdata on income, living conditions and health. EU-SILC contains both cross-sectional and longitudinal elements, with nationally representative samples of individuals 16 years and older in 28 European Union member states as well as Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. Data collection began in 2003 in Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Greece, Luxembourg and Austria, with subsequent expansion across Europe. By 2011, all 28 EU member states, plus three others, were included in the dataset. Although EU-SILC is administered by Eurostat, the data are output-harmonized so that countries are required to collect specified data items but are free to determine sampling strategies for data collection purposes. EU-SILC covers approximately 500 000 European residents for its cross-sectional survey annually. Whereas aggregated data from EU-SILC are publicly available [http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/income-and-living-conditions/data/main-tables], microdata are only available to research organizations subject to approval by Eurostat. Please refer to [http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/microdata/eu_silc] for further information regarding microdata access.

AB Objective: The aim of this repeated cross-sectional study was to compare patients from a psychiatric intensive care unit (PICU) over >> 30 years regarding their diagnostic and therapeutic characteristics.
   Method: Three samples including 100 consecutive inpatients each from the Viennese PICU were submitted to a chart review: sample no. 1 from the years 1985/86, no. 2 from 1995/96 and no. 3 from 2007/08.
   Results: Changes in referral modes were associated with a decrease of patients with substance induced disorders and an increase of patients with affective disorders over time. The rate of admissions after accidents and suicides was stable. The use of cranial MRI increased, while intravenous psychopharmacotherapy and parenteral nutrition decreased. Involuntary admission occurred in 43% and in 37% of patients physical restraints were necessary. We saw a shift from tricyclic antidepressants to SSRIs and SNRIs from sample 1 to 3. Likewise, we observed the emergence of atypical antipsychotics and a reduction of use of typical neuroleptics mainly from sample 2 to 3. The percentage of patients receiving benzodiazepines increased over time, while the mean dosage of benzodiazepines decreased. 7% of patients received electroconvulsive therapy.
   Conclusions: The changes over time in our samples reflect the medical progress made during the last decades. Future studies should focus on evaluation of efficacy of psychiatric intensive care using standardized measurements. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Various Studies show a high prevalence of mental disorders among homeless people. So far most of these Studies deal solely with single men, mainly affected by homelessness. Few data exist for women, children, adolescents and whole families that are more and more affected by poverty and homelessness. This study, conducted in Innsbruck/Austria, determined the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among homeless adolescents. The adolescents were recruited in a counselling centre and homeless shelter specifically founded for homeless youth. Mental disorders were diagnosed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SKID-I). 40 adolescents and Young adults ranging from 14-23 years (mean 17,9 years) were included in the study. The results show that 58% of the homeless adolescents were exposed to continuous violence in their families and that violence was a major reason for them to leave home. The overall prevalence of diagnosed psychiatric disorders was 80% in the whole sample; the leading disorder was substance abuse/dependence (65%), followed by mood disorders (42,5%), anxiety disorders (17,5%) and eating disorders (17,5%). 57,5% of the adolescents had a history of self-harm and 25% reported at least one suicide attempt. Duration of homelessness had the greatest influence oil the prevalence of mental disorders. Longer duration of homelessness was associated with a higher risk of psychiatric disorder or self-harm. These results demonstrate the Urgent need for early psychosocial and psychiatric help for homeless adolescents.

TI Contemplating Medicine During the Third Reich: Scaffolding Professional
   Identity Formation for Medical Students
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB Problem
   The moral failures of physicians and the medical establishment in Germany and Austria during the Third Reich challenge medicine and medical education in a way few other events do. They compel medical educators to ensure that lessons learned from contemplating medicine during the Third Reich be integrated into current and future physicians' professional identities. Most health professions education programs, however, have not adopted this study domain in their curricula.
   Approach
   The authors describe a new curriculum module-" The Holocaust and Medicine"-and its implementation in October 2013 at Bar-Ilan University Faculty of Medicine in the Galilee, Safed, Israel, as a requirement for all medical students (starting with the class of 2017). This innovative module integrates historical facts, guided reflection, flipped classroom pedagogy, and program evaluation efforts. It spans 20 months of the preclinical curriculum, embedded within a doctoring course and a medical humanities longitudinal course and integrated within the clinical sciences blocks.
   Outcomes
   The evaluation approach will seek to measure changes in learners' knowledge and attitudes, capture their experience with the module, and assess the module's contribution to their identities as future healers.
   Next Steps
   This module aims to sensitize learners to medicine's fundamental dilemmas (e.g., prejudice, assisted reproduction and suicide, physicians in war), ideally enhancing critical reflection on the potential danger of "slippery slopes." The authors propose that contemplation of medicine after the Holocaust and the implications for contemporary practice should be an integral component of health professions education to promote humanistic, ethically responsible practice.

AB The establishment of the exact time and cause of death plays an important role in criminal investigation and criminal law. In violent deaths, where a suspicion that a criminal offence has been committed arises, investigation often focuses on a specific suspect on the basis of a clearly established time and cause of death, or on the examination of other important circumstances surrounding the death in order to close the circle of alleged suspects. An exact post-mortem diagnosis of the time and cause of death requires multidisciplinary cooperation between the police, who establish relevant circumstances surrounding the death, and a physician, who performs a post-mortem examination of the body. This is why the present paper considers post-mortem diagnostics both as part of criminal differential diagnosis and as part of medical post-mortem diagnostics. The competent and quality performance of post-mortem diagnostics is in many ways affected by organisational and cognitive factors.
   This study presents an analysis of legal arrangements governing the work of post-mortem examination services in Germany, Austria, Croatia and Slovenia, and identifies good and bad practices on the basis of professional opinions expressed by experts working in the field of criminal investigation and forensic medicine in comparable countries. Results and findings represent a useful basis for the formulation of a proposal for a new model of post-mortem examination service presented in the last section of this paper. The proposed model provides a basis for achieving qualitative progress in the field of post-mortem diagnostics not only in Slovenia but also in other countries of continental Europe.

AB Objective: The highest suicide rates are found among the elderly, therefore suicidal ideation is prevalent in long-term care facilities. Despite these facts and multiplying losses, most residents show no signs of suicidal ideation. There is a lack of information on which factors protect against suicidal thoughts among the elderly. The aim of this pilot study was to assess the prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideation with risk and protective factors among older residential care home residents in Vienna.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 15 Viennese residential care homes. Participants completed a self-report questionnaire containing sociodemographic factors, physical health, mental health, and protective factors like optimistic attributional style, self-efficacy, and internal locus of control as well as satisfaction with life and were finally asked about active and passive suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
   Results: With the voluntary participation of 129 residents aged 60 years or more, active suicidal ideation during the last month was identified in 7% of the elderly, 11% reported active suicidal ideation during the past year. Primarily, we found that protective factors like internal locus of control, self-efficacy, and satisfaction with life were important single predictors of active suicidal ideation during the past month. Depressive symptoms and current psychotherapeutic treatment were additionally important predictors.
   Conclusions: Suicidal ideation is prevalent in Viennese residential care homes; consequently it is necessary to recognize and treat suicidal ideation in an adequate way. Our findings suggest that research and prevention strategies could not merely target risk, but also include protective factors. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

   Reich; Reparation
AB This sociodemographic study focuses on the disenfranchisement, expulsion and persecution of pathologists in the Third Reich - a group that has, until now, received little systematic attention in scholarly research. The paper attempts to determine the number of pathologists who suffered persecution, the characteristics they shared, and the effects the repression had on their lives - both in the period from 1933 to 1945 and in the post-war period.
   The study is based on primary sources from numerous archives as well as on a systematic re-analysis of published secondary literature on the history of Nazi medicine. A total of 89 disenfranchised pathologists were identified and have been included. The vast majority of these pathologists (90%) were persecuted due to their Jewish ancestry or their relation to Jews. A good two-thirds of these pathologists were employed at a university until their disenfranchisement.
   For two-thirds of these pathologists (n = 62; 70%), documentation of emigration was found. Twenty-four pathologists remained in their home country; of these, five died in concentration camps and two others committed suicide.
   The preferred country for direct immigration was the United States (n = 19), followed by Great Britain (n = 13). Most of these pathologists were able to establish themselves professionally in their destination country, and little inclination to return to Germany after 1945 was shown. The reasons for this were a lack of career options in their home country, the lack of a welcoming culture among colleagues and universities, and the stigmatizing experiences of individual pathologists had during academic appointments and reparations proceedings in Germany. However, especially in recent decades and in part posthumously, these pathologists are being granted honorary, intangible recognition in Germany and Austria. Even though this recognition can no longer provide tangible reparations, it is nevertheless a sign of a gradual change in consciousness.

AB Background: Death due to cardiovascular disease occurs more frequently in prisons than the national average. Due to close surveillance 24h/day, the ability to reach the patient within 3 min and time consuming access for the EMS crews, it was hypothesised that the deployment of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) might make improvements regarding Call-to-the-Fi rst-AED- Prompt (CTP) interval and formed the aim of this study.
   Methods: Our investigation was analysed on an intention to treat basis and conducted in a prospective, open and observational design. As the primary outcome, the CTP-intervals were compared to the arrival intervals of the EMS. As a secondary outcome, an analysis of all deceased inmates was described.
   Results: The average daily population of inmates in Austrian correctional facilities is 7714. During a period of 13 months, 10 instances in which an AED was activated and electrodes attached to a collapsed inmate, were reported. The CTP-intervat (median +/- S.D.) was 2.3 +/- 1.6 S.D. min. It took the EMS 10.0 +/- 4.3 S.D. min. to arrive at the patient's side. Four out of 10 cases of cardiac arrest occurred due to myocardial infarction. Of 39 deceased inmates, a post mortern examination was completed in 34 cases. In 13 cases, cardiovascular disease was the cause of death.
   Discussion: The main finding was a four-fold reduction of the CTP-interval. This fact indicates the potential improvements which could be achieved with the deployment of AEDs. Our secondary objective revealed that death due to cardiovascular disease was found in a high proportion and could be considered to be a strong incentive to initiate programmes to counter cardiovascular death in prison.

AB While Nazism is almost universally recognized as a great evil, control of science and medicine by the totalitarian Nazi state might be viewed as increasing efficiency. Scientific methods are applied to semiquantitatively analyze the effects of Nazism on medical progress in gastroenterology to document its pernicious effects, and to honor outstanding gastroenterologists persecuted or murdered by the Nazis. This is a retrospective, quasi-case-controlled study. To disprove the null hypothesis that Nazism was efficient, retarded progress in gastroenterology is demonstrated by (1) enumerating the loss to Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1944 due to violent death, incarceration, or forced exile of key researchers in gastroenterology, defined by authorship of at least one book or 10 articles in peer-reviewed journals or other outstanding scholarship; (2) demonstrating a statistically significantly greater loss in Nazi Germany than in non-Nazi (Weimar German Republic from 1921 to 1932) or anti-Nazi (democratic America from 1933 to 1944) control groups; and (3) demonstrating that each loss was directly due to Nazism (murder, incarceration, or exile due to documented threat of violence/death or revocation of medical license). Sources of error in analyzing events from 70 years ago are described. Nazi Germany and Nazi-occupied Europe gained 0 and lost 53 key gastroenterology researchers, including 32 lost due to forced exile, 11 murdered by the Nazis, 5 lost due to suicide under threat of violence, 3 in hiding from the Gestapo, and 2 for other reasons. Fifty-two of the gastroenterologists were persecuted solely because they were Jewish or of Jewish descent and one because he was a Christian anti-Nazi Polish patriot. Particularly severe losses occurred in endoscopy. The loss in Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1944 was significantly greater than that in non-Nazi Germany and Austria from 1921 to 1932 (53 versus 4; odds ratio = 25.27; 95% CI: 9.01-70.48; P < 0.0001) and was significantly greater than that in anti-Nazi America from 1933 to 1944 (53 versus 0; odds ratio > 104.0; 95% CI: 17.62-608.95; P < 0.0001). Lost physicians in Nazi Germany (with reasons for loss) included Ismar Boas, the father of modern gastroenterology (suicide after medical license revoked); Hans Popper, the father of hepatopathology (fled impending arrest); Rudolph Nissen, the father of antireflux surgery (fled after job dismissal); Rudolph Schindler, the father of semiflexible endoscopy (fled after incarceration); Heinrich Lamm, the first to experimentally demonstrate fiberoptic transmission and the first to suggest its applicability for gastroscopy (fled after medical license revoked); Hermann Strauss, a pioneer in rigid sigmoidoscopy (suicide in a concentration camp); A.A.H. van den Bergh, who discovered the van den Bergh reaction to differentiate indirect from direct bilirubin (died in hiding in Nazi-occupied Holland); and Kurt Isselbacher, subsequently the Chief of Gastroenterology at Harvard Medical School (fled in childhood after a grandfather murdered by Nazis). All four refugee physicians who were reexposed to Nazi domination, after a regime change in their country of refuge, fled again or committed suicide. The Nazi damage to German and Austrian gastroenterology was immense, e.g., 13 of 14 major international discoveries in diagnostic gastroscopy were made by Germans or Austrians before the Third Reich, versus only 1 of 8 subsequently (odds ratio = 91; 95% CI: 3.58-13,877.61; P < 0.001).
   Eighteen (34%) of the persecuted physicians immigrated to America, thereby contriuting to the postwar flourishing of American gastroenterology, particularly gastrointestinal endoscopy. In conclusion, the Third Reich severely retarded and reversed medical progress in gastroenterology in Germany. The inefficiency of Nazism, as herein documented, is attributable to the Nazi commitment of so much human, economic, and social resources to the military to wage wars of aggression, to the secret police (Gestapo) to pursue and exterminate perceived internal enemies, and to the Party to control and regiment civil society. Most inefficient is the incarceration, exile, or murder of Germany's most trained physicians and talented researchers because of religion or race, sociological parameters that are irrelevant to productivity. Intimidation and repression stifle scientific scholarship and creativity. This work disproves the myth of the efficiency of Nazism, and like tyrannies, by the novel application of semiquantitative scientific methodology to assess causality in medical history.

AB Objective: This study searched for gender differences in filicidal offense characteristics and associated variables.
   Methods: In this binational register-based study all filicide perpetrators (75 mothers and 45 fathers) and their crimes in Austria and Finland 1995-2005 were examined for putative gender differences. The assessed variables were associated with the offense characteristics, the offenders' socioeconomic and criminal history, and related stressful events.
   Results: Mothers had previously committed violent offenses less often than fathers (5% vs. 28%, p < 0.001) and they were less often employed (27% vs. 49%, p < 0.05). Mothers' victims were on average younger than those of fathers; median ages of the victims were 3.4 and 6.1 years, respectively (p < 0.001). Fathers were more often intoxicated during the offense (11% vs. 42%, p < 0.001) and also used shooting as the method of operation more often than mothers (5% vs. 27%, p < 0.001). Mothers used drowning, criminal negligence, and poisoning more often than fathers. Fathers' motives were more impulsive in nature (13% vs. 41%, p < 0.001). After the killing, mothers tried to get rid of the body more often than fathers (25% vs. 7%, p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Fathers who commit filicide may represent at least two subgroups, the one not unlike the common homicide offender; the other, the overloaded, working and suicidal father. Mothers may include several types of offenders, one of which is the neonaticide offender. More detailed descriptions and, therefore, more research are needed.
   Practice implications: Distressed parents and families need support and health care personnel, social work and other officials need to be alert to notice fatigued parents' signs of despair, especially when several stressful experiences amass. Straightforward enquiry to the situation and even practical and psychological help may be needed for enhanced protection of children. The role of employers should also be discussed in relation to the welfare of working parents. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The individual capacity to love (CTL) has been linked to various mental health parameters and is considered to be an important outcome parameter of psychotherapeutic treatment. However, empirical examinations of the concept have not been conducted up to now. The aim of this study was to develop a valid and reliable instrument for the assessment of CTL [Capacity to Love Inventory (CTL-I)] as a trait of personality, which is shown to be related to clinically relevant symptoms and conditions.
   Method: Four independent healthy samples in Austria (n = 547, n = 174, and n = 85) and Poland (n = 240) were assessed by a prototype of the CTL-I and its final shorter version in a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Internal consistency of the total questionnaire and each subscale was assessed by Cronbach alpha. External validity was measured against Beck Depression Inventory, Quality of Relationship Inventory, Sociosexual Orientation Inventory, Pathological Narcissism Inventory, and Narcissistic Personality Inventory according to the theoretical framework of the CTL concept. Further test-retest reliability was assessed.
   Results: The CFA confirmed 41 items in six dimensions: Interest in the life project of the other, Basic trust, Humility and gratitude, Common ego ideal, Permanence of sexual passion, and Acceptance of loss/jealousy/mourning. The Cronbach alphas of the total CTL-I and its subscales ranged between 0.67 and 0.90 in all samples, suggesting a valid construct. The CTL-I was moderately positively associated with quality of relationship (Support r = 0.63, Conflict r = -0.66, and Depth r = 0.66) and inversely associated with symptoms of depression (r = -0.37), pathological narcissism (r = -0.29) and promiscuity (r = -0.42). The test-retest reliability of the total CTL-I was high with r = 0.81, suggesting the stability of answers over time.
   Conclusion: The proposed 41-item version of the CTL-I is a psychometrically sound and validated instrument measuring six dimensions of the concept of the CTL. The reported negative associations with clinically relevant parameters such as depression, pathological narcissism and promiscuity as well as associations with relationship qualities such as conflicts, support, and depth warrant its future use in burdened populations including couples in clinical settings.

AB Background: Mental health problems and risk behaviours among young people are of great public health concern. Consequently, within the VII Framework Programme, the European Commission funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted in eleven European countries, with Sweden as the coordinating centre, and was designed to identify an effective way to promote mental health and reduce suicidality and risk taking behaviours among adolescents.
   Objective: To describe the methodological and field procedures in the SEYLE RCT among adolescents, as well as to present the main characteristics of the recruited sample.
   Methods: Analyses were conducted to determine: 1) representativeness of study sites compared to respective national data; 2) response rate of schools and pupils, drop-out rates from baseline to 3 and 12 month follow-up, 3) comparability of samples among the four Intervention Arms; 4) properties of the standard scales employed: Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-II), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (Z-SAS), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), World Health Organization Well-Being Scale (WHO-5).
   Results: Participants at baseline comprised 12,395 adolescents (M/F: 5,529/6,799; mean age=14.9 +/- 0.9) from Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain. At the 3 and 12 months follow up, participation rates were 87.3% and 79.4%, respectively. Demographic characteristics of participating sites were found to be reasonably representative of their respective national population. Overall response rate of schools was 67.8%. All scales utilised in the study had good to very good internal reliability, as measured by Cronbach's alpha (BDI-II: 0.864; Z-SAS: 0.805; SDQ: 0.740; WHO-5: 0.799).
   Conclusions: SEYLE achieved its objective of recruiting a large representative sample of adolescents within participating European countries. Analysis of SEYLE data will shed light on the effectiveness of important interventions aimed at improving adolescent mental health and well-being, reducing risk-taking and self-destructive behaviour and preventing suicidality.

AB Background Previous trials have shown that pridopidine might reduce motor impairment in patients with Huntington's disease. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether higher doses of pridopidine than previously tested reduce motor symptoms in a dose-dependent manner while maintaining acceptable safety and tolerability.
   Methods PRIDE-HD was a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2, dose-ranging study in adults (aged >= 21 years) with Huntington's disease at outpatient clinics in 53 sites across 12 countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA). Eligible patients had clinical onset after age 18 years, 36 or more cytosine-adenine-guanine repeats in the huntingtin gene, motor symptoms (Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score [UHDRS-TMS] >= 25 points), and reduced independence (UHDRS independence score <= 90%). Patients were randomly assigned (1: 1: 1: 1: 1) with centralised interactive-response technology to receive one of four doses of pridopidine (45, 67.5, 90, or 112.5 mg) or placebo orally twice a day for 52 weeks. Randomisation was stratified within centres by neuroleptic drug use. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in the UHDRS-TMS from baseline to 26 weeks, which was assessed in all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment (full analysis set). Participants and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2013-001888-23) and ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT02006472).
   Findings Between Feb 13, 2014, and July 5, 2016, 408 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive placebo (n=82) or pridopidine 45 mg (n=81), 67.5 mg (n=82), 90 mg (n=81), or 112.5 mg (n=82) twice daily for 26 weeks. The full analysis set included 397 patients (81 in the placebo group, 75 in the 45 mg group, 79 in the 67.5 mg group, 81 in the 90 mg group, and 81 in the 112.5 mg group). Pridopidine did not significantly change the UHDRS-TMS at 26 weeks compared with placebo at any dose. The most frequent adverse events across all groups were diarrhoea, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, falls, headache, insomnia, and anxiety. The most common treatment-related adverse events were insomnia, diarrhoea, nausea, and dizziness. Serious adverse events occurred in the pridopidine groups only and were most frequently falls (n=5), suicide attempt (n= 4), suicidal ideation (n=3), head injury (n=3), and aspiration pneumonia (n=3). No new safety or tolerability concerns emerged in this study. One death in the pridopidine 112.5 mg group due to aspiration pneumonia was considered to be possibly related to the study drug.
   Interpretation Pridopidine did not improve the UHDRS-TMS at week 26 compared with placebo and, thus, the results of secondary or tertiary analyses in previous trials were not replicated. A potentially strong placebo effect needs to be ruled out in future studies.
