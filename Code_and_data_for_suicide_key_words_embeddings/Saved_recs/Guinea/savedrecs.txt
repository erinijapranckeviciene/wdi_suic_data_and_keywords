AB The inhibitory effects of 2-bromoethylamine (2-BEA), a derivative of ethylamine, on guinea pig lung semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SAO) have been studied. Preincubation with 2-BEA time-dependently inhibited SSAO activity. The mode of the initial phase of inhibition was competitive, with a K(i) value of 52 muM. After preincubation at 37degreesC for 2 h, the inhibition was noncompetitive and irreversible, as there was no recovery of SSAO activity by dilution of the inhibited samples. Kinetic analyses confirmed previous results with rat lung SSAO that 2-BEA is a suicide SSAO inactivator with a dissociation constant of 42 muM. This latter value is similar to that of the K(i) value (52 muM) for the reversible phase of inhibition by 2-BEA. Addition of the nucleophilic compound 2-mercaptoethanol could not reduce the SSAO inhibition, indicating that inactivation could not be prevented by trapping the enzymatic reaction product from 2-BEA. This finding clearly indicates that the reaction product should not diffuse away from its site of genesis and agrees with one of the characteristics of suicide inhibitors. This conclusively excludes the possibility of an affinity-labeling mechanism. (C) Prons Science 2003. All rights reserved.

TI Cosmology, resources, and landscape: Agencies of the dead and the living
   in Duna, Papua New Guinea
SO ETHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Among the Duna people of Papua New Guinea, ideas about the dead and the living are intertwined through cosmological perceptions of, and ritual interactions with, the landscape. These ideas change to accommodate and deal with new issues that arise. Malu (narratives of origins) link kin with land and to spirit figures. In the context of colonial and post-colonial mining for minerals and drilling for oil, malu have been reformulated as a way of claiming compensation from mining companies. Central to the Duna perspective is the notion that the agencies and substances of the dead and the living are interlinked. An act of suicide may lead to demands for compensation as a result of the suicide being caused by "shaming": the agency of the dead person therefore lives on. In images of this sort, the connection between the living and the dead is vividly portrayed.

TI Endogamy and suicide: An observation-based hypothesis
SO MEDICAL HYPOTHESES
LA English
DT Article
ID RISK-FACTORS; CONSANGUINITY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; POPULATION; BEHAVIOR; SPAIN
AB Suicide is a complex and multifactorial behavior, which is likely the result of distinct pathways in different individuals or groups. Endogamy has been associated with numerous diseases, including behavioral disorders. Here, we discuss the hypothesis of endogamy as one mechanism facilitating high rates of suicide in some small and isolated groups of people across the world. To support our hypothesis, we describe four geographically and culturally distinct populations (the Aguarunas of Peru, the Vaqueiros of Spain, the Baruyas of New Guinea, and the Palawans of the Philippines), which present the following characteristics: (1) a high level of isolation and endogamy; (2) very high rates of suicide restricted to one group with (3) adjacent groups of similar origin and culture displaying low rates of suicide. Within these four distinct populations, endogamy could act in one isolated group as the amplifier of both selected genetic risk alleles and microcultural values (e.g. suicide as an acceptable solution), beyond cultural and genetic traits shared by the whole population (and therefore found in all groups). Genetic and microcultural risk factors are transmitted through close kinship and imitation/modeling, and could interact to increase the frequency of vulnerable individuals leading, in turn, to heightened rates of suicide. Culture could sometimes additionally act by generating stressful conditions for some individuals (e.g. lower social status and maltreatment). In contrast to endogamy, suicide motives (notably interpersonal conflicts) and mental disorders appear to be universal risk factors. More investigation of this endogamy hypothesis is necessary, which could represent a singular case of gene-culture co-transmission and shed light on particular conditions of suicide genesis.

AB Various mammalian tissues contain a tissue-bound amine oxidizing enzyme distinct from mitochondrial outer membrane enzyme, monoamine oxidase (MAO, EC 1.4.3.4), termed semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO, EC 1.4.3.6). An increase in SSAO activity was found in patients suffering from vascular disorders such as diabetes and diabetic complications. It has previously been shown that 2-bromoethylamine (2-BEA) is a potent, and selective suicidal inhibitor of tissue-bound SSAO. The aim of this study was to investigate the interaction of this suicidal SSAO inhibitor with the tissue-bound enzyme in guinea pig lung, kidney, stomach, and heart homogenates. The conditions necessary for this inhibitor to titrate the concentrations of this enzyme were also determined. 2-BEA appears to interact with SSAO, as reported previously for this enzyme from different sources, in a manner consistent with an irreversible, "suicide" reaction. Because of this property, 2-BEA could be used to titrate the concentrations of SSAO active centers in these tissues under the appropriate conditions employed. Although some possible non-specific binding of the inhibitor to sites other than the active center of the enzyme, metabolism of this inhibitor and/or presence of enzyme subtypes was hypothesized, the molecular characteristics of SSAO in these tissues (Km, Vmax values, enzyme efficiencies, approximate enzyme concentrations, and molecular turnover numbers) towards the substrate kynuramine (0.1 mM) at pH 7.4 and 37 degreesC have been estimated.

AB This paper reviews the literature on deliberate self-burning (DSB) and compares patterns in various countries. Fifty-five studies of deliberate self-harm or suicide by fire published in the last 20 years were reviewed. They reported on 3351 cases of DSB, including 2296 deaths. India had the highest absolute number of cases, the highest fatality rate, and the highest contribution of self-harm to burns admissions. The highest reported incidence was from Sri Lanka. Male victims generally predominated in Western countries, and females in the Middle East and the Indian sub-continent. Patients were grossly 10 years older in Europe than in Asia. The use and nature of fire accelerants, the possible roles of ethnicity, religion/faith and imitation are discussed. Three broad groups of victims were identified: psychiatric patients (Western and Middle-Eastern countries); those committing DSB for personal reasons (India, Sri Lanka, Papua-New Guinea, Zimbabwe); and those who are politically motivated (India, South Korea). Self-mutilators and self-immolators seem to be fairly distinct groups of people. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

AB The existence of a close relation between presynaptic inhibitory alpha(2)-adrenoceptor and mu-opioid receptor pathways is well established. Such interplay may occur during chronic conditions that give rise to neuroadaptive changes involving both receptor systems. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of chronic treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant drug, desipramine, on alpha(2)-adrenoceptors and mu-opioid receptors in the guinea pig brain. Guinea pigs were treated with 10 mg/kg desipramine, injected i.p. for 21 days, every 24 h. The levels of expression of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors and L-opioid receptors, the G protein receptor regulatory kinase, GRK2/3 and signal transduction inhibitory G proteins in synaptosomes of the guinea pig hippocampus and cortex were evaluated by immunoblotting. Quantitative analysis of alpha(2)-adrenoceptor and mu-opioid receptor mRNA levels has been carried out by competitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The expression levels of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors and mu-opioid receptors and the respective mRNAs were found unchanged in the cortex, after chronic desipramine treatment. In these experimental conditions alpha(2)-adrenoceptor and mu-opioid receptor levels decreased, while the relevant transcripts increased, in the hippocampus. GRK2/3 levels remained unchanged and increased, respectively, in the cortex and the hippocampus, after chronic exposure to desipramine. In the same experimental conditions, G alpha(i1), G alpha(i2), G alpha(o), and G alpha(z) levels remained unchanged, while G alpha(i3) levels decreased, in the cortex; whereas, G alpha(i1), G alpha(i2) and G alpha(i3) levels significantly increased, and G alpha(o) and G alpha(z) levels; remained unchanged, in the hippocampus. On the whole, the present data suggest that alpha(2)-adrenoceptor and mu-opioid receptor expression and transcription are similarly influenced by chronic treatment with desipramine, in the guinea pig cortex and hippocampus. Furthermore, alterations in the levels of regulatory GRK2/3 and of inhibitory signal transduction G proteins, relevant to activation of both receptor pathways, have been documented. The distinct pattern of adaptations of the different protein studied in response to chronic desipramine treatment in both regions is discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To develop a prophylactic recombinant HPV58L1-attenuated Shigella live vector vaccine and evaluate its protective efficacy and immunogenicity in the guinea pig keratoconjunctivitis model, the HPV58L1 gene was cloned into vector pUCmt, and then subcloned into the suicide vector pCVD442. The recombinant plasmid pCVD442-HPV58L1 was introduced into attenuated Shigella (sf301:Delta virG) with the helper plasmid PRK2013 by filter mating. The positive colonies were harvested and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. The expression of the HPV58L1 protein with a molecular weight of 60 kDa was confirmed by western blot. The ability of the interested protein to self-assemble into virus-like particles was identified by transmission electron microscope, and murine erythrocyte hemagglutination assay. The guinea pig keratoconjunctivitis model was used to evaluate the protective efficacy and immunogenicity of the vaccine. Animal experiments showed that there was no keratoconjunctivitis occurred in the immunized group (HPV58-attenuated Shigella), and the serum levels of anti-HPV58L1-IgG and -IgA were obviously increased (P < 0.05), but the anti-sf301 LPS-IgG just slightly increased (P > 0.05). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay showed that HPV58L1-specific IgA-antibody-secreting cells (ASC) and IgG-ASC of spleen and lymph nodes were also obviously increased (P < 0.01). In this study, a recombinant HPV58L1-attenuated Shigella live vector vaccine was successfully constructed, and it could induce strong humoral immune responses in the immunized animals, and induce protective antibody production.

AB The use of political assassinations against key leaders of liberation movements has had a major impact on the course of history in Africa and the Middle East. Not only have some of the greatest of Third World leaders been killed but so, too, has the hope for political change they embodied. This survey of assassinations carried out by western states and their agents from the 1960s onwards reveals a bloody legacy of killings of leaders from Algeria, Cameroon, Congo, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Morocco, Mozambique, Palestine, South Africa, Togo and Zimbabwe - all of which were linked to the interests of western imperialism. Today's daily diet of suicide bombings and the targeting of civilians by both western militaries and jihadis is one consequence, it is suggested, of the brutalisation effected by the policy of political assassination.

AB The serotonergic cells of the dorsal raphe nucleus innervate much of the forebrain and are thought to be involved in the mechanism of action of antidepressants. Dysfunction of these cells might be involved in the neural mechanisms underlying depression and suicide. The traffic in pathways emanating from the dorsal raphe nucleus is controlled by 5-HT1 autoreceptors. Until recently it was thought that the autoreceptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus were solely of the 5-HT1A subtype. In this article, we discuss evidence that the situation is more complex and that multiple 5-HT1 subtypes govern different aspects of 5-HT function in the dorsal raphe nucleus presenting new therapeutic opportunities.

TI Depressive symptoms among survivors of Ebola virus disease in Conakry
   (Guinea): preliminary results of the PostEboGui cohort
SO BMC PSYCHIATRY
LA English

ID NORTHERN UGANDA; SIERRA-LEONE; SEQUELAE
AB Background: The 2013-2016 West African Ebola outbreak infected 28,616 people and caused 11,310 deaths by 11 May 2016, across six countries. The outbreak has also resulted in the largest number of EVD survivors in history-over 17,000. Guinea was declared Ebola-free on 1 June 2016. Reports from the outbreak documented 3814 cases resulting in 2544 deaths and 1270 survivors. EVD survivors face various neuropsychological and psycho-affective alterations that have not been fully identified yet. This study aims to document the depressive symptoms among adult survivors in Guinea.
   Methods: Depressive symptoms were investigated using the French version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) administered to all adult survivors (>= 20 years) participating in the PostEboGui study and receiving care in Conakry. The study was combined with a clinical consultation by a psychiatrist at the Donka National Hospital in Conakry that ensured adapted care was provided when needed.
   Results: Overall, 256 adult participants receiving care in Conakry participated in this study: 55% were women, median age 31 years [IQR: 26-40]. The median time since the Ebola Treatment Center (ETC) discharge was 8. 1 months [IQR: 4.1-11.7]. 15% had a score above the threshold values indicating psychological suffering (15% for men and 14% for women). 33 people (16 women and 17 men) met with the psychiatrist, which resulted in the diagnosis of 3 cases of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 3 cases of mild depression, 13 cases of moderate depression, and 11 cases of severe depression, including 1 with kinesthetic hallucinations and another with visual hallucinations, and 1 with suicidal ideation and 3 with attempted suicide. Severe depression was diagnosed between 1 and 19 months after ETC discharge. The various identified forms of depression responded favorably to conventional drug therapies and cognitive behavioral therapy.
   Conclusion: Long-term follow-up for EVD survivors will be necessary to understand the evolution of these pathologies. In the current post-epidemic context, these cases underscore the need to strengthen mental health diagnostic systems and treatment on a national scale.

AB Whether upheld as heroic or reviled as terrorism, people have been willing to lay down their lives for the sake of their groups throughout history. Why? Previous theories of extreme self-sacrifice have highlighted a range of seemingly disparate factors, such as collective identity, outgroup hostility, and kin psychology. In this paper, I attempt to integrate many of these factors into a single overarching theory based on several decades of collaborative research with a range of special populations, from tribes in Papua New Guinea to Libyan insurgents and from Muslim fundamentalists in Indonesia to Brazilian football hooligans. These studies suggest that extreme self-sacrifice is motivated by identity fusion, a visceral sense of oneness with the group, resulting from intense collective experiences (e.g., painful rituals or the horrors of frontline combat) or from perceptions of shared biology. In ancient foraging societies, fusion would have enabled warlike bands to stand united despite strong temptations to scatter and flee. The fusion mechanism has often been exploited in cultural rituals, not only by tribal societies but also in specialized cells embedded in armies, cults, and terrorist organizations. With the rise of social complexity and the spread of states and empires, fusion has also been extended to much larger groups, including doctrinal religions, ethnicities, and ideological movements. Explaining extreme self-sacrifice is not only a scientific priority but also a practical challenge as we seek a collective response to suicide, terrorism, and other extreme expressions of outgroup hostility that continue to bedevil humanity today.

AB Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible effects of varied exposure to 50Hz extremely low frequency (ELF) electric field (EF) on the lipid peroxidation levels and antioxidant enzyme activities in the brain homogenates of guinea pigs. Subjects were exposed to 2kV/m, 2.5kV/m, 3kV/m, 3.5kV/m, 4kV/m, 4.5kV/m and 5kV/m electric fields for three days, 8h a day in both vertical and horizontal directions.
   Materials and methods: Malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were measured in order to identify possible alterations in lipid peroxidation levels and antioxidant status due to electric field exposure. Xanthine oxidase (XO), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and adenosine deaminase (ADA) activities were also evaluated in the same samples.
   Results: Although the study showed several positive but non-significant findings (p > 0.05), we did not find significant differences among all of the exposed groups and sham groups in lipid peroxidation levels and enzyme activities (p > 0.05) at all strengths and in both directions. Furthermore, the result was the same when the comparison was made between the groups in vertical directions and horizontal directions (p > 0.05).
   Conclusion: The present study observed effects of 50Hz EF exposure on lipid peroxidation levels and antioxidant defense mechanisms but these were not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. Further research on the effects ELF-EF exposure on lipid peroxidation levels and antioxidant defence mechanisms are warranted.

AB Organophosphosphates (OPs) are highly effective acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors that are used worldwide as cheap, multi-purpose insecticides. OPs are also used as chemical weapons forming the active core of G-series and V-series chemical agents including tabun, sarin, soman, cyclosarin, VX, and their chemical analogs. Human exposure to any of these compounds leads to neurotoxic accumulation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, resulting in abnormal nerve function and multiple secondary health complications. Suicide from deliberate exposure to OPs is particularly prevalent in developing countries across the world and constitutes a major global health crisis. The prevalence and accessible nature of OP compounds within modern agricultural spheres and concern over their potential use in biochemical weapon attacks have incentivized both government agencies and medical researchers to enact stricter regulatory policies over their usage and to begin developing more proactive medical treatments in cases of OP poisoning. This review will discuss the research undertaken in recent years that has investigated new supplementary drug options for OP treatment and support therapy, including progress in the development of enzymatic prophylaxis.

TI A new definition of health? An open letter of autochthonous peoples and

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE

DT Article
DE Public health; Wellbeing; Ecology; Medical anthropology; Suicide
AB Currently, formany practitioners (hospital and liberals) and researchers (including public health), the WHO definition of health is outdated: first it seems more utopian than pragmatic; then, it proves unsuitable for a large part of the world population. There is clearly a need to refine this definition or propose additional criteria to be more relevant or discriminating. In this perspective, what can indigenous people offer in the elaboration of a new definition of health?
   In this article, leaders or representatives of autochthonous peoples, anthropologists and physicians from many cultural origins (Amazonia, Patagonia, Papua New-Guinea, Inuit, North-American Indian, sub-Saharan Africa, India, China, Melanesia and Polynesia) have tried to identify and explain several key concepts that WHO should reintegrate into its new definition of health: human equilibrium in nature, accepted spirituality and adaptation. On the sidelines of the application of COP21 decisions that should give back to man his place into the environment, autochthonous people leaders, anthropologists and MDs explain why these three concepts are fundamental and universal health determinants, and need to be included in a new WHO definition of health.

AB The present study examined the prodynorphin and kappa opioid receptor mRNA expression levels in the anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices of subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia bipolar disorder, or major depression as compared with normal controls without a psychiatric diagnosis. Multivariate analyses failed to reveal any differences in the mRNA expression levels between the four diagnostic groups, though a group trend (non-significant) was evident for the expression of the kappa opioid receptor and prodynorphin mRNAs in the prefrontal cortex. The mRNA expression levels were not associated with lifetime history of antipsychotic treatment or with suicide as a cause of death. The results, however, suggested an influence of certain drugs of abuse on the prodynorphin cortical mRNA expression. Prodynorphin mRNA expression levels were found to be elevated in individuals with a history of marihuana or stimulant use, but not alcohol. Overall, our data do not provide strong evidence for impaired prodynorphin or kappa opioid receptor mRNA levels in the dorsolateral prefrontal or cingulate cortices of schizophrenic, bipolar disorder, or major depressed subjects.

AB Here, I will review accumulating evidence that during the developmental period of synaptogenesis, also known as the brain growth spurt period, neurons are very sensitive to specific disturbances in their synaptic environment. During this period abnormal increases in NMDA glutamate (Glu) receptor activity triggers excitotoxic neurodegeneration, and abnormal inhibition of neuronal activity (by blockade of NMDA Glu receptors or excessive activation of GABA(A) receptors) triggers neuronal suicide (apoptosis). Only a transient disturbance, lasting for a few hours, is sufficient to trigger either excitotoxic or apoptotic neurodegeneration during this developmental period. Ethanol, which has both NMDA antagonist and GABAmimetic properties, triggers widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing rat, mouse or guinea pig brain, and this provides a likely explanation for the reduced brain mass and lifelong neurobehavioral disturbances associated with the human fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). The brain growth spurt occurs in different species at different times relative to birth. In rats and mice it is a postnatal event, but in humans it extends from the 6th month of gestation to several years after birth. Thus, there is a period in fetal and neonatal human development, lasting for several years, during which immature central nervous system (CNS) neurons are exquisitely sensitive to environmental agents (the specific number and variety of which remains to be established) that can trigger widespread neurodegeneration by inducing specific abnormal changes in the synaptic environment. Agents identified thus far include drugs that may be abused by pregnant mothers (ethanol, phencyclidine (PCP) (angel dust), ketamine (Special K), nitrous oxide (laughing gas), barbiturates, benzodiazepines) and many medicinals used in obstetric and pediatric medicine as sedatives, anti-convulsants or anesthetics (all general anesthetics are either NMDA antagonists or GABAmimetics). Many other chemicals in the human environment remain to be evaluated for their ability to cause developing CNS neurons to commit suicide, and this provides an exciting challenge for the field of developmental neurotoxicology.

AB After the thrombus formation in cardiac cavities or coronaries, the serine protease thrombin is produced and can therefore reach the myocardial tissue by the active process of extravasation and binds to the G protein-coupled protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) expressed in human myocardium. The role of PAR1 was investigated in the thrombin effect on sodium current (I-Na). I-Na was recorded in freshly isolated human atrial myocytes by the whole-cell patch-clamp method. Action potentials (AP) were recorded in guinea pig ventricular tissue by the conventional glass microelectrode technique. Thrombin-activated PAR1 induced a tetrodotoxin-blocked persistent sodium current, I-NaP, in a concentration-dependent manner with an apparent EC50 of 28 U/ml. The PAR1 agonist peptide SFLLR-NH2 (50 mu M) was able to mimic PAR1-thrombin action, whereas PAR1 antagonists N-3-cyclopropyl-7-((4-(1-methylethyl)phenyl) methyl)-7H-pyrrolo(3,2-f)quinazoline-1,3-diamine (SCH 203099; 10 mu M) and 1-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-phenyl)-2-3-(3-ethyl-3-hydroxy-pentyl)-2-imino-2,3-dihydro-imidazol-1yl]-ethanone (ER 112787) (1 mu M), completely inhibited it. The activated PAR1 involves the calcium-independent phospholipase-A(2) signaling pathway because two inhibitors of this cascade, bromoenol lactone (50 mu M) and haloenol lactone suicide substrate (50 mu M), block PAR1-thrombin-induced I-NaP. As a consequence of I-NaP activation, in guinea pig right ventricle papillary muscle, action potential duration (APD) were significantly increased by 20% and 15% under the respective action of 32 U/ml thrombin and 50 mu M SFLLR-NH2, and these increases in APD were prevented by 1 mu M tetrodotoxin or markedly reduced by application of 1 mu M SCH 203099 or ER 112787. Thrombin, through PAR1 activation, increases persistent component of the Na+ current resulting in an uncontrolled sodium influx into the cardiomyocyte, which can contribute to cellular injuries observed during cardiac ischemia.

AB Despite the success of L1 virus-like particles (VLPs) vaccines in prevention of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical cancer, extraordinary high cost for the complete vaccination has impeded widespread use of the vaccine in resource-poor countries, where cervical cancers impose greater challenge. Presentation of HPV L1 protein by attenuated pathogenic bacteria through natural infection provides a promising low-cost and convenient alternative. Here, we describe the construction and characterization of attenuated L1-expressing Shigella vaccine candidate, by fusion of L1 into the autotransporter of Shigella sonnei, IcsA, an essential virulence factor responsible for actin-based motility. The functional a domain of IcsA was replaced by codon-optimized L1 gene with independent open reading frames (ORFs) facilitated by suicide vector pJCB12. The L1 gene was stabilized in the genome of recombinant S. sonnei with protein expression and assembly of VLPs in the bacterial cytoplasm. Through conjunctival route vaccination in guinea pigs, L1-containing S. sonnei was able to elicit specific immune response to HPV16 L1 VLP as well as bacterial antigens. The results demonstrated the feasibility of the novel stratagem to develop prophylactic Shigella-HPV vaccines. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The potential antidepressant, LY367265 (1-[2-[4-(6-fluoro-1H-indol-3-yl)-3,6-dihydro-1(2H)-pyridinyl]ethyl]-5,6-dihydro-1H,4H-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[4.3.2-ij]quinoline-3.2 has been shown to have a higher affinity fur the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) transporter (K-i = 2.3 nM) acid 5-HT2A (K-i = 0.81 nM) receptor than the clinically effective antidepressant, nefazodone. It is a potent inhibitor of [H-3]5-HT uptake into rat cortical synaptosomes (IC50 = 3.1 nM) and shows selectivity over that for [H-3]noradrenaline (IC50 > 1000 nM). It potentiates potassium-induced [H-3]5-HT outflow from prelabelled guinea pig cortical slices both in the presence (EC50 = 950 nM) and absence (EC50 = 250 nM) of a saturating concentration of the 5-HT transport inhibitor, paroxetine, indicating a low level of activity at the 5-HT1B/1D autoreceptor. These studies indicate that LY367265 is a putative antidepressant which, because of its 5-HT2A receptor antagonist activity, has the potential to produce less sleep disturbance and sexual dysfunction than selective serotonin uptake inhibitors.

AB Since its discovery 50 years ago, the role of the indoleamine 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine; serotonin) in the pathogenesis of depression and in the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs has been the subject of considerable research. Advances in molecular biology and radioligand techniques have led to the functional characterisation of at least 14 serotonin receptor subtypes. This classification has led to the development of selective compounds that have aided in the efforts of dissecting the complex role of 5-HT in depression and in mediating the antidepressant response. This review focuses largely on novel strategies of targeting specific 5-HT receptors subtypes, especially the presynaptic 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B/1D receptors. These subtypes are of primary importance in that they control the firing of the 5-HT neuron and the release of 5-HT. In addition, a number of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors have been shown to be dysfunctional in depression and are also potential targets for a number of antidepressants. We conclude that selective targeting of 5-HT receptors may lead to a faster acting and more efficient antidepressant response. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

   BOLT; HEAD
AB A total of eight cases of homicide by crossbow are reported, including six intentional, assault-like killings and one hired killer. The bolts showed a high penetration capacity despite the rather low kinetic energy (< 100 J): a field-tip traversed one upper arm and the thorax ( 36 cm) and two broadheads caused perforating injuries of the thorax ( 25 - 26 cm). This was due to the high sectional density and the split-like penetration mechanism. Wound morphology was especially important if the perpetrator had extracted the bolt, which occurred in half of the cases. The shape of the entrance wound depended on the type of arrowhead: broadheads produced star-shaped to triangular wounds, field-tips caused circular, oval or slit-like injuries. Foreign material from the arrowhead was found inside two injuries. In assaults, the crossbow was used to hunt the victim down from a short distance which does not require practice but still has the advantage of a distance weapon. However, immediate incapacitation occurred rarely so that additional violence was frequently applied. The noiseless character of the weapon explains why many victims were taken by surprise and why the corpses initially remained unnoticed. Crossbows can therefore be considered ideal weapons for man hunting and some were bought for the very purpose of the killing.

AB Background: Pathogenic Leptospira species cause leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease of global importance. The spirochete displays active rotative mobility which may contribute to invasion and diffusion of the pathogen in hosts. FliY is a flagellar motor switch protein that controls flagellar motor direction in other microbes, but its role in Leptospira, and paricularly in pathogenicity remains unknown.
   Results: A suicide plasmid for the fliY gene of Leptospira interrogans serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae serovar Lai strain Lai that was disrupted by inserting the ampicillin resistance gene (bla) was constructed, and the inactivation of fliY gene in a mutant (fliY-) was confirmed by PCR and Western Blot analysis. The inactivation resulted in the mRNA absence of fliP and fliQ genes which are located downstream of the fliY gene in the same operon. The mutant displayed visibly weakened rotative motion in liquid medium and its migration on semisolid medium was also markedly attenuated compared to the wild-type strain. Compared to the wild-type strain, the mutant showed much lower levels of adhesion to murine macrophages and apoptosis-inducing ability, and its lethality to guinea pigs was also significantly decreased.
   Conclusion: Inactivation of fliY, by the method used in this paper, clearly had polar effects on downstream genes. The phentotypes observed, including lower pathogenicity, could be a consequence of fliY inactivation, but also a consequence of the polar effects.

AB This chapter traces changing patterns of mental health and its provision within the smaller Pacific Islands. Although small and distant from Europe, some people living within precolonial Pacific cultures suffered from stress and mental illness. This chapter emphasizes indigenous conceptions of Pacific minds and mental health and the entanglement with Western biomedicine, psychiatry and global mental health structures. The smaller nations in the Pacific are covered-American Samoa, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, French Polynesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, NewHawai Caledonia, Niue, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Tokelau, Tonga Tuvalu, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Wallis and Futuna-but not Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Hawai`i. This chapter begins with the discussion of indigenous conceptions and treatment of mental illness within the Pacific Islands. We then examine the introduction of mental health infrastructure and biomedicine into the region. The Islands also attracted researchers who offered divergent interpretations of mental health epidemiology among Pacific cultures. The second half of this chapter focuses on contemporary health provision in the Pacific. Global mental health structures have been directed through the Pacific Islands Mental Health Network (PIMHnet), launched in 2007. Despite this, mental health within the small islands of the Pacific region continues to receive low priority, competes for scarce resources, faces problems of isolation and struggles to be recognized at all levels of government and society. Indigenous communities still rely heavily upon traditional treatments and support-offering some resilience but also presenting challenges for contemporary health initiatives.

AB Studies in mice and guinea pigs have shown that albumin is a new biomarker of organophosphorus toxicant (OP) and nerve agent exposure. Our goal was to determine whether OP-labeled albumin could be detected in the blood of humans exposed to OP. Blood from four OP-exposed patients was prepared for mass spectrometry analysis by digesting 0.010 ml of serum with pepsin and purifying the labeled albumin peptide by offline high performance liquid chromatography. Dimethoxyphosphate-labeled tyrosine 411 was identified in albumin peptides VRY(411)TKKVPQVSTPTL and LVRY(411)TKKVPQVSTPTL from two patients who had attempted suicide with dichlorvos. The butyrylcholinesterase activity in these serum samples was inhibited 80%. A third patient whose serum BChE activity was inhibited 8% by accidental inhalation of dichlorvos had undetectable levels of adduct on albumin. A fourth patient whose BChE activity was inhibited 60% by exposure to chlorpyrifos had no detectable adduct on albumin. This is the first report to demonstrate the presence of OP-labeled albumin in human patients. It is concluded that tyrosine 411 of human albumin is covalently modified in the serum of humans poisoned by dichlorvos and that the modification is detectable by mass spectrometry. The special reactivity of tyrosine 411 with OP suggests that other proteins may also be modified on tyrosine. Identification of other OP-modified proteins may lead to an understanding of neurotoxic symptoms that appear long after the initial OP exposure.

AB 5-HT-stimulated [S-35]GTP gamma S binding to rat hippocampal membranes was pharmacologically characterized. Signal/noise ratio or percent increase over basal was optimized with 100 mu M GDP, 2 - 10 mM MgCl2, and 150 - 200 mM NaCl. However, we preferred the standard condition (20,mu M GDP, 5 mM MgCl2, and 100 mM NaCl: Condition 1) to the alternative one (100 mu M GDP, 5 mM MgCl2, and 150 mM NaCl: Condition II) because 1) absolute values of basal and 5-HT-sensitive bindings decreased with higher concentrations of GDP and NaCl; 2) EC50 values determined under Condition II were 2 - 6 fold higher than those under Condition 1; 3) some partial agonists had less intrinsic activities in the presence of higher concentrations of GDP; and 4) Inhibitory effects of WAY100635 were complete under Condition 1, while incomplete under Condition II. Pharmacological profile of concentration-dependent stimulation by a series of 5-HT ligands and concentration-dependent inhibition of 5-HT-stimulated binding by several 5-HT-receptor antagonists clearly indicated that this response under Condition I was mediated solely through 5-HT1A receptors. Although caution should be paid especially to the apparent intrinsic activities susceptible to the assay conditions, this method appears useful to investigate functional coupling between 5-HT1A receptors and their coupled G proteins in native hippocampal membranes.

   RELEASE
AB Mechanosensory hair cells of the inner ear are especially sensitive to death induced by exposure to aminoglycoside antibiotics. This aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death involves activation of an intrinsic program of cellular suicide. Aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death can be prevented by broadspectrum inhibition of caspases, a family of proteases that mediate apoptotic and programmed cell death in a wide variety of systems. More specifically, aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death requires activation of caspase-9. Caspase-9 activation requires release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytoplasm, indicating that aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death is mediated by the mitochondrial (or "intrinsic") cell death pathway. The Bcl-2 family of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins are important upstream regulators of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein that localizes to the mitochondria and promotes cell survival by preventing cytochrome c release. Here we have utilized transgenic mice that overexpress Bcl-2 to examine the role of Bcl-2 in neomycin-induced hair cell death. Overexpression of Bcl-2 significantly increased hair cell survival following neomycin exposure in organotypic cultures of the adult mouse utricle. Furthermore, Bcl-2 overexpression prevented neomycin-induced activation of caspase-9 in hair cells. These results suggest that the expression level of Bcl-2 has important effects on the pathway(s) important for the regulation of aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death.

AB Beta-adrenoceptors are predominantly located in the cerebral cortex, nucleus accumbens and striatum. At lower densities, they are also present in amygdala, hippocampus and cerebellum. Beta-2 sites regulate glial proliferation during ontogenic development, after trauma and in neurodegenerative diseases. The densities of beta-1 adrenoceptors are changed by stress, in several mood disorders (depression, excessive hostility, schizophrenia) and during treatment of patients with antidepressants.
   A technique for beta-adrenoceptor imaging in the human brain is not yet available. Although 24 (ant)agonists have been labeled with either C-11 or F-18 and some of these are successful myocardial imaging agents, only two (S-1,-F-18-fluorocarazolol and S-1'-F-18-fluoroethylcarazolol) could actually visualize beta-adrenoceptors within the central nervous system. Unfortunately, these radiopharmaceuticals showed a positive Ames test. They may be mutagenic and cannot be employed for human studies.
   Screening of more than 150 beta-blockers described in the literature yields only two compounds (exaprolol and L643,717) which can still be radiolabeled and evaluated for beta-adenoceptor imaging. However, other imaging techniques could be examined. Cerebral beta-adrenoceptors might be labeled after temporary opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and simultaneous administration of a hydrophilic ligand such as S-C-11-CGP12388. Another approach to target beta-adrenoceptor ligands to the CNS is esterification of a myocardial imaging agent (such as C-11-CGP12177), resulting in a lipophilic prodrug which can cross the BBB and is split by tissue esterases. BBB opening is not feasible in healthy subjects, but the prodrug approach may be successful and deserves to be explored.

AB Objective: Based on the characteristics of clinical symptoms of pruritus, analyze the relevant animal model, and then propose the evaluation and improvement. Method: According to the clinical diagnostic criteria of pruritus in Chinese and Western medicine, summarize the characteristics and modeling methods of the current pruritus mode, and analyze the coincidence between the existing animal models and clinical features of pruritus. Result: At present, the animal model of mice, guinea pig itch is almost used, which reflects the pathophysiological characteristics of clinical pruritus. However, it is lack of disease model which can reflect the clinical characteristics of TCM. Conclusion: It is the focus of the future research to establish a better combination of symptoms and signs and the index system of pruritus model. Pruritus is a kind of disease of self-conscious itching and clinical primary lesions, only scratches, blood scab or hypertrophy of leather change, which belongs to the category of Chinese medicine "itching wind". The symptoms of Pruritus relates to invasion of the skin such as wind, wet, heat, turbid evil, when there are also due to blood deficiency caused by dry wind. Clinically, it can be divided into systemic pruritus and localized pruritus. It's Common symptom is severe itching, which can be seen in the whole body or confined to the anus, scrotum or genitals. It's paroxysmal and itchs sharply, which is often aggravated at night and affects sleeping. Scratch scratches, blood stasis appear if you scratch excessively. It appears eczema, lichen and pigmentation over time, which can be seen in a variety of skin diseases, biliary diseases, thyroid disease, kidney disease, cancer and AIDS and other common diseases. Pruritus has high incidence rate. Through the report which investigates 1236 cases of elderly subjects, we can find it's 827 cases which suffers from skin itching cured accounting for 67%. Pruritus often affects the quality of life of patients, which leads to severe insomnia and then fatigue, fatigue, depression and even suicide. Modern research on pruritus has become the focus of medical research.

AB In order to overcome the defects of difficult gene operations in low-copy suicide plasmid pCVD442, Gateway technology was applied in the construction process of recombinant plasmid for gene knockout in this study. With this improved knockout system, we inactivated sitC gene, which is associated with iron transport in Shigella flexneri 2a strain 301, to yield the mutant, MTS. The functional detection of the mutant was performed at the level of culture medium, cell and animal experiment, respectively. The gene expression profiles were compared with DNA microarray between the mutant and the wild type under iron-restricted conditions. The results showed that MTS grew obviously less well than the wild-type strains in L broth containing 150 mu mol/L iron chelator DIP (2,2'-dipyridyl). Addition of iron or manganese to the cultures stimulated the growth of MTS to wild-type levels in rich culture medium. In either the experiment on the ability of intracellular multiplication and cell-to-cell spread in HeLa and U937 cell lines, or the experiment on keratoconjunctivitis in guinea pigs, MTS showed no obvious changes in virulence compared with the parental strain Sf301. When 65 mu mol/L DIP was added to the cultured HeLa cells, the ability of intracellular multiplication of MTS reduced about 51.6% as compared with that of Sf301. The analysis of expression profiles under iron-limited condition showed that MTS was more sensitive for the change of iron deficiency than Sf301. There are 106 more up-regulated genes in MTS than in wild-type strains, which are involved in membrane transportation, amino acid metabolism and uncategorized function genes, while down-regulated genes are mainly involved in energy and carbohydrate metabolism. Under low iron conditions, the expression levels of known iron-transport associated genes generally increased. Additionally, the number of these genes and their increase amplitude in MTS are more than those in Sf301. Together, these results confirmed that Sit iron-transport system is important for the growth of Shigella.

AB Perinatal brain damage in the mature fetus is usually brought about by severe intrauterine asphyxia following an acute reduction of the uterine or umbilical circulation. The areas most heavily affected are the parasagittal region of the cerebral cortex and the basal ganglia. The fetus reacts to a severe lack of oxygen with activation of the sympathetic-adrenergic nervous system and a redistribution of cardiac output in favor of the central organs (brain, heart and adrenals). If the asphyxic insult persists, the fetus is unable to maintain circulatory centralization, and the cardiac output and extent of cerebral perfusion fall. Owing to the acute reduction in oxygen supply, oxidative phosphorylation in the brain comes to a standstill. The Na+/K+ pump at the cell membrane has no more energy to maintain the ionic gradients. In calcium ions flow through the voltage-dependent ion the absence of a membrane potential, large amounts of channels, down an extreme extra-/intracellular concentration gradient, into the cell. Current research suggests calcium, so-called calcium overload, leads to cell that the excessive increase in levels of intracellular damage through the activation of proteases, lipases and calcium ions into the cells via voltage-dependent endonucleases. During ischemia, besides the influx of calcium channels, more calcium enters the cells through glutamate-regulated ion channels. Glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, is released from presynaptic vesicles during ischemia following anoxic cell depolarization. The acute lack of cellular energy arising during ischemia induces almost complete inhibition of cerebral protein biosynthesis. Once the ischemic period is over, protein biosynthesis returns to preischemic levels in non-vulnerable regions of the brain, while in more vulnerable areas it remains inhibited. The inhibition of protein synthesis, therefore, appears to be an early indicator of subsequent neuronal cell death. A second wave of neuronal cell damage occurs during the reperfusion phase. This cell damage is thought to be caused by the postischemic release of oxygen radicals, synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), inflammatory reactions and an imbalance between the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter systems. Part of the secondary neuronal cell damage may be caused by induction of a kind of cellular suicide programme known as apoptosis. Interestingly, there is increasing evidence from recent clinical studies that perinatal brain damage is closely associated with ascending intrauterine infection before or during birth. However, a major part of this damage is likely to be of hypoxic-ischemic nature due to LPS-induced effects on fetal cerebral circulation. Knowledge of these pathophysiological mechanisms has enabled scientists to develop new therapeutic strategies with successful results in animal experiments. The potential of such therapies is discussed here, particularly the promising effects of intravenous administration of magnesium or postischemic induction of cerebral hypothermia.
