TI Suicide Policy in Canada: Lessons From History

DE Suicide; policy; history
AB In Canada, suicide has transitioned from being a criminal activity with much associated stigma, to being a public health concern that needs to be managed by governments and clinicians in a culturally sensitive manner. In Canada and worldwide, the social attitudes toward and legal interpretation of suicide have been dynamic. Much has been proposed in the development of suicide policy in Canada, however Canada is unique in that it remains one of the only industrialized countries without a national suicide prevention strategy. The current article provides a critical review of the history of suicide in Canada, as well as an appraisal of Canadian suicide prevention policies and key government and political milestones that have impacted suicide policy. Current activity regarding a national suicide prevention strategy in Canada is discussed, as well as potential options for clinician involvement.

AB Worldwide, between 48 and 500 million individuals are affected by suicide every year. In Canada alone, 4,000 individuals die yearly by suicide, meaning that a substantial portion of the population must cope with the traumatic and complex aftermath of suicide. This paper discusses the emergence of suicide bereavement as a public health issue following the decriminalization of attempted suicide in 1972. The role of key structures, including the courts, the constitution, and special interest groups, that have shaped suicide and suicide bereavement policy in Canada are examined. Health outcomes associated with suicide bereavement are reviewed, as well as the need for intervention. Emerging areas of suicide policy where guidance is needed are also discussed, as are the need for upstream, midstream, and downstream approaches to suicide bereavement intervention.

TI Suicide Mortality in Canada after the Death of Robin Williams, in the
   Context of High-Fidelity to Suicide Reporting Guidelines in the Canadian
   Media
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE PSYCHIATRIE
LA English
DT Article

ID MENTAL-ILLNESS; COVERAGE; NEWS
AB Background: Evidence suggests that suicide mortality increases after high-profile suicide deaths. Indeed, suicide in the United States increased disproportionately after the suicide by suffocation of well-known comedian Robin Williams in August 2014. Such increases are often attributed to irresponsible media coverage of the suicide contributing to "copycat suicides." However, recent research indicates that the mainstream Canadian media have significantly improved their suicide coverage, with high fidelity to suicide reporting guidelines after Williams' death. As such, the aim of the present study is to examine suicide mortality in Canada after Robin Williams' suicide. Methods: We obtained deidentified monthly suicide count data from January 1999 to December 2015 stratified by age, sex, and method of suicide from Statistics Canada. We used time-series analyses to estimate the expected number of suicides in the months following Robin Williams' death. This was done using a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving averages (SARIMA) method. Expected suicides were then compared with observed suicides. Results: August 2014 was the month with the highest number of suicides from 2010 to 2015. The time-series model indicated a 16% increase in the expected number of suicides during the months from August to December 2014 inclusive. Moreover, males over 30 had the greatest number of excess suicides, and suicides by suffocation (the method used by Robin Williams) were also higher in August and the following months. Interpretation: Suicides increased in Canada after Robin Williams' death, despite the improved mainstream media coverage witnessed in other studies. Other factors (e.g., social and alternative media) may have contributed to the observed increase in suicide.

AB Objectives. To review Suicide patterns among Inuit in Canada and highlight new developments in Inuit-driven and community-based Suicide prevention.
   Study design. Narrative overview Of Suicide among Inuit in Canada, strides towards Inuit autonomy. and community and government action towards Suicide prevention.
   Methods. Review of Inuit meanings of mental health, movements towards Inuit control across Inuit Nunaat (the 4 Inuit regions) of Canada. and of community and government action towards suicide prevention.
   Results. Economic advancement is Occurring in Inuit Nunaat following land claim settlements, and territorial and provincial governments are overseeing Inuit well-being. Inuit community engagement in suicide prevention is taking place and studies are being planned to evaluate the efficacy of such action for Suicide prevention and community mental health. Initial evidence demonstrates that community control over suicide prevention itself can be effective towards preventing suicide.
   Conclusions. A new orientation is taking place in Canada in the name of Aboriginal community empowerment. There is a new hope for the model of meaningful community engagement and partnership with the Canadian government in suicide prevention and well-being, (Int J Circumpolar Health 2009; 68(3):292-308)

AB Objective: Trends in rates of adolescent suicide and undetermined deaths in Canada from 1981 to 2012 were examined, focusing specifically on variations between Canadian regions. Exploratory hypotheses were formulated for regional variability in adolescent suicide rates over time in Canada. Methods: A descriptive time trend analysis using public domain vital statistics data was performed. All deaths from 1981 to 2012 among 15 to 19 year olds coded as suicides or undetermined intent according to the International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions were included. Results: While there was an overall stability in adolescent suicide and undetermined death rates across Canada, regional analyses showed that Quebec experienced a 7.6% annual reduction between 2001 and 2012 while the Prairies and Atlantic provinces experienced significant annual increases since 2001. Ontario and British Columbia have had non-significant fluctuations since 2001. The trends remained similar overall when excluding undetermined deaths from the analyses. Conclusions: Variations in adolescent suicide trends across provinces were found. Factors such as provincial suicide action and prevention legislation contributing to these variations remain to be studied, but these regional differences point towards the need for better consistency of suicide prevention strategies across the country.

AB Gun control is the prototypical example of controlling the environment for the means of suicide, an effective public health approach to suicide prevention. Canada's Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1977 (Bill C-51) provides an excellent opportunity to illustrate the effects of legislative gun-control laws and the impact on suicide. The research in Canada supports the significant effect of C-51 in reducing suicides and firearm suicides, even if one controls for socioeconomic factors, although not equally for all ages. The young, a high-risk group, show the most significant decrease, without significant substitution of other methods (displacement). Studies on gun-control laws from New Zealand, the United States, and Australia support the Canadian findings. It is concluded that, although not equally applicable in all countries, gun control may well have significant applications in reducing suicide worldwide.

AB Suicide in young people is a significant health concern, with numerous community- and school-based interventions promising to prevent suicide currently being applied across Canada. Before widespread application of any one of these, it is essential to determine its effectiveness and safety. We systematically reviewed the global literature on one of the most common community suicide prevention interventions in Canada and summarized data on 2 commonly applied school-based suicide prevention programmes. None of these has demonstrated effectiveness in preventing youth suicide or safety in application. Concurrently with their widespread distribution in Canada, the suicide rate in young women has increased-the first time in over 3 decades. Policy and regulatory implications of these findings are discussed.

AB Introduction: Both active euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal in The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxemburg and, most recently, in Canada. Aim: Examination of national legislations of countries where both active euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal. The number of accomplished active euthanasia cases and that of assisted suicide cases. Method: Analysis of national statistical data. Comparison of statistical data before and after 2010. Comparison of the related practices in the surveyed countries. Results: The number of active euthanasia cases markedly predominates over the number of assisted suicide cases. Cancer is a main reason for active euthanasia, or assisted suicide. In countries with a larger population, the number of active euthanasia cases is higher than that in countries with a smaller population. Conclusions: Regarding the fact that the applicants for active euthanasia withdraw their requests in a smaller number than the applicants for assisted suicide, patients prefer the choice of active euthanasia. Since the related legislative product is too recent in Canada at present, it may be only presumed that a certain preference will also develop in the related practices in Canada.

AB This paper provides new and exciting insight of suicide between genders in Canada for 39 years from a socio-economic perspective. A theoretical framework based on sound economic theory of suicide using Vector Autoregression (VAR) model to establish meaningful relationships between variables incorporated. Additional causality test and beyond sample analysis (forecasting) will be helpful inbeautifying the linkages among the variables employed in this study. It is suggested that both female and male suicidal behaviour can be explained by socio-economic indicators. The findings provide useful insights for policy makers and suicide related agencies to perform a novel approach in dealing with suicides in addition to traditional behavioural correction and counselling strategies in hand. This study should also be helpful in understanding suicide from a broad perspective and analysing suicide in a new economic framework of rational choice theory.

AB The impact of underreporting or misclassifying suicides as injuries with undetermined intent is rarely evaluated. We assessed whether undetermined injury deaths influenced provincial rankings of suicide in Canada, using 2 735 152 Canadians followed for mortality from 1991 to 2001. We found that suicide rates increased by up to 26.5% for men and 37.7% for women after including injuries with undetermined intent, shifting provincial rankings of suicide. Attention to the stigma of suicide and to coding suicides as injuries with undetermined intent is merited for surveillance and prevention.

AB Indigenous youth suicide incidence is high globally, and mostly involves young males. However, the Inuit of Arctic Canada have a suicide rate that is among the highest in the world (and ten times that for the rest of Canada). The author suggests that suicide increase has emerged because of changes stemming in part from the Canadian government era in the Arctic in the 1950s and 1960s. The effects of government intervention dramatically affected kin relations, roles, and responsibilities, and affinal/romantic relationships. Suicide is embedded in these relationships. The author also discusses the polarization between psychiatric and indigenous/community methods of healing, demonstrating that government-based intervention approaches to mental health are not working well, and traditional cultural healing practices often take place outside of the mainstream clinics in these communities. The main questions of the paper are: Who should control suicide prevention? What is the best knowledge base for suicide prevention?.

ID UNEMPLOYMENT
AB Objective: To describe the association between occupation and risk of suicide among working-age men and women in Canada.
   Method: This study of suicide mortality over an 11-year period is based on a broadly representative 15% sample of the noninstitutionalized population of Canada aged 30 to 69 years at cohort inception. Age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) and rate ratios were calculated for men and women in 5 categories of skill level and 80 specific occupational groups, as well as for people not occupationally active.
   Results: The suicide mortality rate was 20.1/100 000 person years for occupationally active men (during 9 600 000 person years of follow-up) and 5.3/100 000 person years for occupationally active women (during 8 100 000 person years of follow-up). Among occupationally active men, elevated rates of suicide mortality were observed for 9 occupational groups and protective effects were observed for 6 occupational groups. Among women, elevated rates of suicide were observed in 4 occupational groups and no protective effects were observed. For men and women, ASMRs for suicide were inversely related to skill level.
   Conclusions: The limited number of associations between occupational groups and suicide risk observed in this study suggests that, with few exceptions, the characteristics of specific occupations do not substantially influence the risk for suicide. There was a moderate gradient in suicide mortality risk relative to occupational skill level. Suicide prevention strategies in occupational settings should continue to emphasize efforts to restrict and limit access to lethal means, one of the few suicide prevention policies with proven effectiveness.

AB Given the current opioid crisis in Canada, there is interest in the role of opioid toxicity in suicide deaths, particularly in whether any observed patterns are similar to those of unintentional deaths. The present analysis examined characteristics of opioid-toxicity suicide, and its role in relation to other suicide methods, from 2000 to 2016 in Alberta. It does not appear that the opioid crisis has resulted in a disproportionately higher number of suicides in Alberta. Individuals who die from unintentional opioid toxicity and those who die by opioid-toxicity suicide are likely distinct populations, requiring nuanced public health responses for prevention.

AB Objective: To examine the impact of the Health Canada regulatory warnings regarding antidepressant (AD) prescribing on suicide rates in boys and girls under the age of 18 and aged 18 to 19 years in Canada between 2004 and 2009. We hypothesized that an increase in suicide rates would be specific to girls, reflecting higher AD prescribing rates in girls than boys.
   Method: We graphed and tested the difference between Canada-wide suicide rates before and after the regulatory warning periods (either from 1995 to 2006 or from 1995 to 2009) in boys and girls under the age of 18 or aged 18 to 19 years. For comparison with prior studies, we estimated rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals using either Poisson regression or negative binomial regression.
   Results: There was no statistically significant increase in suicide rates in girls under the age of 18, or aged 18 to 19 years in response to the AD regulatory warnings. In boys under the age of 18 or aged 18 to 19 years, suicide rates declined after 2003.
   Conclusions: We did not find increased rates of suicide after the AD regulatory warnings in boys or girls under the age of 18 or aged 18 to 19 years in Canada-wide rates. However, this does not rule out the possibility that such an effect occurred in some jurisdictions in girls and (or) the regulatory warnings prevented the trend toward declining suicide rates. Factors influencing the downward trend in boys merit further attention.

AB Semistructured interviews focusing on suicide were conducted with 80 street youth in agencies and on the streets of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and Vancouver British Columbia, Canada. Participants described their understandings of the phenomenon of suicide among street youth and the meanings suicide held for them. Qualitative analysis of the interviews revealed themes of worthlessness, loneliness, hopelessness, and most centrally the feeling of being "trapped" as forming the construct of suicide held by the participants. These idioms of distress were situated within the context of a street life that included social stigma and drug abuse.

AB This paper analyses how prison suicide became a public issue in the late 1970s and early 1980s and discusses the expertise and kinds of actions that originated from the Correctional Service of Canada. The origin of these reforms is shown to be the wider context of prison transformations, such as the development of inmates' rights, the opening of prisons to outside experts, particularly doctors, and the restructuring of the disciplinary function of the institution. The strongest suicide prevention measures, while only sketched out in the early 1980s, were already clearly focused on issues such as collecting and sharing information and classifying, assigning, and supervising suicidal inmates.

AB This literature review sought to examine the extant literature on the relationship between emergency response services (ERS) personnel and suicide in Canada. The purpose was to determine what research has been conducted on suicide and suicide ideation among ERS, to contribute to knowledge in the area, and also to identify potential research gaps. Through a search of multiple databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, Psyc Articles, Psyc Info, Science Direct, CINAHL) and additional hand searching, 40 articles were identified to meet search criteria and provide relevant information on this topic. The articles revealed that research has primarily focused on the traumatic stress and critical incidents encountered by emergency responders, while little research has been conducted specifically on suicide within these professions. The minimal research that has focused on suicide generally discusses ERS encounters with suicide victims and patients, rather than suicide in the context of their personal mental health. The limited research that does discuss ERS suicide is largely restricted to law enforcement and military personnel. Finally, the literature search identified a particular lack of research relevant to the Canadian context. A research agenda is recommended to further investigate suicide among ERS within Canada, and the impact these suicides have on colleagues, families and friends.

ID MEDIA GUIDELINES
AB Research suggests that reporting suicide in the media has the potential to influence vulnerable individuals to emulate suicide behavior. Therefore, media guidelines for the responsible reporting of suicide have been developed and disseminated worldwide, but with mixed success. This study used semi-structured interviews with Canadian media professionals to understand the experience of reporting suicide and attitudes towards the suicide reporting guidelines in Canada. Findings indicate that media professionals view the guidelines as useful information within the bounds of normal reporting, but find them difficult to implement in light of media culture and realities. Interviews also highlighted the unique challenges of working across sectors with different sets of values, priorities and working styles. The study echoes the literature suggesting that collaborative guideline development and implementation is essential to meaningfully change suicide reporting practices.

SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SANTE PUBLIQUE
LA English
DT Editorial Material
DE Suicide; health services; Indigenous; population groups; adolescent
ID TREAT ADDICTIONS; INTERVENTIONS
AB In Canada, Indigenous youth suicide represents one of several health disparities burdening Indigenous populations, and like many other of these disparities, can be understood as an expression of societal, historical, cultural and familial trauma. As the number of Indigenous youth who take their own lives every year in Canada continues to far exceed national averages, it appears that conventional suicide prevention efforts remain ineffective among this population. A growing body of research argues that conventional interventions, largely rooted in Westernin dividual-level behavioural change frameworks, are culturally discordant with Indigenous paradigms. In response, some Indigenous communities are turning to cultural revitalization as a holistic community-driven response to suicide prevention and treatment. The following commentary explores the emerging evidence base for "culture as treatment" - a novel approach to suicide that emphasizes the significance of interconnectedness in healing, alongside the revitalization of traditional values to reclaim community wellness. In doing so, we seek to contribute to a changing discourse surrounding Indigenous youth suicide by acknowledging culture as strength against this national crisis.

   Methods: Suicide mortality and hospital separation data were retrieved from the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) holdings of Statistics Canada's Canadian Vital Statistics: Death Database (CVS: D) (1979 to 2012); Canadian Socio-Economic Information Management System (CANSIM 2011, 2012); the Hospital Morbidity Database (HMDB) (1994/95 to 2010/11); and the Discharge Abstract Database (2011/12 to 2014/15). Mortality and hospitalization counts and rates were reported by sex, 5-year age groups and method.
   Results: The Canadian suicide rate (males and females combined, all ages, age-sex standardized rate) has decreased from 14.4/100 000 (n = 3355) in 1979 to 10.4/100 000 (n = 3926) in 2012, with an annual percent change (APC) of -1.2% (95% CI: -1.3 to -1.0). However, this trend was not observed in both sexes: female suicide rates stabilized around 1990, while male rates continued declining over time-yet males still accounted for 75.7% of all suicides in 2012. Suffocation (hanging and strangulation) was the primary method of suicide (46.9%) among Canadians of all ages in 2012, followed by poisoning at 23.3%. In the 2014/15 fiscal year, there were 13 438 hospitalizations in Canada (excluding Quebec) associated with self-inflicted injuries-over 3 times the number of suicides. Over time females have displayed consistently higher rates of hospitalization for self-inflicted injury than males, with 63% of the total. Poisoning was reported as the most frequent means of self-inflicted harm in the fiscal year 2014/15, at 86% of all hospitalizations.
   Conclusion: Suicides and self-inflicted injuries continue to be a serious-but preventable-public health problem that requires ongoing surveillance.

AB Objective: The aim of this study is to compare Canadian suicide rates with other external causes of death to examine potential poisoning misclassifications as a contributor to suicide underreporting.
   Method: The study used Statistics Canada mortality data from 2000 to 2011 to calculate sex-and age-specific ratios by external cause of injury codes.
   Results: The overall Canadian suicide rate, as well as the poisoning suicide rate, declined over the study timeframe by an average annual percentage change (AAPC) of 1.0% each year. However, unintentional and undetermined poisonings increased significantly during the timeframe. Unintentional poisoning mortality (primarily narcotics and hallucinogens, including opioids) increased in proportion to suicides for both sexes, although females were consistently higher. The undetermined death to suicide ratio was higher and increasing for females. Poisonings of undetermined intent increased over time to comprise 47% to 80% of the undetermined death category for males and females combined.
   Conclusions: Canadian poisoning suicide rates declined, in contrast to rising unintentional and undetermined poisoning mortality rates. This trend is similar to that of the United States, supporting the hypothesis that misclassification of poisoning deaths may also be an issue in Canada.

AB Epidemiological data shows an alarming prevalence of suicide in Aboriginal populations around the world. In Canada, the highest rates are found in Inuit communities. In this article, we present the findings of a secondary analysis conducted with data previously collected as part of a larger study of psychological autopsies conducted in Nunavut, Canada. The objective of this secondary analysis was to identify protective factors in the Inuit population of Nunavut by comparing people who died by suicide, people from the general population who attempted suicide, and people from the general population who never attempted suicide. This case-control study included 90 participants, with 30 participants in each group who were paired by birth date, sex, and community. Content analysis was first conducted on the clinical vignettes from the initial study in order to codify the presence of protective variables. Then, inferential analyses were conducted to highlight differences between each group in regards to protection. Findings demonstrated that (a) people with no suicide attempt have more protective variables throughout their lifespan than people who died by suicide and those with suicide attempts within the environmental, social, and individual dimensions; (b) people with suicide attempts significantly differ from the two other groups in regards to the use of services; and (c) protective factors that stem from the environmental dimension show the greatest difference between the three groups, being significantly more present in the group with no suicide attempt. Considering these findings, interventions could focus on enhancing environmental stability in Inuit communities as a suicide prevention strategy.

DE suicide; belonging; aboriginal; culture; New Zealand Maori
AB This perspective article describes the problem of Canadian indigenous suicide from a non-Canadian viewpoint. In particular, the article compares both similarities and differences in suicide prevention between maori in New Zealand and indigenous peoples in Canada. It emphasises that the problem of indigenous suicide is not being indigenous but coping with losses secondary to colonisation. A useful way to translate this into helpful clinical conversations and actions is to think about loss of belonging. Culture and belonging are key components of identity and as such should be considered in all psychiatric encounters, not just in those who are considered minorities or other. The article concludes by suggesting how some of the experiences of addressing health inequalities and suicide in maori may be applied in Canada.

DT Article
DE alcohol; Canada; suicide; time-series analyses
ID UNITED-STATES; CONSUMPTION; MORTALITY; RATES
AB Studies suggest that the population level link between alcohol and suicide differs across countries and between men and women. The aim of this paper was to estimate the relationship between alcohol consumption and suicide in Canada and to put the results in a comparative perspective. The relationship was elucidated for whole Canada, different provinces and also separately for men and women. The total suicide rate in Canada increased signicantly by around 4% as alcohol consumption increased by one litre per capita, suggesting that approximately 25 - 30% of Canadian suicides were related to alcohol. The relationship was stronger for women than for men. A signicant effect was found in all provinces except from Quebec, but the overall regional variation was not statistically signicant. In an international perspective, the relationship for women was somewhat weaker than in Sweden and Norway, but larger than in Finland, the United States and Southern European countries. For men, the association was similar to what is found in the United States and Finland, weaker than in Sweden, Norway and Russia but stronger than in Southern European countries. The results only partly support the idea that intoxication frequency explains national differences in this relationship. Possible explanations for the stronger association among women are also discussed.

ID HOMICIDE; FIREARMS; RATES; GENDER
AB Suicide is a multiply determined behavior, calling for diverse prevention efforts. Gun control has been proposed as an important component of society's response, and an opportunity for studying the effects of legislative gun control laws on suicide rates was provided by Canada's Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1977 (Bill C-51). This article reviews previous studies of the impact of this act on the total population of Canada and subpopulations by age and gender and, in addition, presents the results of 2 new studies: a different method of analysis, an interrupted time-series analysis, and the results of a multiple regression analysis that controls for some social variables. It appears that Bill C-51 may have had an impact on suicide rates, even after controls for social variables.

TI Is tetraethyl lead poison affecting contemporary indigenous suicides in

SO PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Prior to the mid-1980s, suicide in Indigenous population in Northwestern Ontario, Canada, was rare, occurring at rates of 1-2 per year among over 20 communities. By the early 1990s, the completed suicide rates in the same communities were among the highest in the world. Prior to the outbreak of the suicide epidemic, sniffing of gasoline containing tetraethyl was common in many communities. Existing literature confirms that tetraethyl lead poisoning is associated with alterations to the amyloid-P protein precursor and amyloid-beta as well as the 5-HT-1B receptor. The presence of this risk factor within the population warrants further inquiry.

AB A reliability check of Lester's (2000b) 1970-1995 time series that examined associations between the availability of firearms and their use for homicide and suicide in Canada. For the period 1974 to 1999, the relative availability of firearms as measured by the rate of accidental death from firearms and the average of the percentages of suicides +homicides using firearms was positively associated with the rate of homicide by firearms but not negatively associated with the rate of homicide by all other methods, and positively associated with the rate of suicide by firearms and negatively associated with the rate of suicide by all other methods. Correlations for the homicide versus murder rates, homicide rate using guns versus murder rate using guns, and homicide rate by all other methods versus murder rate by all other methods were very similar. There was a decrease over time of total suicide and homicide rates and firearm suicide and homicide rates, and with a slight indication of substitution of other methods for suicide.

AB Indigenous peoples in Canada experience disproportionate rates of suicide compared to non-Indigenous populations. Indigenous communities and organizations have designed local and regional approaches to prevention, and the federal government has developed a national suicide prevention framework. However, public health systems continue to face challenges in monitoring the population burden of suicide and suicidal behaviour. National health data systems lack Indigenous identifiers, do not capture data from some regions, and do not routinely engage Indigenous communities in data governance. These challenges hamper efforts to detect changes in population-level outcomes and assess the impact of suicide prevention activities. Consequently, this limits the ability to achieve public health prevention goals and reduce suicide rates and rate inequities.
   This paper provides a critical analysis of the challenges related to suicide surveillance in Canada and assesses the strengths and limitations of existing data infrastructure for monitoring outcomes in Indigenous communities. To better understand these challenges, we discuss the policy context for suicide surveillance and examine the survey and administrative data sources that are commonly used in public health surveillance. We then review recent data on the epidemiology of suicide and suicidal behaviour among Indigenous populations, and identify challenges related to national surveillance.
   To enhance capacity for suicide surveillance, we propose strategies to better track progress in Indigenous suicide prevention. Specifically, we recommend establishing an independent community and scientific governing council, integrating Indigenous identifiers into population health datasets, increasing geographic coverage, improving suicide data quality, comprehensiveness, and timeliness, and developing a platform for making suicide data accessible to all stakeholders. Overall, the strategies we propose can build on the strengths of the existing national suicide surveillance system by adopting a collaborative and inclusive governance model that recognizes the stake Indigenous communities have in suicide prevention.

AB Colonization has left in its wake alarming suicide rates for Indigenous youth. The suicide rate of Indigenous youth in Canada is five to six times higher than their non-Indigenous counterparts. This article presents the findings of a research project that explored and promoted wellness and life promotion with Indigenous youth living on a reserve in Saskatchewan, Canada. Data collection occurred through an arts-based workshop, where youth collectively created stories about healing, life, relationships, hope, and ceremony. Specifically, authors discuss a two-eyed seeing approach and emphasize the importance of cultural continuity, cultural connectedness, and cultural revitalization when considering the process in which leisure programmes and services are organized.

AB Objectives To examine whether significant changes in method-specific male suicide rates occurred in the province of Quebec after stronger firearms regulations were introduced in Canada in 1991; to ascertain whether more stringent firearms regulations influence firearms and total suicide trends among men and to determine whether different results are obtained according to the statistical methods used.
   Study design Descriptive analyses of time trends in method-specific suicide rates for men from 1981 to 2006 using Joinpoint regression models and pre-post firearms regulation analyses.
   Setting Quebec (Canada).
   Patients or Subjects Men who have commited suicide aged 15-34, 35-64 and 65 years and over, based on the Quebec mortality database, 1981-2006.
   Interventions A national firearms control initiative enacted in 1991.
   Results The Joinpoint regression models suggest that firearm suicide rates declined towards the end of the 1990s. Since 1996, the pace of decline was twice as great in men aged 15-34 years (annual percentage change (APC) - 11.1%) compared with men aged 35-64 years (APC - 5.6%). Total suicide rates also declined among men aged 15-34 and 35-64 years during this period. Pre-post firearms regulation Poisson regression analyses failed to detect the specific point in time when significant changes in the trend occurred.
   Conclusions Male firearm suicide rates declined following the introduction of restrictive firearms regulations in Canada. Whether this represents a causal relationship requires further study.

AB Background: Suicide is the second leading cause of death for young Canadians (1019 years of age) - a disturbing trend that has shown little improvement in recent years. Our objective was to examine suicide trends among Canadian children and adolescents.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of standardized suicide rates using Statistics Canada mortality data for the period spanning from 1980 to 2008. We analyzed the data by sex and by suicide method over time for two age groups: 10-14 year olds (children) and 15-19 year olds (adolescents). We quantified annual trends by calculating the average annual percent change (AAPC).
   Results: We found an average annual decrease of 1.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.5 to -0.4) in the suicide rate for children and adolescents, but stratification by age and sex showed significant variation. We saw an increase in suicide by suffocation among female children (AAPC = 8.1%, 95% CI 6.0 to 10.4) and adolescents (AAPC = 8.0%, 95% CI 6.2 to 9.8). In addition, we noted a decrease in suicides involving poisoning and firearms during the study period.
   Interpretation: Our results show that suicide rates in Canada are increasing among female children and adolescents and decreasing among male children and adolescents. Limiting access to lethal means has some potential to mitigate risk. However, suffocation, which has become the predominant method for committing suicide for these age groups, is not amenable to this type of primary prevention.

AB Annual suicide deaths outnumber the total deaths from homicide and war combined. Suicide is a complex behavioral endpoint, and a simple cause-and-effect model seems highly unlikely, but relationships with weather could yield important insight into the biopsychosocial mechanisms involved in suicide deaths. This study has been designed to test for a relationship between air temperature and suicide frequency that is consistent enough to offer some predictive abilities. Weekly suicide death totals and anomalies from Toronto, Ontario, Canada (1986-2009) and Jackson, Mississippi, USA (1980-2006) are analyzed for relationships by using temperature anomaly data and a distributed lag nonlinear model. For both analysis methods, anomalously cool weeks show low probabilities of experiencing high-end suicide totals while warmer weeks are more likely to experience high-end suicide totals. This result is consistent for Toronto and Jackson. Weekly suicide totals demonstrate a sufficient association with temperature anomalies to allow some prediction of weeks with or without increased suicide frequency. While this finding alone is unlikely to have immediate clinical implications, these results are an important step toward clarifying the biopsychosocial mechanisms of suicidal behavior through a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between temperature and suicide.

AB Background: The Province of Quebec, Canada (PQ), witnessed a drastic rise in suicide among adult men between 1990 and 2000, followed by a continuous drop since then. At the end of the 1990s, men's suicide became recognized as a social issue, leading to implementation of gender-responsive strategies focusing on positive aspects of masculinity. Many of these strategies received positive assessments. Aims: This article offers a critical overview of the evolution of social responses to men's suicide in PQ. Method: We highlight elements of success with examples of interventions targeting men directly, professionals who work with men, and natural support networks of men. Results: Results and discussion suggest the benefits to shift towards salutogenic, gender-transformative approach to men's suicide prevention. Conclusion: Closing remarks question the current gaps and upcoming challenges in suicide prevention among men.

ID TRAIN SUICIDES; SYSTEM; NETHERLANDS; PATTERNS; BEHAVIOR
AB This study presents and compares the prevalence and characteristics of rail-related suicide and other railway fatalities in Canada over 10 years, from 1999 to 2008. The methodology involved in-depth data analysis of records from provincial coroner and medical examiner's investigations, railway company reports and Transportation Safety Board data. We identify physical risk factors and psychosocial descriptions of people who commit suicide and compared them to accidental (non-suicide). railway fatalities in order to identify at-risk populations and better target and elaborate railway suicide prevention strategies. We identified 460 accidental deaths and 428 suicides. Most people (94.7%) died on the site of the incident, although not always immediately. Canada does not have any specific locations with high incidence suicide or accidents clusters. We conclude that impairment of some type, by illness, substance abuse or intoxication, advanced age or immature youth, play an important role in a significant number of accidents, suggesting that more intense warnings of approaching trains may help prevent accidental deaths. Mental illness, although often being treated, is associated with the majority of suicide fatalities, and more than one-third of suicides occur on rails near psychiatric facilities, suggesting targeted prevention strategies in facilities near rails and at track locations in proximity to mental health facilities. What is already known on this subject:
   - In other countries we have basic data on location, time and date, gender, age and some basic epidemiological characteristics of railway fatalities, usually combining suicides and accidental fatalities in studies of collisions or Person Under Train (PUT) incidents.
   - Hotspots for suicides have been identified in Europe, often near psychiatric facilities.
   What this study adds:
   - We provide more in-depth information on fatality victims from analyses of detailed coroners' investigations and industry reports on all railway fatalities in Canada over an extended period of ten years.
   - We compare characteristics of deaths by suicide with accident fatalities in order to develop specific recommendations for prevention programmes that consider the specific characteristics of each type of fatality.
   - Our approach provides a model for developing prevention strategies based upon in-depth comparative analyses of suicides and accident fatalities to adapt prevention approaches to characteristics unique to a country or location, and the different characteristics of people who die on railways by suicide and in accidental fatalities.

AB Few studies evaluate language-group differences in suicide mortality. This study assessed the suicide mortality gap between Francophones and Anglophones of Quebec, Canada according to age, sex, method, region and socioeconomic deprivation.
   Suicide decedents were extracted from the Quebec death file for 1989-2007 (N = 24,465). Age- and sex-specific suicide mortality rates were calculated for four periods (1989-1993, 1994-1998, 1999-2003, 2004-2007) for Francophones and Anglophones aged a parts per thousand yen10 years. Age-standardized rates of suicide by method, region, and level of social and material deprivation were calculated for each sex. Rate ratios and rate differences were estimated.
   Suicide rates for Francophones were two to three times higher than rates for Anglophones, and differences were greatest for adults aged 25-64 years. Francophone males had more than two times the rate of suicide by hanging or firearms than Anglophone males. Francophone females had twice the rate of hanging, poisoning or firearm suicide as Anglophone females, although precision was low. Francophone-Anglophone suicide mortality gaps were higher in urban areas despite lower suicide rates, and varied little across levels of social and material deprivation.
   There was a large suicide mortality gap between Francophones and Anglophones of Quebec; especially, among adults aged 25-64 years.

AB Recent reports have suggested a link between low serum total cholesterol and risk of death from suicide. We examined this association using participants in the 1970-1972 Nutrition Canada Survey. We determined the mortality experience of Nutrition Canada Survey participants older than 11 years of age at baseline through 1993 by way of record linkage to the Canadian National Mortality Database. The relation between low serum total cholesterol and mortality from suicide was assessed using a stratified analysis (N = 11,554). There were 27 deaths due to suicide. Adjusting for age and sex, we found that those in the lowest quartile of serum total cholesterol concentration (<4.27 mmol/liter) had more than six times the risk of committing suicide (rate ratio = 6.39; 95%, confidence interval = 1.27-32.1) as did subjects in the highest quartile (>5.77 mmol/liter). Increased rate ratios of 2.95 and 1.94 were observed for the second and third quartiles, respectively. The effect persisted after the exclusion from the analysis of the first 5 years of follow-up and after the removal of those who were unemployed or who had been treated for depression. These data indicate that low serum total cholesterol level is associated with an increased risk of suicide.

AB This paper reviews the sentences dictated between 1993 and 2002 by the Supreme Courts of Canada and the Unites States, the House of Lords and Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the European Human Rights Court, about the validity of the legal prohibition of assistance for suicide. These sentences constituted a judicial consensus about the right to die. This consensus recognized the legal right of patients to reject medical treatments but did not recognize the right to be assisted by a physician to commit suicide. This exclusion is changing in the recent case law of Canada and the United Kingdom, which accepts the fundamental right of terminal patients to medically assisted suicide.

DT Article
DE suicide; media; contagion; Canada
AB Evidence of a media impact on suicide is mixed and needs further research. The main objective of this article is to document the effects of the media coverage following the suicide of a well-known and popular television reporter in Quebec, Canada. A content analysis of the printed media and an analysis of suicide rates during the following year, of coroners' records and of calls to Suicide Prevention Centres during the following 3 months was conducted. Most guidelines for responsible reporting of a suicide were not applied. The results showed a rise in the suicides rates immediately after the reporter's suicide, especially by hanging as in the original case. A cluster of six suicides by hanging also took place in the small municipality where the reporter's suicide occurred. There was also an indication of direct influence in the coroners' records and a rise in calls to Suicide Prevention Centres. This research indicates that the reporting of the suicide of a popular figure preceded an important rise in the number of suicides. A possible theoretical explanation is that a positive role model appeared to suddenly fail to cope with life, thus creating high distress and cognitive dissonance in the audience. The news media should apply more caution and follow recommended guidelines in reporting this type of news. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB It has been theorized that suicide behaviours amongst indigenous peoples may be an outcome of mass trauma experienced as a result of colonization. In Canada, qualitative evidence has suggested that the Indian Residential School System set in motion a cycle of trauma, with some survivors reporting subsequent abuse, suicide, and other related behaviours. It has been further postulated that the effects of trauma can also be passed inter-generationally. Today, there are four generations of Canadian First Nations residential school survivors who may have transmitted the trauma they experienced to their own children and grandchildren. No empirical study has ever been undertaken to demonstrate this dynamic. This study is therefore the first to investigate whether a direct or indirect exposure to Canada's residential school system is associated with trauma and suicide behaviour histories. Data were collected in 2002/2003 from a representative sample of Manitoba, Canada, First Nations adults (N = 2953), including residential (N = 611) and non-residential school attendees (N = 2342). Regression analyses showed that for residential school attendees negative experiences in residential school were associated with a history of abuse, and that this history and being of younger age was associated with a history of suicide thoughts, whereas abuse history only was associated with a history of suicide attempts. For First Nations adults who did not attend a residential school, we found that age 28-44, female sex, not having a partner, and having a parent or grandparent who attended a residential school was associated with a history of abuse. This history, along with age and having had a parent or grandparent who attended residential school was associated with a history of suicide thoughts and attempts. In conclusion, this is the first study to empirically demonstrate, at the population level, the mental health impact of the residential school system on survivors and their children.

AB Inuit youth suicide is at an epidemic level in the circumpolar north. Rapid culture change has left Inuit in a state of coloniality that destabilized their kin-based social organization, and in spite of advances in self-governance social problems such as suicide continue. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork I carried out in Nunavut, Canada (20042005), including 27 interviews with Inuit between the ages of 17 and 61, I examine male youth in particular in the context of recent colonial change, gender ideologies and behavior, youth autonomy, and the family. Anger is common among Inuit male youth, often directed toward girlfriends and parents, and suicide is embedded in some of these relationships. Many Inuit male youth are struggling with a new cultural model of love and sexuality. Inuit speak about a need for more responsible parenting. Evidence is beginning to show, however, that local, community-based suicide prevention may be working.

AB Suicide rates in Canada are highest among rural men. Drawing on photovoice interviews with 13 women and two men living in a small rural Canadian town who lost a man to suicide, we inductively derived three themes to describe how contextual factors influence rural men's experiences of depression and responses to suicidal thoughts: (a) hiding depression and its cause, (b) manly self-medicating, and (c) mobilizing prevention. Further discussed is how gender relations and ideals of masculinity within rural milieu can inhibit men's acknowledgment of and help seeking for mental illness issues. Participants strongly endorsed a multifaceted approach to the destabilization of dominant ideals of masculinity that likely contribute to depression and suicide in rural men.

TI A systematic review of suicide prevention interventions targeting

SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Review
ID ALASKA NATIVE COMMUNITIES; ALCOHOL; BEHAVIOR; PROGRAM; DISEASE; INJURY
AB Background: Indigenous peoples of Australia, Canada, United States and New Zealand experience disproportionately high rates of suicide. As such, the methodological quality of evaluations of suicide prevention interventions targeting these Indigenous populations should be rigorously examined, in order to determine the extent to which they are effective for reducing rates of Indigenous suicide and suicidal behaviours. This systematic review aims to: 1) identify published evaluations of suicide prevention interventions targeting Indigenous peoples in Australia, Canada, United States and New Zealand; 2) critique their methodological quality; and 3) describe their main characteristics.
   Methods: A systematic search of 17 electronic databases and 13 websites for the period 1981-2012 (inclusive) was undertaken. The reference lists of reviews of suicide prevention interventions were hand-searched for additional relevant studies not identified by the electronic and web search. The methodological quality of evaluations of suicide prevention interventions was assessed using a standardised assessment tool.
   Results: Nine evaluations of suicide prevention interventions were identified: five targeting Native Americans; three targeting Aboriginal Australians; and one First Nation Canadians. The main intervention strategies employed included: Community Prevention, Gatekeeper Training, and Education. Only three of the nine evaluations measured changes in rates of suicide or suicidal behaviour, all of which reported significant improvements. The methodological quality of evaluations was variable. Particular problems included weak study designs, reliance on self-report measures, highly variable consent and follow-up rates, and the absence of economic or cost analyses.
   Conclusions: There is an urgent need for an increase in the number of evaluations of preventive interventions targeting reductions in Indigenous suicide using methodologically rigorous study designs across geographically and culturally diverse Indigenous populations. Combining and tailoring best evidence and culturally-specific individual strategies into one coherent suicide prevention program for delivery to whole Indigenous communities and/or population groups at high risk of suicide offers considerable promise.

DE Masculinity; Social inclusion; Suicide prevention; Help-seeking; Men
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore recent research on reducing suicide, especially in men, who are often seen as excluding themselves from needing support, or they are excluded because people think they do not want it.
   Design/methodology/approach -A search was carried out for recent papers on suicide prevention in men.
   Findings - One study of 75 regions of Europe reported a link between higher value on giving social support and lower suicide rates, especially for men. Another study reported on the fall in a previously high suicide rate, especially in men, in Quebec province in Canada. A programme of suicide prevention may have contributed to this reduction. Finally, a small interview study reported on how certain kinds of encounters with professionals can inspire hope to carry on after a suicide attempt.
   Originality/value - The two papers looking at regions (across Europe and one province of Canada) suggest how social forces may contribute to reducing suicide, especially in men. The Canadian study suggests the possibility that suicide might be reduced partly by enabling help-seeking in men to be seen as a positive aspect of masculine identity, rather than seeing masculinity as excluding men from support. The small qualitative study illustrates vividly how individual encounters after a suicide attempt might promote hopefulness and are relevant to both sexes.

   We collected data on suicides and undetermined deaths in 12 countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, England and Wales, Finland, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, and Sweden) directly from their prison administrations for 2003-2007. These were compared with rates of suicides in the general population separately by gender using Pearson's correlations. In addition, they were compared with rates of incarceration. Linear regression was used to examine any association after adjustment for rates of incarceration.
   Data were collected on 861 suicides in prison, of which 810 were in men. In the men, crude relative rates of suicide were at least three times higher than the general population. Western European countries had similar rates of prisoner suicide which were mostly higher than those in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. There was no association between rates of suicide in prisoners and general population rates or rates of incarceration. In the women, inmate suicide rates varied widely and were mostly raised compared with rates in the general population. In addition, these rates did not appear to be associated with general population rates of suicide.
   Rates of prison suicide do not reflect general population suicide rates, suggesting that variations in prison suicide rates reflect differences in criminal justice systems including, possibly, the provision of psychiatric care in prison.

TI Perinatal suicide in Ontario, Canada: a 15-year population-based study

   ADMINISTRATIVE DATA; LEADING CAUSE; PREGNANCY; CERTIFICATES; POSTPARTUM;
   DISORDERS; MORBIDITY
AB BACKGROUND: Death by suicide during the perinatal period has been understudied in Canada. We examined the epidemiology of and health service use related to suicides during pregnancy and the first postpartum year.
   METHODS: In this retrospective, population-based cohort study, we linked health administrative databases with coroner death records (1994-2008) for Ontario, Canada. We compared sociodemographic characteristics, clinical features and health service use in the 30 days and 1 year before death between women who died by suicide perinatally, women who died by suicide outside of the perinatal period and living perinatal women.
   RESULTS: The perinatal suicide rate was 2.58 per 100 000 live births, with suicide accounting for 51 (5.3%) of 966 perinatal deaths. Most suicides occurred during the final quarter of the first postpartum year, with highest rates in rural and remote regions. Perinatal women were more likely to die from hanging (33.3% [17/51]) or jumping or falling (19.6% [10/51]) than women who died by suicide non-perinatally (p = 0.04). Only 39.2% (20/51) had mental health contact within the 30 days before death, similar to the rate among those who died by suicide non-perinatally (47.7% [762/1597]; odds ratio [OR] 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40-1.25). Compared with living perinatal women matched by pregnancy or postpartum status at date of suicide, perinatal women who died by suicide had similar likelihood of non-mental health primary care and obstetric care before the index date but had a lower likelihood of pediatric contact (64.5% [20/31] v. 88.4% [137/155] at 30 days; OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10-0.58).
   INTERPRETATION: The perinatal suicide rate for Ontario during the period 1994-2008 was comparable to international estimates and represents a substantial component of Canadian perinatal mortality. Given that deaths by suicide occur throughout the perinatal period, all health care providers must be collectively vigilant in assessing risk.

AB Background: Aboriginal populations worldwide face increasing rates of suicide. Despite this recurring observation, little research has emerged from Aboriginal settings. Aims: This paper describes the psychosocial and behavioral characteristics of 30 consecutive adult suicides from four First-Nations communities in Quebec, Canada. Method: Psychological autopsies guided by the LEDS with family members of the deceased. Results: Suicide among this group is overrepresented by young single men. Alcohol intoxication at the time of death was reported for 22 cases in association with rapid acting out after the precipitating event for 20. All but two cases had a history of alcohol abuse, and drug use was also present in 23 cases. In 16 cases there had been a previous suicide attempt, 14 of which occurred during the previous year. Themain socio-demographic characteristics of the communities were overcrowded living arrangements and no job status (90%). Seven cases were incarcerated or locked up at the time of death. Clustering of suicide was observed within seven nuclear families including 16 suicides. Conclusion: This study shows that Aboriginal suicide is the result of a complex interweaving of individual, familial, and socio-historical variables. The impact of contemporary social stressors on individual well-being must be addressed to prevent suicide in this community.

ID TELEMEDICINE PROGRAM
AB The 2015 Carter v Canada (Attorney General) case radically changed end-of-life care in Canada. This groundbreaking decision legalized physician-assisted suicide for competent adults who meet certain clinical criteria and who consent to their termination of life. The federal government then passed its legislative response, Bill C-14, to change the Criminal Code and legalize medical assistance in dying. Since Bill C-14 was enacted, the health care community has struggled to ensure that its implementation occurs in a legally compliant, patient-centered manner. This article focuses on the challenges of this new law for nurse practitioners, especially those in rural and remote communities.

ID ATTITUDES; FACTS
AB The responses of 70 trainees in suicide intervention to 10 Suicide Opinion Questionnaire items were evaluated for accuracy of their knowledge about suicide myths. Participants were Canadian adults (62 women, 8 men, M-age = 35 yr.) representing a wide variety of occupations and educational backgrounds. Analysis indicated knowledge for most items was high but less accurate for items concerning the most common method of suicide and suicide risk across the lifespan. Those trained in suicide intervention were more knowledgeable on four items than those awaiting training; they more frequently knew that most suicides are not triggered by an argument with a spouse, people who are depressed are more likely to commit suicide, a person whose parent has committed suicide is at greater risk for suicide, and that shooting is the most common method of suicide in Canada.

AB Suicide is a complex and tragic outcome driven by biological, psychological, social and cultural factors. Women of Chinese descent and women who have immigrated to other countries have higher rates of suicidal ideation and behaviour, and immigration-related stress may contribute. To understand the experiences of immigration and their relationship with distress and suicide-related behaviour in Chinese women who have immigrated to Canada. 10 semi-structured qualitative interviews with Chinese women who have immigrated to Toronto, Canada and have a history of suicide-related behaviour were completed and analyzed using a constructivist grounded theory methodology. Immigration-related and acculturation stress stemmed from unmet expectations and harsh realities. These repeated experiences resulted in hopelessness, helplessness, and alienation, which are risk factors for suicide and suicide-related behaviour. However, immigration-related support can also increase hope, self-efficacy and connectedness to foster recovery and resilience. This is the first qualitative study focusing on immigration experiences and its relationship to suicide-related behaviour in Chinese immigrant women. Knowledge of immigration and acculturation stressors can a) help identify and support women at risk for suicide and b) form a target for social intervention for all immigrant women, regardless of suicide risk.

AB On February 6, 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the prohibition of physician-assisted death (PAD) was unconstitutional for a competent adult person who "clearly consents to the termination of life" and has a "grievous and irremediable (including an illness, disease, or disability) condition that causes enduring suffering that is intolerable to the individual in the circumstances of his or her condition."(1) The radically subjective nature of this ruling raises important questions about who will be involved and how this practice might be regulated. This paper aims to stimulate discussion about psychiatry's role in this heretofore illegal practice and to explore how psychiatry might become involved in end-of-life care in a meaningful, patient-centred way. First, I will review existing international legislation and professional regulatory standards regarding psychiatry and PAD. Second, I will discuss important challenges psychiatry might face regarding capacity assessment, the notion of rational suicide, and the assessment of suffering.

AB BACKGROUND: Indigenous peoples in Canada have high rates of psychological distress and suicide. We sought to assess the socioeconomic inequalities in psychological distress and suicidal behaviours, and the factors that explain them within Indigenous peoples living off-reserve. METHODS: Using the nationally representative 2012 Aboriginal Peoples Survey collected from Indigenous adults living off-reserve in Canada, we measured income-related inequalities in psychological distress (measured on the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale) and suicidal behaviours (suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) and identified factors contributing to these inequalities using the concentration index (C) approach. RESULTS: Among 14 410 individuals representing 600 750 Indigenous adults (aged >= 18 yr) living off-reserve in Canada, the mean score of psychological distress was 16.1; 19.4% reported lifetime suicidal ideation and 2.2% reported a lifetime suicide attempt. Women had higher psychological distress scores (mean score 16.7 v. 15.2, p < 0.001), and prevalence of suicidal ideation (21.9% v. 16.1%, p < 0.001) and suicide attempts (2.3% v. 2.0%, p = 0.002) than men. Poorer individuals disproportionately experienced higher psychological distress (C = -0.054, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.057 to -0.050), suicidal ideation (C-n = -0.218, 95% CI -0.242 to -0.194) and suicide attempts (C-n = -0.327, 95% CI -0.391 to -0.263). Food insecurity and income, respectively, accounted for 40.2% and 13.7% of the psychological distress, 26.7% and 18.2% of the suicidal ideation and 13.4% and 7.8% of the suicide attempts concentrated among low-income Indigenous peoples. INTERPRETATION: Substantial income-related inequalities in psychological distress and suicidal behaviours exist among Indigenous peoples living off-reserve in Canada. Policies designed to address major contributing factors such as food insecurity and income may help reduce these inequalities.

ID COMPLETED SUICIDE; ALASKA; YOUTH
AB Inuit suicide is the most significant mental health issue in the newly created Nunavut Territory of Canada's eastern Arctic. Suicide rates in Nunavut are 6 times those of Canada's southern provinces. Consistent with other Canadian populations, males aged 15-29 years of age are most at risk.
   Various social constructions have been used to make sense of Inuit suicide, a phenomenon of historical interest to anthropologists, who popularized the idea of elderly Inuit voluntarily abandoning their lives to the elements so as not to burden their surviving relatives. An examination of the literature and research dealing with Inuit suicide suggests that three typologies have typically been used to explain the problem: organic or quasi-organic explanations, social explanations involving concepts of social change and social disruption, and socio-psychological models of two types; a risk assessment approach focusing on the circumstances surrounding the deceased or the person with suicidal thoughts and another dealing with norms, values, thought processes and relationships within Inuit culture.
   We argue that these approaches offer incomplete explanations of the current problem. Attempts to complete the picture by identifying risk factors have produced contradictory and unsatisfactory results. We conclude that the impact of colonial relations of ruling has much to do with the current problem and advocate an approach that combines narrative research and intergenerational communication with community action to address the problem. Low Inuit inuusittiaqarniq (self-esteem) is an important factor in Inuit suicide, but rather than a psychological problem, has its roots in a history of colonialism, paternalism and historical events.

AB Three theories have been proposed to explain the relationship between suicide and economic fluctuations, including the Durkheim (nonlinear), Ginsberg (procyclical), and Henry and Short (countercyclical) theories. This study tested the effect of economic fluctuations, measured by unemployment rate, on suicide rates in Canada from 1926 to 2008. Autoregressive integrated moving average time-series models were used. The results showed a significant relationship between suicide and economic fluctuation; this association was positive during the contraction period (1926-1950) and negative in the period of economic expansion (1951-1973). Males and females showed differential effects in the period of moderate unemployment (1974-2008). In addition, the suicide rate of mid-adults (45-64) was most impacted by economic fluctuations. Our study tends to support Durkheim's theory and suggests the need for public health responses in times of economic contraction and expansion.

AB Introduction: The epidemiology of attempted suicide has not been well characterized because of lack of national data or an International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code for suicide attempts. We conducted a retrospective chart review in 2 adult general hospitals (tertiary and community) in Montreal, Canada, in 2009-2010 to 1) describe the characteristics of men and women who presented to the emergency department (ED) and/or were hospitalized following a suicide attempt, 2) identify factors associated with attempts requiring hospitalizations, and 3) validate the use of International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes for "intentional self-harm'' as a method to detect suicide attempts from hospital abstract summary records.
   Method: All potential suicide attempts were identified from hospital abstract summary records and ED nursing triage file using ICD-10 codes and keywords suggestive of suicide attempts. All identified charts were examined, and those with confirmed suicide attempts were fully reviewed.
   Results: Of the 5746 identified charts, 369 were fully reviewed. Of these, 176 were for suicide attempters treated in the ED and 193 for hospitalized attempters, of whom 46% had an ICD-10 code for intentional self-harm. Poisoning (46%) was the most frequent method of suicide used. Half of attempters were younger than 34 years, 53% were female, and 75% had a history of mental disorders.
   Conclusion: About half of individuals who seek medical care for attempted suicide are admitted to hospital. About half of attempters use poisoning as a method of suicide, and a quarter do not have a history of mental disorders. Intentional self-harm codes capture only about half of hospitalized attempters.

TI Current trends in youth suicide and firearms regulations
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SANTE PUBLIQUE
LA English
DT Article
DE adolescent; suicide; firearms; Canada
AB Background: Despite numerous prevention initiatives, suicide remains the second leading cause of death in youth aged 10-19. One of the major prevention strategies is the introduction of restrictive firearms regulations. For example, Bill C-17 was enacted in 1991 to promote safer handling and storage of firearms through mandatory safety courses for all new gun owners. Examining the suicide rates subsequent to Bill C-17 may shed light on the possible benefit of these regulations as a solution to this major public health issue. Therefore, this paper examines the trends in youth suicide from 1979-1999 and the association with changes in the firearms act in 1991.
   Methods: Age-specific suicide rates for youth between 15-19 years and rates by methods of suicide were calculated based on data from Statistics Canada for the years 1979-1999. Time series analyses were conducted.
   Results: Although the overall rates did not change from 1979-1999 in youth aged 15-19, there was a substantial change in the methods used. In particular, the rates of suicide by firearms dropped from 60% to 22% while suicide due to hanging/suffocation increased from 20% to 60% in this age group over this period of time.
   Conclusion: These results suggest a possible association between changes in the firearms act in 1991 and the methods used by youth to complete suicide. However, the overall rates of suicides did not change over this same period. These trends underscore the need for broader prevention interventions that do not solely focus on methods of suicide but rather, their underlying causes.

AB Suicide is a major public health issue in Canada. The quality of health care services, in addition to other individual and population factors, has been shown to affect suicide rates. In publicly managed care systems, such as systems in Canada and the United Kingdom, the quality of health care is manifested at the individual, program and system levels. Suicide audits are used to assess health care services in relation to the deaths by suicide at individual level and when aggregated at the program and system levels.
   Large health administrative databases comprise another data source used to inform population-based decisions at the system, program and individual levels regarding mental health services that may affect the risk of suicide. This status report paper describes a project we are conducting at the Institut national de sante publique du Quebec (INSPQ) with the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System (QICDSS) in collaboration with colleagues from Wales (United Kingdom) and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.
   This study describes the development of quality of care indicators at three levels and the corresponding statistical analysis strategies designed. We propose 13 quality of care indicators, including system-level and several population-level determinants, primary care treatment, specialist care, the balance between care sectors, emergency room utilization, and mental health and addiction budgets, that may be drawn from a chronic disease surveillance system.

Canada's first forum on this important issue was held in Toronto on November 6, 2015. Participating in the forum were public health policy-makers, mental health and suicide prevention experts and senior media representatives. This commentary summarizes the content of the forum and highlights the need for ongoing collaboration between suicide prevention experts and media professionals aimed at safe and respectful reporting that maintains the public's need to be informed.

The authors comment on the ubiquity of single homicide-suicide across cultures, the incidence of single homicide-suicide in various cultures, the common patterns and differences in single homicide-suicides across cultures, ethnic and gender differences in single homicide-suicide within different cultures, characteristics of the phenomenon of mass murder followed by suicide and ethnic differences within this type of homicide-suicide, and differences in suicidal patterns in different cultures. Suicide and suicide preceded by homicide (single or multiple) are so rare, it is currently impossible to draw any substantive conclusions about the incidence of these phenomena in various contexts; however, ideas for consideration in addressing homicide-suicide are provided.

AB In the Province of Quebec (Canada), adolescents involved with the child welfare and juvenile justice systems committed at least one third of all completed suicides in their age group in 1995 and 1996. Their risk of suicide, standardized for age and sex, was five times that of the general adolescent population, and female juvenile delinquents had the highest relative risk of suicide (36.1). Cumulated risk factors may explain those results. Since 40% of those suicides did occur when subjects were still actively involved with the child welfare and juvenile justice systems, those agencies should revise their suicide prevention strategies.

AB One hundred and ten cases of suicidal suffocation rising a plastic bag were identified in the files of the Office of the Chief Coroner of Ontario, Canada, between 1993 and 1997. The records were reviewed to determine the demographic characteristics of this group compared with all cases of suicide in Ontario, the scene information, autopsy findings and toxicology results. Mast suicides occurred in people over 60 years of age, with older women making up a considerable proportion of cases as compared with other methods of suicide. In 40% of cases the deceased wets suffering from a serious illness. Autopsy findings were usually minimal, with facial, conjunctival and visceral petechiae present in a minority of cases. One or more drugs were detected in the blood in 92.6% of eases where toxicologic testing was performed. Benzodiazepines, diphenhydramine and antidepressants were the most common drugs found, with diphenhydramine the most common drug present at an elevated concentration. Information at the scene from "right to die" societies was uncommon. One quarter of decedents took additional measures, besides the use of drugs or alcohol, to ensure the rapidity, certainty or comfort of their death. This study further elucidates the characteristics of this uncommon method of suicide. It emphasizes additional scene findings, such as the presence of dust masks, physical restraints and modification of the plastic bag that may be of use to death investigators in determining the correct manner of death.

DT Article
AB Between 1892 and 1960, most suicide verdicts rendered during coroners' inquests labelled death by a person's own hand as "suicide while of unsound mind." During this period, psychiatrists increasingly determined the degree to which individuals who attempted to kill themselves could be considered criminally responsible for their actions or not responsible by reason of mental illness. To elucidate this gradual transition from state to medical authority over suicide in Canada, we analyse narratives of responsibility found in "suicide notes" appended to coroners' inquests, particularly ways in which the act of suicide was construed by individuals who committed suicide as a rational decision or an individual right and not as a moment of madness or a criminal act.

AB Since the Carter judgment in 2015, voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal in Canada. The purpose of this article is to analyze the relevance of making people with mental disorders eligible for medical aid in dying (MAD). The text consists of three parts. The first part presents the history of the legalization of the MAD in Canada. In the second part, we discuss the extension of the MAD to individuals suffering from mental disorders. We then insist on five aspects: the MAD and suicide in Quebec, suicide's place in the values of Quebec society, a reflection on rational suicide and the impact of mental health on the ability to make decisions, the respect of the laws and their application as well as assisted suicide of people with mental disorders in Belgium and the Netherlands. In the third part, we suggest four recommendations: to extend the requests to cases with mental disorders whose suffering is refractory to all care, to increase the minimum delay for the treatment of these requests, to systematically include a mental health specialist and to involve the loved ones throughout the process.

AB We investigated changes in the proportion of firearm suicides in Western countries since the 1980s and the relation of these changes to the change in the proportion of: households owning firearms. Several countries had an obvious decline in firearm suicides: Norway, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia; and New Zealand. Multilevel modeling of longitudinal data confirmed the effect of the proportion of households owning firearms. Legislation and regulatory measures reducing the availability of firearms in private households can distinctly strengthen the prevention of firearm suicides.

AB Background: Over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics are frequently used in suicide attempts. Accessibility, toxicity, and unsupervised acquisition of large amounts may be facilitators. Aims: To identify patient characteristics associated with OTC drug use as a suicide attempt method among adults. "Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted using chart review of all individuals who presented to the emergency department (ED) of two adult general hospitals following a suicide attempt during 2009-2010 in Montreal, Canada. Results: Among the 369 suicide attempters identified, 181 used overdosing, 47% of whom used OTC drugs. In logistic regression, women and those with medical comorbidity were more likely to use overdosing, while those with substance use disorders were less likely to do so. Among those who overdosed, women were more likely to use OTC drugs, while those who were Caucasian, had children, comorbidities, diagnoses with substance use disorders, and made attempts in the Fall were less likely to do so. Substances most frequently used were: acetaminophen among OTC drugs (30%); antidepressants (37%), anxiolytics (30%), opioids (10%), and anticonvulsants (9%) among prescription drugs; and cocaine (10%) among recreational drugs. Limitations: Reasons for the suicide method choice were not available. Conclusion: OTC drugs, in particular acetaminophen, are frequently used in suicide attempts. Accessibility to these drugs may be an important contributor.

AB Although male suicide has received research attention, the gendered experiences of men bereaved by male suicide are poorly understood. Addressing this knowledge gap, we share findings drawn from a photovoice study of Canadian-based men who had lost a male friend, partner, or family member to suicide. Two categories depicting the men's overall account of the suicide were inductively derived: (a) unforeseen suicide and (b) rationalized suicide. The unforeseen suicides referred to deaths that occurred without warning wherein participants spoke to tensions between having no idea that the deceased was at risk while reflecting on what they might have done to prevent the suicide. In contrast, rationalized suicides detailed an array of preexisting risk factors including mental illness and/or substance overuse to discuss cause-effect scenarios. Commonalities in unforeseen and rationalized suicides are discussed in the overarching theme, managing emotions whereby participants distanced themselves, but also drew meaning from the suicide.

ID HISTORICAL TRAUMA; RISK-FACTORS; CANADA; INUIT
AB A debate that took place in France in the early 20th century still has much to tell us about the interpretation and strategies of intervention of suicide, particularly the cohort effect of aboriginal youth suicide. The act of suicide, for Durkheim, was inseparable from the problem of social cohesion, with extremes in solidarity and regulation predictably reflected in high rates of suicide. For Gabriel Tarde, by contrast, suicide was seen as an outcome of changeable ideas found in processes of innovation and imitation among creatively receptive individuals. This latter approach remains overlooked in favor of a growing reliance on conceptions of historical trauma and conditions of social disintegration. Recognizing the idea of suicide itself as a potential locus of solidarity opens up other possibilities for responding to and intervening in suicide crises or clusters.

AB Inuit in Canada have among the highest suicide rates in the world, and it is primarily among their youth. Risk factors include known ones such as depression, substance use, a history of abuse, and knowing others who have made attempts or have killed themselves, however of importance are the negative effects of colonialism. This took place for Inuit primarily during the government era starting in the 1950s, when Inuit were moved from their family-based land camps to crowded settlements run by white men, and children were removed from their parents and placed into residential or day schools. This caused more disorganization than reorganization. The most negative effect of this colonialism/imperialism for Inuit has been on their family and sexual relationships. Many Inuit youth feel alone and rejected. Suicide prevention has been taking place, the most successful being community-driven programs developed and run by Inuit. Mental health factors for Indigenous peoples are often cultural. It is recommended that practitioners work with the community and with Inuit organizations. Empowered communities can be healing.

   TRENDS
AB Objectives Unemployment has been repeatedly associated with suicide; however, whether the association is causal remains unclear. Little is known about the relationship between part-time work and either attempted or completed suicide. The objective of this study was to compare the relationships of unemployment, part-time work, nonlaborforce participation, and full-time work with attempted suicide.
   Methods This study utilized a database consisting of 27446 potential laborforce participants that combines information on health care utilization in Manitoba, Canada, with detailed information from the 1986 census. Persons who attempted suicide after the census (N=144) were identified using established definitions based on hospital claims to identify serious attempts only.
   Results Step-wise multiple logistic regression, which controlled for multiple confounding variables, revealed that unemployment [odds ratio (OR) 3.68, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.76-7.71, part-time work (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.07-3.71) and being out of the labor force (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.12-3.97)] were all associated with attempted suicide. A dose-response relationship was observed between weeks worked in 1985 and suicide attempts after the census.
   Conclusions All three groups of those who were not working full-time had an elevated likelihood of attempted suicide after adjustment for potential confounding factors This finding suggests that working full-time is protective against suicide attempts. Suicide attempts related to lack of full-time work may be more preventable than other causes of attempted suicide and may be decreased by social policies that limit "under" and unemployment.

AB Objective: To review the research on the epidemiology, risk and resiliency, assessment, treatment, and prevention of late-life suicide.
   Method: I reviewed mortality statistics. I searched MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases for research on suicide risk and resiliency and for randomized controlled trials with suicidal outcomes. I also reviewed mental health outreach and suicide prevention initiatives.
   Results: Approximately 12/100000 individuals aged 65 years or over die by suicide in Canada annually. Suicide is most prevalent among older white men; risk is associated with suicidal ideation or behaviour, mental illness, personality vulnerability, medical illness, losses and poor social supports, functional impairment, and low resiliency. Novel measures to assess late-life suicide features are under development. Few randomized treatment trials exist with at-risk older adults.
   Conclusions: Research is needed on risk and resiliency and clinical assessment and interventions for at-risk older adults. Collaborative outreach strategies might aid suicide prevention.

AB Canadian Bill C-17 was implemented in 1991 to restrict the use of firearms, providing a chance to investigate the effect of firearm control laws in the use of firearms for suicide and homicide. Following Lester and Leenaars' comprehensive studies, the present study examined the use of firearms for suicide and homicide during the period prior to the bill and during the period after the passing of Bill C-17 to assess the association of the bill with rates of suicide and homicide by method. Analysis showed a significant decrease after passage of Bill C-17 in the rates of suicides and homicides involving firearms and the percentage of suicides using firearms. The analysis provides support for the position that restricting the availability of firearms as a lethal means of committing suicide and homicide may help reduce the numbers of suicides and homicides.

AB Background Suicide rates can vary quite considerably and attitudes regarding suicide may explain part of the variation. Method The present study investigated, across the 17 regions of Quebec (Canada), men's attitudes towards suicide, expressing pain and help seeking, as they are related to suicide rates and sociodemographic variables (unemployment, divorce/separation, income and education). Results Most correlations were non-significant. However, in regions with an above-average educational level and with higher divorce/separation rates, men had better attitudes towards expressing pain. Furthermore, in regions where men were more inclined to express pain, suicide rates were lower. Also, significant positive correlations were found between suicide rates and low educational level, but also between an increase in suicide rates and an increase in income level. Conclusions Where the aetiology of suicide is concerned, researchers must examine both sociodemographic factors and the psychological factors associated with them.

AB Severe depression is a known risk factor for suicide, yet worldwide men's suicide rates continue to outnumber reported rates of men's depression. While acknowledging that the pathways to suicide are diverse, and being mindful of the complex challenges inherent to studying suicide, we interviewed men who experienced depression as a means to better understanding the processes they used to counter and contemplate suicide. This novel qualitative study provides insights on how masculine roles, identities and relations mediate depression-related suicidal ideation in a cohort of 38 men in Canada, ranging in age from 24 to 50 years-old. Constant comparative analyses yielded the core category of reconciling despair in which men responded to severe depression and suicidal ideation by following two pathways. To counter suicide actions, connecting with family, peers and health care professionals and/or drawing on religious and moral beliefs were important interim steps for quelling thoughts about suicide and eventually dislocating depression from self-harm. This pathway revealed how connecting with family through masculine protector and father roles enabled men to avoid suicide while positioning help-seeking as a wise, rational action in re-establishing self-control. The other pathway, contemplating escape, rendered men socially isolated and the overuse of alcohol and other drugs were often employed to relieve emotional, mental and physical pain. Rather than providing respite, these risky practices were the gateway to men's heightened vulnerability for nonfatal suicidal behaviour. Men on this pathway embodied solitary and/or risk taker identities synonymous with masculine ideals but juxtaposed nonfatal suicidal behaviours as feminine terrain.

AB BackgroundMigraine has been associated with mental illness, and may also be associated with increased risk of suicidal behavior.
   ObjectiveThe aim of this article was to examine the association between migraine headache and self-harm and suicide mortality using population-based health administrative data from Ontario, Canada.
   MethodsThe sample included 101,114 participants in a population-based health survey in the province of Ontario, Canada, who responded to the survey in 2003, 2005, or 2007, and provided health card numbers for linkage to population-based health administrative data. Participants self-reported a physician diagnosis of migraine headache. Heath administrative data were used to calculate (1) Follow-up time until first presentation to the emergency department for intentional self-harm; (2) Follow-up time until death by suicide. Proportional subdistribution hazards regression was used to compare time until death among those with and without history of migraine, after accounting for competing risks of death and adjusting for confounders.
   ResultsPhysician diagnosis of migraine was reported by 11.2% of the sample (11,314 individuals). Mean follow-up time was 7.3 years. Emergency department visits for self-harm during the follow-up period were almost 50% more likely in those with migraine (76.4 vs 35.7 per 100,000 person years; adjusted hazard ratio=1.48; 95%CI: 1.11,1.96). Death by suicide was rare with only 55 suicides in the follow-up period (7.45 per 100,000 person-years). Risk of suicide was similar for both those with and without history of migraine headache (adjusted hazard ratio=0.60; 95%CI: 0.22,1.65).
   ConclusionsPhysician diagnosis of migraine headache was found to be prospectively associated with increased risk of deliberate self-harm, but there was no evidence linking it to suicide mortality. Definitively linking migraine to death by suicide may require very large samples. Health care professionals should consider monitoring suicidal risk in individuals with migraine headache.

AB A negative correlation between societal suicide rates and social integration has been reported, but rarely specifically examined for suicide rates of the elderly although suicide rates of elderly persons are among the highest. The associations of suicide rates of elderly persons and fertility rates for 81 countries were examined using data from the World Health Organisation and United Nations. Fertility rates were considered a proxy measure for social integration. Multiple regression analysis indicated that suicide rates for males and females in the age bands 65-74 years and 75+ years were independently (negative) correlated with fertility rates. Fertility rates, as a measure of social integration, may interact with, modify and mediate the effect of cultural factors on suicide rates of elderly persons.

AB Background: People who use illicit drugs (PWUD) are known to experience high rates of suicidal behavior. While heavy alcohol use has been associated with suicide risk, its impact on the suicidal behavior of PWUD has not been well characterized. Therefore, we examined the relationship between heavy alcohol use and suicidal behavior among PWUD in Vancouver, Canada.
   Methods: Data are derived from two prospective cohort studies of PWUD in Vancouver, Canada, from 2005 to 2013. Participants completed questionnaires that elicited information regarding sociodemographics, drug use patterns, and mental health problems, including suicidal behavior. We used recurrent event survival analyses to estimate the independent association between at-risk/heavy drinking (based on National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [NIAAA] criteria) and risk of incident, self-reported suicide attempts.
   Results: Of 1757 participants, 162 participants (9.2%) reported 227 suicide attempts over the 8-year study period, resulting in an incidence rate of 2.5 cases per 100 person-years. After adjusting for potential confounders, including intensive illicit drug use patterns, heavy alcohol use (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 1.97; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.39, 2.78) was positively associated with an increased risk of suicidal behavior.
   Conclusions: We observed a high burden of suicidal behavior among a community-recruited sample of PWUD. Heavy alcohol use predicted a higher risk of suicide attempt, independent of other drug use patterns. These findings demonstrate the need for evidence-based interventions to address suicide risk among PWUD, particularly those who are heavy consumers of alcohol. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI Suicide Rates and State Laws Regulating Access and Exposure to Handguns
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; GUN-CONTROL; HOMICIDE; PREVENTION; LETHALITY; CANADA
AB Objectives. Using previous research, we examined the impact of 4 handgun laws (waiting periods, universal background checks, gun locks, and open carrying regulations) on suicide rates.
   Methods. We used publicly available databases to collect information on state-wide laws, suicide rates, and demographic characteristics for 2013.
   Results. Each law was associated with significantly lower firearm suicide rates and the proportion of suicides resulting from firearms. In addition, each law, except for that which required a waiting period, was associated with a lower overall suicide rate. Follow-up analyses showed a significant indirect effect on overall suicide rates through the proportion of suicides by firearms, indicating that the reduced overall suicide rate was attributable to fewer suicide attempts, fewer handguns in the home, suicide attempts using less lethal means, or a combination of these factors. States that implemented any of these laws saw a decreased suicide rate in subsequent years, whereas the only state that repealed 1 of these laws saw an increased suicide rate.
   Conclusions. Our results were supportive of a potentially vital role in suicide prevention for state legislation that limits access and exposure to handguns.

AB Objectives: Little research has evaluated changes in the association between area deprivation and suicidal behaviour over time. This study investigated patterns in suicide attempts and suicide mortality according to material deprivation in the province of Quebec, Canada between 1990 and 2005.
   Study design: Ecological analysis.
   Methods: Data on suicide attempts were extracted from the hospital discharge summary database (n = 47,516) and data on suicides were extracted from the Quebec death file (n = 20,851). Gender- and age-specific (10-24, 25-44, 45-64 and >= 65 years) suicide attempt and mortality rates were calculated for four time periods (1990-1993, 1994-1997, 1998-2001 and 2002-2005) for the entire Quebec population aged 10 years and older residing in 162 communities ranked by decile of material deprivation. Absolute and relative measures of inequality were calculated to summarize differences between the most and least materially deprived areas. Commonly used methods of suicidal behaviour were examined.
   Results: Differentials in suicide attempt hospitalization between the most and least deprived areas were present for all age groups, and these decreased slightly among males and increased among females over time. Inequalities in suicide attempts were greatest among young adults (age 25-44 years) for both genders, and were smallest among the elderly (>= 65 years). For suicide mortality, differentials increased among females but not males; these differentials were greatest among males and 25-44 year olds, and smallest among the elderly. Differentials in commonly used methods were evident for poisoning hospitalizations in both genders and for hanging deaths among males.
   Conclusions: In Quebec, differences in suicide attempts and mortality between the most and least materially deprived areas persisted or even increased over time. Inequalities were more pronounced for suicide attempts than for suicide mortality, and were greatest among adults of working age. Strategies to reduce socio-economic differences in suicidal behaviour may be important. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Royal Society for Public Health.

AB Objective: We conducted an expedited knowledge synthesis (EKS) to facilitate evidence-informed decision making concerning youth suicide prevention, specifically school-based strategies and nonschool-based interventions designed to prevent repeat attempts.
   Methods: Systematic review of review methods were applied. Inclusion criteria were as follows: systematic review or meta-analysis; prevention in youth 0 to 24 years; peer-reviewed English literature. Review quality was determined with AMSTAR (a measurement tool to assess systematic reviews). Nominal group methods quantified consensus on recommendations derived from the findings.
   Results: No included review addressing school-based prevention (n = 7) reported decreased suicide death rates based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled cohort studies (CCSs), but reduced suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, and proxy measures of suicide risk were reported (based on RCTs and CCSs). Included reviews addressing prevention of repeat suicide attempts (n = 14) found the following: emergency department transition programs may reduce suicide deaths, hospitalizations, and treatment nonadherence (based on RCTs and CCSs); training primary care providers in depression treatment may reduce repeated attempts (based on one RCT); antidepressants may increase short-term suicide risk in some patients (based on RCTs and meta-analyses); this increase is offset by overall population-based reductions in suicide associated with antidepressant treatment of youth depression (based on observational studies); and prevention with psychosocial interventions requires further evaluation. No review addressed sex or gender differences systematically, Aboriginal youth as a special population, harm, or cost-effectiveness. Consensus on 6 recommendations ranged from 73% to 100%.
   Conclusions: Our EKS facilitates decision maker access to what is known about effective youth suicide prevention interventions. A national research-to-practice network that links researchers and decision makers is recommended to implement and evaluate promising interventions; to eliminate the use of ineffective or harmful interventions; and to clarify prevention intervention effects on death by suicide, suicide attempts, and suicidal ideation. Such a network could position Canada as a leader in youth suicide prevention.

AB Suicide is one of the most significant issues facing Indigenous communities throughout Canada. The rate of Indigenous deaths by suicide is severely disproportionate to that of the general public. While the last three decades have seen substantial investments in suicidology research within the Canadian context, rates of Indigenous deaths by suicide have remained relatively stable, and little remains known about effective means to reduce Indigenous deaths by suicide. A movement of critical suicidology scholars across health and social sciences is beginning to challenge the mainstream approach of suicidology research and suicide prevention, citing concerns about the ideological and epistemic foundations. In this article, the author highlights how these critiques are relevant to Indigenous contexts. Challenging a range of assumptions, the author considers the need to rethink the ideological foundations of research on Indigenous suicide. Finally, the author considers two methodological projects that are integral to forming a critical approach to Indigenous suicidology research and Indigenous suicide prevention praxis-culturally grounded research and decolonizing research.

AB The Criminal Code of Canada prohibits persons from aiding or abetting suicide and consenting to have death inflicted on them. Together, these provisions have prohibited physicians from assisting patients to die. On February 6, 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada declared void these provisions insofar as they "prohibit physician-assisted death for a competent adult person who (1) clearly consents to the termination of life and (2) has a grievous and irremediable medical condition (including an illness, disease or disability) that causes enduring suffering that is intolerable to the individual in the circumstances of his or her condition." This declaration of invalidity was scheduled to take effect one year (later extended by six months) after the ruling, to give the government time to put legislation in place. We trace the history of this decision, discuss how it has forever changed the debate on physician-assisted dying, and identify the issues that must be resolved to write the legislation. Of special importance here are the topics of access, safeguards, and conscientious objection.

AB This study presents the changes in the overall and firearm suicide rates for Quebec (Canada) before and after Bill C-17, which was implemented to secure safe storage of firearms. It covers 20,009 suicide cases reported to the coroner's office. Interrupted time series analysis is used to compare suicide rates in the two periods. Firearm suicide rates have dropped among males and females, but the downward trends were not significant when compared to those prior to the law. Hanging suicide rates have risen considerably among men and women, but those upward trends did not increase significantly when compared with those preceding the law. The decline in suicide rates involving firearms has not resulted in a parallel decline in overall suicide rates. The analyses suggest that Bill C-17 neither improved the downward trend in firearm suicide, which had already begun before the enactment of the law, nor reduced the upward trend of the overall suicide rate. Correlation analyses between firearm suicide, hanging suicide, and the overall suicide rate suggest that firearm suicide is replaced by hanging suicide among males.

AB Background Only a few small studies have explored the association between various physical illnesses and suicide in the elderly and they have produced inconsistent results. Thus, we undertook this larger study to more definitively assess the association between elderly suicide and physical illness. Methods This case-control study compared the proportion with physical illnesses among 822 cases who committed suicide with that among 944 controls who died due to motor vehicle accident at age 55 years or over in Alberta, Canada. Results Compared to the motor vehicle accident deaths, the elderly who committed suicide were more likely to have cancer, ischemic heart disease, chronic pulmonary disease, peptic ulcer, prostatic disorder, depression and other psychiatric illnesses. There was no significant difference in the proportion of cerebrovascular disease and diabetes mellitus between the case and control groups before adjustment of demographic and clinical characteristics. After adjustment of these variables, the elderly with any of the following illnesses were more likely to die by suicide than those without the illness: cancer (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.73 [1.16-2.58]), prostatic disorder (excluding prostatic cancer, 1.70 [1.16-2.49]), chronic pulmonary disease among the married (1.86 [1.22-2.83]), depression (6.70 [4.72-9.50]) or other psychiatric illness (2.16 [1.68-2.76]). There was no evidence that ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peptic ulcer and diabetes mellitus might be associated with suicide in the elderly. Conclusions Cancer, prostatic disorder, chronic pulmonary disease among the married and psychiatric illness appear to be associated with suicide among the elderly.

AB We report on findings from an in-depth qualitative case study designed to closely examine the social practices of planning and implementing a four-part (six hour) classroom-based suicide prevention program within two classrooms in one secondary school in Vancouver, British Columbia. Representing a departure from traditional evaluation research studies in suicidology, we examine how school-based youth suicide prevention programs get brought into being in "real world" contexts. Using a discursive, critical constructionist methodology, we aim to illuminate the complexities of this work. Based on our analysis, we suggest that suicide (and its prevention), in all its complex and culturally situated forms, simply cannot be conceptualized through singular, stable or universalizing terms that transcend time and context. Implications for (re)-conceptualizing suicide prevention education are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To estimate the rates of suicide and self-harm among recent immigrants and to determine which immigrant-specific risk factors are associated with these outcomes. Methods: Population-based cohort study using linked health administrative data sets (2003 to 2017) in Ontario, Canada which included adults >= 18 years, living in Ontario (N = 9,055,079). The main exposure was immigrant status (long-term resident vs. recent immigrant). Immigrant-specific exposures included visa class and country of origin. Outcome measures were death by suicide or emergency department visit for self-harm. Cox proportional hazards estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: We included 590,289 recent immigrants and 8,464,790 long-term residents. Suicide rates were lower among immigrants (n = 130 suicides, 3.3/100,000) than long-term residents (n = 6,354 suicides, 11.8/100,000) with aHR 0.3, 95% CI, 0.2 to 0.3. Male-female ratios in suicide rates were attenuated in immigrants. Refugees had 2.1 (95% CI, 1.3 to 3.6; rate 6.1/100,000) and 2.8 (95% CI, 2.5 to 3.2) times the likelihood of suicide and self-harm, respectively, compared with nonrefugee immigrants. Self-harm rate was lower among immigrants (n = 2,256 events, 4.4/10,000) than long-term residents (n = 68,039 events, 9.7/10,000 person-years; aHR 0.3; 95% CI, 0.3 to 0.3). Unlike long-term residents, where low income was associated with high suicide rates, income was not associated with suicide among immigrants and there was an attenuated income gradient for self-harm. Country of origin-specific analyses showed wide ranges in suicide rates (1.4 to 9.9/100,000) and self-harm (1.8 to 14.9/10,000). Conclusion: Recent immigrants have lower rates of suicide and self-harm and different sociodemographic predictors compared with long-term residents. Analysis of contextual factors including immigrant class, origin, and destination should be considered for all immigrant suicide risk assessment.

AB This brief report details a preliminary investigation into how community-level variability in knowledge of Aboriginal languages relate to "band"-level measures of youth suicide. In Canada, and, more specifically, in the province of British Columbia (BC), Aboriginal youth suicide rates vary substantially from one community to another. The results reported demonstrate that not only did this simple language-use indicator prove to have predictive power over and above that of six other cultural continuity factors identified in previous research, but also that youth suicide rates effectively dropped to zero in those few communities in which at least half the band members reported a conversational knowledge of their own "Native" language.

DE children; adolescent; suicide; suicide methods
AB Suicide is second only to accidents as the most common cause of death for children and adolescents age 10 to 19 in Canada. All of the pediatric cases that were referred to the Hamilton Regional Forensic Pathology Unit from 1993 to 2002 were reviewed. For the purpose of this study, pediatric deaths were defined as deaths in the age group of I day up to and including 19 years of age. Specific criteria for suicide were applied to each case, independent of the manner of death issued by the coroner. The criteria were 3-fold. First, homicide had to be ruled out by the police investigation and autopsy findings. Second, the method had to be consistent with self-infliction. Finally, there had to be some evidence of suicidal intent. Questionable cases were discussed among the authors, and if reasonable intent could not be established, then the case was excluded. The autopsy and police reports were examined in detail regarding age, sex, location and method of suicide, presence of suicide notes, and any contributing psychologic factors or stressors. Of the 501 pediatric autopsies performed during the 10-year period, 31 (6%) met the criteria of suicide. The majority of cases (87%) were in older adolescents (age 15 to 19), and the male to fernale ratio was 2.4:1. Psychologic factors were identified in some of the cases, including depressed mood (77%), suicidal ideation (45%), previous suicide attempts (23%), and drug or alcohol problems (19%). Most of the suicides (61%) occurred in the victim's home, and 12 (39%) cases left a suicide note. In 9 cases (29%), alcohol or street drugs were detected postmortem, though in 8 cases toxicology was not performed. Hanging (48%) was the most common rnethod of suicide, followed by firearms (13%), poisoning (10%), drowning (10%), and blunt force vehicular trauma (10%). Almost 60% of the male suicides were by hanging. No specific trend was identified in the 9 female suicides. These results were compared with similar studies within Canada and other countries. Overall, the method of suicide is dictated by what is convenient and readily available, though the acceptance of various suicide methods can change over time. Suicide prevention efforts should be tailored to address local trends.

AB Objective: The Inuit population in Canada's North has suffered from high rates of death by suicide. We report on the first large-scale, controlled, epidemiologically representative study of deaths by suicide in an Indigenous population, which investigates risk factors for suicide among all Inuit across Nunavut who died by suicide during a 4-year period.
   Methods: We identified all suicides by Inuit (n = 120) that occurred between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2006, in Nunavut. For each subject, we selected a community-matched control subject. We used proxy-based procedures and conducted structured interviews with informants to obtain life histories, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Axis I and II diagnoses, and measures of impulsive and (or) aggressive traits.
   Results: Compared with control subjects, subjects who died by suicide were more likely to have experienced childhood abuse (OR 2.38; 95% CI 1.39 to 4.08), have family histories of major depressive disorder (P = 0.002) and suicide completion (P = 0.02), and have been affected by major depressive disorder (OR 13.00; 95% CI 6.20 to 27.25), alcohol dependence (OR 2.90; 95% CI 1.59 to 5.24), or cannabis dependence (OR 3.96; 95% CI 2.29 to 6.8) in the last 6 months. In addition, subjects who died by suicide were more likely to have been affected with cluster B personality disorders (OR 10.18; 95% CI 3.34 to 30.80) and had higher scores of impulsive and aggressive traits (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: At the individual level, clinical risk factors for suicide among Inuit are similar to those observed in studies with the general population, and indicate a need for improved access to mental health services. The high rate of mental health problems among control subjects suggests the need for population-level mental health promotion.

ID SEXUAL MINORITY ADULTS; HEALTH; IDENTITY; STRESS
AB In this study, we document life stories of gay men who attempted suicide as adults. Our goal is to expand the collection of narratives used to understand this persistent health inequity. We interviewed seven adult gay men, each of whom had attempted suicide two to four times, and identified five narratives. Pride narratives resist any connection between sexuality and suicide. Trauma-and-stress narratives enable coping through acknowledgment of sexual stigma as a fundamental trauma and cause of subsequent stress and suicidal thoughts. Memorial narratives prevent suicide by maintaining a strong sense of permanent identity. Outing narratives demand that the listener confronts the legacy of unjust practices of homosexual surveillance and outing, which historically resulted in gay suicides. Finally, postgay narratives warn of the risk of suicide among older generations of gay men who feel erased from the goals of modern gay movements. Sexual identity concealment or invisibility featured prominently in all five narratives.

AB This article is a documentary analysis of Inuit knowledge about suicide prevention which yields insights into how structural and cultural factors are essential to curbing suicide in marginalized populations. This study investigated the grey literature produced by Inuit community organizations and Inuit-led regional governments for Inuit understandings of suicide, its causes and prevention. Findings include that Inuit identify rapid colonization and its effects as the root of Inuit's highest suicide rate of any group in Canada; that suicide cannot be viewed in isolation from socio-economic conditions; that restoring the cultural pride of Inuit is essential to mental well-being; and that Inuit have created suicide prevention models building on strengths, relationship skills building and engaging the community, particularly youth and elders. This article makes an important contribution to the academic literature and social work practice in documenting Inuit suicide prevention concepts as a complement to western models which focus on individual depression.

AB In this ecological study, we attempt to quantify the extent to which differences in homicide and suicide death rates between three countries, and among states/provinces within those countries, may be explained by differences in their social, economic, and structural characteristics. We examine the relationship between state/province level measures of societal risk factors and state/province level rates of violent death (homicide and suicide) across Australia, Canada, and the United States. Census and mortality data from each of these three countries were used. Rates of societal level characteristics were assessed and included residential instability, self-employment, income inequality, gender economic inequity, economic stress, alcohol outlet density, and employment opportunities). Residential instability, self-employment, and income inequality were associated with rates of both homicide and suicide and gender economic inequity was associated with rates of suicide only. This study opens lines of inquiry around what contributes to the overall burden of violence-related injuries in societies and provides preliminary findings on potential societal characteristics that are associated with differences in injury and violence rates across populations.

AB Background: Across Europe, Canada, and the United States, 22-43 % of transgender (trans) people report a history of suicide attempts. We aimed to identify intervenable factors (related to social inclusion, transphobia, or sex/gender transition) associated with reduced risk of past-year suicide ideation or attempt, and to quantify the potential population health impact.
   Methods: The Trans PULSE respondent-driven sampling (RDS) survey collected data from trans people age 16+ in Ontario, Canada, including 380 who reported on suicide outcomes. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression models were weighted using RDS II methods. Counterfactual risk ratios and population attributable risks were estimated using model-standardized risks.
   Results: Among trans Ontarians, 35.1 % (95 % CI: 27.6, 42.5) seriously considered, and 11.2 % (95 % CI: 6.0, 16.4) attempted, suicide in the past year. Social support, reduced transphobia, and having any personal identification documents changed to an appropriate sex designation were associated with large relative and absolute reductions in suicide risk, as was completing a medical transition through hormones and/or surgeries (when needed). Parental support for gender identity was associated with reduced ideation. Lower self-reported transphobia (10th versus 90th percentile) was associated with a 66 % reduction in ideation (RR = 0.34, 95 % CI: 0.17, 0.67), and an additional 76 % reduction in attempts among those with ideation (RR = 0.24; 95 % CI: 0.07, 0.82). This corresponds to potential prevention of 160 ideations per 1000 trans persons, and 200 attempts per 1,000 with ideation, based on a hypothetical reduction of transphobia from current levels to the 10th percentile.
   Conclusions: Large effect sizes were observed for this controlled analysis of intervenable factors, suggesting that interventions to increase social inclusion and access to medical transition, and to reduce transphobia, have the potential to contribute to substantial reductions in the extremely high prevalences of suicide ideation and attempts within trans populations. Such interventions at the population level may require policy change.

AB In Canada, it is young, rural-based men who are at the greatest risk of suicide. While there is no consensus on the reasons for this, evidence points to contextual social factors including isolation, lack of confidential services, and pressure to uphold restrictive norms of rural masculinity. In this article, we share findings drawn from an instrumental photovoice case study to distil factors contributing to the suicide of a young, Canadian, rural-based man. Integrating photovoice methods and in-depth qualitative, we conducted interviews with seven family members and close friends of the deceased. The interviews and image data were analyzed using constant comparative methods to discern themes related to participants' reflections on and perceptions about rural male suicide. Three inductively derived themes, "Missing the signs," "Living up to his public image," and "Down in Rural Canada," reflect the challenges that survivors and young rural men can experience in attempting to be comply with restrictive dominant ideals of masculinity. We conclude that community-based suicide prevention efforts would benefit from gender-sensitive and place-specific approaches to advancing men's mental health by making tangibly available and affirming an array of masculinities to foster the well-being of young, rural-based men.

AB Objective
   To review the empirical claims made in: Pereira J. Legalizing euthanasia or assisted suicide: the illusion of safeguards and controls. Curr Oncol 2011;18:e38-45.
   Design
   We collected all of the empirical claims made by Jose Pereira in "Legalizing euthanasia or assisted suicide: the illusion of safeguards and controls." We then collected all reference sources provided for those claims. We compared the claims with the sources (where sources were provided) and evaluated the level of support, if any, the sources provide for the claims. We also reviewed other available literature to assess the veracity of the empirical claims made in the paper. We then wrote the present paper using examples from the review.
   Results
   Pereira makes a number of factual statements without providing any sources. Pereira also makes a number of factual statements with sources, where the sources do not, in fact, provide support for the statements he made. Pereira also makes a number of false statements about the law and practice in jurisdictions that have legalized euthanasia or assisted suicide.
   Conclusions
   Pereira's conclusions are not supported by the evidence he provided. His paper should not be given any credence in the public policy debate about the legal status of assisted suicide and euthanasia in Canada and around the world.

AB Homicide-suicides, the murder of one or several individuals followed by the suicide of the perpetrator, are rare but have devastating effects on families and communities. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing perpetrators of homicide-suicides with perpetrators of simple homicides and suicides and examined the proportion of firearm use and its correlation with firearm availability. We searched Medline and Embase from inception to July 2012 and identified 27 eligible studies. Perpetrators of homicide-suicides were older and more likely to be male and married to or separated from their victims than perpetrator of simple homicides or suicides. Influence of alcohol and a history of domestic violence or unemployment were less prevalent in homicide-suicides than in homicides. The proportion of firearm use in homicide-suicides varied across countries and was highest in the USA, Switzerland and South Africa, followed by Australia, Canada, The Netherlands and England and Wales, with a strong correlation between the use of firearms and the level of civilian gun ownership in the country. Our results indicate that homicide-suicides represent a distinct entity, with characteristics distinguishing them both from homicides and suicides. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: We examined whether established sex differences in suicide rates persist when adjustments are made for potential misclassification of deaths in children and youth.
   Methods: This is a retrospective, descriptive study of 1,294 suicides, 961 accidental and 254 undetermined deaths occurring between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2007, among persons aged 10 to 25 years in Ontario, Canada. Using data from Coroner's records, causes of death were reclassified based on two different misclassification criteria. Actual and reclassified suicide rates were calculated by sex and age group (with 95% confidence intervals) and by year of death.
   Results: Males aged 16-25 years accounted for the majority of suicides (68.9%). Asphyxia was the most common cause of suicide in both sexes. While suicides by shooting were almost exclusive to males, suicides due to alcohol/drug toxicity were significantly higher in females. Both before and after reclassification of suicide deaths, sex differences in suicide rates emerged in the 16-25 years age group. In each study year, both actual and reclassified suicide rates were higher in males than females.
   Conclusions: Sex differences in suicide rates emerging in adolescence are unlikely to be due to misclassification. Other proposed explanations for sex differences in youth suicide rates should be investigated further.

   Decriminalization
ID EUTHANASIA; SHAME
AB Copies were obtained of the criminal codes from 192 countries and states; in 25 suicide is currently illegal, and an additional 20 countries follow Islamic or Sharia law where suicide attempters may be punished with jail sentences. The vast majority of countries have laws making it illegal to abet, aid or encourage suicide, but the nature and punishment of the actions that are illegal varies. Laws in places with Civil, Common Law, Islamic Law and Traditional Law systems are compared. Great variances in application were noted, sometimes within countries. It is impossible to estimate the number of persons currently in jail for having attempted suicide, but jail sentences are still given to suicide attempters. Some countries do not prosecute suicide attempters despite the laws, while others consistently jail suicide attempters. In countries where suicide attempts have been decriminalized, attempters may still face prosecution when another person is injured or dies as a result of their suicide attempt or where the attempter is a member of the military. We discuss the roots of laws making suicide, aiding, and encouraging suicide illegal and examine prospects for future changes. The recent Supreme Court Decision in Canada, invalidating the law making it illegal to assist in the suicide of physically ill people who are suffering (abeit with restrictive conditions) illustrates current trends towards "liberalization" of assisted suicide.

AB As a result of scientific publications indicating that the last two decades have seen an increase in the number of suicides in the US Armed Forces, the topic of suicide in the military of other countries, such as Germany, has also received a lot of attention in media and science alike. Risk factors for suicidal behaviour and suicide were identified in several research projects in the US, Canada, the UK, and Germany. Until now, German suicide research among military service personnel has mainly focused on epidemiological aspects of suicides and suicidality, individual risk factors, sub-groups at risk for suicide, suicides and deployment abroad, and associations of suicide and suicide attempts with acute mental disorders. The key findings are summarized in this review article. Efforts should be made to develop and evaluate risk group-focused and occupation-focused prevention and intervention programs. Future multinational studies should address potential differences between risk groups for fatal and non-fatal suicidal behaviour.

AB Background: Using a large cohort of western Canadian sawmill workers (n=28,794), the association between psychosocial work conditions and attempted and completed suicide was investigated. Methods: Records of attempted and completed suicide were accessed through a provincial hospital discharge registry to identify cases that were then matched using a nested case control method. Psychosocial work conditions were estimated by expert raters using the demand - control model. Univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the association between work conditions and suicide. Results: In multivariate models, controlling for sociodemographic ( marital status, ethnicity) and occupational confounders ( job mobility and duration), low psychological demand was associated with increased odds for completed suicide, and low social support was associated with increased odds for attempted suicides. Conclusions: This study indicates that workers with poor psychosocial working conditions may be at increased risk of both attempted and completed suicide.

AB Background: Suicide and suicidal behaviour are multifaceted events requiring complex solutions. Controlling the environment vironment is a neglected solution, despite strong support for this approach from the World Health Organization (WHO).
   Method: To discuss this approach from a global view, this review is written by authors from various cultures. American, Australian. Canadian, Chinese, Cuban, Dutch, Indian, Irish, Japanese, Lithuanian, Native North American, Russian, and South African.
   Results: We examine gun control illustrate the environmental control approach, however, the worldwide diversity of suicide methods calls for diverse responses. Further, controlling the environment encompasses more than restricting the means of suicide, which we illustrate with examples of toned-down media reports and restricted medicine availability.
   Conclusions: Controlling the environment may be viable strategy for preventing suicide, although research shows that few clinicians implement such approaches.

SO CANADIAN HISTORICAL REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID BRITISH-COLUMBIA; WOMEN
AB Drawing upon a wide array of sources, from ethnographies and fur trade narratives to coroners' inquest depositions and police reports, this article explores the constructed and contested meanings that Aboriginal peoples and newcomers attached to Aboriginal suicide in Canada's Pacific Northwest and Prairies. Between 1823 and 1927, literary depictions of suicidal Aboriginal women and coroners' inquests into alleged Aboriginal suicides constructed racial difference and legitimated dispossession and regulation by representing Aboriginal peoples as primitive, irrational, and doomed to extinction. With the advent of federal administration in the 1870s, coroners' inquests also served as I contact zones' that allowed Aboriginal witnesses (sometimes in cooperation with police investigators) to contest negative stereotypes and government policies and offer their own counter-narratives in return. Speaking of the traumatic impact that the loss of land, lives, and freedom was having on certain segments of their communities, Aboriginal witnesses also suggested how variables like gender, age, marriage, and religion were influencing responses to colonialism and suicide patterns in select communities. The state, however, invested the proceedings with the majesty of law, legitimating stereotypical constructions of the suicidal, drunken, and criminal Indian that continue to govern interpretations and assumptions of Aboriginal suicide in contemporary Canada.

DT Article
DE Euthanasia; Individual autonomy; Medical ethics; Physician-assisted
   suicide; Right to life; Rights to liberty and security of the person;
   Suffering and the law
AB In its landmark decision Carter v Canada (Attorney General), the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the criminal prohibition on physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia for certain persons in certain circumstances violated their rights to life, liberty, and security of the person in sec. 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and thus was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court in effect overruled its earlier decision, Rodriguez v British Columbia (Attorney General), which upheld the prohibition as constitutionally valid, on the basis of changes in Charter jurisprudence and in the social facts since Rodriguez was decided. We argue that the Supreme Court's Carter decision shows conceptual disagreements with its Rodriguez decision concerning the nature and scope of the sec. 7-protected interests and the accompanying principles of fundamental justice. Not only do these conceptual differences have little to do with the changes that the Court in Carter invoked for 'revisiting' Rodriguez, the Court's articulation of the sec. 7 interests, particularly the right to life, and the principles of fundamental justice, especially the principle of over breadth, are problematic on their own terms. Furthermore, the way in which the Court dealt with evidence regarding abuses in permissive jurisdictions is also subject to criticism. We recommend that if, as now seems inevitable, legislation is introduced, it should mandate that assisted suicide and euthanasia be performed by specially licensed non-medical personnel and only on the authorization of a Superior Court judge. We also reject the key recommendations recently issued by the Provincial-Territorial Expert Advisory Group on Physician-Assisted Dying.

   MORTALITY; SYMPTOMS; VALIDITY; ONTARIO; CANADA; PREVENTION; DEPRESSION
AB Background: Head injuries have been associated with subsequent suicide among military personnel, but outcomes after a concussion in the community are uncertain. We assessed the long-term risk of suicide after concussions occurring on weekends or weekdays in the community.
   Methods: We performed a longitudinal cohort analysis of adults with diagnosis of a concussion in Ontario, Canada, from Apr. 1, 1992, to Mar. 31, 2012 (a 20-yr period), excluding severe cases that resulted in hospital admission. The primary outcome was the long-term risk of suicide after a weekend or weekday concussion.
   Results: We identified 235 110 patients with a concussion. Their mean age was 41 years, 52% were men, and most (86%) lived in an urban location. A total of 667 subsequent suicides occurred over a median follow-up of 9.3 years, equivalent to 31 deaths per 100 000 patients annually or 3 times the population norm. Weekend concussions were associated with a one-third further increased risk of suicide compared with weekday concussions (relative risk 1.36, 95% confidence interval 1.14-1.64). The increased risk applied regardless of patients' demographic characteristics, was independent of past psychiatric conditions, became accentuated with time and exceeded the risk among military personnel. Half of these patients had visited a physician in the last week of life.
   Interpretation: Adults with a diagnosis of concussion had an increased long-term risk of suicide, particularly after concussions on weekends. Greater attention to the long-term care of patients after a concussion in the community might save lives because deaths from suicide can be prevented.

AB Background: Methamphetamine (MA) use is a growing public health concern in many settings around the world. While some physical and mental health effects associated with injection MA use have been well described, little is known about the relationship between injecting MA and suicidal behavior. We sought to determine whether MA injection was associated with an increased risk of attempting suicide among a prospective cohort of injection drug users (IDUs) in Vancouver, Canada.
   Methods: Between 2001 and 2008, eligible participants enrolled in the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study (VIDUS) completed semi-annual questionnaires that elicited information regarding sociodemographics, drug use patterns, and mental health problems including suicidal behavior. We used Cox proportional hazards models with time-dependent covariates to determine whether self-reported MA injection was an independent predictor of attempting suicide at subsequent time points.
   Results: Of 1873 eligible participants, 149 (8.0%) reported a suicide attempt, resulting in an incidence density of 2.5 per 100 person-years. Participants who attempted suicide were more likely to be younger (median: 35 vs. 40, p < 0.01), female (48.3% vs. 35.1%, p < 0.01), and of Aboriginal ancestry (43.6% vs. 31.3%, p < 0.01). In a Cox proportional hazards model, MA injection was associated with an 80% increase in the risk of attempting suicide (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.08-2.99, p = 0.02).
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that IDUs who inject MA should be monitored for suicidal behavior. Improved integration of mental health and suicide prevention interventions within harm reduction and drug treatment programs may be fruitful. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB ObjectiveThe overall rate of suicide in French Guiana is estimated at 6 per 100,000, a rate that is lower than in mainland France. Given the frequent reports of suicide in Amerindian communities, our hypothesis was that this figure fails to capture a more contrasted reality. Our objective was to refine estimates and determine suicide rates in remote villages of French Guiana.MethodsWe included patients for whom a suicide attempt or suicide was mentioned in medical records. The Health centers were grouped into two zones according to geographical remoteness.ResultsThe highest suicide rates observed in the remote Amerindian villages of Camopi and Trois Sauts were, respectively, 118 and 78/100,000. The median age at the time of suicide was significantly younger in remote zones [23years (95% CI 21.59-25.06)] than in non-remote zones[27years (95% CI 24.47-29.31)]. The most frequent methods were hanging (78%) and intoxication (22%).ConclusionsThe suicide rate in remote areas in French Guiana was eight times higher than in France. The suicide of young people in remote areas in French Guiana and specifically in Amerindian villages must be better understood and prevented with contextualized and adapted care.

AB Background Age- and gender-specific suicide rates in England and Wales have changed considerably since 1950.
   Aims To assess whether cohort effects underlie some of these changes.
   Method Graphical displays to assess age- period-cohort effects on suicide for the period 1950-1999.
   Results Successive male birth cohorts born after 1940 carried with them, as they aged, a greater risk of suicide than their predecessors although this effect diminished for the 1975 and 1980 birth cohorts. There was less clear evidence of any increased riskof suicide in post-war female birth cohorts.
   Conclusions Succeeding generations of males born in the post-war years have experienced increasing rates of suicide at all ages, an observation in keeping with patterns seen in other countries. If these trends continue into middle- and old-age they will lead to a great increase in over-all male suicide rates.

AB More and more, youth suicide in the Inuit community is gaining importance, with a frequency in Greenland rising from 14.4 (1960-64) to 110.4 per 100,000 person-years (2010-11). The huge cultural/ educational changes during the last 20 years and the role of globalization, especially of the occidental influence on this community may be at the origin of such an `` epidemics'' of suicide in this cultural region. Recently, a political organization representing the Inuit community in Canada (ITK for Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami) launched a National Inuit Suicide Prevention Strategy (NISP) based on the specificities of this community in comparison to the occidental civilization. In fact, not only the Canadian Inuit community is concerned by this epidemics of suicide, but also many other autochthonous groups. In this context, the European Psychiatric Association (EPA) guidance on suicide treatment and prevention needs to be adjusted to autochthonous individuals' needs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Objective: To estimate a rate of death by suicide in the Canadian medical student population and examine the prevalence of institutional response policies for suicide.
   Methods: A survey was sent to all 17 Canadian medical undergraduate programs (MDUPs) to collect information on deaths by suicide over the past 10 years. In the case of a reported suicide, basic demographic data was collected. Respondents were asked to indicate whether internal statistics or response policies for suicide existed at their MDUP.
   Results: Responses were obtained from 16 of 17 (94%) MDUPs. Six suicides (50% female) were reported over the ten-year period from 2006 to 2016. The estimated cause-specific mortality rate was 5.9-8.7/100,000 medical students/year. There were seven (44%) MDUPs that kept statistics on student deaths including suicides and 10 (63%) reported having policies or guidelines regarding what to do in the event of a suicide.
   Conclusions: Our estimated suicide rate falls within previously reported rates in medical students. While this may be lower than the national rate for Canadians between the ages of 20-30 years old, any suicide in the medical student community must be an impetus for national dialogue and further study. A strategy is needed to better define the prevalence, risk factors for and impact of medical student suicide in Canada.

AB Objective: Multifaceted evidence (family, twin, adoption, molecular genetic, geographic and surname studies of suicide) suggests genetic risk factors for suicide. Migrant studies are also informative in this context, but underused. In particular, a meta-analysis of the associations of immigrant (IMM) and country-of-birth (COB) suicide rates is unavailable.
   Method: Thirty-three studies, reporting IMM suicide rates for nearly 50 nationalities in seven host countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, England, the Netherlands, Sweden and the USA), were retrieved.
   Results: Total-population IMM and COB suicide rates were strongly positively associated (combined rank-order correlation across 20 eligible studies: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.56-0.73, P < 10(-9)). The effect generalized across both sexes, host countries and study periods.
   Conclusion: Following the logic of the migrant study design of genetic epidemiology, the correspondence of IMM and COB suicide rates is consistent with the assumption of population differences in the prevalence of genetic risk factors for suicide.

AB Aim: The genetics underlying suicidal behavior is becoming increasingly recognized and investigated. Convergent evidence towards this end has emerged from numerous research strategies (adoption, family, genome-scan, geographic, immigrant, molecular genetic, surname, and twin studies of suicide). The topic-related mental-health literacy (i.e. knowledge and beliefs) of professionals and laypersons, however, may lag behind this research progress, and data on this question are scant. The aim of the present study was therefore to further validate, in a cross-language setting, the novel 22-item Beliefs in the Inheritance of Risk Factors for Suicide Scale (BIRFSS), originally developed in German, which assesses beliefs about the genetics of suicide.
   Methods: Data were collected from a mixed student sample from Canada (n = 288; 70.5% females, 58.0% studying psychology as a major or minor).
   Results: Factor analysis of BIRFSS items yielded a dominant first factor. Internal scale consistency was, however, only middling (lower than previously observed in Austrian samples). Although the structure of beliefs about the genetics of suicide seems to be complex, the Canadian sample's item-performance indicators corresponded strongly to those obtained in Austrian samples, thus indicating cross-sample and cross-language robustness of item statistics.
   Conclusion: For the Canadian sample, BIRFSS scores were positively related to overall and specific knowledge about suicide and general beliefs about genetic determinism (convergent validity), whereas they were not (or only trivially) related to the Big Five personality dimensions, lay theories of suicide, locus of control, social desirability, religiosity, and political orientation (discriminant validity), and to several key demographic variables. Supplemental findings, study limitations, application possibilities, user recommendations, and avenues for further inquiry are discussed.

AB A fatal concentration of pentobarbital found in a coroner's case where the history had not indicated use of this drug prompted a review of fatalities in Ontario from 2012 to 2015. Coroner's case files, including police and toxicology reports, were reviewed in twenty deaths, in which pentobarbital was identified as the primary cause of death. In all of the deaths (11 females, 9 males), the blood concentration of pentobarbital was greater than 10 mg/L. There were three to eight deaths per year and each was classified as suicide. In 11 cases, there was clear evidence that the drug was purchased over the internet from Mexico or China and imported into Canada. In four cases, it appears that the pentobarbital was labeled as a different, innocuous chemical to facilitate crossing the border without scrutiny. The findings underscore the value of a thorough scene investigation, including details of evidence that may be considered unrelated.

TI Voluntary Euthanasia, Assisted Suicide & Law Reform: A Sketch of the

SO BIOLAW JOURNAL-RIVISTA DI BIODIRITTO

DT Article
DE euthanasia; assisted suicide; law reform; medical assistance in dying
AB This paper outlines the recent Canadian experience of replacing the blanket prohibition of assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia with a new regulatory regime for "medical assistance in dying". The aim is to illustrate how lawnmakers in Canada have pursued the project that the Italian Court has urged Italy's parliament to undertake. Thus, the paper traces the arguments behind this law reform and highlighting ongoing disagreements over the manner in which it reconciles the protection of constitutional rights and the pursuit of particular policy objectives. Of course, the constitutional structures, political dynamics, medical cultures, and legal systems of these two countries differ in potentially salient ways. This paper is not a case for substituting Canada's MAID regime for Italy's current end-of-life laws whole cloth. Instead, the goal is to signal ways of thinking about, and responding to, some of the more pressing and difficult challenges to which efforts at law reform in this area may give rise.

AB A substantial majority of Canadians favours a change to the Criminal Code which would make it legally permissible, subject to careful regulation, for patients suffering from incurable physical illness to opt for either physician assisted suicide (PAS) or voluntary active euthanasia (VAE). This discussion will focus primarily on the arguments for and against decriminalizing physician assisted suicide, with special reference to the British Columbia case of Lee Carter vs. Attorney General of Canada. The aim is to critique the arguments and at the same time to describe the contours of the current Canadian debate. Both ethical and legal issues raised by PAS are clarified. Empirical evidence available from jurisdictions which have followed the regulatory route is presented and its relevance to the slippery slope argument is considered. The arguments presented by both sides are critically assessed. The conclusion suggested is that evidence of harms to vulnerable individuals or to society, consequent upon legalization, is insufficient to support continued denial of freedom to those competent adults who seek physician assistance in hastening their death.

DE Aboriginal; First Nations; Suicide prevention; Suicide intervention;

AB Suicide is a complex problem linked to genetic, environmental, psychological and community factors. For the Aboriginal population more specifically, loss of culture, history of traumatic events, individual, family and community factors may also play a role in suicidal behaviour. Of particular concern is the high rate of suicide among Canadian Aboriginal youth. While the need to develop interventions to reduce suicidal behaviour for First Nations on-reserve populations is evident, there may be an element of distrust of researchers by Aboriginal communities. Furthermore, research in mental health and specifically suicide is much more sensitive than studying medical illnesses like diabetes. Clearly, this issue requires a unique and insightful approach. While numerous suicide prevention/intervention plans and guidelines have been published specifically for work involving Aboriginal people, the literature lacks a comprehensive discussion of the methodological and logistical issues faced by research teams and Aboriginal communities attempting to develop culturally-grounded and community-specific suicide prevention and intervention strategies. This paper outlines the research process, key challenges and lessons learned in a collaborative University-First Nations suicide prevention project conducted with eight north-western Manitoba First Nations communities (Canada).

AB Objectives: Shooting as method of suicide has increased considerably in Austria over recent decades and represented 23.5% of all suicides among men during the period 1990-2000. It is thought that the availability of guns could lead to their use in acts of suicide, and therefore we investigated the numbers of gun licenses (which constitutes ownership of guns and permission to carry a gun) in the nine Austrian counties and their correlation with suicides by shooting and other methods.
   Methods: We studied registered suicides, including the method used, between 1990 and 2000 in Austria and the numbers of gun licenses held in the nine counties of Austria in the same period.
   Results: We found a strong correlation between the average gun license rate for the period 1990-2000 and suicides by shooting (r = 0.967), and only very weak correlation, and for some of the years under investigation a negative correlation, with other methods of committing suicide (r = 0.117) and the suicide rate in general (r = 0.383).
   Conclusions: As shooting as a method of suicide has increased in Austria in recent decades, and is a highly lethal method, the finding that the shooting suicide rate is related to the extent of gun ownership deserves attention, especially as there is evidence that restriction of gun ownership is an important factor in suicide prevention.

AB Five variables were investigated in the evaluation of Suicide Prevention Weeks (SPW) held in 1999, 2000, and 2001 in Quebec, Canada: exposure to the campaign, previous suicide ideation, knowledge, attitudes, and intentions. After the year 2000 campaign, a telephone survey conducted on a representative sample of 1020 men revealed that only those actually exposed to the SPW had gained more knowledge of suicide facts and resources. However, the SPW did not influence attitudes or intentions to seek help. Results are not surprising, considering the low intensity of the campaign, especially in the media. Campaigns aimed at changing suicidal behaviors must be intensive.

AB The objectives of this study were to identify factors that contribute to (1) remission from suicidal ideation, and (2) remission from suicide attempt, among Canadians with a lifetime history of suicide attempt. Data for this study came from Statistics Canada's nationally representative 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health. A sample of 769 adult respondents who had ever attempted suicide was analyzed with remission from past year suicidal ideation and remission from past year suicide attempt as outcome variables. Of the 769 respondents who had ever attempted suicide, more than two-thirds (69%) were free from suicidal ideation within the past year, and approximately 87% were free from suicide attempts within the past year. Compared to men, odds were 2.66 times greater for women to be free of suicide attempt and 2.65 times greater to be free of suicidal ideation in the past year. Older age, being free of sleep problems and major depressive episode, having no history of chronic childhood physical abuse, and having two or fewer previous suicide attempts were associated with higher odds of remission from both suicide attempt and ideation in the past year.

ID RATES; LEGISLATION; PREVENTION
AB Background: US suicide rates correlate with firearm availability. Little is known about variability in rates across countries. Aims: To observe the relationship between firearm/overall suicide rates in Toronto, Canada, and the five most populous US metropolitan areas. Method: Centers for Disease Control suicide rates by age and sex for New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Houston metropolitan areas were compared with equivalent data for Toronto (1999-2015). Results: Suicide rates by firearm, per 100,000 population, ranged from 0.45 in Toronto to 6.03 in Houston while rates by other methods ranged from 4.34 in Dallas-Fort Worth to 7.11 in Toronto. Overall rates of suicide ranged from 6.14 in New York to 10.45 in Houston. The two cities with the highest firearm suicide rates, Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston, also had much higher overall rates. Firearm suicides were most common in men over the age of 65 in all cities. Limitations: This study could not account for cultural differences between cities/countries. Conclusion: Much higher overall rates of suicide observed for Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston appear to be associated with high rates of suicide by firearm. Advocacy for means safety should target cities with high rates of firearm suicide and, in particular, elderly men.

AB Aims To provide novel, population-based estimates of the influence of minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) legislation on target in-patient hospital events in Canada. Design Regression-discontinuity analyses on rates of Canadian in-patient admissions. Setting All in-patient hospitalizations in Canada (except Quebec) between 1 April 1997 and 31 March 2007. Participants Individuals aged 15-22 years admitted to hospital. Measurements International Classification of Diseases-9/10 codes for alcohol-use disorders/poisoning, injury, suicide, assault and motor vehicle accidents were considered as target morbidity conditions. Findings Compared with the baseline hospitalization rate just prior to the MLDA, admissions at the MLDA rose significantly (P <= 0.001) for alcohol-use disorders/poisoning for males (17.3%) and females (21.1%), as well as for suicide events for the combined sample (9.6%, P = 0.029). Among males, there was a significant 4.4% increase (P = 0.001) in a broad class of injuries, including a 9.2% jump (P = 0.020) in admissions for motor vehicle accidents compared with the baseline hospitalization rate just prior to the MLDA. Conclusion Removal of minimum legal drinking age restrictions is associated with significant population-level increases in hospital admissions among young adults in Canada for alcohol-use disorders/poisoning, as well as for other serious injuries, especially among males. Current international minimum legal drinking age policy discussions should account for the impact of the minimum legal drinking age on severe morbidity outcomes.

AB Purpose: This study documented the prevalence of mental health problems among transgender youth in Canada and made comparisons with population-based studies. This study also compared gender identity subgroups and age subgroups (14-18 and 19-25).
   Methods: A nonprobability sample of 923 transgender youth from Canada completed an online survey. Participants were recruited through community organizations, health care settings, social media, and researchers' networks. Mental health measures were drawn from the British Columbia Adolescent Health Survey and the Canadian Community Health Survey.
   Results: Transgender youth had a higher risk of reporting psychological distress, self-harm, major depressive episodes, and suicide. For example, 65% of transgender 14- to 18-year olds seriously considered suicide in the past year compared with 13% in the British Columbia Adolescent Health Survey, and only a quarter of participants reported their mental health was good or excellent. Transgender boys/men and nonbinary youth were most likely to report self-harm and overall mental health remained stable across age subgroups.
   Conclusions: Although a notable minority of transgender youth did not report negative health outcomes, this study shows the mental health disparities faced by transgender youth in Canada are considerable. (C) 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents in many industrialized countries. We report evidence from a mediation model linking greater youth activity engagement, spanning behavioral and psychological components, with lower suicide risk through five hypothesized intrapersonal and interpersonal mediating factors. Self-report survey data (15% French, 85% English) were gathered from a community sample of 5,015 Canadian adolescents participating in a mental health promotion program. Youth (M (age) = 15.77, SD = 1.42, 50% female) were from two urban centers in southern Ontario, Canada. Youth engagement (youth's most important type of activity, frequency of involvement, and psychological engagement), suicide risk predictive factors (self-esteem, current concerns, depressive symptoms, coping ability, and connections with others), and suicide risk (ideation and attempts) were assessed. Consistent with the hypothesized mediation model, enjoyment and stress in youth's most important activity and various activity types were associated with the various hypothesized suicide risk predictive factors, which in turn were related to suicide risk. Implications for conceptualizations of youth engagement as a multidimensional construct and for suicide risk prevention efforts are discussed.

AB This paper discusses the history of assisted suicide/euthanasia and public attitudes in Canada; discusses depression in the terminally ill and the potential role of the psychologist in the assisted suicide/euthanasia process; and specifically addresses the importance of determining competence in terminally ill patients. One area in which the services of psychologists have not been used to their fullest potential is in the care of the terminally in, particularly in helping them make end-of-life decisions. It is very important that individuals making end-of-life decisions be assessed for mental disorders in order to ensure they are able to make competent decisions. If assisted suicide and euthanasia were to become legalized, psychologists should be involved in the assessment process in order to determine competency.

ID BEHAVIOR; RACE/ETHNICITY
AB Background: Evidence is mixed as to whether White Europeans are at a higher risk for suicide attempts or completions compared to other ethnic groups. The present analysis assessed whether risk for suicide attempt was associated with White European ethnicity in 907 subjects with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.
   Methods: Subjects were diagnosed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, and ethnicity was determined by self-report. Subjects were recruited from psychiatric care centers in Toronto, Canada. Logistic regression correcting for clinical covariates like age, gender and diagnosis, was used in this study.
   Results: We found no difference in suicide attempter status in white and non-white subjects who were diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
   Conclusion: Our study does not support the evidence that White-European patients in North America are at higher risk for suicide attempt compared to non-European descent subjects. However, this result has to be replicated in larger studies in patients with these disorders.

DT Article
ID EUTHANASIA LAW; BELGIUM; NETHERLANDS; SUICIDE
AB Although physician-assisted death (PAD) is established in certain countries, the legality and ethics of this issue have been debated for decades in Canada. The Supreme Court of Canada has now settled the issue of legality nationally, and as a result of the decision in Carter v. Canada, PAD (which includes both physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia) will become legal on February 6, 2016. It is difficult to predict the potential demand for PAD in Canada. This paper highlights other countries' experiences with PAD in order to shed light on this question and to forecast issues that Canadian physicians will face once the change to the law comes into effect. At present, there is no legislative scheme in place to regulate the conduct of PAD. Physicians and their provincial colleges may find themselves acting as the de facto regulators of PAD if a regulatory vacuum persists. With their specialized knowledge of pharmacology and interdisciplinary leadership, anesthesiologists may be called upon to develop protocols for the administration of PAD as well as to administer euthanasia. Canadian anesthesiologists currently have a unique opportunity to consider the complex ethical issues they will face when PAD becomes legal and to contribute to the creation of a regulatory structure that will govern PAD in Canada.

AB In this article, Professor McClurg makes the case for mandatory safe gun storage laws as a means of reducing adolescent suicides. He has argued in other articles in favor of safe storage as a means of reducing accidental shootings and criminal misuse of stolen guns. The article begins by analyzing firearms suicides in the U.S., which McClurg calls "the forgotten statistic in the gun control debate." He reviews numerous studies establishing a nexus between guns and suicide, particularly between guns in the home and adolescent suicide. He then examines ten different studies showing that large percentages of American gun owners engage in unsafe firearm storage practices. He concludes by calling for the passage of safe storage laws similar to those enacted in Australia and Canada as a way to reduce gun tragedies of all types-especially adolescent suicides-resulting from unauthorized users gaining access to unsecured guns.

AB There is conflicting evidence concerning the impact of macroeconomic conditions on suicide rates. To help resolve this pertinent question, we present evidence using Canadian data. We estimate feasible generalized least squares models of annual gender-specific suicide rates in the working age population (aged 25-64) using data from each of the 10 Canadian provinces over the period 1982 to 2007. We allow for heteroscedasticity across provinces and first-order autocorrelation common to all provinces. We posit that suicide rates in this population are a function of macroeconomic conditions (current and lagged unemployment rates and real per capita GDP) and other determinants that might be correlated with macro conditions, such as physician supply. We find that different factors affect suicide rates across genders and that some of the results are sensitive to the specification of the model we use and the regressors included. Generally, economic conditions affect men more than women; suicide rates are counter-cyclical and a higher supply of psychiatrists in a province is correlated with lower suicide rates.

AB Previous research on Australian, Canadian. and U.S. trends in the ratio of male to female suicide rates (the relative gender gap) has concluded that changes in female rates are the principal cause of change in the ratio. Pampel's (1998) analysis of longitudinal cross-national data asserts that an unmeasured construct labeled "institutional adjustment" and his measure of the "national political context" are important predictors of trends in female suicide and the accompanying trends in the relative gender gap. Tests of Pampel's measure of national political context failed to find its expected impact on trends in male or female suicide rates or the relative gender gap. However, the period effects attributed by Pamper to the "institutional adjustment" process were evident, even after controlling societal integration and the culture of suicide. Still, Durkheimian indicators of societal integration, national cultures of suicide. and residualized lagged (1938) dependent variables explained most of the variation in 1955-1994 male and female suicide rates and the relative gender gap.

AB This study investigated prevalence and risk factors for suicidal ideation among adults with self-reported disability in Western Canada. The method was secondary data analysis utilising the Canadian Community Health Survey. The odds of 12-month suicidal ideation are 3.5 times greater for adults with self-reported disability compared with non-disabled adults, controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, and psychiatric morbidity. The heightened risk of ideation among adults with self-reported disability is partially explained by social adversity, including food insecurity and low sense of community belonging. Reducing suicide risk among adults with disability requires a broad-spectrum approach, including mental health care, and strategies to ameliorate social and economic hardship.

AB IMPORTANCE The increasing legalization of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide worldwide makes it important to understand related attitudes and practices.
   OBJECTIVE To review the legal status of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide and the available data on attitudes and practices.
   EVIDENCE REVIEW Polling data and published surveys of the public and physicians, official state and country databases, interview studies with physicians, and death certificate studies (the Netherlands and Belgium) were reviewed for the period 1947 to 2016. FINDINGS Currently, euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide can be legally practiced in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Colombia, and Canada (Quebec since 2014, nationally as of June 2016). Physician-assisted suicide, excluding euthanasia, is legal in 5 US states (Oregon, Washington, Montana, Vermont, and California) and Switzerland. Public support for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in the United States has plateaued since the 1990s (range, 47%-69%). In Western Europe, an increasing and strong public support for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide has been reported; in Central and Eastern Europe, support is decreasing. In the United States, less than 20% of physicians report having received requests for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide, and 5% or less have complied. In Oregon and Washington state, less than 1% of licensed physicians write prescriptions for physician-assisted suicide per year. In the Netherlands and Belgium, about half or more of physicians reported ever having received a request; 60% of Dutch physicians have ever granted such requests. Between 0.3% to 4.6% of all deaths are reported as euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide in jurisdictions where they are legal. The frequency of these deaths increased after legalization. More than 70% of cases involved patients with cancer. Typical patients are older, white, and well-educated. Pain is mostly not reported as the primary motivation. A large portion of patients receiving physician-assisted suicide in Oregon and Washington reported being enrolled in hospice or palliative care, as did patients in Belgium. In no jurisdiction was there evidence that vulnerable patients have been receiving euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide at rates higher than those in the general population.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are increasingly being legalized, remain relatively rare, and primarily involve patients with cancer. Existing data do not indicate widespread abuse of these practices.

The analyses included age-adjusted suicide mortality rates, average annual variation in suicide mortality rates, and relative risks for suicide, by age and sex.
   Results: The mean suicide rate for the selected study period and countries/territory was 5.7/100,000 young people (10-24 years), with suicide rates higher among males (7.7/100,000) than females (2.4/100,000). Countries with the highest total suicide mortality rates among young people (10-24 years) were Guyana, Suriname, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Chile, and Ecuador; countries with the lowest total suicide mortality rates included Mexico, Venezuela, Cuba, and Brazil, and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. During this period, there was a significant increase in suicide mortality rates among young people in the following countries: Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, and Suriname; countries with significant decreases in suicide mortality rates included Canada, Colombia, Cuba, El Salvador, and Venezuela. The three leading suicide methods in the Americas were hanging, firearms, and poisoning.
   Conclusions: Some countries of the Americas have experienced a rise in adolescent and youth suicide during the study period, with males at a higher risk of committing suicide than females. Adolescent and youth suicide policies and programs are recommended, to curb this problem. Methodological limitations are discussed. (C) 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

AB Background. Extremely high rates of suicide localized within subgroups of populations where suicide is rare have been reported. We investigated this intriguing observation in a population of South-East Asia, where local culture should theoretically be preventative of suicide.
   Method. A team including an anthropologist and a psychiatrist surveyed all cases of suicide that had occurred over 10 years in four isolated regions. A psychological autopsy was carried out comparing each suicide case with two matched control cases.
   Results. In a region of 1192 inhabitants, 16 suicides occurred, leading to an annual suicide rate of 134/100000 which is 10 times the rate in the USA or Canada. By contrast, three ethnically similar distant communities showed low to null rates. The gender ratio was three males to one female and two-thirds of cases were aged below 35 years. Methods of suicide were poisoning and hanging and motives mainly included interpersonal discord. The pattern of developmental and clinical risk factors was somewhat different from Western countries, showing no childhood maltreatment, only one case of alcohol/substance abuse and impulsive-aggressive personality but elevated rates of social anxiety. Suicide cases had very high frequencies of second-degree biological relatives who committed suicide.
   Conclusions. Our study confirms a persistent phenomenon of high suicide rates restricted to a subgroup of a preindustrialized population. We hypothesized this might be explained by isolation and endogamy, which may have promoted the selection/amplification of genetic vulnerability factors, or a contagion effect. These findings shed light on suicide from both a singular and a universal perspective, suggesting that particular local conditions may significantly modulate the rate of this complex behavior.

AB Background The risks of suicidality among street-involved youth who use drugs and engage in sex work are not well described. This study sought to evaluate if street-involved youth who engage in sex work were at an elevated risk for attempting suicide.
   Methods Data were derived from the At-Risk Youth Study, a prospective cohort of street-involved youth who use drugs in Vancouver, Canada. Multivariable generalized estimating equation analyses were employed to examine whether youth who engaged in sex work were at elevated risk of attempting suicide, controlling for possible confounders.
   Results Between September 2005 and May 2015, 1210 youth were recruited into the cohort, of whom, 173 (14.3%) reported recently attempting suicide at some point during the study period. In multivariable analysis, youth who engaged in sex work were significantly more likely to report a recent suicide attempt (adjusted odds ratio = 1.93; 95% confidence interval: 1.28-2.91).
   Conclusions Street-involved youth who engage in sex work were observed to be at a significantly higher risk for suicidality. Systematic discrimination and unaddressed trauma may contribute to the observed increased burden of suicidality among this population. Interventions that support the mental health and well-being of street-involved youth who engage in sex work are urgently needed.

DT Article
DE Inuit; Community change; Well-being; Happiness
ID SUICIDE; POVERTY; DIVERSITY
AB Suicide among young Inuit in the Canadian Arctic is at an epidemic level. In order to understand the distress and well-being experienced in Inuit communities, a first step in understanding collective suicide, this qualitative study was designed. Fifty Inuit were interviewed in two Inuit communities in Nunavut, Canada, and questionnaires asking the same questions were given to 66 high school and college students. The areas of life investigated here were happiness and wellbeing, unhappiness, healing, and community and personal change. Three themes emerged as central to well-being: the family, talking/communication, and traditional Inuit cultural values and practices. The absence of these factors were most closely associated with unhappiness. Narratives about community and personal change were primarily about family, intergenerational segregation, an increasing population, more trouble in romantic relationships among youth, drug use, and poverty. Change over time was viewed primarily as negative. Discontinuity of kinship structure and function appears to be the most harmful effect of the internal colonialism imposed by the Canadian government in the 1950s and 1960s. Directions toward community control and action are encouraging, and are highlighted. Inuit community action toward suicide prevention and community wellness is part of a larger movement of Indigenous self-determination.

AB Objective To assess the association of eczema with a patient's subsequent risk of death from suicide. We hypothesised that persistent eczema would be associated with an increased risk for death from suicide.
   Design Double matched case-control study.
   Setting General population of Ontario, Canada.
   Participants Patients 15-55 years old. We identified cases of suicide from coroners' reports between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 2014 and matched 1:2 with alive controls based on age, sex and socioeconomic status.
   Exposure The primary predictor was a history of persistent eczema, defined as five or more physician visits for the diagnosis over the preceding 5years.
   Main outcome and measure Logistic regression to estimate the association between eczema and death from suicide.
   Results We identified 18441 cases of suicide matched to 36882 controls over the 21-year accrual period. Persistent eczema occurred in 174 (0.94%) suicide cases and 285 (0.77%) controls yielding a 22% increased risk of suicide associated with persistent eczema (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.48, p=0.037). In mediation analyses, this association was largely explained through major suicide risk factors. Two-thirds of patients with eczema who died from suicide had visited a physician in the month before their death and one in eight had visited for eczema in the month before their death. Among patients who died by suicide, jumping and poisoning were relatively more frequent mechanisms among patients with eczema.
   Conclusions Patients with persistent eczema have a modestly increased subsequent risk of death from suicide, but this is not independent of overall mental health and the absolute risk is low. Physicians caring for these patients have opportunities to intervene for suicide prevention.

ID RISK-FACTORS; PERSONALITY-DISORDERS; HONG-KONG; PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSES;
   ELDERLY SUICIDES; OLDER-PEOPLE; PREVENTION; ILLNESS; CHINESE; RETHINKING
AB Background:
   While numerous past reviews of psychological autopsy (PA) studies have examined the relationship between mental disorder and suicide, there has been little systematic investigation of suicide occurring in the absence of any identifiable psychiatric condition.
   Aim:
   This article reviews available literature on the topic by considering Axis I, sub-threshold, mild disorders and personality disorders.
   Method:
   We conducted a systematic review of PA studies from 2000 onwards. Studies included in the review had to clearly describe the proportion of suicide cases without a classifiable mental disorder or sub-threshold condition.
   Results:
   Up to 66.7% of suicide cases remained without diagnosis in those studies that only examined Axis I disorders (n = 14). Approximately 37.1% of suicide cases had no psychiatric condition in research papers that assessed personality and Axis I disorders (n = 9), and 37% of suicides had no Axis I, sub-threshold/mild conditions (n = 6). In general, areas in China and India had a higher proportion of suicides without a diagnosis than studies based in Europe, North America or Canada.
   Conclusion:
   Variation in the proportion of suicide cases without a psychiatric condition may reflect cultural specificities in the conceptualization and diagnosis of mental disorder, as well as methodological and design-related differences between studies.

AB Background: Male suicide prevention strategies include diagnosis and effective management of men's depression. Fundamental to suicide prevention efforts is public awareness, which in turn, is influenced by literacy levels about men's depression and suicide.Aim: The aim of this study is to examine sex differences in mental health literacy with respect to men's depression and suicide among a cohort of Canadian respondents.Methods: About 901 English-speaking Canadian men and women completed online survey questionnaires to evaluate mental health literacy levels using 10-item D-Lit and 8-item LOSS questionnaires, which assess factual knowledge concerning men's depression and suicide. Statistical tests (Chi-square, z-test) were used to identify significant differences between sex sub-groups at 95% confidence.Results: Overall, respondents correctly identified 67% of questions measuring literacy levels about male depression. Respondents' male suicide literacy was significantly poorer at 53.7%. Misperceptions were especially evident in terms of differentiating men's depressive symptoms from other mental illnesses, estimating prevalence and identifying factors linked to male suicide. Significant sex differences highlighted that females had higher literacy levels than men in regard to male depression.Conclusions: Implementing gender sensitive and specific programs to target and advance literacy levels about men's depression may be key to ultimately reducing depression and suicide among men in Canada.

TI Oral medical assistance in dying (MAiD): informing practice to enhance
   utilization in Canada
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE
LA English
DT Article
ID EUTHANASIA; ATTITUDES; SUICIDE
AB The legislation Bill C-14 legalized medical assistance in dying (MAiD) in Canada. After thorough assessments of eligibility by two clinicians, Bill C-14 allows for both intravenous-assisted death by a clinician (euthanasia) and prescription of oral medication for self-administration (assisted suicide). Nevertheless, since inception in June 2016, intravenous euthanasia is the main form of delivery of assisted death in Canada. The reasons why oral MAiD is underutilized in Canada are multifactorial. Currently, there is no consensus on either the medications or the protocols for oral administration, nor a comprehensive understanding of the potential side effects and complications associated with different regimens. The quality of evidence for optimal MAiD medications is low, so any suggested recommendations can only be informed by the global but generally anecdotal experience. The challenges for implementing oral MAiD in Canada include a need to enhance clinician comfort in prescribing oral medications as an alternative to intravenous administration. The goals for ideal oral MAiD medications are 100% effectiveness and minimal side effects, while ensuring that the needed dose is both palatable and deliverable in a tolerable oral volume. The Netherlands has the most experience worldwide and barbiturates have emerged as the most common, efficacious, and tolerable agents by patients. Based on this global experience and the over-arching goals for oral MAiD, we recommend the use of a secobarbital suspension combined with antiemetic prophylaxis.

TI Implementing Suicide Prevention Programs: Costs and Potential Life Years
   Saved in Canada
SO JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH POLICY AND ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID MENTAL-HEALTH; MULTILEVEL APPROACH; DEPRESSION; RATES; COMMUNITY;
   ALLIANCE; AUDIT
AB Background: Little is known about the costs and effects of suicide prevention programs at the population level.
   Aims of the Study: We aimed to determine (i) the costs associated with a suicide death and using prospective values (ii) the costs and effects of transferring, into a Canadian context, the results of the European Nuremberg Alliance against Depression (NAD) trial with the addition of 4 community-based suicide prevention strategies. These included the training of family physicians in the detection and treatment of depression, population campaigns aimed at increasing awareness about depression, the training of community leaders among first responders and follow-up of individuals who attempted suicide.
   Methods: This study includes a prospective value implementation study design. Using published data and information from interviews with Canadian decision makers, we assessed the costs of a suicide death in the province of Quebec and the costs of potentially implementing the NAD multi-modal suicide prevention programs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), from a health care system and societal perspective, associated with the NAD program while considering the friction cost method (FCM) and human capital approach (HCA) (discounted at 3%.) The costs considered included those incurred for the suicide prevention program and direct medical and non-medical costs as well as those related to a police investigation and funeral costs. Indirect costs associated with loss of productivity and short term disability were also considered. Sensitivity analyses were also carried out. Costs presented were in 2010 dollars.
   Results: The annual total cost of implementing the suicide prevention programs in Quebec reached $23,982,293. The most expensive components of the program included the follow-up of individuals who had attempted suicide and psychotherapy for bereaved individuals. These accounted for 39% and 34% of total costs. The ICER associated with the implementation of the programs reached on average $3979 per life year saved.
   Discussion: Suicide prevention programs such as the NAD trial are cost-effective and can result in important potential cost-savings due to averted suicide deaths and reduced life years lost.
   Implications for Health Care Provision and Use: Implementation of suicide prevention programs at the population level in Canada is cost-effective. Community mental health programs aimed at increasing awareness and the treatment of depression and better follow-up of high risk individuals for suicide are associated with a minimal per capita investment. These programs can result in important potential cost-savings due to averted suicide deaths and decreased disability due to depression.
   Implications for Further Research: Additional research should focus on whether the outcomes of multi-modal suicide programs are specific or synergistic and most effective for which population subgroups. This may help inform how best to invest resources for the highest return.

AB Background: Suicide is a major cause of preventable death globally and a leading cause of death by injury in Canada. To support people who experience suicidal thoughts and behaviors and ultimately prevent people from dying by suicide, it is important to understand the individual and familial experiences with the health care system.
   Objective: This study aims to explore how suicide victims, and their family members, interacted with the health care system.
   Methods: We will invite family members of 6 to 8 suicide victims to participate in the study by sharing their perspectives on both their relative's as well as their own interactions with the health care system. Interviews will take place in-person and will be audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed thematically.
   Results: The results of the study are expected to be available in 12 months. We expect the results to shed light on the experiences of suicide victims and their family members with the health care system.
   Conclusions: Our study results may inform practice, policy, and further research. They may shape how members of the health care system respond to people who are at risk of suicide and their families.

AB There has been much research on the associations between weather variables and suicide rates. However, the state of understanding has remained rather stagnant due to many contradictory findings. The purpose of this project is to examine a larger database of suicides that includes a longer and more recent period of record (1975-2010) across numerous locations in the USA. In all, we examine nine total counties (and the primary city associated with them) with a special effort made to compare locations with varying degrees of temperature seasonality: Cook (Chicago), Fulton (Atlanta), King (Seattle), Los Angeles (Los Angeles), Maricopa (Phoenix), Miami-Dade (Miami), Philadelphia (Philadelphia), Salt Lake (Salt Lake City), and St. Louis (St. Louis). We first examine the unique seasonal cycle in suicides evident in each locale and then use distributed lag nonlinear modeling (DLNM) to relate the suicide data to daily surface temperatures. Results suggest that a late spring/summer peak generally exists in suicide rates, and above average temperatures are associated with increased suicide risk in almost all study counties. Further, it appears that these associations can be found in both mid-latitude and sub-tropical climate types.

AB Background The factors most strongly associated with suicide are age and gender-more men than women, and, more people over 65 kill themselves. As a number of Governments have targets to reduce suicide levels we compare elderly suicide rates over a 20-year period in England and Wales. And the major Western countries focusing upon age and gender.
   Method WHO mortality data were used to calculate three-year average General Population Suicide Rates (GPSR) for 1979-1981 to 1997-1999 and rates of people aged 65-74 and 75+ suicide by gender to provide ratios of change and a statistical comparison of England and Wales and the Major Western countries over the period.
   Results Male GSPR: '65-74' suicide ratios fell significantly in six countries and in three for the '75+'. Female GSPR: '65-74' suicide ratios fell in every country except Spain. Proportionately, there were more suicides in the over 65s in countries with an 'extended family' tradition, Spain, Italy, Germany, France and Japan, than in the five 'secular' countries. England and Wales male '65-74' suicide fell significantly more than Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Netherlands and the USA, and did significantly better than the other countries for all female senior citizen suicides.
   Conclusion Suicide of the over-65s has improved in seven countries, especially in England and Wales, who had the greatest proportional reduction, which reflects well upon the psycho-geriatric and community services. However, in all countries, male 65-74 rates did not match the female out so extra efforts are needed to improve male rates. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Since colonial times, imperialist discourse has driven Western research regarding cultures of non-Western background. It has perpetuated the notion of culture as an encapsulated item; a reified entity isolated from the rest of the world, and has constructed cultural myths about who we are and of what we are capable. This has had profound implications both for psychology and for the people and cultures psychology submits to study. It is of great importance in Canada where Aboriginal people have been subjected to the hegemony of the 'dominant culture' both in a physical as well as a cultural sense for the past 400 years. Could a postcolonial psychology have a role in suicide prevention? Through the use of current postcolonial theories and of discursive examples taken from Aboriginal Canadians discussing suicide and suicide prevention, this paper will elaborate upon these concerns. It will conclude with the suggestion that researchers and suicide research involving culture should take a role in revealing the limitations of culture research.

AB Background The availability of firearms in homes and at aggregate levels is a risk factor for suicide and homicide. One method of reducing access to suicidal means is the restriction of firearm availability through more stringent legislation.
   Aims To evaluate the impact of firearm legislation reform on firearm suicides and homicides as well as on the availability of firearms in Austria.
   Method Official statistics on suicides, firearm homicides and firearm licences issued from 1985 to 2005 were examined. To assess the effect of the new firearm law, enacted in 1997, linear regression and Poisson regressions were performed using data from before and after the law reform.
   Results The rate of firearm suicides among some age groups, percentage of firearm suicides, as well as the rate of firearm homicides and the rate of firearm licences, significantly decreased after a more stringent firearm law had been implemented.
   Conclusions Our findings provide evidence that the introduction of restrictive firearm legislation effectively reduced the rates of firearm suicide and homicide. The decline in firearm-related deaths seems to have been mediated by the legal restriction of firearm availability. Restrictive firearm legislation should be an integral part of national suicide prevention programmes in countries with high firearm suicide rates.

AB We propose a varying-coefficient autoregressive model that contains additive models, varying- coefficient models, partially linear models and low-dimensional interaction models as special cases. A global kernel backfitting method is proposed for the estimation and inference of parameters and unknown functions in this model. Key large-sample results are established, including estimation consistency, asymptotic normality and the generalized likelihood ratio test for parameters and non-parametric functions. The proposed methodology is examined by simulation studies and applied to examine the relationship between suicide news reports in the three leading newspapers and the daily number of suicides in Taiwan. The relationship between the media reporting and suicide incidence has been established and explored. The Canadian Journal of Statistics 47: 487-519; 2019 (c) 2019 Statistical Society of Canada

AB Inuit in Canada currently suffer from one of the highest rates of suicide in the world. The objective of this study was to explore the prevalence of suicide ideations and attempts among 15-24year olds living in Nunavik, Quebec, and to explore risk and protective factors of suicide attempts as a function of gender. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2004 across Nunavik. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were conducted. A total of 22% of young males and 39% of females adults reported past suicidal attempts. Gender differences were observed in relation to associated risk and protective factors as well as degree of exposure to risk factors. Suicide prevention must include alcohol and drug prevention programs and rehabilitation services, interventions to reduce physical and sexual violence and their long-term impacts on Inuit youth, as well as exposure to culturally meaningful activities.

AB In Canada, poisoning deaths are classified as unintentional, suicide, homicide or undetermined. However, there is a significant proportion of deaths which are classified as undetermined. This work describes a methodology to classify cases of poisoning-related deaths that were misclassified as undetermined, using data from the Canadian Coroner and Medical Examiner Database (CCMED). The research work used Decision Trees (DTs), Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), using a number of known cases of suicides and of unintentional deaths, to classify undetermined cases as a suicide or an unintentional poisoning. The performance achieved a sensitivity of 96% (true positives or suicides), a specificity of 84% (true negatives or unintentional), and an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) of 0.96. The results will help to calculate better estimates of the rates of suicides and of unintentional deaths by poison.

AB Objective: Suicide rates among Indigenous peoples in Canada are at least twice that of their non-Indigenous counterparts. Although contemporary stressors contribute to this increased risk, historical experiences such as the Indian Residential School (IRS) system may also have continuing links with the risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The current investigation examined the intergenerational and cumulative links between familial IRS attendance in relation to lifetime suicide ideation and attempts among First Nations adults living on-reserve.
   Method: Data from the 2008-2010 First Nations Regional Health Survey were analyzed, and participants comprised a representative sample of First Nations adults older than 18 years (weighted N = 127,338; IRS attendees were excluded). Of those who knew their familial IRS history, 38.0% had no history of attendance, 19.3% had a grandparent who attended, 16.2% had a parent who attended, and 26.5% had a parent and grandparent who attended.
   Results: Exposure of one previous familial generation to the IRS experience was associated with increased risk for lifetime suicide ideation (odds ratio [OR], 1.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16 to 1.84; P = 0.001) and attempts (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.94; P < 0.016) compared with those with no IRS history. Having 2 generations of IRS familial history was associated with greater odds of reporting a suicide attempt compared with having one generation (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.75; P = 0.022), which was reduced when current levels of distress and ideation were accounted for.
   Conclusion: Findings support the existence of linkages between intergenerational exposure to IRS and risk for suicidal ideation and attempts and for a potential cumulative risk in relation to suicide attempts across generations.

   METHODS; UNITED-STATES; RISK-FACTORS; PREVENTION
AB Objective: To evaluate whether reaction to survival of a suicide attempt and method of the index attempt predicted repeat suicide attempts within 6 months.
   Method: Data came from the Suicide Assessment Form in Emergency Psychiatry (SAFE) Database Project, which contains information on all presentations to emergency psychiatric services at the 2 tertiary hospitals in Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada (N = 7,007). During a 4-year period (2009-2012), 922 individuals presented with suicide attempts. Logistic regressions were used to examine whether a person's reaction to attempt survival and the method of attempt predicted repeat suicide attempt within 6 months.
   Results: Of the 922 participants, 82 (8.8%) presented with another suicide attempt within 6 months. Ambivalence about attempt survival (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.84; 95% CI, 1.455.54; P < .01) and wishing to be dead (adjusted OR = 2.68; 95% CI, 1.17-6.17; P < .05) predicted future attempts even when adjusted for age, sex, depression, substance abuse, and method of the initial attempt. Method of the index attempt did not predict future suicide attempts in adjusted models (adjusted OR = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.35-1.25; P > .05).
   Conclusions: Assessment of the patient's reaction to survival, regardless of method of attempt, is important to identify risk of repeat attempts. (C) Copyright 2014 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB Immigrants represent a substantial proportion of suicides in Canada. This study assesses the hypothesis that high immigrant density fosters personal sense of community belonging among immigrants, and in turn, protects against suicide risk. This multilevel cross-sectional study is based on individual-level data from the 2007 Canadian Community Health Survey (n = 12,951 participants) merged with area-level data from the 2006 Canadian census (n = 57 health regions). Prevalence of suicidal ideation was 1.3 %. Among rural racial minority immigrants, each 10 % increase in immigrant density associated with 67 % lower odds of suicidal ideation (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.33, 95 % CI: 0.14-0.77); sense of community belonging did not mediate this association, but was independently associated with suicidal ideation (AOR = 0.44, 95 % CI: 0.28-0.69). Immigrant density was not associated with suicidal ideation among white immigrants or urban settings. Immigrant density and sense of community belonging may correlate with suicidal ideation through distinct mechanisms of association.

AB Many scholars assert that Indigenous peoples across the globe suffer a disproportionate burden of mental illness. Research indicates that colonialism and its associated processes are important determinants of Indigenous peoples' health internationally. In Canada, despite an abundance of health research documenting inequalities in morbidity and mortality rates for Indigenous peoples, relatively little research has focused on mental health. This paper provides a critical scoping review of the literature related to Indigenous mental health in Canada. We searched eleven databases and two Indigenous health-focused journals for research related to mental health, Indigenous peoples, and Canada, for the years 2006-2016. Over two hundred papers are included in the review and coded according to research theme, population group, and geography. Results demonstrate that the literature is overwhelmingly concerned with issues related to colonialism in mental health services and the prevalence and causes of mental illness among Indigenous peoples in Canada, but with several significant gaps. Mental health research related to Indigenous peoples in Canada overemphasizes suicide and problematic substance use; a more critical use of the concepts of colonialism and historical trauma is advised; and several population groups are underrepresented in research, including Metis peoples and urban or off-reserve Indigenous peoples. The findings are useful in an international context by providing a starting point for discussions, dialogue, and further study regarding mental health research for Indigenous peoples around the world.

ID PROJECT ECHO; PRIMARY-CARE; POPULATION; ONTARIO; ACCESS; IMPLEMENTATION;
   OUTCOMES; SUICIDE
AB Many Canadians living in rural and remote communities face difficulty accessing mental health services. This has become a pressing issue in the Canadian healthcare system duc to an increased focus on mental health and the high rate of suicide in rural regions as compared to urban communities. The inaccessibility of mental health services in rural Canada can only he partially explained by the lack of psychiatrists working in these areas. Additional access barriers arise from sociocultural nuances within individual rural communities, including an increased value placed on self-reliance and stigmatization of seeking mental health support. It has been challenging for mental health services to adequately address the vast social, economic and cultural differences that exist among individual rural communities - a reality that necessitates holistic mental health programs tailored to the unique complexities of each community. Nonetheless, programs aiming to improve accessibility of rural mental health services do exist across Canada, often employing technology to deliver psychiatric support to rural patients or provide guidance to rural primary care physicians who care for patients with mental illness. This narrative review outlines the barriers that arc impeding mental health care in rural Canada, the existing strategics to circumvent these barriers, and the role of current medical students in the future of rural psychiatry.

TI Domestic Homicide and Homicide-Suicide: The Older Offender
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PSYCHIATRY AND THE LAW
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; DEPRESSION; CRIMINALS; SERVICE; AGE
AB The importance of clarifying the features characteristic of older homicide offenders is highlighted by recent research that indicates an increase in rates of homicides followed by suicides of older perpetrators. In a retrospective study of data from coroners' files on domestic homicides involving individuals killed by an older spouse or family member (65+ years of age) over a 15-year period in Quebec, Canada, we identified several specific offender and victim characteristics and circumstances surrounding the offenses. The homicide was frequently followed by the suicide of the perpetrator. Several victims had pre-existing medical illnesses, indicating that the offenses may have been committed by individuals who were caregivers to chronically ill spouses. At the time of the offense, most of the perpetrators had a mental illness, usually depressive disorder, but few had received psychiatric help. The impact of mental illness on domestic homicide-suicide is indicated, underscoring the importance of identifying existing psychopathology.

ID GAMBLERS; BEHAVIOR; DISORDERS; EDMONTON
AB The association between pathological gambling and attempted suicide was examined using data from a prevalence study conducted in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The sample size was 7,214, the questionnaire was the Diagnostic Interview Schedule, and diagnoses were made on a lifetime basis according to DSM-III criteria. Logistic regression analysis was performed, with attempted suicide as the dependent variable. The odds ratio for pathological gambling was statistically significant (odds ratio = 4.91; 95% confidence interval = [1.41, 17.1]) when major depression was the only comorbid mental disorder in the model. As terms for additional mental disorders were included, pathological gambling ceased to be statistically significant. It was concluded that a history of pathological gambling is associated with previous attempted suicide, and that the association may be due to a common factor-"mental illness."

AB In 1989, Susan Wolf convincingly warned of a troublesome consequence that should discourage any movement in American society towards physician-assisted death-a legal backlash against the gains made for limiting life-sustaining treatment. The authors demonstrate that this dire consequence did not come to pass. As physician-assisted suicide gains a foothold in USA and elsewhere, many other slippery slope arguments are being put forward. Although many of these speculations should be taken seriously, they do not justify halting the new practice. Instead, our courts, regulatory agencies, journalists, professional organisations and researchers should carefully monitor and study it as it unfolds, allowing continuous improvement just as our society has done in implementing the practice of limiting life-sustaining treatment.

TI Suicide Attempts and Associated Factors in Newfoundland and Labrador,

SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE PSYCHIATRIE
LA English
DT Article
DE suicide attempts; epidemiology; hospitalization; Newfoundland and
   Labrador; Canada
AB Objective: This study examined the epidemiology and associated factors for suicide attempts requiring hospitalization in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.
   Method: We extracted data from the provincial hospital separation database. Outcome measures included incidence rates (IRs) of suicide attempts by age, sex, and geographical region of residence. We also analyzed sociodemographic data to determine associated factors.
   Results: A total of 978 patients who were hospitalized owing to suicide attempts were identified for 1998-2000, giving an overall IR of 68.7 per 100 000 person-years (P-Y). The age-specific rate for people aged 15 to 19 years was much greater, at 143.0 per 100 000 P-Y. The overall female-to-male ratio was 1.3, with an attempted suicide rate of 76.1 per 100 000 P-Y for female patients and 60.3 per 100 000 P-Y for male patients (P = 0.001). Labrador (210.2 per 100 000 P-Y), a region with a high Aboriginal population, had a higher rate of suicide attempts, compared with the island portion of the province (59.0 per 100 000 P-Y) (P < 0.001). More than 70% of hospitalizations were associated with psychiatric diagnosis. Poisoning was the most frequent method of attempting suicide. Higher IRs of suicide attempts were found among people who were divorced or separated and among those who were less educated (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Suicide attempt represents a significant public health concern in the province, particularly in Labrador. An increased risk of suicide attempts was associated with single status, female sex, younger age (teen or young adult), and low educational level during the index attempt. Further research is needed to explicate these findings and increase our understanding of attempted suicide.

AB Following Hagan, Gillis, and Simpson (1985), Hagan, Simpson, and Gillis (1987), and Girard (1993), we introduce a measure of egalitarian political attitudes that reflect gender differences in socialization that may affect adult suicidal behavior. Past efforts to explain national differences in the gender gap in suicide rates have not determined how the different determinants of male and female suicide rates cause the gender gap to vary among nations. We present a methodology that allows one to measure, one at a time, the impact of multiple predictors of societal integration on the gender gap. Data from nine European countries are used to illustrate this methodology.

SO HEALTH REPORTS

DT Article
DE Aboriginal; age-standardized mortality rates; child health; death rates;
   suicide; vital statistics; wounds and injuries
ID SUICIDE; HEALTH; YOUTH
AB Background
   Because Vital Statistics data do not include information on Inuit identity in all jurisdictions, mortality rates cannot be calculated specifically for Inuit. However, Inuit in Canada are geographically concentrated-78% live in Inuit Nunangat, and 82% of the area's total population identify as Inuit. While there are limitations, geographic approaches can be employed to calculate mortality for the population of that area.
   Data and methods
   The Vital Statistics Database (1994 to 2008) and population estimates were used to calculate age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) in five-year intervals around the 1996 and 2006 Census years. Mortality rates were calculated for 1- to 19-year-olds living in Inuit Nunangat and those living elsewhere in Canada.
   Results
   The ASMR in 2004-2008 for 1- to 19-year-olds in Inuit Nunangat was 188.0 deaths per 100,000 person-years at risk, five times the rate (35.3) elsewhere in Canada. The disparity had not narrowed over the previous decade. In Inuit Nunangat, injuries were responsible for 64% of deaths of children and teenagers, compared with 36% in the rest of Canada.
   Interpretation
   The persistently high mortality rates for children and teenagers living in Inuit Nunangat, compared with the rest of Canada, are important in understanding the health and socio-economic situation of residents of this region.

AB Purpose of reviewTo provide an update on recent studies on suicide prevention in indigenous populations with a focus on recently colonised indigenous peoples in Canada, the United States, Australia and New Zealand.Recent findingsThere have been several recent reviews on suicide prevention in indigenous populations with high suicide rates. However most of them describe the problem and there is little new that is available on effective interventions. One randomized controlled trial of a package of measures focusing on cultural identity in Maori who had recently self-harmed compared to usual care found little effect on suicidal behavior but it did significantly reduce presentations to hospital for any reason after one year.SummaryThe reasons for the limited evidence include a lack of ring fenced funding and a lack of research infrastructure; the problem of high rates of suicide but small numbers; and the difficulty in creating effective collaborations between researchers and communities. Potential solutions include identifying specific research funding; improving capacity in indigenous research; putting effort into accurate identification and recording of ethnicity; and thinking about the problem of suicide in recently colonised populations as a global problem to enable large scale high quality studies to take place.

DT Article
ID RATES; ENGLAND; TRENDS; WALES; GAS
AB Objectives. We investigated whether the installation of a suicide prevention barrier on Jacques-Cartier Bridge led to displacement of suicides to other jumping sites on Montreal Island and Monteregie, Quebec, the 2 regions it connects.
   Methods. Suicides on Montreal Island and Monteregie were extracted from chief coroners' records. We used Poisson regression to assess changes in annual suicide rates by jumping from Jacques-Cartier Bridge and from other bridges and other sites and by other methods before (1990-June 2004) and after (2005-2009) installation of the barrier.
   Results. Suicide rates by jumping from Jacques-Cartier Bridge decreased after installation of the barrier (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.13, 0.43), which persisted when all bridges (IRR = 0.39; 95% CI = 0.27, 0.55) and all jumping sites (IRR = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.54, 0.80) in the regions were considered.
   Conclusions. Little or no displacement to other jumping sites may occur after installation of a barrier at an iconic site such as Jacques-Cartier Bridge. A barrier's design is important to its effectiveness and should be considered for new bridges with the potential to become symbolic suicide sites.

AB Objectives. Aboriginal leadership and families are deeply concerned about the rate of suicide attempt among their young people. The objectives of this study were to (a) describe the prevalence of suicide attempt and (b) to describe correlates of Vulnerability to Suicide attempts within a cohort of young Aboriginal people who use drugs in 2 Canadian cities. We aimed to Situate file findings within the context of historical and lifetime trauma.
   Study design. The Cedar Project is a prospective cohort study involving 605 young Aboriginal people aged 14-30 Who use drugs in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia, Canada.
   Methods. Multivariable logistic regression modelling identified independent predictors of suicide attempts. Estimates of adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated.
   Result. In multivariable analysis, residing in Prince George (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]: 1.80,95% Cl: 1.23, 2.64), ever having been sexually abused (AOR: 2.07, 95% CI: 1.39, 3.08), and ever having overdosed (AOR: 2.29, 95% Cl: 1.53, 3.42) independently predicted lifetime attempted Suicide.
   Conclusions. Suicide prevention and intervention programs must address historical and lifetime trauma among Aboriginal young people who struggle with substance dependence. (Int J Circumpolar Health 2009; 68(3):261-273)

ID SUICIDE
AB In-custody deaths have garnered considerable attention in recent years, both within Canada and internationally. This study represents the first examination of death-in-custody cases across three provinces - Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario - between 2000 and 2009. To provide context, the article reviews deaths in custody in several international jurisdictions. The objective of this project was to identify baseline indicators of the nature and extent of custody deaths in Canada. Using all completed cases from the offices of Medical Examiners and Coroners, this paper compares and contrasts the manner and causes of death by type of custody (provincial vs. federal) and further compares the mortality trends (natural vs. non-natural) between the provinces. The results and findings from this comparison are then examined and the implications for policy makers are identified. Most of the recommendations relate to improved intake and more sophisticated pre-screening strategies for inmates.

TI Assessing the risk for suicide in schizophrenia according to migration,

   METAANALYSIS
AB Background: Suicide is a leading cause of mortality among those afflicted by schizophrenia. Previous studies demonstrated that the stressors associated with immigration may lead to an onset of schizophrenia and suicide separately in susceptible individuals. However, no studies have shown whether immigration may lead to suicidal behaviour for individuals with schizophrenia. Our study proposes that an individual's geographical ancestry, ethnicity or migration status may be predictive of suicide risk in schizophrenia.
   Methods: In a sample of 276 participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, we conducted cross-sectional assessments to collect clinical information. Self-identified ethnicity and suicide history were collected through self-report questionnaires and interview-based scales. Ancestry was identified using 292 genetic markers from HapMap. Migrants were classified as those who immigrated to Canada during their lifetime. Using a regression analysis, we tested whether a history of migration, ethnicity or geographical ancestry were predictive of a history of suicide attempts.
   Results: Our analysis failed to demonstrate a significant relationship between suicide history and migration, ethnicity or ancestry. However, ethnicity appears to be significantly associated with the number of psychiatric hospitalizations in our sample.
   Conclusion: Ethnicity and migration history are not predictive of previous suicide attempts. Ethnicity may be an important demographic factor affecting access to mental health resources and frequency of hospitalizations.

TI Suicide among East Asians in North America: A scoping review
SO JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH

ID COLLEGE-STUDENTS; MODEL MINORITY; IDEATION; IMMIGRANT; CHALLENGES;
   PREVENTION; INVENTORY; BEHAVIOR
AB Background: Suicide is among the leading causes of death in North America for various age groups. Given the far-reaching impacts of suicide on families and societies, there is growing research on this phenomenon; yet, most focus primarily on mainstream populations (i.e. Caucasian, native-born Americans or Canadians) and/or aggregated population data. As a result cultural considerations within multicultural milieus and increasing globalization can be overlooked.
   Aims: This scoping review reports findings drawn from 11 studies examining suicide among East Asian (EA) population in North America.
   Method: A web-based literature search was performed to identify original research articles published from January 2002 to December 2011, addressing suicide among EAs living in North America, specifically in the USA and Canada.
   Results: Four prominent thematic findings were identified in the literature related to: (1) rates of suicidal ideation and behavior among EAs in North America; (2) acculturation; (3) family support and conflict; and (4) other cultural and ethnic considerations.
   Conclusions: Further research, particularly qualitative and/or mixed methods, is needed to provide a more complete understanding of suicide among this under-studied population. This article concludes with a list of recommendations for future research based on the review.

TI Body mass index weight categories in adults who died by suicide: An

DT Article

ID RISK-FACTORS; OBESITY; ASSOCIATION; OVERWEIGHT; GENDER; FAT; MORTALITY;
   IDEATION; CANADA; COHORT
AB Background: There is conflicting evidence about the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and suicide death. This study aimed to characterize and compare suicide deaths by weight using BMI weight categories.
   Methods: We examined suicide deaths in adults in the city of Toronto (2009-2015); grouped them by BMI categories (underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese) and compared groups based on demographics, clinical variables and method of suicide death.
   Results: Suicide decedents' (n = 1429) mean age was 48.6 years (SD = 17.4) and mean BMI was 25.5 (SD = 5.4). Underweight decedents were more likely to be female and to have cancer while obese decedents were more likely to have diabetes. Underweight decedents were more likely to have an identified history of any medical condition. Obese and overweight decedents were significantly more likely to have an identified history of any psychiatric condition. Non-violent methods (e.g., self-poisoning) were used at a higher proportion by people with obesity and by people who were underweight.
   Limitations: Psychological autopsies were not available and it was not possible to assess for change in or stability of BMI over time.
   Conclusions: These findings add to our understanding of the relationship between suicide and weight. A higher prevalence of females as well as those with a history of cancer and any medical condition in underweight decedents was noteworthy and of potential clinical significance.

AB Objective To describe the trends in suicide and emergency department (ED) visits for self-harm in youth by immigration status and immigrant characteristics.
   Design Population-based longitudinal cohort study from 1996 to 2012 using linked health and administrative datasets.
   Setting Ontario, Canada.
   Participants Youth 10 to 24 years, living in Ontario, Canada.
   Exposure The main exposure was immigrant status (recent immigrant (RI) versus long-term residents (LTR)). Secondary exposures included region of birth, duration or residence, and refugee status.
   Main outcome measure Trends over time in suicide and ED self-harm were modelled within consecutive 3-year time periods. Rate ratios were estimated using Poisson regression models.
   Results 2.5 to 2.9 million individuals were included per cohort period. LTR suicide rates ranged from 7.4 to 9.4/100 000 male person-years versus 2.2-3.4/100 000 females. RI's suicide rates were 2.7-7.2/100,000 male versus 1.9-2.7/100 000 female person-years. Suicide rates were lower among RI compared with LTR (adjusted relative rate (aRR)=0.70, 95% CI=0.57 to 0.85) with different mechanisms of suicide. No significant time trend in suicide rates was observed (p=0.40). ED self-harm rates for LTR and RI were highest in females (2.6-3.4/1000 LTR females versus 1.1-1.5/1000 males, 1.2-1.8/1000 RI females versus 0.4-0.6/1000 males). RI had lower rates of self-harm compared with LTR (aRR=0.60, 95% CI=0.56 to 0.65). Stratum-specific rates showed a steeper decline per period in RI compared with LTR (RI: aRR=0.85, 95% CI=0.81 to 0.89; LTR: aRR=0.91, 95% CI=0.90 to 0.93). Observed trends were not universal across region of origin and by refugee status.
   Interpretation Suicide rates have been stable and ED self-harm rates are declining over time among RI youth. These trends by important subgroups should continue to be monitored to allow for early identification of subpopulations of immigrant youth in need of targeted and culturally appropriate public health interventions.

AB Background: We addressed two unanswered questions from prior research, demonstrating a prospective association between frequent religious service attendance and decreased risk for suicide. First, we assessed whether religious service attendance conferred protection from suicide even after accounting for strength of religious affiliation. Second, we evaluated whether the relationship between religious service attendance and suicide was subject to period effects.
   Methods: Data were drawn from the 1978-2010 General Social Survey, a nationally representative study of 30,650 non-institutionalized, English-speaking American residents age 18 or older. Data were linked with the National Death Index through the end of 2014. We analyzed these data using moderated Cox proportional hazard analyses.
   Results: Religious affiliation had no relationship with suicide. Religious service attendance only had a protective effect against suicide death among those in later (2000-2010) rather than earlier (1998 and earlier) data collection periods.
   Limitations: Secondary analysis of data limited the types of variables that were available.
   Conclusions: The protective nature of religion is due more to participating in religious activities, such as attending religious services, than to having a strong religious affiliation, and this effect exists primarily in more recent data collection periods.

ID SOCIAL-WORK RESEARCH; MENTAL-HEALTH; INTERVENTIONS; PROMOTION;

AB Background: Indigenous young people have significantly higher suicide rates than their non-indigenous counterparts. There is a need for culturally appropriate and effective suicide prevention programs for this demographic. Aims: This review assesses suicide prevention programs that have been evaluated for indigenous youth in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. Method: The databases MEDLENE and PsycINFO were searched for publications on suicide prevention programs targeting indigenous youth that include reports on evaluations and outcomes. Program content, indigenous involvement, evaluation design, program implementation, and outcomes were assessed for each article. Results: The search yielded 229 articles; 90 abstracts were assessed, and 11 articles describing nine programs were reviewed. Two Australian programs and seven American programs were included. Programs were culturally tailored, flexible, and incorporated multiple-levels of prevention. No randomized controlled trials were found, and many programs employed ad hoc evaluations, poor program description, and no process evaluation. Conclusion: Despite culturally appropriate content, the results of the review indicate that more controlled study designs using planned evaluations and valid outcome measures are needed in research on indigenous youth suicide prevention. Such changes may positively influence the future of research on indigenous youth suicide prevention as the outcomes and efficacy will be more reliable.

AB Objective: To characterize self-poisoning suicide deaths in BD compared to other suicide decedents.
   Methods: Extracted coroner data from all suicide deaths (n = 3319) in Toronto, Canada from 1998 to 2012. Analyses of demographics, clinical history, recent stressors, and suicide details were conducted in 5 subgroups of suicide decedents: BD self-poisoning, BD other methods, non-BD self-poisoning, non-BD other methods, and unipolar depression self-poisoning. Toxicology results for lethal and present substances were also compared between BD and non-BD self-poisoning subgroups as well as between BD and unipolar depression self-poisoning subgroups.
   Results: Among BD suicide decedents, self-poisoning was significantly associated with female sex, past suicide attempts, and comorbid substance abuse. In both the BD and non-BD self-poisoning groups, opioids were the most common class of lethal medication. For both groups, benzodiazepines and antidepressants were the most common medications present at time of death, and in 23% of the BD group, an antidepressant was present without a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic. Only 31% of the BD group had any mood stabilizer present, with carbamazepine being most common. No antidepressant, mood stabilizer, or antipsychotic was present in 15.5% of the BD group. Relative to unipolar depression self-poisoning group, the BD self-poisoning group evidenced higher proportion of previous suicide attempt(s) and psychiatry/ER visits in the previous week.
   Conclusion: People with BD who die by suicide via self-poisoning comprise a distinct but understudied group. The predominant absence of guideline-concordant pharmacologic care comprises a crucial target for future policy and knowledge translation efforts.

AB Objectives: We evaluated the six-item Inmate Security Assessment (ISA) tool used among detained youth in Manitoba, Canada. Method: Two hundred and forty-one recorded self-harm incidents among all incarcerated youth occurred between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2010 (N=5102). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), positive likelihood ratio (PLR) and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) for three categories of suicide risk (high, medium, and low) as well as each of the six suicide risk evaluation indicators were determined. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) calculations for the three suicide risk levels and the six indicators were created. Results: Having at least a low suicide risk level (93.8%) or at least one suicide risk factor (94.6%) provided high sensitivity. Specificity was high if an individual had at least a medium suicide risk level (94.2%) or at least three suicide risk indicators (96.7%). The PPV was low (8.9-16.2%) and the NPV was high (94.9-99.3%) for all suicide risk levels. The most sensitive risk factor for self-harm was a prior history of suicidal behavior or a family history of suicide (94.6%). All risk indicators had a low PPV (7.4-23.1%) and a high NPV (95.4-99.5%). A very low NLR was found for those without prior suicidal behavior or a family history of suicide (0.107). The AUC was 0.719 (95%CI = 0.692-0.746), indicating a fair test. Conclusion: The ISA is a moderately accurate tool for identifying risk for self-harm in detained youth.

   BACKGROUND: Despite the known disparity in suicide rates in Canada, there is limited information on the independent risk indicators of suicide ideation among First Nations youth living on reserve.
   OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and adjusted risk indicators for suicide ideation among on-reserve First Nations youth. METHODS: Saskatoon Tribal Council (Saskatchewan) First Nations students enrolled in grades 5 through 8 who were living on reserve were asked to complete a health survey using validated questionnaires. In total, 75.3% of the students completed the survey. The study was led by the Saskatoon Tribal Council with assistance from three departments at the University of Saskatchewan (Saskatoon, Saskatchewan).
   RESULTS: Among on-reserve First Nations youth, 23% experienced suicide ideation within the past 12 months. In comparison, 8.5% of Saskatoon urban youth and 19% of Saskatoon urban Aboriginal youth within the same grades experienced suicide ideation. Wanting to leave home (OR 13.91 [95% CI 3.05 to 63.42]), having depressed mood (OR 2.98 [ 95% CI 1.16 to 7.67]) and not feeling loved (OR 3.85 [ 95% CI 1.49 to 9.93]) were independently associated with suicide ideation among on-reserve youth. None of the children with a father who was professionally employed reported suicide ideation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the independent risk indicators associated with suicide ideation among First Nations youth living on reserve will hopefully aid in appropriate interventions.

DE pathological gambling; attempted suicide; survey
ID DIAGNOSTIC INTERVIEW; MENTAL-HEALTH
AB Objective: To examine the association between pathological gambling (PG) and attempted suicide in a nationally representative sample of Canadians.
   Methods: Data came from the Canadian Community Health Survey, Cycle 1.2, conducted in 2002, in which 36 984 subjects, aged 15 years or older, were interviewed. Logistic 14 regression was performed with attempted suicide (in the past year) as the dependent variable. The independent variables were PG, major depression, alcohol dependence, drug dependence, and mental health care (in the past year), as well as a range of sociodemographic variables. Survey weights and bootstrap methods were used to account for the complex survey design.
   Results: In the final logistic regression model, which included terms for PG, major depression, alcohol dependence, and mental health care, as well as age, sex, education, and income, the odds ratio for PG and attempted suicide was 3.43 (95% confidence interval, 1.37 to 8.60).
   Conclusions: PG (in the past year) and attempted suicide (in the past year) are associated in a nationally representative sample of Canadians. However, it is not possible to say from these data whether this represents a causal relation.

AB Background: There is limited information available regarding community pharmacists' stigma of suicide. Pharmacists regularly interact with people at risk of suicide and stigmatizing attitudes may impact care. Objective: To measure community pharmacists' stigma of suicide. Method: Pharmacists in Canada and Australia completed an online survey with the Stigma of Suicide Scale-Short Form. Data were analysed descriptively and with univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Three hundred and ninety-six pharmacists returned completed surveys (Canada n = 235; Australia n = 161; female 70%; mean age = 38.6 +/- 12.7 years). The rate of endorsement of stigmatizing terms was low overall. Canadian and Australian pharmacists differed (p < 0.05) for several variables (e.g. age, friend or relative with a mental illness, training in mental health crisis). Pharmacists without someone close to them living with a mental illness were more likely to strongly agree/agree with words describing those who die by suicide as pathetic, stupid, irresponsible, and cowardly. Those without a personal diagnosis of mental illness strongly agreed/agreed with the terms immoral, irresponsible, vengeful, and cowardly. More Australian pharmacists strongly agreed/agreed that people who die by suicide are irresponsible, cowardly, and disconnected. Independent variables associated with a higher stigma were male sex, Australian, and negative perceptions about suicide preventability. Conclusion: Community pharmacists frequently interact with people at risk of suicide and generally have low agreement of stigmatizing terms for people who die by suicide. Research should focus on whether approaches such as contact-based education can minimize existing stigma.

ID CANADA
AB Background. Suicides remain a major public health problem in Greenland. Their increase coincides with the modernization since 1950. Serious suicidal thoughts are reported by a significant proportion of participants in countrywide surveys.
   Objective. To analyze the time trend by region of suicides and suicidal thoughts among the Inuit in Greenland.
   Design. Data included the Greenland registry of causes of death for 1970-2011 and 2 cross-sectional health surveys carried out in 1993-1994 and 2005-2010 with 1,580 and 3,102 Inuit participants, respectively.
   Results. Suicide rates were higher among men than women while the prevalence of suicidal thoughts was higher among women. Suicide rates for men and women together increased from 1960 to 1980 and have remained around 100 per 100,000 person-years since then. The regional pattern of time trend for suicide rates varied with an early peak in the capital, a continued increase to very high rates in remote East and North Greenland and a slow increase in villages relative to towns on the West Coast. Suicidal thoughts followed the regional pattern for completed suicides. Especially for women there was a noticeable increasing trend in the villages. The relative risk for suicide was highest among those who reported suicidal thoughts, but most suicides happened outside this high-risk group.
   Conclusion. Suicide rates and the prevalence of suicidal thoughts remain high in Greenland but different regional trends point towards an increased marginalization between towns on the central West Coast, villages and East and North Greenland. Different temporal patterns call for different regional strategies of prevention.

AB Background: Myocardial infarction (MI) has been associated with an increased risk of suicide, further increased among individuals with a comorbid psychiatric illness. A paucity of studies have examined details of suicide among individuals with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and comorbid depression. We aimed to compare demographic, clinical and suicide-specific characteristics between suicide victims with CVD with depression (CVD+D) and without comorbid depression (CVD-D).
   Methods: Coroner data on suicide decedents with CVD (n=413) occurring in Toronto, Canada from 1998 to 2012 were collected. Characteristics were compared between the CVD+D and CVD-D groups. Regression analysis examined for gender differences in these groups.
   Results: CVD+D subjects compared to CVD-D were more likely to have had a past suicide attempt (p = 0.008), and to have experienced a bereavement (p = 0.008) or financial stressor (p = 0.005) in the past year. Each of these variables remained significantly associated with the presence of depression after the regression analysis. Within the CVD+D group, females were more likely to die from suicide by self poisoning (p < 0.0001) and males by shooting (p = 0.001). Limitations: Psychological autopsies were not available. The definition of CVD was broad and the accuracy of its diagnosis could not be confirmed.
   Conclusion: Individuals with CVD+D who died from suicide had significant differences in clinical characteristics and specific stressors compared to those without depression. These data may help to better characterize suicide risk and prevention in this vulnerable population. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB PurposeTo explore Canadian and Australian community pharmacists' practice experiences in caring for people at risk of suicide.MethodsWe conducted a thematic analysis of 176 responses to an open-ended extension question in an online survey.ResultsFour themes were identified and include referrals and triage, accessibility for confiding, emotional toll, and stigma. Subthemes included gatekeeping the medication supply, sole disclosure, planning for end of life, concerns of support people, assessing the validity of suicidality, gaps in the system, not directly asking, ill-equipped, resources in the pharmacy, relying on others to continue care, and attention seeking.ConclusionsCommunity pharmacists are caring for patients at risk of suicide frequently, and often with patients seeking the help of pharmacists directly. Pharmacists engage in activities and actions that would be considered outside of the traditional dispensing roles and provide support and intervention to people at risk of suicide through collaboration and other mechanisms. Further research to determine appropriate education and training and postvention supports is required.

AB There is evidence for widespread disbelief in the genetics of suicide, despite recent research progress in this area and convergent evidence supporting a role for genetic factors. This study analyzed the beliefs held in 8 samples (total N=1224) of various types (psychology, medical, and various undergraduates, psychology graduates, and the general population) from 6 countries located on 3 continents (Austria, Canada, Malaysia, Romania, United Kingdom, and the USA). Endorsement rates for the existence of genetic risk factors for suicide ranged from 26% and 30% (Austrian psychology undergraduates and general population) to around 50% (psychology undergraduates in the USA and United Kingdom). In the 8 samples, respondents' sex, age, religiosity, political orientation, and other demographic variables were, for the most part, unrelated, but overall knowledge about suicide throughout was related positively to endorsement rates. Consistent with previous research, across a considerable variety of sample types and cultural settings there was no evidence for a clear majority believing in genetic bases for suicide.

   reasons why; Mixed-methods; Stigma
ID MENTAL-ILLNESS; NEWS MEDIA; CAMPAIGNS
AB Background: Evidence suggests that the media can influence societal attitudes and beliefs to various social issues. This influence is especially strong for mental health issues, particularly suicide. As such, the aim of this study is to systematically examine Canadian newspaper coverage of the popular fictional Netflix series 13 Reasons Why, wherein the lead character dies by suicide in the final episode.
   Methods: Articles mentioning the series were systematically collected from best-selling Canadian newspapers in the three-month period following series release (April-June 2017). Articles were coded for adherence to key best practice recommendations on how to sensitively report suicide. Frequency counts and proportions were produced. An inductive qualitative thematic analysis was then undertaken to identify common themes within the articles.
   Results: A total of 71 articles met study inclusion criteria. The majority of articles did not mention the suicide method (88.7%) and did not use stigmatizing language such as 'commit suicide' (84.5%). Almost half of the articles linked suicide to wider social issues (43.7%) or quoted a mental health professional (45.1%). 25% included information telling others considering suicide where to get help. Our qualitative analysis indicated that articles simultaneously praised and criticized the series. It was praised for (i) promoting dialogue and discussion about youth suicide; (ii) raising awareness of youth suicide issues; (iii) shining a spotlight on wider social issues that may affect suicide. It was criticized for (i) glorifying suicide, (ii) harmfully impacting young viewers; (iii) prompting pushback from educators and schools.
   Conclusions: Newspaper coverage of '13 Reasons Why' generally adhered to core best practice media recommendations, and sensitively discussed suicide from various angles, prompting productive discussion and dialogue about youth suicide. These findings suggest that the media can be an ally in promoting dialogue and raising awareness of important public health issues such as suicide.

AB Self-reported life satisfaction is increasingly measured in government and private surveys around the world. In Canada, life satisfaction questions have not been asked in a consistent manner over time, but the accumulated set of data since 1985, along with recent surveys with repeated structure, now facilitates an analysis of regional changes. Those two and a half decades reveal a significant increase in life satisfaction in the province of Quebec as compared with the rest of Canada. The scale of this increase in well-being is comparable to the imputed effect of more than a trebling of mean household income.

   PREVENTION; WALES
AB Objective To determine whether rates of suicide changed in Toronto after a barrier was erected at Bloor Street Viaduct, the bridge with the world's second highest annual rate of suicide by jumping after Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.
   Design Natural experiment.
   Setting City of Toronto and province of Ontario, Canada; records at the chief coroner's office of Ontario 1993-2001 (nine years before the barrier) and July 2003-June 2007 (four years after the barrier).
   Participants 14 789 people who completed suicide in the city of Toronto and in Ontario.
   Main outcome measure Changes in yearly rates of suicide by jumping at Bloor Street Viaduct, other bridges, and buildings, and by other means.
   Results Yearly rates of suicide by jumping in Toronto remained unchanged between the periods before and after the construction of a barrier at Bloor Street Viaduct (56.4 v 56.6, P=0.95). A mean of 9.3 suicides occurred annually at Bloor Street Viaduct before the barrier and none after the barrier (P<0.01). Yearly rates of suicide by jumping from other bridges and buildings were higher in the period after the barrier although only significant for other bridges (other bridges: 8.7 v 14.2, P=0.01; buildings: 38.5 v 42.7, P=0.32).
   Conclusions Although the barrier prevented suicides at Bloor Street Viaduct, the rate of suicide by jumping in Toronto remained unchanged. This lack of change might have been due to a reciprocal increase in suicides from other bridges and buildings. This finding suggests that Bloor Street Viaduct may not have been a uniquely attractive location for suicide and that barriers on bridges may not alter absolute rates of suicide by jumping when comparable bridges are nearby.

AB OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to highlight the differences in injury rates between populations through a descriptive epidemiological study of population-level trends in injury mortality for the high-income countries of Australia, Canada and the United States.
   METHODS: Mortality data were available for the US from 2000 to 2014, and for Canada and Australia from 2000 to 2012. Injury causes were defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision external cause codes, and were grouped into major causes. Rates were direct-method age-adjusted using the US 2000 projected population as the standard age distribution.
   RESULTS: US motor vehicle injury mortality rates declined from 2000 to 2014 but remained markedly higher than those of Australia or Canada. In all three countries, fall injury mortality rates increased from 2000 to 2014. US homicide mortality rates declined, but remained higher than those of Australia and Canada. While the US had the lowest suicide rate in 2000, it increased by 24% during 2000-2014, and by 2012 was about 14% higher than that in Australia and Canada. The poisoning mortality rate in the US increased dramatically from 2000 to 2014.
   CONCLUSION: Results show marked differences and striking similarities in injury mortality between the countries and within countries over time. The observed trends differed by injury cause category. The substantial differences in injury rates between similarly resourced populations raises important questions about the role of societal-level factors as underlying causes of the differential distribution of injury in our communities.

DT Article
ID MENTAL-HEALTH; RURAL SUICIDE; RISK; MORTALITY; CONTACT; PSYCHOSIS; RATES
AB Objective: To compare individuals with and without schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or psychotic disorder not otherwise specified) who die by suicide.
   Method: This is a retrospective case control study which compared all individuals who died by suicide in Ontario, Canada with (cases) and without (controls) SSD between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2012. Cases (individuals with SSD) were compared to controls on demographics, clinical characteristics, and health service utilization proximal to suicide. A secondary analysis compared the characteristics of those with SSD and those with severe mental illness (defined as those without SSD who have had a psychiatric hospitalization within the five-years before suicide (excluding the 30 days prior to death)).
   Results: Among 5650 suicides, 663 (11.7%) were by individuals with SSD. Compared to other suicides, SSD suicides were significantly more likely to be between the ages of 25-34. SSD suicide victims were significantly more likely to reside in the lowest income neighbourhoods and to reside in urban areas. SSD victims were also significantly more likely to have comorbid mood and personality disorders and all types of health service utilization, including outpatient mental health service contact in the 30 days prior to death, even when compared only with those who had a history of mental health hospitalization.
   Conclusions: Individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorder account for over 1 in 10 suicide deaths, tend to be younger, poorer, urban, more clinically complex, and have higher rates of mental health service contact prior to death. The demographic and service utilization differences persist even when the SSD group is compared with a population with severe mental illness that is not SSD. Suicide prevention strategies for people with schizophrenia spectrum disorder should emphasize the importance of clinical suicide risk assessment during clinical encounters, particularly early in the course of illness.

ID BEHAVIORS; HEALTH; RISK; ADOLESCENTS; FOUNDATION; CRIME
AB In this article, we test the utility of Agnew's general strain theory to explain suicidal behaviors among American Indian youth. Data from 721 American Indian adolescents from the Midwest and Canada were collected in partnership with participating reservations/reserves and a research team. We investigate the effects of strains/stressors on suicide, including tests of mediating effects of negative emotions on relationships between stressors and suicidality. We found that several strains/stressors were related to suicidality, including coercive parenting, caretaker rejection, negative school attitudes, and perceived discrimination. We also found that depressive symptoms and anger mediated the effects of several key predictors of suicidality. We discuss the theoretical and policy implications of our work for the general strain theory and for American Indian suicide in general.

AB Suicide claims over 800,000 lives each year worldwide. Suicide rates in indigenous populations in Canada are about double that of the national average, making it a serious public health issue. Numerous factors are involved in suicide risk, including genetic factors, as well as various psychosocial stressors, such as historical experience with the Indian Residential School system for Indigenous populations, as well as protective variables such as social support. Here, we report the first genetic study of suicidal behaviors that includes multiple measures of stress and social supports. We investigated the role of the functional Val66Met marker (rs6265) in the Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) gene in suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in a First Nations community sample (N = 278). We did not find a significant association between the BDNF rs6265 marker and suicidal behaviors. We found childhood adversities, recent life stress, chronic stress, perceived stress, difficulties, and hazardous alcohol use to be associated with both suicidal ideation and suicide attempt. Thus, while additional studies with larger samples are required to elucidate the genetic component of suicide, addressing environmental stressors may be important for suicide prevention.

AB Introduction: The risks of suicidality (suicidal ideation or behaviour) are higher in Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) Veterans (former members) than in the Canadian general population (CGP). Suicide prevention is everyone's responsibility, but it can be difficult for many to see how they can help. This article proposes an evidence-based theoretical framework for discussing suicide prevention. The framework informed the 2017 joint CAF - Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) suicide prevention strategy. Methods: Evidence for the framework was derived from participation in expert panels conducted by the CAF in 2009 and 2016, a review of findings from epidemiological studies of suicidality in CAF Veterans released since 1976, suicide prevention literature reviews conducted at VAC since 2009, and published theories of suicide. Results: Common to all suicide theories is the understanding that suicide causation is multifactorial, complex, and varies individually such that factors interact rather than lie along linear causal chains. Discussion: The proposed framework has three core concepts: a composite well-being framework, the life course view, and opportunities for prevention along the suicide pathway from ideation to behaviour. Evidence indicates that Veterans are influenced onto, along, and off the pathway by variable combinations of mental illness, stressful well-being problems and life events, individual factors including suicidal diathesis vulnerability, barriers to well-being supports, acquired lethal capability, imitation, impulsivity, and access to lethal means. The proposed framework can inform discussions about both whole-community participation in prevention, intervention and postvention activities at the individual and population levels, and the development of hypotheses for the increased risk of suicidality in CAF Veterans.
   LAY SUMMARY Suicide prevention is everyone's responsibility, but many wonder "What can I do?" This article proposes a practical framework that can help people and organizations to find roles for themselves. We have based the framework on expert suicide theories and research findings. The framework has three parts: a well-being framework, the life course concept, and opportunities for preventing suicides along pathways from thinking about suicide to attempting suicide.

DT Article
DE education; electronic health record; interprofessional care; mental
   health; psychiatry; suicide risk
AB Purpose:
   This article describes efforts undertaken to improve the clinical competencies of health professionals in the area of suicide risk assessment, documentation, and care planning.
   Description of the Project:
   Best practices that fit the mental health and addictions setting were identified from the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario Best Practice Guideline on Assessment and Care of Adults at Risk for Suicidal Ideation and Behaviour. A variety of methods were used to implement the guidelines at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. These included 3 in-person educational modules, an e-learning module, and the creation of an electronic health record suicide risk assessment documentation form.
   Outcome:
   Results showed that interprofessional team members improved their suicide awareness and increased their confidence and knowledge in suicide risk assessment and the identification of interventions for clients at risk. Organizational level performance and quality improvement activities after implementation of the education and the electronic suicide risk assessment documentation form are being implemented through a collaboration between performance improvement, clinical education and informatics, and professional practice.
   Conclusion:
   The success of an interprofessional educational program of this nature is dependent on the collaboration of a number of stakeholders from a variety of areas of the organization.

AB Objective: Mindset is a short recently-published booklet funded by the Mental Health Commission of Canada outlining evidence-based guidelines and best practices for journalists writing about mental health and suicide. Our study aimed to assess fidelity to Mindset recommendations in Canadian newspaper reports of a recent celebrity suicide. A secondary aim is to identify common themes discussed in these newspaper articles.
   Methods: Articles about Robin Williams' suicide from major Canadian newspapers were gathered and coded for presence or absence of each of the 14 recommendations in the "Covering Suicide'' section of Mindset. A threshold of 80% was set to test for high fidelity to the guidelines. A qualitative content analysis of the articles was also undertaken to discern common themes and social issues discussed in the articles.
   Results: Fifty-five per cent of articles surpassed the 80% threshold for high fidelity, while 85% applied at least 70% of the recommendations. The recommendation most commonly overlooked was "Do tell others considering suicide how they can get help,'' which was absent in 73% of articles. The most common themes discussed were those of addictions and stigma.
   Conclusions: The news articles generally follow the evidence-based guidelines regarding the reporting of suicide set out in Mindset. This is a welcome development. Future research should continue to examine reporting of suicide to assess for further improvements, while also examining the wider impact of Mindset on the reporting of mental illness per se.

AB Significant controversy exists as to whether soldiers are at increased risk for suicide and suicidal behaviors compared with civilians. Furthermore, little is known about whether risk factors for suicidal behaviors in civilian populations are generalizable to soldiers. The aim of the current study is to determine whether the prevalence and correlates of past-year suicidal ideation and suicide attempts differ in Canadian soldiers when compared with Canadian civilians. The current study utilized data from the Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 1.2-Canadian Forces Supplement in conjunction with the 2001-2002 Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 1.2. Logistic regression interaction models were used to explore differences between correlates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts comparing Canadian soldiers with civilians. Although there was no significant difference between the 2 samples on prevalence of past-year suicidal ideation, the prevalence of past-year suicide attempts was significantly lower in the Canadian forces sample compared with the civilian population (odds ratio = 0.41, 95% confidence interval: 0.25, 0.67). Findings suggest that suicide attempts are less common in Canadian active military personnel than in the civilian population. Possible mechanisms for these differences are discussed.

SO LANCET

DT Article
ID ATTITUDES; CARE; NETHERLANDS; DEATH
AB Background Euthanasia and assisted suicide, and policies to address them are the subjects of contentious debate in many countries. However, the question of why people desire euthanasia or assisted suicide has not been coherently answered. We aimed to answer this question in a specific group of patients.
   Methods We did a qualitative study of 32 people with HIV-1 or AIDS, who were enrolled in the HIV-1 Ontario Observational Database at Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. We elicited participants' experiences of deliberation about euthanasia or assisted suicide, and the meaning of these experiences with in-depth, face-to-face interviews. We analysed our data with grounded theory methods.
   Findings Participants' desire for euthanasia and assisted suicide were affected by two main factors: disintegration, which resulted from symptoms and loss of function; and loss of community, which we defined as progressive diminishment of opportunities to initiate and maintain close personal relationships. These factors resulted in perceived loss of self. Euthanasia and assisted suicide were seen by participants as means of limiting loss of self.
   Interpretation These determinants of desire for euthanasia or assisted suicide in people with HIV-1 or AIDS have implications for the debate on these practices, and development of policies to regulate them.

AB Background: While several studies have demonstrated that gay and bisexual men are at increased risk of suicide less attention has been given to the processes that generate the inherent inequity with the mainstream population. This study tested whether syndemic theory can explain the excess suicide burden in a sample of Canadian gay and bisexual men. Syndemic theory accounts for co-occurring and mutually reinforcing epidemics suffered by vulnerable groups due to the effects of social marginalization.
   Methods: This study used data from Sex Now 2011, a cross-sectional survey of Canadian gay and bisexual men (n = 8382). The analysis measured the extent to which anti-gay marginalization and several psychosocial health problems are associated with suicide related ideation and attempts. Since psychosocial health problems were hypothesized to have an additive effect on suicide related ideation and attempts, the analysis calculated the effect of accumulated psychosocial health problems on suicide behavior.
   Results: Suicide ideation and attempts were positively associated with each individual marginalization indicator (verbal violence, physical violence, bullying, sexual violence and work discrimination) and psychosocial health problems (smoking, party drugs, depression, anxiety, STIs, HIV risk and HIV). Furthermore, prevalence of suicide ideation and attempts increased with each added psychosocial health problem. Those who reported 3 or more had 6.90 (5.47-8.70) times the odds of experiencing suicide ideation and 16.29 (9.82-27.02) times the odds of a suicide attempt compared to those with no psychosocial health problems.
   Conclusions: This investigation suggests that syndemics is a useful theory for studying suicide behavior among gay and bisexual men. Moreover, the findings highlight a need to address gay and bisexual men's health problems holistically and the urgent need to reduce this population's experience with marginalization and violence.

AB Postpartum suicidality in Israel had not been systematically studied until the recent important investigation by Glasser and colleagues. The authors review rates, trends, and characteristics of postpartum women who considered, attempted, or completed suicide in Israel. This commentary argues that, although postpartum suicidality is relatively rare, it is extremely tragic-not just for the women, but for the entire family and community. The main aim of this commentary is to emphasize that preventive efforts should continue and expand, especially among at-risk groups. At-risk groups include the youngest age group, postpartum Arab women, and postpartum former Soviet Union immigrants. Identification of women at risk or suffering from postpartum depression (PPD) is mandated in Israel. Efforts should include broader screening for various types of suicide ideation and behavior. Assessments should specifically include passive suicide ideation, active suicide ideation with method, intent, and plan, as well as various types of suicide attempts and preparatory behaviors. In addition, specific interventions formulated on evidencebased psychotherapies should be provided in family practice, obstetric, and pediatric settings. These settings are less stigmatized in comparison to mental health settings. Potential therapies can be (among others) Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), which are effective in preventing perinatal depression.

ID PSYCHIATRIC-PATIENTS; SCOTLAND; INPATIENTS; ENGLAND; TRENDS; WALES
AB This retrospective case note review describes the demographic, forensic and psychiatric backgrounds of 14 in-patient suicides in a maximum secure hospital. The majority were schizophrenic with chronic treatment-resistant illnesses, who had committed proportionally more violent offences, had a history of serious self-injury but no recognized clear depressive episodes. This profile is markedly different from that reported in general psychiatric in-patients, out-patients and suicides in prison, but is similar to that described in a maximum secure hospital in the United States and in long-stay patients in Canada. Many of the patients had continued to experience significantly subjective distress over many years. The clinical relevance of this series is discussed in the context of the assessment of suicidal intent in psychotic patients. We speculate that the decrease in in-patient suicides in the State Hospital may be due to a less restrictive ward milieu, increased staff/patient ratios, or the introduction of Clozapine.

AB Homicide followed by suicide (H-S) is a lethal event in which an individual kills another individual and subsequently dies by suicide. This article presents a review of research carried out in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, and the United States of America over the past 60 years on the prevalence of mental illness among the perpetrators of H-S. Analysis of the available data indicated a great disparity in the results of the different studies. Overall, depression was the most frequent disorder reported (about 39% of the cases in the 20 studies that assessed depressive disorders), followed by substance abuse (about 20% in 10 studies) and psychosis (about 17% in 11 studies). This review, therefore, indicated that mental illness plays an important role in H-S. The prevention of these events depends on the identification and treatment of psychiatric disorder in potential perpetrators. J Am Acad Psychiatry Law 40:462-8, 2012

TI Suicide deaths by gas inhalation in Toronto: An observational study of
   emerging methods of suicide

DE Suicide; Contagion; Helium; Charcoal; Motor vehicle exhaust
ID CHARCOAL-BURNING SUICIDE; HONG-KONG; ASPHYXIAL SUICIDE; HELIUM; TAIWAN;
   TRENDS; EPIDEMIC; IMPACT
AB Background: Suicide death by gas inhalation has been the subject of global scientific interest due to a rapid increase in the use of helium and charcoal gas for suicide. These may be particularly amenable to means restriction strategies. There has been little scientific attention of this phenomenon in Canada.
   Methods: A review of coroner records was conducted for all suicide deaths in Toronto (1998-2015). Deaths were categorized as due to inhalational asphyxia by compressed gas (i.e. helium or nitrogen), charcoal burning or motor vehicle exhaust, with suicide deaths by other methods as a comparator. Demographic, clinical and suicide specific differences between decedents in these four categories were compared using chi-squared or ANOVA global test of significance with additional pairwise comparisons where appropriate. Secular trends were also examined.
   Results: Gas inhalational deaths accounted for 190 (4.7%) of all suicides in Toronto (n = 4062) over the study period and a higher proportion of males used compressed gas or motor vehicle exhaust gases than those who died by other methods (83.3% and 84.0% vs. 69.7%, both p = 0.01). Comparing 1998-2003 to 2010-2015 there was a 1075% increase in deaths by helium (4 vs. 43 deaths) and a 533% increase in deaths by charcoal burning (3 vs. 16 deaths) although helium and charcoal burning deaths still accounted for only 4.2% of total suicides 2010-2015. Deaths by helium were more likely to be accompanied by the book "Final Exit" than those by noninhalational methods (15% vs. 0.7%, p < 0.0001) while 13 of 14 people who died by charcoal burning whose ethnicity could be determined were Asian.
   Limitations: Ethnicity and specific details of procurement of suicide methods were not systematically available in coroner records.
   Discussion: Suicide by inhalational asphyxia, particularly by compressed gases, has increased substantially over time in Toronto consistent with observations in other countries. Increased surveillance of these deaths, efforts to restrict access to these methods, and timely interventions including minimizing media reporting are all warranted.

SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
ID SELF-HARM RISK; PREVENTING SUICIDE; CLASSIFICATION
AB Objective To compare the effectiveness of clinician prediction of risk to a standardized assessment of presentation status. Methods All adult psychiatry emergency department consults in the two main hospitals in Winnipeg, Canada, were assessed using a standardized form (n = 5,376). This form includes two risk scales for a gestalt physician assessment of risk (Suicide Likelihood scale, suicide Attempt Likelihood scale) and the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA). Regression determined whether assessments predicted future suicide attempts and deaths. The area under the curve (AUC) determined the prediction accuracy of these methods. Results Although the regression results were significant, the AUCs were either moderate or poor. Clinician assessment was not effective at predicting deaths (AUC = .546, .36-.73), but moderately accurate at predicting future attempts (AUC = .728, .66-.79). C-CASA assessment was moderately accurate at predicting both attempts and deaths (AUC = .666 and .678). Conclusions Clinician assessment does not significantly outperform a simple assessment of the occurrence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors during presentation to the emergency department. Behavior-based standardized assessments should be further researched in this field. Assessment of suicidality at presentation using C-CASA or similar assessment should be standard for psychiatric patients assessed in the emergency department.

SO HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE IN THE COMMUNITY
LA English
DT Article
DE Alberta; assisted suicide; Canada; educational needs; euthanasia; survey
AB Medical assistance in dying (MAID) was implemented across Canada in June of 2016, after each Canadian province and territory had developed their own MAID processes. Over the first 2 years, just under 300 Alberta citizens received MAID services, a very small proportion (<0.5%) of all 52,000 decedents. An online 2017-2018 survey of Alberta healthcare providers and members of the general public was conducted to assess and compare their knowledge of MAID. A devised brief survey tool was posted online, with broad-based advertising for voluntary participants. The survey was taken down after 282 Albertans had participated (100+ healthcare professionals and 100+ members of the general public), a non-representative sample. Through SPSS data analysis, educational needs were clearly evident as only 30.5% knew the correct approximate number of MAID deaths to date, 33.0% correctly identified the point in life when MAID can be done, 48.9% correctly identified the locations where MAID can be performed, 49.3% correctly identified who can stop MAID from being carried out, and 52.8% correctly identified how MAID is performed to end life. Healthcare professionals were significantly more often correct; as were participants born in Canada, university degree holders, working persons, those who identified a religion, had experience with death and dying care, had direct prior experience with death hastening, thought adults had a right to request and receive MAID, had past experience with animal euthanasia, and had hospice/palliative education or work experience. Age, gender, and having previously worked or lived in a country where assisted suicide or euthanasia was performed were not significant for educational needs. These findings indicate new approaches to meet sudden assisted suicide educational needs are needed.

AB This paper reviews some recent research on the mental health of the First Nations, Inuit, and Metis of Canada. We summarize evidence for the social origins of mental health problems and illustrate the ongoing responses of individuals and communities to the legacy of colonization. Cultural discontinuity and oppression have been linked to high rates of depression, alcoholism, suicide, and violence in many communities, with the greatest impact on youth. Despite these challenges, many communities have done well, and research is needed to identify the factors that promote wellness. Cultural psychiatry can contribute to rethinking mental health services and health promotion for indigenous populations and communities.

AB Introduction: Suicide is disproportionately common among Aboriginal people in Canada.
   Methods: Life stories were collected from 54 Aboriginal suicide attempters in northern Saskatchewan. Constant comparison techniques and modified grounded theory identified common themes expressed.
   Results: Three common plots/themes preceded suicide attempts: 1) relationship breakup, usually sudden, unanticipated, involving a third person; 2) being publicly humiliated by another person(s), accompanied by high levels of shame; and 3) high levels of unremitting, chronic life stress (including poverty) with relative isolation. We found 5 common purposes for suicide attempts: 1) to show someone how badly they had hurt the attempter, 2) to stop the pain, 3) to save face in a difficult social situation, 4) to get revenge, and 5) don't know/don't remember/made sense at the time, all stated by people who were under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs at the time of their suicide attempt. We found 5 common beliefs about death: 1) you just cease to exist, and everything just disappears; 2) you go into the spirit world and can see and hear everything that is happening in this world; 3) you go to heaven or hell; 4) you go to a better place; and 5) don't know/didn't think about it.
   Discussion: The idea of personal and cultural continuity is essential to understanding suicide among First Nations youth. Interventions targeted to the individual's beliefs about death, purpose for suicide, and consistent with the life story (plot) in which they find themselves may be more successful than one-size-fits-all programs developed outside of aboriginal communities.

AB An influential study from the United States generated considerable discussion and debate. This study documented rising morbidity and mortality in midlife among white non-Hispanic Americans in the 21st century, with clear linkages of all-cause mortality to increasing rates of poisonings, suicides and chronic liver disease deaths. All of these causes of deaths are strongly related to the use of legal and illegal substances, but the study stressed the importance of prescription opioids. Given the similarities between the United States and Canada in prescription opioid use, the assessment of similar all-cause mortality trends is relevant for Canada. As this commentary highlights, the all-cause mortality shifts seen in the United States cannot be seen in Canada for either sex or age groups. The exact reasons for the differences between the two countries are not clear, but it is important for public health to further explore this question.

ID DIE
AB After her intense battle for the decriminalization of assisted suicide in the Supreme Court of Canada, Sue Rodriguez committed suicide with medical assistance in 1994. Following her suicide, government and law representatives remained silent and no criminal charges were ever brought against the person(s) who presumably assisted Ms Rodriguez in her death. This apparent non-intervention of criminal law is examined in view of the useful role that the Rodriguez event may have played in a possible shift in the dominant morality. It is argued that the Rodriguez assisted suicide may have been a useful 'crime' (in the Durkheimian sense) in that it brought to the fore the possibility that social conditions - which made the 'crime' possible - may no longer be in harmony with conventional morality. Similarly to Socrates' crime, the Rodriguez case can be seen as an anticipation of a new morality. It can be analysed as a prelude to alterations, as directly preparing the way for changes in the dominant morality. The role of criminal law as a preferred mode of moral regulation is also examined in relation to the moral demands and expectations that arose during as well as after the judicial saga.

AB Introduction. The increasing global prevalence of suicide has made it a major public health concern. Research designed to retrospectively study suicide cases is now being conducted in populations around the world. This field of research is especially crucial in Aboriginal populations, as they often have higher suicide rates than the rest of the country.
   Objective. This article presents the methodological aspects of the first psychological autopsy study on suicide among Inuit in Nunavut. Qaujivallianiq Inuusirijauvalauqtunik (Learning from lives that have been lived) is a large case-control study, including all 120 cases of suicide by Inuit that occurred in Nunavut between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2006. The article describes the research design, ethical considerations and strategies used to adapt the psychological autopsy method to Nunavut Inuit. Specifically, we present local social and cultural issues; data collection procedures; and the acceptability, reliability and validity of the method.
   Method. A retrospective case-control study using the psychological autopsy approach was carried out in 22 communities in Nunavut. A total of 498 individuals were directly interviewed, and medical and correctional charts were also reviewed.
   Results. The psychological autopsy method was well received by participants as they appreciated the opportunity to discuss the loss of a family member or friend by suicide. During interviews, informants readily identified symptoms of psychiatric disorders, although culture-specific rather than clinical explanations were sometimes provided. Results suggest that the psychological autopsy method can be effectively used in Inuit populations.

AB Objectives We study the association between changing residence and risks of attempted suicide and violent assault injury in Alberta, Canada. Our primary objective is to understand whether a change in residence between urban, rural and semiurban areas is associated with increased risk of intentional injury.
   Methods Study subjects are a cohort of residents linked to data on emergency department and inpatient hospital admissions between 1999 and 2010. We used generalised estimating equations to model the effects of changing residence on risk of intentional injury while controlling for the influence of age, sex, socio-economic status, Aboriginal status and history of intentional injury.
   Results Changing residence is associated with an increase in the risk of both attempted suicide and violent assault injury. In the case of attempted suicide, this effect is strongest for persons between 20 and 35years of age. For violent assault injuries, persons from rural regions that have recently moved to urban regions have higher risk of injuries, and women of rural origin are at higher risk of violent assault injury than women of urban origin.
   Conclusions Our findings reveal an association between risk of intentional injuries and change of residence adjusting for geographical differences in injury risk. These findings suggest that intentional injury risk is associated with change in community at intraregional scales and that these populations may benefit from support that helps integrate them into their new communities.

AB Administrative data have been used to determine the occurrence of suicide attempts and deliberate self-harm, but research about the accuracy of these sources is limited. This study used a clinical sample (n=5719) containing psychiatry consultations from the emergency departments and inpatient units of the two major tertiary hospitals in Winnipeg, Canada to validate the accuracy of inpatient hospital diagnosis codes at identifying presentations for self-harm and suicide attempts. The Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA) was used as the gold standard. International Classification of Diseases version 10 Canadian Enhancement codes for intentional self-harm, undetermined intent self-harm, and accidental poisoning were assessed. Measures of validity included Kappa (), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Sensitivity of hospitalized attempts was low using intentional intent codes (36.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 32.4-41.4%) but improved using unknown intent and accidental poisoning codes (44.8%, 95% CI: 40.2-49.4%). Agreement for suicide attempts did not increase with the addition of unknown intent and accidental poisoning codes (=0.465-0.481), but were better for any self-harm (=0.395-0.478). Hospital diagnosis codes undercount attempts and self-harm admissions. Including more data sources might improve the detection of events.

AB The objective of this research is to investigate the possible difference in accumulation of adversity over the life course among decedent gamblers and living control gamblers in the province of Quebec, Canada. A sample of 90 adult men, 41 living participants and 49 suicide decedents, met the criteria for at-risk and problem gambling over the last five years. Data were obtained from informants in the case of suicide and directly from living controls during semi-structured face-to-face interviews using SCID I and II, SOGS, Module K and a recount of life trajectories methodology. The results showed a high level of adversity throughout the life trajectories of both groups. However, the living gamblers faced more difficulties during their lifespan than the suicide victims. In the last six months before their death, suicide victims had a significantly higher number of mental health disorders, especially co-morbid mental health disorders and anxiety, compared to the living controls. We also observed a rapid escalation of difficulties, more life events and more psychological distress in the last six months of their lives among the suicide decedents. Suicidal behaviour needs to be carefully investigated by medical staff and mental health practitioners, especially when gamblers demonstrate evidence of mental health disorders or financial difficulties.

ID SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION; NEWS
AB The purpose of this article is to discuss the portrayal of death in modem North American society in the highest circulating English language magazines available in Canada and published either in the United States or in Canada, in 1991, 1996, and 2001. The prevailing underlying frame/discourse of which there were a number of sub-variants, was the notion of the control of death. Stories focused on people taking control of death by 1) passive and active euthanasia, 2) suicide with political and social motivations and messages, 3) suicide deaths among celebrities and the families of celebrities, 4) dramatic murders, 5) issues in the "right to die movement," and 6) new techniques and technologies for life extension. There was a very small minority of articles on miscellaneous issues such as death rates and their variation across geographic region, social class, environmental condition, and cause. The article ends with discussion of the ways that this portrayal of death obfuscates the real lack of control most North Americans, particularly those who are poor or "racialized," have over the timing, or circumstances of death. In addition, as a critical discourse analysis, it discusses the interests that are served by this perspective.

AB Suicide is one of the leading causes of death today in the Western world, and most people have had suicidal ideation at some time during their life. In the population of persons with intellectual disability, some researchers have thought that impaired intellectual capacity could act as a buffer to suicidal behavior, but the fact is that the few studies conducted in that population contest this assumption and show that the characteristics of suicidality in this population are very similar to persons without intellectual disability. This paper reviews the studies conducted and describe the symptomatology in this population. Professionals working with this population should, therefore, be aware of and assess for this behavior. Sadness, or depression, are symptoms that could indicate later suicidal behavior.

AB Objective: To construct an index that represents the general level of social problems among Canadian provinces and territories.
   Method: Factor weights were used to combine provincial and territorial rates for homicide, attempted murder, assault, sexual assault, robbery, divorce, suicide, and alcoholism into a single Social Problem Index.
   Results: The resulting index demonstrated strong positive intercorrelations among its factors across provinces. That is, provinces that showed high rates on one factor tended to show high rates on the others as well. The validity of the Social Problem Index is demonstrated by its positive correlation with an independent measure of the likelihood of having experienced personal trauma.
   Conclusions: The robust nature and apparent validity of the Social Problem Index suggest that it can be well used for needs assessments and theoretical studies and as a feedback mechanism to national, provincial, and community, leaders on the social problem status of their particular jurisdictions.

AB Suicide in later life is a global public health problem. The aim of this review was to conduct a systematic analysis of studies with comparison groups that examined the associations between social factors and suicidal behavior (including ideation, non-fatal suicidal behavior, or deaths) among individuals aged 65 and older. Our search identified only 16 articles (across 14 independent samples) that met inclusion criteria. The limited number of studies points to the need for further research. Included studies were conducted in Canada (n = 2), Germany (n = 1), Hong Kong (n = 1), Japan (n = 1), Singapore (n = 1), Sweden (n = 2), Taiwan (n = 1), the U. K. (n = 2), and the U.S. (n = 3). The majority of the social factors examined in this review can be conceptualized as indices of positive social connectedness-the degree of positive involvement with family, friends, and social groups. Findings indicated that at least in industrialized countries, limited social connectedness is associated with suicidal ideation, non-fatal suicidal behavior, and suicide in later life. Primary prevention programs designed to enhance social connections as well as a sense of community could potentially decrease suicide risk, especially among men.

SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SANTE PUBLIQUE

DT Article
DE Quebec; suicide; age-period-cohort; cohort effect; median polish
ID NEW-SOUTH-WALES; RATES; AUSTRALIA; CANADA
AB OBJECTIVE: Suicide rates in Quebec over the second half of the 20th century show a wide range of variation depending on age and time period. However, few studies have verified the presence of a cohort effect affecting trends in Quebec suicide rates. This study is designed to evaluate the potential effects of age, period and cohort (APC) on trends in suicide between 1950 and 2009 in Quebec.
   METHOD: For these APC analyses, we used a multiphase approach combining a graphical inspection followed by an analysis that isolates the cohort effect from age and period effects (linear regression of the residuals from a median polish of the rates).
   RESULTS: The graphical inspection of trends in rates points to combined effects of age, period and cohort among both men and women. However, the median polish analysis attributes primary importance to period effects, followed by age effects, but also shows weak cohort effects that are significant only among men born between 1950 and 1979.
   CONCLUSION: The variation in Quebec suicide rates appears to be primarily a reflection of period, age and, to a lesser degree, birth cohort. Thus, in addition to sex, selection of risk groups should be based more on age and time period than on birth cohort.

TI Suicide and history of childhood trauma among street youth
SO JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Homeless youth; Suicide; Child abuse; Child neglect; Depression
ID INJECTION-DRUG-USE; RISK
AB Background: Street youth represent a marginalized population marked by early mortality and elevated risk for suicide. It is not known to what extent childhood abuse and neglect predispose to suicide in this difficult-to-study population. This study is among the first to examine the relationship between childhood trauma and subsequent attempted suicide during adolescence and young adulthood among street youth.
   Methods: From October 2005 to November 2007, data were collected for the At Risk Youth Study (ARYS), a cohort of 495 street-recruited youth aged 14-26 in Vancouver, Canada. Self-reported attempted suicide in the preceding six months was examined in relation to childhood abuse and neglect, as measured by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), using logistic regression. Results: Overall, 46 (9.3%) youth reported a suicide attempt during the preceding six months. Childhood physical and sexual abuse were highly prevalent, with 201 (40.6%) and 131 (26.5%) of youth reporting history of each, respectively. Increasing CTQ score was related to risk for suicide attempt despite adjustment for confounders (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.45 per standard deviation increase in score; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.91).
   Limitations: Use of snowball sampling may not have produced a truly random sample, and reliance on self-report may have resulted in underreporting of risk behaviors among participants. Moreover, use of cross-sectional data limits the degree to which temporality can be concluded from the results of this study alone.
   Conclusions: There exists a strong and graded association between childhood trauma and subsequent attempted suicide among street youth, an otherwise 'hidden' population. There is a need for effective interventions that not only prevent maltreatment of children but also aid youth at increased risk for suicide given prior history of trauma. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Objectives To compare the risk of death by suicide in male veterans with age-matched civilians.
   Design Retrospective cohort study linking provincial administrative databases between 1990 and 2013 with follow-up complete until death or December 31, 2015.
   Setting Population-based study in Ontario, Canada.
   Participants Ex-serving Canadian Armed Forces and Royal Canadian Mounted Police veterans living in Ontario who registered for provincial health insurance were included. A civilian comparator group was matched 4: 1 on age and sex.
   Main outcome Death by suicide was classified using standard cause of death diagnosis codes from a provincial registry of mandatory data collected from death certificates. Fine and Gray sub-distribution hazards regression compared the risk of death by suicide between veterans and civilians. Analyses were adjusted for age, residential region, income, rurality and major physical comorbidities.
   Results 20 397 male veterans released to Ontario between 1990 and 2013 and 81 559 age-sex matched civilians were included. 4.2% of veterans died during the study time frame, compared with 6.5% of the civilian cohort. Death by suicide was rare in both cohorts, accounting for 4.6% and 3.6% of veteran and civilian deaths, respectively. After adjustment for confounders, veterans had an 18% lower risk of dying from causes other than suicide (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.89) and a similar risk of dying by suicide (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.43), compared with civilians.
   Conclusions Deaths by suicide were rare in male veterans residing in Ontario. Our findings demonstrate that veterans had a similar risk of suicide-related mortality as an age-matched civilian population. A better understanding of effective suicide prevention as well as clarifying pathways to seeking and receiving mental health supports and services are important areas for future consideration.

AB Background: Suicide claims one million lives worldwide annually, making it a serious public health concern. The risk for suicidal behaviour can be partly explained by genetic factors, as suggested by twin and family studies (reviewed in (Zai et al. 2012)). Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of suicide attempt on large samples of bipolar disorder (BD) patients from multiple sites have identified a number of novel candidate genes. GWASs of suicide behaviour severity, from suicidal ideation to serious suicide attempt, have not been reported for BD.
   Methods: We conducted a GWAS of suicide behaviour severity in three independent BD samples:212 small nuclear families with BD probands from Toronto, Canada, 428 BD cases from Toronto, and 483 BD cases from the UK. We carried out imputation with 1000 Genome Project data as reference using IMPUTE2. Quality control and data analysis was conducted using PLINK and R. We conducted the quantitative analyses of suicide behaviour severity in the three samples separately, and derived an overall significance by a meta-analysis using the METAL software.
   Results: We did not find genome-wide significant association of any tested markers in any of the BD samples, but we found a number of suggestive associations, including regions on chromosomes 8 and 10 (p < 1e-5).
   Conclusions: Our GWAS findings suggest that likely many gene variants of small effects contribute collectively to the risk for suicidal behaviour severity in BD. Larger independent replications are required to strengthen the findings from the GWAS presented here. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The issues related to end of life situations have acquired great importance in today's society, due to the increase in life expectancy as a result of the advances in medicine and the consolidation of the patient's rights to autonomy. However, from a comparative approach neither legislation nor the case-law gives a clear answer to what scope should be recognized to this autonomy. This paper is focus on the different trends that can be currently found in wester legal systems in relation to the so called right to die with dignity in the light of the most recent pronouncements of the Strasbourg Court and the Supreme Court of Canada.

LA English

AB Objective: "13 Reasons Why," a Netflix series, included a controversial depiction of suicide that has raised fears about possible contagion. Studies of youth suicide in the United States found an increase on the order of 10% following release of the show, but this has not been replicated in other countries. This study aims to begin to address that gap by examining the relationship between the show's release and youth suicide in Canada's most populous province. Methods: Suicides in young people (under the age of 30) in the province of Ontario following the show's release on March 31, 2017, were the outcome of interest. Time-series analyses were performed using data from January 2013 to March 2017 to predict expected deaths from April to December 2017 with a simple seasonal model (stationary R-2 = 0.732, Ljung-Box Q = 15.1, df = 16, P = 0.52, Bayesian information criterion = 3.09) providing the best fit/used for the primary analysis. Results: Modeling predicted 224 suicides; however, 264 were observed corresponding to 40 more deaths or an 18% increase. In the primary analysis, monthly suicides exceeded the 95% confidence limit for 3 of the 9 months (May, July, and October). Conclusion: The statistical strength of the findings here is limited by small numbers; however, the results are in line with what has been observed in the United States and what would be expected if contagion were occurring. Further research in other locations is needed to increase confidence that the associations found here are causal.

AB Objectives Violent deaths classified as undetermined intent (UD) are sometimes included in suicide counts. This study investigated age and sex differences, along with socioeconomic gradients in UD and suicide deaths in the province of Ontario between 1999 and 2012. Methods We used data from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, which has linked vital statistics from the Office of the Registrar General Deaths register with Census data between 1999 and 2012. Socioeconomic status was operationalised through the four dimensions of the Ontario Marginalization Index. We computed age-specific and annual age-standardised mortality rates, and risk ratios to calculate risk gradients according to each of the four dimensions of marginalization. Results Rates of UD-classified deaths were highest for men aged 45-64 years residing in the most materially deprived (7.9 per 100 000 population (95% CI 6.8 to 9.0)) and residentially unstable (8.1 (95% CI 7.1 to 9.1)) neighbourhoods. Similarly, suicide rates were highest among these same groups of men aged 45-64 living in the most materially deprived (28.2 (95% CI 26.1 to 30.3)) and residentially unstable (30.7 (95% CI 28.7 to 32.6)) neighbourhoods. Relative to methods of death, poisoning was the most frequently used method in UD cases (64%), while it represented the second most common method (27%) among suicides after hanging (40%). Discussion The similarities observed between both causes of death suggest that at least a proportion of UD deaths may be misclassified suicide cases. However, the discrepancies identified in this analysis seem to indicate that not all UD deaths are misclassified suicides.

DT Article

AB Objective: The aim of the study was to identify factors associated with suicide death occurring in the month following an outpatient visit, emergency room contact, or hospitalization.
   Methods: The results of this study are based on data for 8,851 individuals ages 11 years and older who died between January 1, 2000, and December 15, 2007, and whose death was confirmed as suicide by the coroner's office in Quebec, Canada. Health service use in the year prior to death was assessed by review of data from the province's public health insurance agency. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the association of clinical and socio-demographic factors and the occurrence of suicide death in the month following versus more than one month after the last use of health services.
   Results: A total of 81.6% of suicide decedents had consulted on an outpatient basis, 48.7% had visited an emergency department, and 28.5% were hospitalized in the year prior to death. Among individuals who had been discharged from an emergency department or a hospital closest to their death, 29.5% and 75.3%, respectively, died in the month following discharge. The most consistent modifiable factor associated with death in the month following last contact was number of outpatient consultations following discharge.
   Conclusions: Ensuring follow-up care after an emergency department visit or hospitalization may be associated with a longer period between discharge and suicide, allowing for more time to intervene and, possibly, prevent suicide.

TI Euthanasia and assisted suicide: Comparison of legal aspects in
   Switzerland and other countries
SO MEDICINE SCIENCE AND THE LAW
LA English
DT Article
AB The purpose of this paper is to present the legal aspects associated with assisted suicide in Switzerland and compare them with those in other countries. Like euthanasia, assisted suicide is a subject that induces much discussion in many countries. While the law is very liberal in some countries, such as Belgium and the Netherlands (where both euthanasia and assisted suicide take place), these practices are very controversial in other countries, such as France, where they remain taboo subjects.
   In the United States of America, the laws concerning assisted suicide can differ greatly from one state to another. For example, in Oregon, assisted suicide is allowed if applied by a medical doctor; in others, this act is illegal. In Canada, it is punishable according to the Criminal Code.
   In Switzerland euthanasia is punishable by law. However, the penal code does not condemn assisted suicide, whether carried out by a medical doctor or another person, provided it is not carried out through selfish motives. The application of these practices has become simplified in recent years and societies for the right to die with dignity based on this principle have come into being (Exit and Dignitas).
   In the French- and German-speaking parts of Switzerland the association Exit assists individuals living in Switzerland with serious progressive and incurable disease in their engagement to end their life. The association Dignitas, in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, also undertakes - in the same circumstances - to assist individuals coming from foreign countries. Dignitas welcomes several such individuals every year, especially from Germany, where a similar approach does not currently exist.

AB Background: Our laboratory recently confronted this issue while conducting research with undergraduate students at the University of Waterloo (UW). Although our main objective was to examine cognitive and genetic features of individuals with schizotypal personality disorder (SPD), the study protocol also entailed the completion of various self-report measures to identify participants deemed at increased risk for suicide. Aims and Methods: This paper seeks to review and discuss the relevant ethical guidelines and legislation that bear upon a psychologist's obligation to further assess and intervene when research participants reveal that they are at increased risk for suicide. Results and Conclusions: In the current paper we argue that psychologists are ethically impelled to assess and appropriately intervene in cases of suicide risk, even when such risk is revealed within a research context. We also discuss how any such obligation may potentially be modulated by the research participant's expectations of the role of a psychologist, within such a context. Although the focus of the current paper is on the ethical obligations of psychologists, specifically those practicing within Canada, the relevance of this paper extends to all regulated health professionals conducting research in nonclinical settings.

AB Death by suicide and attempted suicide among Inuit youth is now considered a public health emergency of epidemic proportion, with rates among the highest worldwide. A strong sense of cultural identity and pride, as well as social capital, has been identified as being protective against suicide. The Canadian Institute for Health Research (CIHR) Guidelines for Health Research Involving Aboriginal People call for communities to be included in the conception, planning and implementation of research. The authors took first steps towards sharing the responsibility of designing a community initiative with the youth of Naujaat, Nunavut, a community located directly on the Arctic Circle. With the objectives of promoting open listening and exploration of community needs and enhancing self-determination and sustainability, we postulated a youth resiliency project that will be co-authored by the community. This paper describes the joint work process. We recount how Inuit youth take ownership of the project with the guidance of Ms. Elizabeth Haqpi, a Naujaat Elder. The article will particularly reflect on the process of balancing the different perspectives and expectations while enjoying the richness of mutual learning through keeping each other accountable.

AB Context: Suicide bereavement remains understudied and poorly understood.
   Objectives: To examine outcomes of parents bereaved by the suicide death of their offspring and to compare these with both nonbereaved parent controls and parents who had offspring die in a motor vehicle crash (MVC).
   Design: Population-based case-control study. Suicide-bereaved parents were compared with nonbereaved matched control parents in the general population (n = 1415) and with MVC-bereaved parents (n = 1132) on the rates of physician-diagnosed mental and physical disorders, social factors, and treatment use in the 2 years after death of the offspring. Adjusted relative rates (ARRs) were generated by generalized estimating equation models and adjusted for confounding factors.
   Setting: Manitoba, Canada.
   Participants: All identifiable parents who had an offspring die by suicide between 1996 and 2007 (n = 1415).
   Main Outcome Measures: Mental and physical disorders, social factors, and treatment use.
   Results: Suicide bereavement was associated with an increased rate of depression (ARR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.88-2.43), anxiety disorders (ARR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.24-1.60), and marital breakup (ARR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.13-1.23) in the 2 years after the suicide of an offspring, as compared with the 2 years prior to the death. Suicide-bereaved and MVC-bereaved parents had very few differences on predeath to postdeath outcomes. Depression rate increases were greater for MVC-bereaved parents (19.9%) compared with suicide-bereaved parents (15.9%; P = .005), whereas suicide-bereaved parents had higher rate increases of hospitalization for mental illness (P = .049). Suicide-bereaved parents were more likely than their MVC-bereaved counterparts to have depression (ARR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.06-1.61), physical disorders (ARR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.19-1.45), and low income (ARR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.18-1.51) before their offspring's death.
   Conclusions: Suicide bereavement is associated with adverse mental health and social outcomes. These consequences appear similar to those associated with MVC bereavement. Parents who lose offspring to suicide appear to be a vulnerable group even prior to their offspring's death. JAMA Psychiatry. 2013;70(2):158-167.

AB Injuries continue to be a public health concern in Canada. National injury death data are essential for understanding the magnitude and pattern of injuries. This paper used the Vital Statistics - Death database to examine deaths associated with injuries in 2015. Injuries were ranked against causes of death, and more in-depth analysis of injury categories was conducted by sex and age. Unintentional injuries were the 6th leading causes of death overall, with different ranking by sex. Among unintentional injury deaths, leading causes included falls, poisonings, motor vehicle traffic collisions, and suffocation, which varied by age group.

AB Few studies of adolescent suicidality have examined its associations with social capital. We explored associations of measures of individual level social capital with self-reported suicide ideation and suicide attempt in adolescents in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, Canada, controlling for other factors known to be associated with adolescent suicidality.
   We surveyed 1,597 grade 10-12 students at three high schools in 2006 using self-completion questionnaires. Both sexes were combined for analysis. Outcome measures were suicidal ideation and attempt in the previous year. Measures of social capital included perceptions of trustworthiness and helpfulness of others at school, frequency of religious attendance and participation in extracurricular activities. Logistic regressions were carried out to determine associations of social capital with suicidality while controlling for other factors.
   Perceived trustworthiness and helpfulness were protective for suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in the previous year. In adjusted analyses, there were interactions of gender and social capital-females reporting more social capital were more protected from suicide attempt relative to males with similar levels of social capital.
   This study provides initial evidence of protective associations of individual level social capital with adolescent suicidality. Our findings suggest that among adolescents low social capital as measured by perceptions of trust and helpfulness of others at school may be a warning sign for suicidality, particularly for females. It may be helpful to inquire of young people how they perceive the trustworthiness and helpfulness of their school environment as a measure of how supportive that environment might be to them when they are facing challenges to their mental health.

DE Assisted suicide; Human rights; Right to life; Right to private life;
   New Zealand; Canada; England and Wales
AB This article critically examines the decision of the New Zealand High Court in Seales v Attorney-General [2015] NZHC 1239, which rejected the claim that that country's blanket ban on assisted suicide violated various rights enshrined in the New Zealand Bill of Rights. That outcome runs contrary to the Canadian Supreme Court's decision in Carter v Canada (Attorney General) [2015] 1 SCR 331. This disparity in result arose despite overt similarities between the rights documents in each of the jurisdictions and, more significantly, notwithstanding the fact that the trial judge in <italic Seales placed heavy reliance upon the decision in Carter. With two new challenges to the blanket ban on assisted suicide in England and Wales progressing through the lower courts, and given proposed amendments to the ban in both New Zealand and its antipodean neighbours - the Australian states of Victoria and New South Wales - it is a propitious time to consider the reasons for the disparate outcomes in Seales and Carter. This article will demonstrate that the trial judge's reasoning in Seales was wanting in a number of important respects, particularly in terms of the characterisation of the objective of the blanket ban. These limitations undermine the decision's utility as authority both domestically and internationally. This is particularly important given the high likelihood that reference will be made to the decision during debate in the New Zealand Parliament regarding amendments to the ban in that country and the possibility that the Legislatures in Victoria and New South Wales, as well as the English courts hearing the current challenges to the ban in that jurisdiction will, particularly given the shared common law background, refer to the judgment in Seales.

AB BACKGROUND: Although suicide is a known leading cause of death among street youth, few prospective studies have explored childhood experiences as risk factors for future suicide attempt in this population. We examined the risk of attempted suicide in relation to childhood maltreatment among street youth.
   METHODS: From September 2005 to November 2013, data were collected from the At Risk Youth Study (ARYS), a prospective cohort of street youth in Vancouver, Canada. Inclusion criteria were age 14 to 26 years, past-month illicit drug use, and street involvement. Participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, an instrument measuring self-reported sexual, physical, and emotional abuse and physical and emotional neglect. Suicide attempts were assessed semiannually. Using Cox regression, we examined the association between the 5 types of maltreatment and suicide attempts.
   RESULTS: Of 660 participants, 68.2% were male and 24.6% were Aboriginal. Median age was 21.5 years. The prevalence of moderate to extreme childhood maltreatment ranged from 16.8% (sexual abuse) to 45.2% (emotional abuse). Participants contributed 1841 person-years, with suicide attempts reported by 35 (5.3%) individuals (crude incidence density: 1.9 per 100 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4-2.6 per 100 person-years). In adjusted analyses, types of maltreatment associated with suicide attempts included physical abuse (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 4.47; 95% CI: 2.12-9.42), emotional abuse (adjusted HR: 4.92; 95% CI: 2.11-11.5), and emotional neglect (adjusted HR: 3.08; 95% CI: 1.05-9.03).
   CONCLUSIONS: Childhood maltreatment is associated with subsequent risk of suicidal behavior among street youth. Suicide prevention efforts should be targeted toward this marginalized population and delivered from a trauma-informed perspective.

AB Background: Few studies have investigated how area-level deprivation influences the relationship between individual disadvantage and suicide mortality. The aim of this study was to examine individual measures of material and social disadvantage in relation to suicide mortality in Canada and to determine whether these relationships were modified by area deprivation.
   Methods: Using the 1991-2001 Canadian Census Mortality Follow-up Study cohort (N = 2,685,400), measures of individual social (civil status, family structure, living alone) and material (education, income, employment) disadvantage were entered into Cox proportional hazard models to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for male and female suicide mortality. Two indices of area deprivation were computed one capturing social, and the other material, dimensions - and models were run separately for high versus low deprivation.
   Results: After accounting for individual and area characteristics, individual social and material disadvantage were associated with higher suicide mortality, especially for individuals not employed, not married, with low education and low income. Associations between social and material area deprivation and suicide mortality largely disappeared upon adjustment for individual-level disadvantage. In stratified analyses, suicide risk was greater for low income females in socially deprived areas and males living alone in materially deprived areas, and there was no evidence of other modifying effects of area deprivation.
   Conclusions: Individual disadvantage was associated with suicide mortality, particularly for males. With some exceptions, there was little evidence that area deprivation modified the influence of individual disadvantage on suicide risk. Prevention strategies should primarily focus on individuals who are unemployed or out of the labour force, and have low education or income. Individuals with low income or who are living alone in deprived areas should also be targeted.

AB Objective: Several studies have shown that acute alcohol use is associated with suicidal behavior, but the magnitude and nature of the relationship remain unclear. We report a study on the impact of acute alcohol use on suicide attempts treated in the emergency room (ER) using the case-crossover design. Method: Seven ER studies carried out in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Australia from 1984 to 1996 with probability samples and similar methodology were merged yielding a total of 102 suicide attempters (overall 52% were male and 59% under 30 years of age). Results: Thirty-six patients reported alcohol use within 6 hours prior to the suicide attempt. When usual alcohol consumption during the past 12 months served as the control value, the estimated relative risk (RR) for patients who reported alcohol use within 6 hours prior to the suicide attempt was 9.6 (95% confidence interval: 5.7-16.3). Although the prevalence of alcohol use differed by sex, there was no statistically significant difference in the estimated RRs (RR = 13.6 men and RR = 5.3 women, p = 0.11 for the heterogeneity test). Conclusions: A positive association was found between alcohol use 6 hours prior and suicide attempts in 102 ER cases in four countries. The case-crossover methodology is well suited to studies for which an external control group is not easily obtainable.

AB Bullying and stalking through cyberspace have become serious phenomena in the Internet era, impacting mainly young users and teenagers. Many tragic incidents have occurred, especially in the West, including self-harm and suicide due to these problems. To protect the victims many countries such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK) and Canada have codified laws dealing with cyber-crimes, including cyber-harassment. To determine the adequacy of such laws in addressing these issues, we present in this paper a legal analysis of the existing anti-bullying and stalking laws in the UAE, US, UK, and Canada. The purpose is to gain perspective on the characteristics of the laws and their ability to protect society from various forms of crimes associated with cyberbullying and cyberstalking. The paper also presents recommendations to help combat cyberbullying and cyberstalking and protect our youth from these issues.

AB OBJECTIVES: Suicide-related emergency department (ED) visits by children are increasing in tandem with suicide-related Internet content. Following the announcement of Amanda Todd's suicide, her YouTube video received widespread views, providing an opportunity to explore this association.
   METHODS: Our research question was: Among Ontario children age 11-17 years, was the release of Amanda Todd's YouTube video following her death announcement in October 2012 associated with an increase in average monthly ED visit rates for suicide-related diagnoses? We performed an interrupted time series analysis from April 2002 to December 2013, with the primary outcome as a composite of the average monthly rate of initial ED visits for suicidal ideation, intentional self-poisoning, and intentional self-harm. Secondary outcomes were average monthly rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death resulting from the index visit.
   RESULTS: There was a statistically significant increase in the monthly ED visit rate for the composite outcome (p = 0.02) and death or ICU admission (p = 0.006) from April 2002 to December 2013. There was no significant change in ED visit rate for the composite outcome before and after the announcement of Amanda Todd's death, overall (119.8 versus 219.2 respectively, p = 0.5), among females (167.4 versus 316.8 respectively, p = 0.47) or among males (74.7 versus 116.9 respectively, p = 0.33).
   CONCLUSIONS: Ontario ED visits for suicide-related diagnoses in 11-17 year olds increased from 2002 to 2013. However, the increase from October 2012 to December 2013 could not be attributed to a highly publicized adolescent suicide. Our findings suggest that suicide-related Internet content is not associated with the increase in ED visits for suicidal behaviour.

AB Background: While the elevated risk of suicide attempt among persons who inject drugs (PWID) is well documented, whether use of different substances is associated with varying degrees of risk remains unclear. We sought to examine the associations between substance use patterns and attempted suicide in a prospective cohort of PWID in Montreal, Canada.
   Methods: Between 2004 and 2011, participants completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire eliciting information on socio-demographics, substance use patterns, related behaviors, and mental health markers. Generalized estimating equations were used to model the relationship between self-reported use of six common substances (cocaine, amphetamine, opioids, sedative-hypnotics, cannabis and alcohol), associated patterns of use (chronic, occasional and none), and a recent (past six-month) suicide attempt.
   Results: At baseline, of 1240 participants (median age: 39.1,83.7% male), 71 (5.7%) reported a recent suicide attempt. Among 5621 observations collected during follow-up, 221 attempts were reported by 143 (11.5%) participants. In multivariate analyses adjusting for socio-demographics and psychosocial stressors, among primary drugs of abuse, chronic [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.97] and occasional (AOR: 1.92) cocaine use, and chronic amphetamine use (AOR: 1.96) were independently associated with attempted suicide. Among co-used substances, chronic sedative-hypnotic use was independently associated with an attempt (AOR: 2.29). No statistically significant association was found for the remaining substances.
   Conclusion: Among PWID at high risk of attempted suicide, stimulant users appear to constitute a particularly vulnerable sub-group. While the mechanisms underlying these associations remain to be elucidated, findings suggest that stimulant-using PWID should constitute a prime focus of suicide prevention efforts.

AB Homicide is a multiply determined behavior, and single-factor prevention efforts have rarely been shown to have an impact on the homicide rate. Gun control has been proposed as an important component of society's response, and an opportunity for studying the effects of legislative gun control laws on homicide rates was provided by Canada's Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1977 (Bill C-51). This article reviews previous studies of the impact of this Act on the total population of Canada and subpopulations by age and sex and, in addition, presents the results of a multiple regression analysis, which controls for some social variables. It appears that Bill C-51 may have had an impact on homicide rates, at least for older victims. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background Suicide is the third most common cause of death among adolescents worldwide, and poisoning is the leading method of attempted suicide. Unlike more violent methods, survival after self-poisoning is common, providing an opportunity for secondary prevention. We determined the risk and time course of completed suicide after adolescent self-poisoning, and explored potential risk factors.
   Methods We did a population-based cohort study using multiple linked health-care databases in Ontario, Canada, from Jan 1, 2001, to Dec 31, 2012. We identified all adolescents aged 10-19 years presenting to hospital after a first self-poisoning episode. Each was matched with 50 population-based reference individuals with no such history, matching on age, sex, and year of cohort entry. The primary outcome was the risk of suicide after a first self-poisoning episode. Secondary analyses explored factors associated with suicide and self-poisoning repetition.
   Findings We identified 20 471 adolescents discharged from hospital after a first self-poisoning episode and 1 023 487 matched reference individuals. Over a median follow-up of 7.2 years (IQR 4.2-9.7), 248 (1%) adolescents discharged after self-poisoning died, 126 (51%) of whom died by suicide. The risk of suicide at 1 year after self-poisoning was greatly increased relative to reference individuals (hazard ratio [HR] 32.1, 95% CI 23.6-43.6), corresponding to a suicide rate of 89.6 (95% CI 75.2-106.7) per 100 000 person-years over the course of follow-up. The median time from hospital discharge to suicide was 3.0 years (IQR 1.1-5.3). Factors associated with suicide included recurrent self-poisoning (adjusted HR 3.5, 95% CI 2.4-5.0), male sex (2.5, 1.8-3.6) and psychiatric care in the preceding year (1.7, 1.1-2.5). Adolescents admitted to hospital for self-poisoning were also more likely to die from accidents (5.2, 4.1-6.6) and from all causes (3.9, 2.8-5.4) during follow-up.
   Interpretation Self-poisoning in adolescence is a strong predictor of suicide and premature death in the ensuing decade, and identifies a high-risk group for targeted secondary prevention. Suicide risk is increased for many years after the index hospital admission, emphasising the importance of sustained prevention efforts.

TI A Registry Based Approach to Suicide Research: Opportunities and

AB Together with the other Nordic countries, Norway stands in a unique position internationally with its large population representative registries. By means of unique personal identification numbers assigned to all Norwegian citizens, as well as to immigrants who stay for more than 6 months, it is possible to construct individual record linkages covering an increasing number of years across different national registries. The Norwegian registries include, among others, information from the primary and specialist health care services, the prescription of drugs, and causes of death. In addition, they include sociodemographic information like year of birth, gender, immigration status, educational attainment, marital status, and the use of various social benefits. Norway is one of very few countries that have a nationwide registry on primary health care use. This registry gives the opportunity to explore the role of the primary health care services prior to suicide and in the follow-up of the suicide bereaved, which has been pointed out as one of the most promising areas for future suicide prevention. Linkages of Norwegian registries opens up new approaches in analyses and the possibility to explore a range of novel research themes, such as treatment trajectories and patterns of health care use prior to suicide and among the suicide bereaved.
   In this paper, we give a description of the Norwegian population representative registries applicable for suicide research. We discuss the analytic opportunities as well as the challenges and obstacles of a registry based research approach to - suicide.
   The main strength of registry-based research on suicide is the ability to maintain data on the total population, the possibility to study small sub-populations or low-prevalent events, virtually continuous timelines in longitudinal data, few or no non-response or other missing data, no sample attrition, and the possibility of gaining access to large amounts of various health and sociodemographic information. In addition registry-based research allows investigation of hard-to-reach populations, such as groups of individuals with severe mental disorders or immigrants that traditionally have been difficult to recruit for participation in research projects.
   The opportunities presented in the article could motivate to do similar research in Canada and even inspire for cooperation between Norwegian and Canadian researchers on registry based research on suicide. In our opinion, registry-based research on suicide will play an increasingly important role in suicide research in the years to come.

TI Risk of Suicide Following Deliberate Self-poisoning
SO JAMA PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID HARM; MORTALITY; COHORT; CARE; ILLNESS; DEATH
AB IMPORTANCE Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, and its rate has risen by 16% in the past decade. Deliberate self-poisoning is the leadingmethod of attempted suicide. Unlike more violent methods, which are almost universally fatal, survival following self-poisoning is common, providing an opportunity for secondary prevention. However, the long-term risk of suicide following a first episode of self-poisoning is unknown.
   OBJECTIVE To determine the risk of suicide and mortality from other causes following a first self-poisoning episode.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Population-based cohort study using multiple linked health care databases. We identified all individuals with a first self-poisoning episode in Ontario, Canada, from April 1, 2002, through December 31, 2010, and followed up all surviving participants until December 31, 2011, or death, whichever occurred first. For each individual with a deliberate self-poisoning episode, we randomly selected 1 control from the same population with no such history, matched for age (within 3 months), sex, and calendar year.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary analysis examined the risk of suicide following discharge after self-poisoning. The secondary analyses explored factors associated with suicide and examined the risk of death caused by accidents or any other cause.
   RESULTS We identified 65 784 patients (18 482 [28.1%] younger than 20 years) who were discharged after a first self-poisoning episode. During a median follow-up of 5.3 years (interquartile range, 3.1-7.6 years), 4176 died, including 976 (23.4%) by suicide. The risk of suicide following self-poisoning was markedly increased relative to controls (hazard ratio, 41.96; 95% CI, 27.75-63.44), corresponding to a suicide rate of 278 vs 7 per 100 000 person-years, respectively. The median time from hospital discharge to completed suicide was 585 days (interquartile range, 147-1301 days). Older age, male sex, multiple intervening self-poisoning episodes, higher socioeconomic status, depression, and recent psychiatric care were strongly associated with suicide. Patients with a self-poisoning episode were also more likely to die because of accidents (hazard ratio, 10.45; 95% CI, 8.10-13.47) and all causes combined (hazard ratio, 5.55; 95% CI, 5.12-6.02).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A first self-poisoning episode is a strong predictor of subsequent suicide and premature death. Most suicides occur long after the index poisoning, emphasizing the importance of longitudinal, sustained secondary prevention initiatives.

AB Objective: In the present paper we describe a case-control study on the utilization of health care services prior to suicide (across different time periods) among children and adolescents aged 11 to 18 years in the Province of Quebec, Canada and matched healthy controls.
   Method: Utilization of services (i.e., contact with general practitioners, mental health professionals, psychiatrists and/or youth protection groups) was examined at different time periods in 55 child and adolescent suicide victims and 54 matched community controls using proxy-based interviews and questionnaires. In addition, we examined the rates of detection of psychopathology by health care professionals, the use of psychotropic medications and the subjects' compliance with treatment.
   Results: Although more than 90% of child and adolescent suicide completers in our sample suffered from mental disorders, a significant proportion of them were left without appropriate healthcare support (including psychiatric consultation) in the period preceding their suicide. Also, 20% of suicide completers and no control subject made prior suicide attempts. More specifically, over two-thirds of suicide completers had no treatment contact within the month prior to the completion, while only 12.7% (n = 7) of them were in contact with psychiatric services during that same period. Moreover, 56.4% (n = 31) of the suicide completers had not been diagnosed as having a mental disorder at the time of their death, and 54.5% of the subjects' that received treatment (12 out of 22) were considered poorly compliant or not compliant at all according to their medical/psychosocial records. Finally, we also found that females seemed to have more psychiatric and mental health service contacts in the past month, that subjects with depressive and anxious disorders received more psychiatric and general mental health services in the past year, and that past month hospitalization was more often associated with alcohol abuse and psychosis.
   Limitations: Relatively small sample size, and cross-sectional design.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate the need for an overall increase in the rates of healthcare services delivered to young subjects at risk for suicide, as well as better training of health professionals in detecting and treating youth psychopathology. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB AimTo estimate associations between recent licit and illicit substance use and subsequent suicide attempt among people who inject drugs (PWID).
   DesignSecondary analysis of longitudinal data from a prospective cohort study of PWID followed bi-annually between 2004 and 2011.
   SettingMontreal, Canada.
   ParticipantsSeven hundred and ninety-seven PWID who reported injection drug use in the previous 6months, contributing to a total of 4460 study visits. The median number of visits per participant was five (interquartile range: 3-8).
   MeasurementsAn interviewer-administered questionnaire eliciting information on socio-demographic factors, detailed information on substance use patterns and related behaviours, mental health markers and suicide attempt. The primary exposure variables examined were past-month use of alcohol [heavy ( 60 drinks); moderate (one to 59 drinks); none], sedative-hypnotics, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine and opioids [regular ( 4 days); occasional (1-3days); none]. The outcome was a binary measure of suicide attempt assessed in reference to the previous 6months.
   FindingsIn multivariate analyses, a positive association was found among licit substances between heavy alcohol consumption [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=2.05; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.12-3.75], regular use of sedative-hypnotics (AOR=1.89; 95% CI=1.21-2.95) and subsequent attempted suicide. Among illicit substances, occasional use of cannabis (AOR=1.84; 95% CI=1.09-3.13) had a positive association with subsequent suicide attempt. No statistically significant association was found for the remaining substances.
   ConclusionAmong people who inject drugs, use of alcohol, sedative-hypnotics and cannabis, but not cocaine, amphetamine or opioids, appears to be associated with an increased likelihood of later attempted suicide.

AB Male depression has been recognized as an important factor in some cases of intimate partner violence but there is a paucity of literature connecting depression and intimate partner homicide (IPH). This retrospective study provides a preliminary analysis that distinguished depressed from nondepressed perpetrators of IPH from a sample of 135 cases analyzed by a coroner's homicide death review committee in Ontario, Canada. Depressed perpetrators were more likely to commit homicide-suicide and had almost 1.5 times the number of risk factors present than nondepressed perpetrators. Consistent with the existing literature, the results indicated that depressed perpetrators were significantly older, more likely to commit homicide-suicide than homicide only, more likely to have prior threats or attempts of suicide, more likely to have been abused or witnessed domestic violence as a child than nondepressed perpetrators and more likely to exhibit sexual jealousy. The implications for these findings are outlined in terms of training of mental health professionals and public awareness about the potential lethality of domestic violence.

AB Background Gatekeeper training aims to train people to recognize and identify those who are at risk for suicide and assist them in getting care. Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST), a form of gatekeeper training, has been implemented around the world without a controlled evaluation. We hypothesized that participants in 2 days of ASIST gatekeeper training would have increased knowledge and preparedness to help people with suicidal ideation in comparison to participants who received a 2-day Resilience Retreat that did not focus on suicide awareness and intervention skills (control condition).
   Methods First Nations on reserve people in Northwestern Manitoba, aged 16 years and older, were recruited and randomized to two arms of the study. Self-reported measures were collected at three time pointsimmediately pre-, immediately post-, and 6 months post intervention. The primary outcome was the Suicide Intervention Response Inventory, a validated scale that assesses the capacity for individuals to intervene with suicidal behavior. Secondary outcomes included self-reported preparedness measures and gatekeeper behaviors.
   Results In comparison with the Resilience Retreat (n = 24), ASIST training (n = 31) was not associated with a significant impact on all outcomes of the study based on intention-to-treat analysis. There was a trend toward an increase in suicidal ideation among those who participated in the ASIST in comparison to those who were in the Resilience Retreat.
   Conclusions The lack of efficacy of ASIST in a First Nations on-reserve sample is concerning in the context of widespread policies in Canada on the use of gatekeeper training in suicide prevention. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Research is needed on the desire for hastened death (DHD) in the context of advanced cancer in order to address the clinical, ethical, and legal questions that it raises. The goal of the present qualitative study was to understand the experience of the DHD as expressed by individuals with advanced cancer, and to understand how it evolves over time. Participants were 27 ambulatory patients aged 45-82 years with advanced lung or gastrointestinal cancer. Participants were recruited through theoretical sampling from outpatient clinics at a large cancer center in Toronto Canada, and were asked about the DHD in serial, open-ended interviews until the point of death. A total of 54 interviews were analyzed based on the grounded theory method. The experience of the DHD in the context of advanced cancer was found to be subsumed under three distinct categories: i) DHD as a hypothetical exit plan; ii) DHD as an expression of despair; and iii) DHD as a manifestation of letting go. Each category had unique temporal and qualitative characteristics. The identification of these categories may be important to inform future research on the DHD, the criteria for clinical intervention in individuals who express this desire, and the public debate about physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia for individuals with advanced disease.

TI Suicidal Ideation among Canadian Youth: A Multivariate Analysis
SO ARCHIVES OF SUICIDE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Canada; NLSCY; social determinants; suicidal ideation; youth
AB A multivariate model was developed incorporating various socio-demographic, social-environmental, and social-psychological factors in an attempt to predict suicidal ideation among Canadian youth. The main research objective sought to determine what socially based factors elevate or reduce suicidal ideation within this population. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Children and Youth-Cycle 5 (2003), a cross-sectional sample of 1,032 was used to empirically identify various social determinants of suicidal ideation among youth between the ages of 12 and 15. Results reveal statistically significant correlations between suicide ideation and some lesser examined socially based measures. In particular, ability to communicate feelings, negative attachment to parents/guardians, taunting-bullying or abuse, and presence of deviant peers were significant predictors of suicidal ideation. As expected, depression/anxiety, gender, and age were also correlated with thoughts of suicide. Research findings should help foster a better understanding toward the social elements of suicide and provide insight into how suicide prevention strategies may be improved through an increased emphasis on substance use education, direct targeting of dysfunctional families and deviant peer groups, and exploring more avenues of self-expression for youth.

ID RATES
AB From each of 15 health regions, potential years of life lost (PYLL) before age 75 for Status Indians is compared for select causes of death with all other residents. Mortality data from 1991 to 2001 for rates of PYLL (standardized to the 1991 population) are from tables of the British Columbia Vital Statistics Agency and First Nations and Inuit Health Branch in 2002. PYLL rate differences and rate ratios were compared for two groups with significance of the former indicated by the 95% confidence interval. Overall, the rates of PYLL for suicide, homicide, and deaths due to motor vehicle accidents were about 224%, 340%, and 248% higher among Status Indians than all other residents. Rates of PYLL for homicide and deaths from motor vehicle accidents among Status Indian women exceeded those of other residents who were men. For suicide, Status Indian men ranked first and all other male residents of British Columbia ranked second.

AB Objective: To estimate the cumulative incidence of self-reported suicide-related thoughts (SRTs) and suicide attempts (SAs) in males and females from 11 to 25 years of age in Canada. Methods: A cohort study was conducted by linking cycles 2 to 8 from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth, a representative survey of Canadians aged 11 to 25 years conducted from 1996 to 2009. The 11- to 25-year cumulative incidence of self-reported SRTs and SAs (with suicidal intent) was estimated in males and females using a novel application of a counting process approach to account for discontinuous risk intervals between survey cycles. Results: The risk of SRTs was 29% (95% confidence interval [CI], 26% to 31%) in females and 19% (95% CI, 16% to 23%) in males. The risk of SAs was 16% (95% CI, 14% to 19%) in females and 7% (95% CI, 6% to 8%) in males. Over 70% of SRTs and SAs first occur between 11 and 16 years of age and 30% between 11 and 13 years of age, respectively. Conclusions: The risk of SRTs and SAs is high in young Canadians, with most events first occurring in early to mid-adolescence and possibly earlier. Females are at a higher risk compared to males. This research underscores the need for better longitudinal surveillance of SRTs and SAs in the population. A counting process framework could be useful for future research using existing longitudinal surveys suffering from design limitations relating to gaps in respondent follow-up. Furthermore, these findings have implications for younger SRT and SA risk management by clinicians and earlier implementation of suicide prevention programs.

AB Objectives. We examined the longitudinal associations between different types and severities of childhood trauma and suicide attempts among illicit drug users.
   Methods. Data came from 2 prospective cohort studies of illicit drug users in Vancouver, Canada, in 2005 to 2010. We used recurrent event proportional means models to estimate adjusted and weighted associations between types and severities of childhood maltreatment and suicide attempts.
   Results. Of 1634 participants, 411 (25.2%) reported a history of suicidal behavior at baseline. Over 5 years, 80 (4.9%) participants reported 97 suicide attempts, a rate of 2.6 per 100 person-years. Severe to extreme levels of sexual abuse (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4, 4.4), physical abuse (AHR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.1, 3.8), and emotional abuse (AHR = 3.5; 95% CI = 1.4, 8.7) predicted suicide attempts. Severe forms of physical and emotional neglect were not significantly associated with an increased risk of suicidal behavior.
   Conclusions. Severe sexual, physical, and emotional childhood abuse confer substantial risk of repeated suicidal behavior in adulthood. Illicit drug users require intensive secondary suicide prevention efforts, particularly among those with a history of childhood trauma.

AB Depression and suicide are of increasing concern on college campuses. This article presents data from the College Health Intervention Projects on the frequency of depression and suicide ideation among 1,622 college students who accessed primary care services in 4 university clinics in the Midwest, Northwest, and Canada. Students completed the Beck Depression Inventory and other measures related to exercise patterns, alcohol use, sensation seeking, and violence. The frequency of depression was similar for men (25%) and women (26%). Thought of suicide was higher for men (13%) than women (10%). Tobacco use, emotional abuse, and unwanted sexual encounters were all associated with screening positive for depression. "Days of exercise per week" was inversely associated with screening positive for depression. Because the majority of students access campus-based student health centers, medical providers can serve a key role in early identification and intervention. With every 4th student reporting symptoms of depression and every 10th student having suicidal thoughts, such interventions are needed.

AB Purpose: To evaluate the association among suicide behaviors, high-risk behaviors, coping style, and psychological adjustment (i.e., depressive symptomatology, internalizing and externalizing behavior problems) in homeless and non-homeless adolescent males (aged 16 to 19 years).
   Methods: Data were obtained from 100 homeless youth accessing an emergency shelter (Ottawa, ON). The comparison group was comprised of 70 youth accessing local community drop-in centers that lived with their parent(s)/guardian(s) and had never stayed in a shelter. Data were analyzed using Chi-square, Student's t-tests, and regression statistics.
   Results: Relative to non-homeless youth, homeless youth were more likely to report drug, alcohol, and tobacco use, legal problems, academic difficulties, and mental health problems. Homeless youth presented with a higher prevalence of suicidal ideation, past suicide attempts, depressive symptomatology, and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Disengagement coping was a predictor of suicidal ideation, past attempts, depressive symptoms and both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in homeless youth.
   Conclusions: Relative to non-homeless youth, findings indicate that homeless youth reported greater use of a disengaging coping style and are at greater risk for high-risk behaviors, past suicide attempts, and clinically elevated levels of depressive symptoms and behavior problems.

DT Review
DE suicide; prognosis; capacity; pressure; clinical; assessment
AB Background: Physician-assisted suicide (PAS) laws have been enacted in five US States and, along with physician-administered euthanasia, in Canada and the Netherlands.
   Sources of data: Annual reports of the Oregon Health Authority and published research papers.
   Areas of agreement: Not all recipients of lethal drugs use them to end their lives. Improvements in palliative care provision.
   Areas of controversy: Rising numbers of deaths from PAS. Emergence of 'doctor shopping' and multiple-prescribing. Absence of qualitative scrutiny of assessment process. No re-assessment or oversight when prescribed drugs are ingested. Recent pressures to extend Oregon's PAS law.
   Growing points: Reasons given for seeking PAS indicate this is a societal rather than a clinical issue and raise the question whether adjudicating on requests for legalized PAS is an appropriate role for doctors.
   Areas for timely research: Research into quality of decision-making in requests for PAS and into potential role of doctors as expert witnesses rather than judges in requests for PAS.

AB This study examined the first participants who registered for the Huntington's disease predictive testing program 1990-1995 in Stockholm, Sweden. A psychosocial investigation was performed to evaluate potential effects of the presymptomatic testing. The results showed no significant differences between 13 genecarriers and 21 noncarriers in pretest attitudes, expectations, general well-being, life satisfaction and lifestyle, the need for support, estimated sense of well-being or degree of health. However, both groups showed high suicidal ideation and self-injurious behavior. Noncarriers had a very high frequency of attempted suicide, and both groups had similarly pronounced psychiatric dysfunction. Their relatives also had high frequencies of psychiatric diseases, suicide or suicidal attempts. Most of the participants had a desire to meet a psychologist or a social worker. The need for counseling, using a well designed protocol, and the importance of focusing on suicide risk of participants in predictive testing programs is emphasized.

AB Because of the nature of their work, nurses are directly involved with terminally ill patients and the problems associated with the decision to hasten death through voluntary euthanasia or assisted suicide (VE/AS). An anonymous survey delivered to nurses working in HIV/AIDS settings in Canada was used to analyse nurses' experiences and attitudes regarding VE/AS. An emergent analysis of 22 nurses' responses to an open-ended prompt appearing at the end of the survey reveals that nurses: support death-hastening practices; believe that legislation for these practices needs to be established; are wary of the potential abuse of VE/AS; and believe that further discussion on end-of-life issues is imperative. Their caring role in the health care setting places nurses in key positions to stimulate discussion in this area.

AB BackgroundMedical assistance in dying (MAID) was legalized in Canada in 2016. As of July 2017, approximately 2149 patients have accessed MAID. There remains no national-level data on the perspectives of future physicians about MAID or its changing legal status. We provide evidence from a national survey of Canadian medical students about their opinions, intentions, and concerns about MAID.MethodsFrom October 2016 to July 2017, we distributed an anonymous online survey to all students at 15 of Canada's 17 medical schools. The survey collected data on respondent socio-demographic characteristics, features of their medical education, intentions for medical practice, and perspectives on MAID. We analyzed responses using univariate descriptive and stepwise multivariate logistic regression.ResultsIn 1210 completed surveys, 71% of respondents reported being willing to provide MAID under a legal framework that permits it. Non-religious respondents reported greater willingness to participate in MAID than respondents of any religious affiliation (p<0.001). Frequency of religious attendance was inversely associated with willingness to provide MAID (p<0.001). Medical students born in Quebec were more willing to provide MAID than respondents from other provinces (OR 2.21; p<0.001). Age, sex, socioeconomic status, year of medical study, previous academic major, and rural/urban city of birth were not associated with willingness to provide MAID.ConclusionAs the current class of medical students becomes the first cohort of new physicians to enter Canada's changing medical and legal landscape around MAID, our findings inform the public debate by examining attributes associated with support or opposition to the practice.

AB Background: Although a number of suicide-risk assessment tools are available to clinicians, the high levels of suicide still evident in society suggest a clear need for new strategies in order to facilitate the prevention of suicidal behaviors. Aims: The present study examined the utilization of a new structured clinical interview called the Scale for Impact of Suicidality Management, Assessment, and Planning of Care (SIS-MAP). Methods: SIS-MAP ratings were obtained from a group of incoming psychiatric patients over a 6-month period at Regional Mental Health Care, St. Thomas, Canada. Results: A canonical discriminant function analysis resulted in a total 74.0% of original grouped cases correctly classified based on admission status (admitted or not; Wilks lambda = .749, p < .001). The specificity of the scale was 78.1%, while the sensitivity of the scale was 66.7%. Additionally, mean total scores on the scale were used to establish clinical cutoffs to facilitate future level of care decisions. Conclusions: Preliminary analysis suggests the SIS-MAP is a valid and reliable tool for determining the level of psychiatric care needed for adults with suicidal ideation.

AB This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of mental illness and substance use among Indigenous students attending Canadian post-secondary institutions. We obtained data from the National College Health Assessment - American College Health Association Spring 2013 survey, which includes 34,039 participants in 32 post-secondary institutions across Canada. We calculated prevalence estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We compared Indigenous and non-Indigenous students using age- and sex-adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) obtained from Poisson regression models. Of the total sample, 1,110 (3.3%) post-secondary students self-identified as Indigenous. Within the past 12 months, Indigenous students had higher odds of intentionally injuring themselves (PR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.27-1.84), seriously considering suicide (PR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.12-1.56), attempting suicide (PR = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.16-2.62), or having been diagnosed with depression (PR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.08-1.47) or anxiety (PR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.02-1.35) when compared with non-Indigenous students. Indigenous students also had higher odds of having a lifetime diagnosis of depression (PR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.17-1.47) when compared with non-Indigenous students. Indigenous students were more likely to report binging on alcohol (PR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.02-1.19), using marijuana (PR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.06-1.37), and using other recreational drugs (PR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.06-1.63) compared to non-Indigenous students. This study demonstrates that Indigenous students at post-secondary institutions across Canada experience higher prevalence of mental health and related issues compared to the non-Indigenous student population. This information highlights the need to assess the utilization and ensure the appropriate provision of mental health and wellness resources to support Indigenous students attending post-secondary institutions.

AB Objectives: To characterize the health-care utilization and economic burden associated with depression in Manitoba, Canada. Methods: Patient-level data were retrieved from the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy administrative, clinical, and laboratory databases for the study period of January 1, 1996, through December 31, 2016. Patients were assigned to the depression cohort based on diagnoses recorded in hospitalizations and outpatient physician claims, as well as antidepressant prescription drug claims. A comparison cohort of nondepressed subjects, matched with replacement for age, gender, place of residence (urban vs. rural), and index date, was created. Demographics, comorbidities, intentional self-harm, mortality, health-care utilization, prescription drug utilization, and costs of health-care utilization and social services were compared between depressed patients and matched nondepressed patients, and incidence rate ratios and hazard ratios were reported. Results: There were 190,065 patients in the depression cohort and 378,177 patients in the nondepression cohort. Comorbidities were 43% more prevalent among depressed patients. Intentional self-harm, all-cause mortality, and suicide mortality were higher among patients with depression than the nondepression cohort. Health-care utilization-including hospitalizations, physician visits, physician-provided psychotherapy, and prescription drugs-was higher in the depression than the nondepression cohort. Mean health-care utilization costs were 3.5 times higher among depressed patients than nondepressed patients ($10,064 and $2,832, respectively). Similarly, mean social services costs were 3 times higher ($1,522 and $510, respectively). Overall, depression adds a total average cost of $8,244 (SD = $40,542) per person per year. Conclusions: Depression contributes significantly to health burden and per patient costs in Manitoba, Canada. Extrapolation of the results to the entire Canadian health-care system projects an excess of $12 billion annually in health system spending.

AB Objective: In Canada, 80% of firearm-related deaths are suicides. Access to firearms is associated with increased suicide rates. This study examines the frequency and factors that influence assessment of firearm access in an emergency setting. Methods: A total of 15,847 consecutive adults seen for psychiatric consultation in two tertiary emergency departments (EDs) in Winnipeg, Manitoba were interviewed. Data captured whether access to firearms was assessed, and whether respondents endorsed access or not. Comparisons were done to determine group differences among those with and without and with known and unknown firearm access. Results: Access to firearms was unknown in 47% (n = 7,363) of psychiatric ED consultations, including 43% (n = 998) of individuals who presented with a suicide attempt. Female sex was associated with decreased odds of firearm access (odds ratio [OR] 0.28; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.35). Being single was associated with lower odds of known firearm access (OR 0.83; 95% CI, 0.77 to 0.89) yet higher likelihood of firearm access (OR 1.36; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.68). Presenting with a suicide attempt (OR 2.45; 95% CI, 1.80 to 3.34), preparatory acts (OR 6.40; 95% CI, 4.38 to 9.36) and suicidal ideation (OR 2.45; 95% CI, 1.87 to 3.21) were associated with increased odds of reporting access. When clinicians felt there was a high likelihood of future suicide, firearm access remained unknown in half of cases. Conclusion: Firearm ownership and access is an essential component of a suicide risk assessment and remains unknown in half of individuals seen by psychiatry in this tertiary care ED sample. People presenting with suicidal ideation and attempts were more likely to report access to firearms.

AB Background Deliberate self-harm (DSH) is related to suicide and DSH repetition is common. DSH hospital presentations are often self-poisonings with medicinal agents. While older age and male sex are known risk factors for suicide, it is unclear how these factors are related to the nature and severity of medicinal self-poisoning (SP). Such knowledge can guide prevention strategies emphasizing detecting and treating mental illness and controlling access to means. Methods Medicinal SP presentations by 18,383 residents of Ontario, Canada, aged 12 years and older, who presented to a hospital emergency department in that province between April 1, 2001-March 31, 2002 were characterized by the agents taken, identification of deliberate intent and medical severity. Results We found distinct age-sex differences in the nature and severity of medicinal SP. In youths, aged 12-17, about 40% of presentations involved analgesics, typically not prescribed and most often the acetaminophen agent-group. Females aged 12-64 were identified as deliberate more often than their male counterparts and this pattern occurred in most agent-groups, even among those who took antidepressants. The acetaminophen agent-group was most consistently associated with medical severity and this effect was strongest among female youths. Although medicinal SP was less frequent in the elderly, these presentations tended to be more medically serious and less often identified deliberate. Conclusions The high proportion of medicinal SP in youths involving agents typically not prescribed and the medical severity of the acetaminophen agent-group underscore how prevention strategies must extend beyond controlling access to antidepressants. Despite a higher risk for suicide, males and the elderly may not have their deliberate intent detected and therefore, may not receive appropriate treatment. The emergency department can serve as important link to mental health care and usage patterns can provide feedback about the need for system-level enhancements and DSH surveillance.

ID REMEDIES; CANADA
AB How long does it take the elected branches of government to study complex policy questions and develop legislation that respects constitutional rights? Judges often suspend for twelve months declarations that a law unjustifiably limits a right protected by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Dialogue theorists praise such suspensions for allowing the legislative and executive branches to act. This article recounts the experiences of the governments of Quebec and of Canada in grappling with assisted suicide en route to legislating. It concludes that tackling a serious policy issue - including research, public education and consultation, and meaningful deliberation - may take much longer than twelve months. Consequent possible changes to judicial practice include granting fewer suspensions and prompting fuller debate in court on the appropriate order. As for dialogue theorists, they might better align their justifications of suspensions with legislative realities.

AB Background: People who inject drugs (PWID) have an elevated risk of suicide attempt. Although different substances are associated with suicide attempt, the overall risk posed by binge behavior, a high-risk pattern of drug use, remains unclear. The objective of this study is to assess the association between binge drug use and suicide attempt in a prospective cohort of PWID in Montreal, Canada. Methods: Participants answered a biannual interviewer-administered questionnaire compiling information on sociodemographics, pattern of substance use (cocaine, amphetamine, opioids, sedative-hypnotics, alcohol, and cannabis), and psychosocial stressors and related markers. The relationship between suicide attempt and binge behavior was modeled using generalized estimating equations (GEEs), controlling for type and pattern of substance use, sociodemographic characteristics, and significant mental health markers. Results: Among 1240 participants (mean age +/- SD: 38.2 +/- 9.8) at baseline, 222 (17.9%) reported binge during the past 6-months. PWID reporting binge were significantly younger (P < .001), less educated (P = .012), less likely male (P = .047), and had shorter history of injection (P < .001). In addition, they were younger at first injection (P = .014), reported higher rates of prostitution and psychological disorders (P = .003), and were more likely to use other drugs except cannabis and alcohol. Binge was independently associated with attempted suicide in the GEE multivariate model (adjusted odds ratio [aOR 95% CI] = 1.91 [1.38-2.65], P < .001). Conclusions: Among PWID at high risk of suicide attempt, those who binge represent a particularly vulnerable subgroup. Although the exact mechanisms underlying this finding remain unresolved, several hypothesis pertaining to the neurobiological and psychosocial consequences of binge, as well as common personality traits, warrant further investigations.

TI Suicide and Ambient Temperature: A Multi-Country Multi-City Study

ID SOUTH-AFRICA; MORTALITY; SEASONALITY; RATES; ASSOCIATION; ENGLAND
AB BACKGROUND: Previous literature suggests that higher ambient temperature may play a role in increasing the risk of suicide. However, no multicountry study has explored the shape of the association and the role of moderate and extreme heat across different locations.
   OBJECTIVES: We examined the short-term temperature suicide relationship using daily time-series data collected for 341 locations in 12 countries for periods ranging from 4 to 40 y.
   METHODS: We conducted a two-stage meta-analysis. First, we performed location-specific time-stratified case-crossover analyses to examine the temperature suicide association for each location. Then, we used a multivariate meta-regression to combine the location-specific lag-cumulative nonlinear associations across all locations and by country.
   RESULTS: A total of 1,320,148 suicides were included in this study. Higher ambient temperature was associated with an increased risk of suicide in general, and we observed a nonlinear association (inverted J-shaped curve) with the highest risk at 27 degrees C. The relative risk (RR) for the highest risk was 1.33 (95% CI: 1.30, 1.36) compared with the risk at the first percentile. Country-specific results showed that the nonlinear associations were more obvious in northeast Asia (Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan). The temperature with the highest risk of suicide ranged from the 87th to 88th percentiles in the northeast Asian countries, whereas this value was the 99th percentile in Western countries (Canada, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the United Slates) and South Africa, where nearly linear associations were estimated. The country-specific RRs ranged from 1.31 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.44) in the United States to 1.65 (95% CI: 1.40, 1.93) in Taiwan, excluding countries where the results were substantially uncertain.
   DISCUSSION: Our findings showed that the risk of suicide increased with increasing ambient temperature in many countries, but to varying extents and not necessarily linearly. This temperature suicide association should be interpreted cautiously, and further evidence of the relationship and modifying factors is needed.

AB Urban Indigenous peoples face a disproportionate burden of ill health compared to non-Indigenous populations, and experience more frequent geographic mobility. However, most of what is known about Indigenous health is limited to rural, northern, or in the case of Canada, reserve-based populations. Little is known about the complexities of urban Indigenous health, and the differential impacts of residential mobility and urban migration remain poorly understood. Drawing upon interviews with Aboriginal movers and service providers in Winnipeg, Canada, we apply a critical population health lens, informed by holistic health, to examine these impacts. The results demonstrate mobility is an intergenerational phenomenon, influenced by colonial practices. While migration can contribute to positive health experiences, residential mobility, which is largely involuntary, and linked to stressors such as neighborhood safety, results in negative health effects.

ID COMPENSATION; WORKPLACE; SUICIDE
AB THIS PAPER CRITICALLY EXAMINES official statistics on workplace fatalities in Canada. Each year the Association of Workers' Compensation Boards of Canada reports on the number of workers who die from a work-related injury or illness/disease. The problem, however, is that these data report the number of deaths that were accepted for compensation; it is not a system for tracking all work-related deaths. Drawing from a range of data sources and employing a broad definition of what constitutes death at work we attempt to generate a more accurate estimate of the number of work-related fatalities in Canada. In so doing our goal is not to produce a definitive number of annual deaths at work - an impossibility given the paucity of data sources - but instead to challenge dominant ways of conceptualizing what constitutes a work-related fatality and thus contribute to ongoing efforts to raise academic, political, and public awareness about this important issue. In this sense our goal is to question whether official statistics regarding workplace fatalities are complete when set against a broader understanding of what constitutes death at work.

AB Objective: The study estimated costs and effects associated with increasing access to publicly funded psychological services for depression in a public health care system.
   Methods: Discrete event simulation modeled clinical events (relapse, recovery, hospitalizations, suicide attempts, and suicide), health service use, and cost outcomes over 40 years in a population with incident depression. Parameters included epidemiologic and economic data from the literature and data from a secondary analysis of the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey on mental health. Societal costs were measured with the human capital approach. Analyses estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio associated with improved access to psychological services among individuals not receiving adequate mental health care and reporting an unmet need for such care compared with present use of health services for mental health reasons.
   Results: Over 40 years, increased access to mental health services in a simulated population of adults with incident depression would lead to significantly lower lifetime prevalence of hospitalizations (27.9% versus 30.2% base case) and suicide attempts (14.1% versus 14.6%); fewer suicides (184 versus 250); a per-person gain of .17 quality-adjusted life years; and average societal cost savings of $2,590 CAD per person (range $1,266-$6,320). Publicly funding psychological services would translate to additional costs of $123,212,872 CAD ($67,709,860-$190,922,732) over 40 years. Savings to society would reach, on average, $246,997,940 CAD ($120,733,356-$602,713,120).
   Conclusions: In Canada, every $1 invested in covering psychological services would yield $2.00 ($1.78 to $3.15) in savings to society. Covering psychological services as part of Medicare for individuals with an unmet need for mental health care would pay for itself.

AB Bill C-14 introduces a new era in end-of-life care by permitting death to be hastened through medical assistance in dying (MAiD). This article reviews those aspects of MAiD that are of particular relevance to psychologists, as seen through the perspective of the author's research. It includes a brief overview of the major legal cases that led the Supreme Court of Canada to overturn the laws against assisted suicide. It addresses such issues as the prevalence of the desire for death in the terminally ill, reasons for requesting MAiD, the concept of "intolerable suffering," and the association between MAiD, depression, and suicide. Findings from the Canadian National Palliative Care Survey are highlighted, which document the attitudes of patients receiving palliative care for cancer. Data from the Netherlands, Belgium, and Oregon are also reviewed briefly and contrasted; differences in the incidence of MAiD in these jurisdictions point to the importance of permitting MAiD to be provided by clinicians (euthanasia) rather than requiring patients to self-administer lethal medication (assisted suicide). It is concluded that Bill C-14 aligns with the opinions expressed by the majority of terminally ill participants in the National Palliative Care Survey. It remains to be seen whether new legal challenges will lead to the extension of MAiD to other patient groups.

TI Varenicline and Risk of Self-Harm: A Nested Case-Control Study

AB Background
   Smoking remains a serious public health concern. Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation, including bupropion and varenicline, are proven means to increase quit rates. Postmarketing reports describing suicidal behaviours have raised concerns about the safety of varenicline. However, whether varenicline imparts a higher risk of suicide relative to bupropion remains uncertain.
   Methods
   A population-based nested case-control study in Ontario, Canada, from April 1, 2011 to March 31, 2015 was conducted. Subjects were residents of Ontario aged 18 years and older with publicly funded drug coverage receiving either bupropion or varenicline for smoking cessation. We defined cases were those with a hospitalization or emergency department visit for suicide or non-fatal self-harm within 90 days of treatment. For each case, we identified up to fifty controls from the same cohort matched on age, sex, history of self-harm, use of selected psychotropic medications, alcohol abuse and prior admission to a mental health unit. Adjusted odds ratio were used to compare the risk of suicide/self-harm of varenicline to bupropion.
   Results
   We identified 331 cases and 5,346 matched-controls. Following adjustment for potential confounders, we found that varenicline was not associated with an increased risk of suicide/ self-harm relative to bupropion (adjusted odds ratio 1.15; 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 1.87).
   Interpretation
   Treatment with varenicline does not appear to significantly increase the risk of suicide or self-harm relative to bupropion.

AB Objectives: To investigate the trends and correlations of gross domestic product (GDP) adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita on suicide rates in 10 WHO regions during the past 30 years.
   Design: Analyses of databases of PPP-adjusted GDP per capita and suicide rates. Countries were grouped according to the Global Burden of Disease regional classification system.
   Data sources: World Bank's official website and WHO's mortality database.
   Statistical analyses: After graphically displaying PPP-adjusted GDP per capita and suicide rates, mixed effect models were used for representing and analysing clustered data.
   Results: Three different groups of countries, based on the correlation between the PPP-adjusted GDP per capita and suicide rates, are reported: (1) positive correlation: developing (lower middle and upper middle income) Latin-American and Caribbean countries, developing countries in the South East Asian Region including India, some countries in the Western Pacific Region (such as China and South Korea) and high-income Asian countries, including Japan; (2) negative correlation: high-income and developing European countries, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and (3) no correlation was found in an African country.
   Conclusions: PPP-adjusted GDP per capita may offer a simple measure for designing the type of preventive interventions aimed at lowering suicide rates that can be used across countries. Public health interventions might be more suitable for developing countries. In high-income countries, however, preventive measures based on the medical model might prove more useful.

DT Article
ID MORTALITY; PATTERNS; POLICE; CANADA
AB Objective: Approximately 70% of all US suicides are among working-age adults. This study was to determine whether and how 12-month suicidal ideation and suicide attempt were associated with specific occupations among currently employed adults aged 18-64 in the U.S.
   Methods: Data were from 184,300 currently employed adults who participated in the 2008-2013 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). NSDUH provides nationally representative data on suicidal ideation and suicide attempt. Descriptive analyses and multivariable logistic regressions were conducted.
   Results: Among currently employed adults aged 18-64 in the U.S., 3.5% had suicidal ideation in the past 12 months (3.1% had suicidal ideation only, and 0.4% had suicidal ideation and attempted suicide). Compared with adults in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations (model adjusted prevalence (MAP) = 1.6%), adults in the following occupations were 3.0-3.6 times more likely to have suicidal ideation in the past year (model adjusted relative risks (MARRs) = 3.0-3.6): lawyers, judges, and legal support workers (MAP = 4.8%), social scientists and related workers (MAP = 5.4%), and media and communication workers (MAP = 5.8%).
   Conclusions: Among employed adults aged 18-64 in the U.S., the 12-month prevalence of suicidal ideation varies by occupations. Adults in occupations that are at elevated risk for suicidal ideation may warrant focused suicide prevention. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Purpose As part of the Mini-Sentinel pilot program, under contract with the Food and Drug Administration, an effort has been made to evaluate the validity of algorithms useful for identifying health outcomes of interest, including suicide and suicide attempt. Method Literature was reviewed to evaluate how well medical episodes associated with these events could be identified in administrative or claims data sets from the USA or Canada. Results Six studies were found to include sufficient detail to assess performance characteristics of an algorithm on the basis of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, E-codes (950-959) for intentional self-injury. Medical records and death registry information were used to validate classification. Sensitivity ranged from 13.8% to 65%, and positive predictive value range from 4.0% to 100%. Study comparisons are difficult to interpret, however, as the studies differed substantially in many important elements, including design, sample, setting, and methods. Although algorithm performance varied widely, two studies located in prepaid medical plans reported that comparisons of database codes to medical charts could achieve good agreement. Conclusions Insufficient data exist to support specific recommendations regarding a preferred algorithm, and caution should be exercised in interpreting clinical and pharmacological epidemiological surveillance and research that rely on these codes as measures of suicide-related outcomes.

AB Objective: Suicide rates are often high in rural areas. Despite the strong association between deliberate self-harm (DSH) and suicide, few have studied rural residence and DSH. Self-poisonings dominate DSH hospital presentations. We investigate a previously reported association between rural residence and medical severity (defined as a subsequent medical/surgical inpatient stay) among emergency department presentations for medicinal self-poisoning (SP) to determine whether differences in agents taken, mental health service use or hospital-level resources explain the relationship.
   Method: A cohort of n=16,294 12-64-year olds presenting with SP to hospital emergency departments in Ontario, Canada, in 2001/2002 was linked to their service records over time.
   Results: The rural-medical severity association was best explained by differences in hospital resources; presenting to hospitals providing inpatient psychiatric services appeared to reduce medical/surgical inpatient stays in favor of psychiatric ones. Among those with a recent psychiatric admission, more intensive ambulatory psychiatric contact may be protective of a psychiatric inpatient stay subsequent to the SP presentation. Compared to nonrural residents, deliberate intent was identified less often in rural residents, particularly males.
   Conclusions: The rural-medical severity association was best explained by disparities in the delivery systems serving rural and nonrural residents, important to rural suicide prevention efforts. (c) 2008 Elsevier the. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: We estimate associations between emergency department (ED) diagnoses and suicide among youth to guide ED care. Method: This ED-based case-control study used data from the Office of the Chief Coroner and all EDs in Ontario, Canada. Cases (n = 697 males and n = 327 females) were aged 10 to 25 years who died by suicide in Ontario between April 2003 and March 2014, with an ED contact in the year before their death. Same-aged ED-based controls were selected during this time frame. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results: Among youth diagnosed with a mental health problem at their most recent ED contact (41.9% cases, 5% controls), suicide was elevated among nonfatal self-inflicted: 'other' injuries, including hanging, strangulation, and suffocation in both sexes (aORs > 14); cut/pierce injuries in males (aOR > 5); poisonings in both sexes (aORs > 2.2); and mood and psychotic disorders in males (aORs > 1.7). Among those remaining, 'undetermined' injuries and poisonings in both sexes (aORs > 5), 'unintentional' poisonings in males (aOR = 2.1), and assault in both sexes (aORs > 1.8) were significant. At least half of cases had ED contact within 106 days. Conclusions: The results highlight the need for timely identification and treatment of mental health problems. Among those with an identified mental health problem, important targets for suicide prevention efforts are youth with self-harm and males with mood and psychotic disorders. Among others, youth with unintentional poisonings, undetermined events, and assaults should raise concern.

AB Background. Death during international travel concerns several levels of the travel industry. In addition to the immediate effects for the traveler, their family and friends, the nature of travel-related mortality has important implications for pretravel health advisors and providers of medical care services.
   Methods. The Consular Affairs Bureau, Foreign Affairs Canada provides information and assistance to Canadian civilians abroad. Beginning in 1995, the Consular Management and Operations System tracked Canadian deaths abroad notifications. The annual data for 1996 to 2004 was extracted for sex, age, and cause of death by location for all reports received.
   Results. There were 2,410 reported deaths in Canadians abroad; reported sex was 32% female and 68% male, average age of 61.7 and 60.4 years, respectively. Recorded causes of death: natural (1,762), accidental (450), suicide (92), and murder (106). Country of death reflected the pattern of Canadian international travel for recreation, business, and ancestral linkages. Average age of natural death (66 years) distinguished it from all other causes of death: accidental (45), suicide (41), and murder (43).
   Conclusion. Natural causes and suicide deaths may be anticipated or planned to occur abroad. The risk of death may be mitigated through personal knowledge and medical assessment and prevention strategies. Deaths due to vaccine-preventable diseases, exotic and infectious diseases were rare in this population. Consular services may be able to provide various types of support. Local laws and customs, as well as international regulations in health and quarantine govern other responsibilities such as funeral services and repatriation of the deceased to Canada.

DT Article
DE clinician prediction; suicide attempt; SAD PERSONS
ID SELF-HARM; EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT; RISK; SCALE
AB Objective: Established risk assessment tools are often inaccurate at predicting future suicide risk. We therefore investigated whether clinicians are able to predict individuals' suicide risk with greater accuracy.
   Method: We used the SAFE Database, which included consecutive adult (age >= 18 years) presentations (N = 3818) over a 22-month period to the 2 tertiary care hospitals in Manitoba, Canada. Medical professionals assessed each individual and recorded his or her predicted risk for future suicide attempt (SA) on a 0-10 scale-the clinician prediction scale. The SAD PERSONS scale was completed as a comparison. SAs within 6 months, assessed using the Columbia Classification Algorithm for Suicide Assessment, were the primary outcome measure. Receiver operating characteristic curve and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the accuracy of both scales to predict SAs, and the scales were compared with z scores. Clinician prediction scale performance was stratified based on level of training.
   Results: Clinicians were able to predict future SAs with significantly greater accuracy (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.77; P < 0.001) compared with the SAD PERSONS scale (z = 3.79, P < 0.001). Both scales nonetheless showed positive predictive value of less than 7%. Analyses by level of training showed that junior psychiatric residents and non-psychiatric residents did not accurately predict SAs, whereas senior psychiatric residents and staff psychiatrists demonstrated greater accuracy (AUC = 0.76 and 0.78, respectively).
   Conclusions: Clinicians are able to predict future attempts with fewer false positives than a conventional risk assessment scale, and this skill appears related to training level. Predicting future suicidal behaviour remains very challenging.

AB Objective: To investigate the association of childhood trajectories of anxiousness and disruptiveness with suicide attempts in early adulthood.
   Design: Prospective cohort study.
   Setting: Public francophone schools in Quebec, Canada, from the 1986 to 1988 school years.
   Participants: Of 4488 French Canadian children attending kindergarten, a representative group of 1001 boys and 999 girls was chosen for follow-up. Of these, 1144 individuals participated in the study during early adulthood.
   Main Outcome Measures: Suicide attempt histories by early adulthood, adjusted odds ratios (ORs) associated with membership in high- vs low-risk trajectories of anxiousness and disruptiveness, moderation (by sex), and mediation (by adolescent Axis I disorders).
   Results: We observed 4 distinct developmental profiles of anxiousness and disruptiveness and a frequent cooccurrence of similar levels of these traits. In contrast to anxiousness trajectories (OR = 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-2.65), disruptiveness (OR = 1.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-3.13) and joint (OR = 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-3.37) trajectories made statistically significant contributions to suicide attempts. We found no support for mediation by adolescent anxiety/mood or disruptive disorders. Sex, however, moderated the effect of joint trajectories, increasing the risk of suicide attempts in women (OR = 3.60; Wald chi(2) = 10.93; P < .001) but not men (OR = 0.80; Wald chi(2) = 0.23; P = .64) displaying both anxious and disruptive traits as children.
   Conclusions: Anxious-disruptive girls and disruptive boys appear to be more likely than their peers to attempt suicide by early adulthood. Preventive efforts will require more research into the possible mechanisms behind this early sex difference, ie, gene-environment interplays and nonpsychiatric mediators.

TI 'Coalition-In-Iraq' countries 'internal' civil violent deaths compared
   to the USA 'external' violence of September 11th 2001
SO MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR

ID SUICIDE; FEAR
AB Background: The atrocity of 9/11 exemplified 'external' caused civil violent deaths, which have major policy implications for the countries contributing armed forces to the 'Coalition-In-Iraq' [C.I.I]. C.I.I Government's resources for perennial 'internal' violent deaths (suicide, homicide and road), are likely to be threatened by alternative priorities. C.I.I 'internal' deaths are compared with those of 9/11 to provide information to determine relative risks.
   Material/Methods: To uniformly compare mortality between countries we utilise the most recent WHO mortality data, taking the latest three years 1997-1999 and calculating an average annual number and rate of 'internal' deaths in each country, these are compared with the 9/11 fatalities, calculating a proportional ratio, as an indicator of differential damage to families and society.
   Results: USA 'external' deaths were 3,074 people and annual average suicides were 30,966. Total 'internal' deaths exceeded 'external' more than 30 times. Every fortnight there are more USA 'internal' violent deaths than on 9/11. Except Australia and Bulgaria, every country had more suicides than died on 9/11. Apart from Bulgaria, total 'internal' deaths exceeded the 'external' toll in all other CAI countries- by 14 times in Japan; 6 in Republic of Korea, 4 in Italy, 3 in Spain and the UK, twice in Canada and 1.5 times in Australia.
   Conclusions: The extent of 'internal' civil violent deaths, such as suicide, highlight the perennial pressures upon psychiatric services and the need to defend resources at a time of competing priorities.

AB Objective: The objective of this study is to examine suicide attempts and completions among mothers who had a child taken into care by child protection services (CPS). These mothers were compared with their biological sisters who did not have a child taken into care and with mothers who received services from CPS but did not have a child taken into care.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort of mothers whose first child was born in Manitoba, Canada, between April 1, 1992, and March 31, 2015, is used. Rates among discordant biological sisters (1872 families) were compared using fixed-effects Poisson regression models, and mothers involved with CPS (children in care [n = 1872] and received services [n = 9590]) were compared using a Poisson regression model.
   Results: Compared with their biological sisters and mothers who received services, the adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) of death by suicide was greater among mothers whose child was taken into care by CPS (aIRR = 4.46 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.39-14.33] and ARR = 3.45 [95% CI, 1.61-7.40], respectively). Incidence rates of suicide attempts were higher among mothers with a child taken into care compared with their sisters (aIRR = 2.15; 95% CI, 1.40-3.30) and mothers receiving services (aIRR = 2.82; 95% CI, 2.03-3.92).
   Conclusions: Mothers who had a child taken into care had significantly higher rates of suicide attempts and completions. When children are taken into care, physician and social workers should inquire about maternal suicidal behaviour and provide appropriate mental health.
   Objectif: L'objectif de cette etude est d'examiner les tentatives de suicide et les deces par suicide chez les meres dont un enfant a ete pris en charge par les services de protection de l'enfance (SPE). Ces meres ont ete comparees avec leurs sOEurs biologiques qui n'avaient pas d'enfant pris en charge et avec des meres qui recevaient des services des SPE mais qui n'avaient pas d'enfant pris en charge.
   Methodes: Une cohorte retrospective de meres dont le premier enfant est ne au Manitoba, Canada, entre le 1(er) avril 1992 et le 31 mars 2015 est utilisee. Les taux chez les sOEurs biologiques discordantes (1 872 familles) ont ete compares a l'aide des modeles de regression de Poisson a effets fixes, et les meres impliquees avec les SPE [enfants pris en charge (n = 1 872) et recu des services (n = 9 590)] ont ete comparees a l'aide d'un modele de regression de Poisson.
   Resultats: Compare avec leurs sOEurs biologiques et les meres qui ont recu des services, le rapport des taux d'incidence ajuste (RTIa) des deces par suicide etait plus grand chez les meres dont l'enfant a ete pris en charge par les SPE (RTIa = 4,46; IC a 95 % 1,39 a 14,33; et RTA = 3,45; IC a 95 % 1,61 a 7,40, respectivement). Les taux d'incidence des tentatives de suicide etaient plus eleves chez les meres dont l'enfant a ete pris en charge comparativement a leurs sOEurs (RTIa = 2,15; IC a 95 % 1, 40 a 3,30) et aux meres recevant des services (RTIa = 2,82; IC a 95 % 2,03 a 3,92).
   Conclusions: Les meres qui avaient un enfant pris en charge avaient des taux significativement plus eleves de tentatives de suicide et de deces par suicide. Quand les enfants sont pris en charge, le medecin et les travailleurs sociaux devraient poser des questions sur le comportement suicidaire maternel et offrir des services de sante mentale appropries.

AB Background/aims: Given high rates of depression and suicide among marginalized women, and increasing calls to integrate trauma-informed biomedical and community-led structural interventions, this study longitudinally examines the potential moderating effect of psychedelic use on the relationship between other illicit drug use and suicide risk. Methods: Data (2010-2017) were drawn from a community-based, prospective open cohort of marginalized women in Vancouver, Canada. Extended Cox regression analyses examined the moderating effect of psychedelic use on the association between other illicit drug use and incidence of suicidal ideation or attempt over follow-up. Results: Of 340 women without suicidal ideation or attempt at baseline, 16% (n=53) reported a first suicidal episode during follow-up, with an incidence density of 4.63 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval 3.53-6.07). In unadjusted analysis, psychedelic use moderated the relationship between prescription opioid use and suicide risk: among women who did not use psychedelics, prescription opioid use increased the hazard of suicide (hazard ratio 2.91; 95% confidence interval 1.40-6.03) whereas prescription opioid use was not associated with increased suicidal ideation or attempt among those who used psychedelics (hazard ratio 0.69; 95% confidence interval 0.27-1.73) (interaction term p-value: 0.016). The moderating effect of psychedelics remained significant when adjusted for confounders (interaction term p-value: 0.036). Conclusions: Psychedelic use had a protective moderating effect on the relationship between prescription opioid use and suicide risk. In the context of a severe public health crisis around prescription opioids and lack of addiction services tailored to marginalized women, this study supports calls for innovative, evidence-based and trauma-informed interventions, including further research on the potential benefits of psychedelics.

AB Background Previous studies have demonstrated an association between a diagnosis of cancer and the risk of suicide; however, they failed to account for psychiatric care before a cancer diagnosis, which may confound this relationship. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of a cancer diagnosis on the risk of suicide, accounting for prediagnosis psychiatric care utilization. Methods All adult residents of Ontario, Canada who were diagnosed with cancer (1 of prostate, breast, colorectal, melanoma, lung, bladder, endometrial, thyroid, kidney, or oral cancer) between 1997 and 2014 were identified. Noncancer controls were matched 4:1 based on sociodemographics, including a psychiatric utilization gradient (PUG) score (with 0 indicating none; 1, outpatient; 2, emergency department; and 3, hospital admission). A marginal, cause-specific hazard model was used to assess the effect of cancer on the risk of suicidal death. Results Among 676,470 patients with cancer and 2,152,682 matched noncancer controls, there were 8.2 and 11.4 suicides per 1000 person-years of follow-up, respectively. Patients with cancer had an overall higher risk of suicidal death compared with matched patients without cancer (hazard ratio, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.22-1.48). This effect was pronounced in the first 50 months after cancer diagnosis (hazard ratio, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.42-1.81); patients with cancer did not demonstrate an increased risk thereafter. Among individuals with a PUG score 0 or 1, those with cancer were significantly more likely to die of suicide compared with controls. There was no difference in suicide risk between patients with cancer and controls for those who had a PUG score of 2 or 3. Conclusions A cancer diagnosis is associated with increased risk of death from suicide compared with the general population even after accounting for precancer diagnosis psychiatric care utilization. The specific factors underlying the observed associations remain to be elucidated.

AB Although there has been an increase in public health campaigns and initiatives aimed at preventing suicidal behaviors, suicide rates in Canada appear to be increasing particularly among young adults. Yet, few studies in Canada have examined the effect of suicidal ideation on unmet mental health needs among young adults. The objective of this study is to examine the association between suicidal ideation and unmet mental health needs, over and above predisposing, enabling, and need factors. This study uses data on 3393 young adults aged 20-29 years from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health (CCHS-MH). Binary logistic regression analysis was conducted with unmet mental health needs as the outcome variable and suicidal ideation as the main explanatory variable. Of the 3393 respondents, 8.8% had unmet mental health needs and 16.5% had suicidal ideation. In the multivariate logistic regression model, respondents who experienced suicidal ideation had 2.55 times higher odds of having unmet mental health needs. Respondents were also more likely to have unmet mental health needs if they are female, experienced childhood adversity, or were diagnosed with mental health disorders or cannabis abuse or dependence. Each additional unit increase in social support decreased the odds of unmet mental health needs by 11%. Community peer support programs for young adults may be beneficial in enhancing access to mental health particularly for at-risk individuals.

AB Every four years, partisan Americans threaten to migrate to Canada (or some other country) if their preferred candidate loses the Presidential election. This phenomenon has yet to undergo an empirical test. In the present experiment, 308 Obama voters and 142 Romney voters following the 2012 election responded to one of two writing prompts that led them to think about how the United States was becoming more liberal or conservative. Regardless of the writing prompt condition, Romney voters endorsed migration expressions more than Obama voters. Furthermore, Romney voters, compared to Obama voters, expressed a reduced sense of belonging in the United States. The relationship between voting for Romney and migration expressions was fully mediated by sense of belonging. Together, these findings support the ideological migration hypothesis and suggest that threatening to move to Canada following an undesirable election outcome may be driven by voters' belonging needs.

AB OBJECTIVES: Mental health and substance use have been identified as health priorities currently facing Indigenous peoples in Canada; however, accessible and culturally relevant population health data for this group are almost non-existent. The aim of the Our Health Counts study was to generate First Nations adult population health data in partnership with the De dwa da dehs ney> s Aboriginal Health Access Centre in Hamilton, Ontario.
   METHODS: Analysis involved data gathered through respondent-driven sampling. Prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals were generated for diagnosis and treatment of a psychological disorder or mental illness, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicide, alcohol and substance use, and access to emotional support.
   RESULTS: Of the 554 First Nations adults who participated in the Our Health Counts study in Hamilton, 42% had been told by a health care worker that they had a psychological and/or mental health disorder. High rates of depression (39%) and PTSD (34%), as well as suicide ideation (41%) and attempts (51%) were reported. Half of the sample reported marijuana use in the previous 12 months, and 19% reported the use of cocaine and opiates.
   CONCLUSION: First Nations adults living in Hamilton experience a disproportionate burden of mental health and addictions. By working in partnership with urban Aboriginal organizations, it is possible to produce policy-and service-relevant data and address the current deficiency in appropriate mental health and substance use services for urban Aboriginal people.

   STATES; MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS; METROPOLITAN-AREAS
AB Objectives: Evidence of the association between income inequality and mortality for small rather than large areas is conflicting. This study evaluated community-level income inequality in relation to age- and cause-specific mortality.
   Study design: Ecological analysis.
   Methods: Mortality data were extracted from the Quebec, Canada registry for 1999-2003. For Quebec communities (n = 143), directly standardized mortality rates were calculated for all-cause (overall, working-age and post-working-age), suicide, alcohol, tobacco and cardiovascular mortality. Using 2001 Canada Census data, the tertiles of income inequality measured as the decile ratio, coefficient of variation and median share were calculated. The relative risk (RR) of death was determined using Poisson regression, accounting for median community income, family structure and rural-urban area.
   Results: Income inequality was most strongly associated with alcohol-related mortality (RP(CoefficientVariation) 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.77-0.94), followed by statistically significant but weaker inverse associations with tobacco-related and age-specific all-cause mortality.
   Conclusions: Income inequality in Quebec communities is inversely associated with mortality outcomes, particularly alcohol-related mortality. These associations contrast with positive or null associations observed in studies of larger US and Canadian metropolitan areas, respectively. Community-level studies accounting for individual-level covariates are necessary to clarify the relationship between income inequality and mortality. (C) 2009 The Royal Society for Public Health.

TI DEATH DASHLEY SMITH: BETWEEN BIO-POLITICAL CAREER AND JUDICIAL
   SOVEREIGNTY
SO SOCIETES
LA French
DT Article
DE Correctional Service of Canada; Ashley Smith; biopolitics; judicial
   sovereignty; neoliberalism
AB This essay offers a critical rhetorical reading of the death of Ashley Smith, a young woman who died of positional asphyxia when she tied a ligature around her neck while held in solitary confinement. Smith's death was ruled a homicide by the jury in the Coroner's Inquest and subsequently figured as a suicide in the Correctional Service of Canada's published Response to the Inquest one year later. The equivocation over the precise cause of her death calls into question the responsible agency - or agencies - that killed, whether directly or through systemic negligence. Drawing on Foucault's theoretico-historical distinction between sovereign power and biopolitics, the authors argue that Smith's death is a biopolitical effect of neoliberal correctional institutions. There is a ruse, however, in the way the Correctional Service of Canada evades responsibility: it invokes a sovereign juridical prerogative over the lives placed in its care in an effort to cover over its biopolitical operations.

AB The number of prison inmates is predicted to rise in Canada, as is concern about those among them with mental illness. This article is a selective literature review of the epidemiology of serious mental illness (SMI) in prisons and how people with SMI respond to imprisonment. We review the required service components with a particular focus on care models for people with SMI in the Canadian correctional system. An estimated 15 to 20 percent of prison inmates have SMI, and this proportion may be increasing. The rate of incarceration of aboriginal people is rising. Although treatment in prison is effective, it is often unavailable or refused. Many of those with SMI are lost to follow-up within months of re-entering the community. There is much policy and service development aimed at improving services in Canada. However, the multijurisdictional organization of health care and the heterogeneity of the SMI population complicate these developments.

AB Background: The study of seasonal patterns of public interest in psychiatric disorders has important theoretical and practical implications for service planning and delivery. The recent explosion of internet searches suggests that mining search databases yields unique information on public interest in mental health disorders, which is a significantly more affordable approach than population health studies.
   Objective: This study aimed to investigate seasonal patterns of internet mental health queries in Ontario, Canada.
   Methods: Weekly data on health queries in Ontario from Google Trends were downloaded for a 5-year period (2012-2017) for the terms "schizophrenia," "autism," "bipolar," "depression," "anxiety," "OCD" (obsessive-compulsive disorder), and "suicide." Control terms were overall search results for the terms "health" and "how." Time-series analyses using a continuous wavelet transform were performed to isolate seasonal components in the search volume for each term.
   Results: All mental health queries showed significant seasonal patterns with peak periodicity occurring over the winter months and troughs occurring during summer, except for "suicide." The comparison term "health" also exhibited seasonal periodicity, while the term "how" did not, indicating that general information seeking may not follow a seasonal trend in the way that mental health information seeking does.
   Conclusions: Seasonal patterns of internet search volume in a wide range of mental health terms were observed, with the exception of "suicide." Our study demonstrates that monitoring internet search trends is an affordable, instantaneous, and naturalistic method to sample public interest in large populations and inform health policy planners.

AB Background: The rate of completed suicide among Inuit in Canada has been alarmingly high in recent years, and the suicide rate among Inuit in northern Quebec has increased since 1982. Our objectives were to describe the characteristics of Inuit people who died by suicide in Nunavik between 1982 and 1996, and to identify the antecedents and correlates of completed suicide.
   Methods: We carried out a case-control study of 71 people who died by suicide between 1982 and 1996 and 71 population-based living control subjects matched for sex, community of residence and age within 1 year. Comprehensive medical charts were reviewed for data on sociodemographic characteristics, medical and psychiatric history, childhood separations and family history, and use of health care services.
   Results: Most of the case subjects were single males aged 15 to 24 years. The two principal means of suicide were hanging (in 39 cases [54.9%]) and gunshot (in 21 cases [29.6%]). About 33% had been in contact with medical personnel in the month before their death. The case subjects were significantly more likely than the control subjects to have received a lifetime psychiatric diagnosis (one or more of depression, personality disorder or conduct disorder) (odds ratio [ORI 4.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-15.2]) and to have had a history of psychiatric symptoms, disorder (including solvent sniffing) or treatment (OR 3.5 [95% CI 1.4-8.7]). The case subjects had experienced more severe types of nonpsychiatric illnesses and injuries than the control subjects (p = 0.04). The case subjects had more lifetime contacts with health care services than the control subjects (p = 0.01) and were more likely than the control subjects to have had contact with health care services in the year before death of the case subject (p = 0.03), even when psychiatric diagnoses were controlled for in conditional regression analysis (OR 1.02 [95% CI 1.01-1.04] and 5.0 [95% CI 1.07-23.7] respectively).
   Interpretation: Since case subjects had frequent contact with health care services, frontline medical personnel may be in a position to identify people at risk for suicide.

AB Background. The project, Injury in British Columbia's Aboriginal Communities: Building Capacity while Developing Knowledge, funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), aims to expand knowledge on injury rates among First Nations communities in British Columbia (BC), Canada.
   Objective. The purpose is to improve understanding of community differences and to identify community-level risk and protective factors. Generally, injury incidence rates in the Aboriginal population in Canada greatly exceed those found in the non-Aboriginal population; however, variability exists between Aboriginal communities, which have important implications for prevention.
   Design. This study uses administrative records of deaths, hospitalizations, ambulatory care episodes, and workers' compensation claims due to injuries to identify communities that have been especially successful in maintaining low rates of injury.
   Results. The analysis of risk and protective factors extends the work of Chandler and Lalonde who observed that community efforts to preserve and promote Aboriginal culture and to maintain local control over community life are strongly associated with lower suicide rates.
   Conclusion. The discussion on psychological and cultural considerations on healing and reducing the rates of injury expands the work of McCormick on substance use in Aboriginal communities.

ID ASSISTED SUICIDE
AB Euthanasia was decriminalized in Quebec in December 2015, and Canada-wide in June 2016. Both the Provincial and Federal legislation have limited the right to medical assistance in dying (MAID) to end-of-life cases; which makes MAID inaccessible to most patients solely suffering from psychiatric illness. While some end-stage anorexia nervosa or elderly patients may meet the end-of-life criterion because of their medical comorbidities or their age (Kelly et al., 2003), repeated suicide attempts or psychotic disorganization would not qualify since they would not be seen as elements of an illness leading to a foreseeable "natural death" (Canada, 2016). This is in contradiction to other jurisdictions, such as Belgium and the Netherlands as well as the eligibility criteria stated in the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Carter v. Canada (Supreme Court of Canada, 2015). Here we analyze three cases of patients who presented to a psychiatric emergency department and requested MAID for psychiatric reasons. While none of the patients were eligible for MAID under Canadian law, we find that their demographics match closely that of patients granted MAID for psychiatric reasons in jurisdictions where that practice is allowed. Based on these cases, we comment on potentially negative consequences that may come from decriminalizing MAID for psychiatric reasons (such as an increased assessment burden on ED staff) and potentially positive consequences (such as encouraging suffering patients who had not consulted to seek care). While it is by no means our intention to take a political or moral stand on this important issue, or to conclusively weigh the negatives and positives of allowing MAID for psychiatric reasons, we do stress the importance of an active voice for psychiatry in this ongoing public debate.

AB The legalization of medical assistance in dying (MAID) in Canada has presented an opportunity for physicians, policy makers, and patients to rethink end-of-life care. This article reviews the key features of the Alberta MAID framework and puts it in the context of other provinces and their MAID programs. We also compared policies and MAID practices in different provinces/territories of Canada. In addition, we used the Alberta MAID database to provide the current state of patient demographics and access to MAID services in Alberta in 2017-2018. Significant differences were identified between provincial/territorial MAID program processes and practices. Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec have more comprehensive frameworks. Alberta has dedicated resources to the support of MAID. The median age of those who received MAID service in Alberta from July 2017 to April 2018 was 70 years; a higher proportion were males (55%) and the majority included patients with a cancer diagnosis (70%). Approximately 39 per cent of MAID events happened in a hospital setting, and 38 per cent occurred in patients' homes. We have presented some recommendations on MAID program development, implementation, and review based on Alberta's experience with MAID over the past two years.

AB Objective: Prior year medical care was compared among youth dying by suicide to their peers. Effect modification of these associations by age or place of residency (rural versus larger community sizes) was examined in a large, medically insured population.
   Method: This population-based case control study used data from the Office of the Chief Coroner in Ontario, Canada, linked to health care administrative data to examine associations between medical care for mental health or other reasons (versus no medical care) and suicide. Decedents (n = 1203 males and n = 454 females) were youth (aged 10 to 25 years) who died by suicide in Ontario between April 2003 and March 2014, inclusive. Peers of the same ages were frequency matched to decedents on sex and place of residency. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals and to test effect modification.
   Results: Associations with mental health care were stronger in decedents than peers with a gradation of care (i.e., outpatient only, emergency department [ED], inpatient care) in both sexes. However, these associations were weaker among youth living in rural communities. Furthermore, older males (aged 18 to 25 years) were less likely than younger males (aged 10 to 17 years) to access the ED (ambulatory care only). This decrease was observed in rural and larger communities alongside no increase in medical care for other reasons.
   Conclusions: Geographical and age-related barriers to mental health care exist for youth who die by suicide. Preventive efforts can address these barriers, intervening early and integrating services, including the ED.
   Objectif: Les soins medicaux de l'annee precedente ont ete compares chez les jeunes decedes par suicide avec ceux de leurs pairs. La modification de l'effet de ces associations par age ou lieu de residence (taille de la communaute rurale par opposition a plus grande) a ete examinee dans une vaste population.
   Methode: Cette etude cas temoins dans la population a utilise des donnees du Bureau du coroner en chef de l'Ontario, Canada, couplees avec les donnees de sante administratives afin d'examiner les associations entre les soins medicaux pour la sante mentale ou d'autres raisons (par opposition a des soins non medicaux) et le suicide. Les defunts (n = 1203 hommes et n = 454 femmes) etaient des jeunes (de 10 a 25 ans) qui sont decedes par suicide en Ontario entre avril 2003 et mars 2014, inclusivement. Les pairs du meme age ont ete frequemment apparies aux defunts selon l'age et le lieu de residence. La regression logistique a servi a calculer les rapports de cotes (RC) et les intervalles de confiance a 95% et a verifier la modification de l'effet.
   Resultats: Les associations avec les soins de sante mentale etaient plus fortes chez les defunts que les pairs avec une gradation des soins (c.-a-d., patient ambulatoire seulement, service d'urgence [SU], soins d'hospitalisation) chez les deux sexes. Toutefois, ces associations etaient plus faibles chez les jeunes habitant des communautes rurales. En outre, les hommes plus ages (de 18 a 25 ans) etaient plus susceptibles que les plus jeunes (de 10 a 17 ans) d'acceder au SU (soins ambulatoires seulement). Cette diminution a ete observee dans les communautes rurales et d'autres plus grandes en meme temps qu'aucune augmentation des soins medicaux pour d'autres raisons.
   Conclusions: Il existe des obstacles geographiques et lies a l'age aux soins de sante mentale pour les jeunes qui decedent par suicide. Des initiatives de prevention peuvent faire en sorte d'eliminer ces obstacles, en intervenant tot et en integrant les services, y compris le SU.

AB Objective:
   The aim of this systematic review was to provide a picture of suicidality (suicide ideation and behavior, both fatal and nonfatal) among indviduals with migraine.
   Background:
   Migraine is a leading cause of disability around the world. Migraine may manifest with a number of symptoms, ranging from severe headaches to neurological sensory disturbances. Comorbid psychological conditions, such as depression, have also been linked to chronic migraine.
   Data Sources:
   Articles were retrieved from SCOPUS, PubMed, Proquest, and Web of Science.
   Search Terms:
   Suicid* AND migrain* in English-language peer-reviewed journals between January 1, 1966 and December 31, 2014.
   Eligibility Criteria:
   Original research papers providing empirical evidence about the potential link between migraine and suicidal behaviors.
   Results:
   Initial search identified 510 papers; the titles and abstracts of 360 unique results were examined for their relevance to the combination of migraine and suicidality. In total, 17 papers reporting original empirical analyses were included in this review.
   Conclusions:
   Research has empirically documented a link between migraine and suicide ideation and behavior, particularly concerning the subtype of migraine with aura. Overall, nonfatal suicidal behavior among people with migraine has primarily been investigated, with only 2 studies analyzing suicide mortality. In addition, majority of studies originated from the United States or Canada (n=10). Future research should thoroughly define migraine and investigate link between migraine and suicide mortality.

DT Article

ID NONFATAL SELF-HARM
AB Objective: In Canada, emergency departments (EDs) are a frontline setting for treating suicide-related behaviours (SRBs) among adolescents, yet description of national trends in ED SRB visits is lacking. We determined whether the SRB incidence rate and method patterns between 2002 and 2010 previously shown for Ontario adolescents were also experienced in Alberta.
   Method: A retrospective, population-based study of ED visits for SRBs (self-poisoning or self-injury, irrespective of suicidal intent) by 12- to 17-year-olds was conducted using administrative health care data from 104 EDs across Alberta, Canada. Incidence rates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and graphed. Rate ratios (RRs) comparing rates between time periods (2002-2005 and 2006-2010) and corresponding 95% CIs were estimated. Changes in SRB methods were also described. The time periods chosen were based on published Ontario trends.
   Results: Decreases in yearly incidence rates levelled off after 2005. Crude RRs indicated a rate decrease in 2006 to 2010 for boys (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.90) and girls (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.95). From 2002 to 2010, the proportion of SRB visits for self-poisoning decreased (girls, -13%; boys, -10%) while visits for self-cutting increased (girls, +13%; boys, +14%).
   Conclusions: Alberta trends were similar to those previously published for Ontario. Determining if the trends and observed changes are associated with mental health care access or availability and/or provincial suicide prevention strategies would contextualize these findings and could shape future prevention efforts. Lack of identification of suicidal intent and exclusion of fatal SRB are limitations of the current study.

AB Variability in mood swings is a characteristic of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and is associated with suicidal behavior. This study investigated patterns of mood variability and whether such patterns could be predicted from demographic and suicide-related psychological risk factors. Eighty-two adults with BPD and histories of recurrent suicidal behavior were recruited from 3 outpatient psychiatric programs in Canada. Experience sampling methodology (ESM) was used to assess negative mood intensity ratings on a visual analogue scale, 6 random times daily, for 21 days. Three-level models estimated variability between times (52.8%), days (22.2%), and patients (25.1%) and supported a quadratic pattern of daily mood variability. Depression scores predicted variability between patients' initial rating of the day. Average daily mood patterns depended on levels of hopelessness, suicide ideation, and sexual abuse history. Patients reporting moderate to severe sexual abuse and elevated suicide ideation were characterized by worsening moods from early morning up through evening, with little or no relief; patients reporting mild sexual abuse and low suicide ideation reported improved mood throughout the day. These patterns, if replicated in larger ESM studies, may potentially assist the clinician in determining which patients require close monitoring.

AB Context. Medical assistance in dying (MAiD) allows a practitioner to administer or prescribe medication for the purpose of ending a patient's life. In 2016, Canada was the latest country, following several European countries and American states, to legalize physician-assisted death. Although some studies report on physicians' attitudes toward MAiD or describe patient characteristics, there are few studies that explore the professional challenges faced by physicians who provide MAiD.
   Objectives. The objective of the study was to explore the professional challenges faced by Canadian physicians who provide MAiD.
   Methods. Sixteen physicians from across Canada who provide MAiD completed in-depth, semistructured telephone interviews. An inductive thematic analysis approach guided data collection and the iterative, interpretive analysis of interview transcripts. Three members of the research team systematically co-coded interview transcripts, and the emerging themes were developed with the broader research team. NVivo was used to manage the coded data.
   Results. Participants described three challenges associated with providing MAiD: 1) their relationships with other MAiD providers were enhanced and relationships with objecting colleagues were sometimes strained; 2) they received inadequate financial compensation for time, and 3) they experienced increased workload, resulting in sacrifices to personal time. Although these providers did not intend to stop providing MAiD at the time of the interview, they indicated their concerns about whether they would be able to sustain this service over time.
   Conclusion. Physicians described relationship, financial, and workload challenges to providing MAiD. We provide several recommendations to address these challenges and help ensure the sustainability of MAiD in countries that provide this service. (C) 2018 The Authors.

TI Assessment of police calls for suicidal behavior in a concentrated urban

SO PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES
LA English
DT Article
AB As a result of deinstitutionalization over the past half-century, police have become frontline mental health care workers. This study assessed five-year patterns of police calls for suicidal behavior in Toronto, Canada. Police responded to an average of 1,422 calls for suicidal behavior per year, 15 percent of which involved completed suicides (24 percent of male callers and 8 percent of female callers). Calls for suicidal behavior increased by 4 percent among males and 17 percent among females over the study period. The rate of completed suicides decreased by 22 percent among males and 31 percent among females. Compared with women, men were more likely to die from physical (as opposed to chemical) methods (22 percent and 43 percent, respectively). The study results highlight the importance of understanding changes in patterns and types of suicidal behavior to police training and preparedness.

AB In the past decade, there have been many structural changes implemented to Vancouver's largest bridges as a means of deterring criminogenic and suicidal behaviors. Guided by an environmental criminology theoretical framework, this research examines the patterns and trends of 201 cases of successful suicide jumping in the Metro Vancouver Regional District (MVRD) of British Columbia, Canada from 2006 to 2014. To evaluate these trends and to bolster the existing literature on deterrence measures through environmental design, this research will examine the spatial relationship between preferential bridge jumping locations and the home addresses of the deceased. Network analysis of 145 bridge jumpers suggests that suicidal people are willing to travel greater distances to jump from more iconic bridges than those closest to their home. Beyond mere aesthetic or practical functions, symbolic significance may impact which bridges become suicide hotspots over other convenient locations. Dwelling types, demographic profiles, and regional prevalence in the MVRD have also been aggregated and explored in this study. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine.

TI True and simulated homicidal hangings: a six-year retrospective study
SO MEDICINE SCIENCE AND THE LAW
LA English
DT Article
ID ASPHYXIAL DEATHS; SUICIDE; LESIONS
AB The manner of death in hangings is virtually always suicide. Uncommonly, accidental hangings do also occur. Homicidal hangings, however, are generally thought to be highly unusual. Despite some case reports of homicidal hangings, retrospective studies have demonstrated that homicidal hangings are virtually non-existent. The present study was undertaken retrospectively to evaluate the incidence of true and simulated homicidal hangings in the forensic population of Quebec (Canada) during a six-year study period. In a total of 251 cases of hanging, suicide was the leading manner of death (239 cases); the remaining cases were accidents (eight cases) and homicides (four cases). This unusually high homicidal hanging rate in Quebec (1.6%) is hard to explain. It could be attributed to an intrinsic particularity of the population and culture. It could also be that our forensic team shares a strong interest in asphyxial deaths as a research topic and, therefore, is particularly alert in detecting such homicides. Nevertheless, this relatively higher homicidal rate may be a reminder that homicidal hangings do sometimes occur. This study emphasises the importance of not disregarding this manner of death in hangings.

AB Context: Intentional overdose is a leading method of self-harm and suicide, and repeat attempts strongly predict eventual death by suicide.Objectives: To determine the risk of recurrence after a first intentional overdose. Secondary objectives included characterization of the temporal course and potential predictors of repeat overdose, a strong risk factor for death from suicide.Methods: Design: Population-based cohort study.Setting: Ontario, Canada, from 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2013.Participants: All Ontario residents presenting to an emergency department after a first intentional overdose.Main outcome measures: The incidence and timing of recurrent overdose.Results: We followed 81,675 patients discharged from hospital after a first intentional overdose. Overall, 13,903 (17.0%) returned with a repeat overdose after a median interval of 288 (inter-quartile range: 62 to 834) days. Of these, 4493 (5.5%) had multiple repeat episodes. Factors associated with repeat self-poisoning included psychiatric care in the preceding year (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.50 to 1.61), alcohol dependence (aHR 1.41; 95% CI 1.35 to 1.46) and documented depression (aHR 1.39; 95% CI 1.34 to 1.44). Female sex, rural residence, lower socioeconomic status, ingestion of psychoactive drugs and younger age were also weakly associated with repeat overdose.Discussion: Hospital presentation for repetition of intentional overdose is common, with recurrent episodes often far removed from the first. While several factors predict overdose repetition, none is particularly strong.Conclusion: Secondary prevention initiatives should be implemented for all individuals who present to the emergency department and survive intentional overdose.

DE adolescent; suicide; health risk behaviours; Canada
ID VIOLENCE
AB Objective: To examine associations between health risk behaviours and suicidal ideation and attempts in Canadian adolescents aged 12 to 13 years. Young adolescents think about and attempt suicide. However, most existing research on suicide has been conducted on individuals aged 15 years and older.
   Method: The present study examined a nationally representative Canadian sample of adolescents aged 12 to 13 years (n = 2090). Health risk behaviours included disruptive (shoplifting, physical fighting, damaging property, fighting with a weapon, carrying a knife, and gambling), sexual (petting below the waist and sexual intercourse), and substance use behaviours (smoking cigarettes, consuming alcohol, marijuana or hash, and glue or solvents). Unadjusted and adjusted (for all significant health risk behaviour and psychiatric symptoms) models were tested.
   Results: All health risk behaviours were common among male and female adolescents. In unadjusted models, almost all health risk behaviours were associated with suicidal ideation and attempts among adolescent boys. In adjusted models, only damaging property, sexual intercourse, and smoking cigarettes remained statistically associated with suicidal ideation, while smoking cigarettes and using marijuana or hash remained statistically associated with suicide attempts among adolescent boys. All health risk behaviours were statistically associated with suicidal ideation and attempts among female adolescents in unadjusted models. In adjusted models, only carrying a knife remained statistically associated with suicidal ideation, while shoplifting and gambling remained statistically associated with suicide attempts among adolescent girls.
   Conclusions: Health risk behaviours among young adolescents are associated with suicidal ideation and attempts among young adolescents. Recognizing health risk behaviours among young adolescents may be one means of understanding who among them is at increased risk of suicidality.

ID DEATH; PREVENTION; VALIDITY; AUTOPSY; IMPACT
AB Objective: We sought to determine the utility of health administrative databases for population-based suicide surveillance, as these data are generally more accessible and more integrated with other data sources compared to coroners' records.
   Method: In this retrospective validation study, we identified all coroner-confirmed suicides between 2003 and 2012 in Ontario residents aged 21 and over and linked this information to Statistics Canada's vital statistics data set. We examined the overlap between the underlying cause of death field and secondary causes of death using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes for deliberate self-harm (i.e., suicide) and examined the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of misclassified records.
   Results: Among 10,153 linked deaths, there was a very high degree of overlap between records coded as deliberate self-harm in the vital statistics data set and coroner-confirmed suicides using both ICD-9 and ICD-10 definitions (96.88% and 96.84% sensitivity, respectively). This alignment steadily increased throughout the study period (from 95.9% to 98.8%). Other vital statistics diagnoses in primary fields included uncategorised signs and symptoms. Vital statistics records that were misclassified did not differ from valid records in terms of sociodemographic characteristics but were more likely to have had an unspecified place of injury on the death certificate (P < 0.001), more likely to have died at a health care facility (P < 0.001), to have had an autopsy (P = 0.002), and to have been admitted to a psychiatric hospital in the year preceding death (P = 0.03).
   Conclusions: A high degree of concordance between vital statistics and coroner classification of suicide deaths suggests that health administrative data can reliably be used to identify suicide deaths.
   Objectif : Nous avons cherche a determiner l'utilite des bases de donnees administratives de la sante pour la surveillance du suicide dans la population, car ces donnees sont generalement plus accessibles et plus integrees avec d'autres sources de donnees comparativement aux dossiers des coroners.
   Methode : Dans cette etude de validation retrospective, nous avons identifie tous les suicides confirmes par un coroner entre 2003 et 2012 chez les residents ontariens de 21 ans et plus, et lie cette information aux donnees des statistiques d'etat civil de Statistique Canada. Nous avons examine le chevauchement entre le domaine des causes de deces sous-jacentes et celui des causes secondaires de deces a l'aide des codes de la CIM-9 et de la CIM-10 pour l'automutilation deliberee (c.-a-d., le suicide), et examine les caracteristiques sociodemographiques et cliniques des dossiers mal classes.
   Resultats : Parmi les 10 153 deces lies, il y avait un degre tres eleve de chevauchement entre les dossiers codes comme etant une automutilation deliberee dans les donnees des statistiques d'etat civil et les suicides confirmes par les coroners a l'aide des definitions de la CIM-9 et de la CIM-10 (sensibilite de 96,88% et de 96,84% respectivement). Cet alignement s'est accru constamment durant la periode de l'etude (de 95,9% a 98,8%). D'autres diagnostics des statistiques d'etat civil dans des domaines principaux incluaient des signes et symptomes non categorises. Les dossiers des statistiques d'etat civil qui ont ete mal classes ne differaient pas des dossiers valides au chapitre des caracteristiques sociodemographiques, mais ils etaient plus susceptibles de contenir un endroit non specifie pour la blessure sur le certificat de deces (p < 0,001), plus susceptibles que les deces aient eu lieu dans un etablissement de sante (p < 0,001), qu'il y ait eu une autopsie (p = 0,002), et qu'il y ait eu une hospitalisation en psychiatrie dans l'annee precedant le deces (p = 0,03).
   Conclusions : Un degre eleve de concordance entre le classement des deces par suicide des statistiques d'etat civil et celui des coroners suggere que les donnees administratives de la sante peuvent etre utilisees avec confiance pour identifier les deces par suicide.

ID DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; STRESS; SUICIDE; FARMERS; INJURIES; ENGLAND;
   SATISFACTION; PREDICTORS; COMMUNITY
AB Background: Farmers experience one of the highest rates of suicide of any industry and there is growing evidence that those involved in farming are at higher risk of developing mental health problems. This article provides an overview of the literature examining mental health issues experienced by farming populations in the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States and identifies areas for further research.
   Method: A literature review (Medline, Science Direct, Ingenta, Proquest and PsychINFO) was carried out using the words 'farmers', 'agriculture', 'depression', I mental health', 'mental illness', 'stress', and 'suicide', as well as a review of relevant papers and publications known to the authors. (Papers not written in English and those published prior to 1985 were excluded.)
   Results: Fifty-two papers were identified with the majority focusing on stress and coping styles in farmers (24). A number of studies also focused on neuropsychological functioning and agricultural chemical use (7), depression (7), suicide (9), general mental health (4) and injury and mental health (1). This body of research studied male farmers, female farmers, farm workers, farming families, and young people living on farms. Research to date indicates that farmers, farm workers and their respective families face an array of stressors related to the physical environment, structure of farming families and the economic difficulties and uncertainties associated with farming which may be detrimental to their mental health.
   Conclusion: Whilst suicide rates in some groups of farmers are higher than the general population, conclusive data do not exist to indicate whether farmers and farming families experience higher rates of mental health problems compared with the non-farming community. It is clear, however, that farming is associated with a unique set of characteristics that is potentially hazardous to mental health and requires further research.

AB Over the 20th century sex differences in life expectancy in the industrialized countries have widened in favour of women. Recently, a reversal in the long-term pattern of this differential has been noted in some countries. In Canada, between 1981 and 2000, this differential narrowed by almost two years. Greater than expected improvements in male death rates with respect to heart disease, lung cancer, accidents and violence (excluding suicide) explain a large part of this phenomenon. Change in male and female smoking prevalence correlates strongly with change in sex differences in mortality from heart disease and cancer. The reasons underlying men's greater mortality improvements in regard to accidents and violence are less clear and need further investigation.

AB Our aim in this article is to provide readers with a critical overview of some of the recent research in psychology, sociology, geography and critical masculinity studies with a focus on rural places and masculinities. We begin our critical review of rural masculinities with a discussion of hegemonic masculinity, a concept well known to theorists of masculinities, before providing an overview of the literature on rural men, which leads into to a larger theoretical discussion about the nature of masculinities and rural studies. We discuss how we can operationalize these theories and answer the question, are rural Prairie masculinities hegemonic masculinities. We argue that scholars must do more to unpack the complexity and relationality of masculinities that take place across changing rural settings.

TI Association Between Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors,
   Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Suicide
SO JAMA NETWORK OPEN
LA English

ID FACTOR-KAPPA-B; SUBSTANCE-P; POLYMORPHISM; GENE; SYSTEM; DEPRESSION;
   BIPOLAR; RISK
AB IMPORTANCE The renin-angiotensin system has been implicated in mood disorders. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are among the most commonly used medications, yet their effects on mental health outcomes, particularly suicide, are poorly understood. This study examined the association between suicide and exposure to ACEIs and ARBs. Because of differences in their mode of action, it was speculated that ARBs would be associated with a higher risk of suicide than ACEIs.
   OBJECTIVE To examine the association between suicide and exposure to ARBs compared with ACEIs.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based nested case-control study of individuals aged 66 years and older used administrative claims databases in Ontario, Canada, from January 1, 1995, to December 31, 2015. Data analysis was performed from January to April 2019. Cases were individuals who died by suicide within 100 days of receiving an ACEI or ARB. The date of death served as the index date. For each case, 4 controls were identified and matched by age (within 1 year), sex, and presence of hypertension and diabetes. All individuals received an ACEI or ARB within 100 days before the index date.
   EXPOSURES Use of an ACEI or ARB.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios for the association between suicide and exposure to ARBs compared with ACEIs.
   RESULTS Nine hundred sixty-four cases were matched to 3856 controls. The median (interquartile range) age of cases and controls was 76 ( 70-82) years. Most cases (768 [79.7%]) and controls (3068 [79.6%]) were men. Among cases, 260 (26.0%) were exposed to ARBs, and 704 (18.4%) were exposed to ACEIs. Among controls, 741 (74.0%) were exposed to ARBs, and 3115 (81.6%) were exposed to ACEIs. Compared with ACEI exposure, ARB exposure was associated with higher risk of death by suicide (adjusted odds ratio, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.33-2.00). The findings were consistent in a sensitivity analysis excluding individuals with a history of self-harm (odds ratio, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.29-1.98).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The use of ARBs may be associated with an increased risk of suicide compared with ACEIs. Preferential use of ACEIs over ARBs should be considered whenever possible, particularly in patients with severe mental health illness.

AB IMPORTANCE Recent evidence indicates a high prevalence of child abuse exposure in modern US veterans, which may explain in part their higher likelihood of suicide relative to civilians. However, the relationship between child abuse exposure and suicide-related outcomes in military personnel relative to civilians is unknown. Furthermore, the associations among deployment-related trauma, child abuse exposure, and suicide-related outcomes in military personnel have not been examined.
   OBJECTIVES To determine whether child abuse exposure is more prevalent in Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) personnel compared with the Canadian general population (CGP); to compare the association between child abuse exposure and suicidal ideation, suicide plans, and suicide attempts among the CAF and CGP; and to determine whether child abuse exposure has an additive or interaction effect on the association of deployment-related trauma and past-year suicidal ideation and suicide plans among Regular Forces personnel.
   DATA, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data were collected from the following 2 nationally representative data sets: the 2013 Canadian Forces Mental Health Survey (CFMHS) for the CAF (8161 respondents; response rate, 79.8%) and the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health (CCHS-MH) for the CGP (23 395 respondents; response rate, 68.9%[of these, 15 981 age-matched participants were drawn]). Data were collected from April 15 to August 31, 2013, for the CFMHS and January 2 to December 31, 2012, for the CCHS-MH. Data were analyzed from October 2014 to October 22, 2015. Statistical weights were applied to both data sets.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Child abuse exposure, including physical abuse, sexual abuse, and exposure to intimate partner violence, and deployment-related trauma were assessed in relation to suicide-related outcomes.
   RESULTS Data were analyzed from 24 142 respondents aged 18 to 60 years (Regular Forces, 86.1% male and 13.9% female; Reserve Forces, 90.6% male and 8.9% female; and CGP, 49.9% male and 50.1% female). Any child abuse exposure was higher in the Regular Forces (47.7%; 95% CI, 46.4%-49.1%) and Afghanistan mission-deployed Reserve Forces (49.4%; 95% CI, 46.3%-51.5%) compared with the CGP (33.1%; 95% CI, 31.8%-34.4%). All types of child abuse exposures were associated with increased odds of suicidal ideation, suicide plans, and suicide attempts in the CGP (range of adjusted odds ratios [AORs], 3.0 [95% CI, 2.3-3.9] to 7.7 [95% CI, 5.7-10.3]; P<.05) and CAF (range of AORs, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.0-2.9] to 6.3 [95% CI, 4.2-9.5]; P<.05), with many associations significantly weaker in military personnel relative to civilians. Additive effects for past-year suicide ideation (AOR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.8-4.2) and past-year suicide plans (AOR, 4.6; 95% CI, 2.3-9.2) but not interactive effects for past-year suicide ideation (AOR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.7-2.2) and past-year suicide plans (AOR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.3-2.2) were noted between deployment-related trauma and child abuse exposure among Regular Forces personnel.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Individuals with a child abuse history may be more likely to enter the military, and child abuse exposure may increase the likelihood of suicide-related outcomes. Prevention efforts targeting child abuse may reduce suicide-related outcomes.

As many clinicians supported the Bill as opposed it (28%); 44% were uncertain of their stance. Most were unwilling to directly provide voluntary assisted dying; if they did, would refer to palliative care services for ongoing support.

AB Men are more likely to die of cancer, heart disease, or diabetes at younger ages than women - a reality that is compounded by the reluctance of men to use healthcare services. In addition to reduced life expectancy, men can also expect to live fewer healthy years than their female counterparts. As gynecologists and obstetricians have led the women's health movement in addressing gender-specific gaps in care, urologists are well-poised to take on a leadership role to advocate for, and address, men's health initiatives.

AB Medical assistance in dying (MAID) recently became legal in Canada, and social workers have an integral role providing psychosocial care to those considering this end-of-life care option. Research has found that most requests for assisted dying have a psychosocial dimension. Social workers are uniquely equipped to understand the personal and contextual factors informing the choice for MAID and offer supports. A case example highlights practice opportunities for social workers throughout the MAiD process.

AB Adolescent development includes solidification of personal identity, ethical beliefs, approach to the world, patterns of friendships, cognitive sophistication and sexual/gender identity. Rapid brain development accounts for many of the changes of adolescence, but this can be affected by environmental and social factors. In the US, the top 3 causes of adolescent death are unintentional injuries (often involving motor vehicles), homicide and suicide. In Canada, the top 3 are unintentional injuries (more than a third of deaths in 15-19 year olds), suicide (about a fifth of deaths) and neoplasia. This chapter does not discuss some major areas of health and determinants, including gay, lesbian and trans-gender youth, gender inequality and mental health. Issues for aboriginal youth include those of education, nutrition, housing and racism. Racism is not limited to this group and is also intertwined with the issues faced by immigrant youth. Access to high-quality education is particularly problematic in the United States. Alcohol and other substance use lead to health issues and also educational problems. Adolescent pregnancy, parenting and access to abortion are issues in both countries (more extreme in the US). Finally, the care of children by the state leads to issues in adolescence and adulthood.

AB In June 2016, Bill C-14 or Medical Assistance in Dying legislation became law in Canada. With this law came changes to nurses' (ie, nurse practitioner, registered nurse, registered practical nurse) scopes of practice, roles, and responsibilities. While federal law, regulatory, and organizational policies are developed to inform nurses about the practice of medical assistance in dying, there is little evidence examining how nurses' roles and responsibilities are enacted in practice. Therefore, a scoping review was conducted to synthesize the evidence on nurses' roles and responsibilities in relation to medical assistance in dying and to identify gaps in the literature. A secondary aim was to identify organizational supports for nurses to effectively and ethically engage in medical assistance in dying. Using a recognized and rigorous scoping review methodology, the findings from 24 research studies were synthesized in this article. The analysis highlights the importance of effective health care professional engagement with the individual in the decision-making process and of the need to educate, support, and include nurses in providing medical assistance in dying. Overall, the current research on medical assistance in dying is limited in Canada, and more attention is needed on the role of the nurse.

AB As part of a cross-national collaborative study of resilience among circumpolar youth, we examined the life experiences, stressors, and coping or resilience strategies of Inuit youth in the community of Igloolik, Nunavut, Canada. An Inuit steering committee was formed with youth, adults, and one elder. The steering committee led this project in the community, informing community members of progress and helping direct all aspects of the study from research questions to methods to data collection to dissemination. A structured interview used across sites allowed youth to describe what matters to them, that is, what is at stake for them in terms of challenges and successes. Developing stable and secure relationships with one's friends and family members enabled Inuit youth to become more resilient in the face of stresses related to social change in the Canadian Arctic.

DE American; exceptionalism; Christian right; legal mobilization
ID CHARTER; RIGHTS
AB The American exceptionalism thesis holds that American political culture produces an unusually litigious society. The us Christian right has participated in litigation, especially in constitutional rights cases dealing with issues such as religious schools and abortion. However, since 1982 Canada has had a constitutional Charter of Rights and an increasingly active Christian right of its own. We compare data on Christian right involvement in education, abortion, and "right to die" (euthanasia, assisted suicide or mercy killing) cases at the Supreme Court level in both countries. Among North America's Christian conservatives, exceptionalism has eroded, but not disappeared. We employ interviews and data on religious interest groups to analyze the sources of legal mobilization, and find that it is a matter not just of political culture, but also resource mobilization, political opportunity structures, and religious worldviews.

AB Objective: Studies from around the world point to differences in the rates of mental illnesses between immigrant, refugee, ethnocultural, and racialized (IRER) groups and host populations. Risk of illness depends on social contexts; therefore, to offer the best information for people aiming to develop and offer equitable services, local information on rates of mental illness in different population groups is required.
   Methods: We performed a literature review of peer-reviewed journals and the grey literature between 1990 and 2009 using standard techniques and identified primary research reporting the rates of mental illness and suicidality in IRER groups in Canada.
   Results: Among the 229 papers we reviewed, 17 were included. Most papers reported rates for depression. There was no clear pattern, with different IRER groups and different age groups reporting either elevated or lower rates, compared with white Canadians. Refugee youth in Quebec have higher rates of numerous mental health problems and illnesses. When immigrant groups were considered as a whole, suicide rates were low but different national origin groups reported different trajectories in rates across the generations.
   Conclusion: The literature on rates of mental illness and suicidality in IRER groups in Canada is diverse and not comprehensive. In addition, most research has been conducted in 3 provinces and, in particular, 3 major cities. The rates of mental illness seem to vary by national origin groups, age, and status in Canada. There is very little research on nonimmigrant, culturally diverse populations in Canada. This lack of information may undermine efforts to develop equitable mental health services for all Canadians.

AB Objective: To estimate the burden of mental, neurological, substance use disorders and self-harm (MNSS) in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Method: We extracted 2017 data from the Global Burden of Disease online database. Based on a previously developed framework to classify and aggregate the burden of specific disorders and symptoms, we reestimated the MNSS burden to include suicide, alcohol use, drug use, specific neurological, and painful somatic symptom disorders. We analyzed age-sex-specific patterns within and between countries. Results: The MNSS burden is the largest of all disorder groupings. It is lowest in Mexico, intermediate in Canada, and highest in the United States. Exceptions are alcohol use, bipolar, conduct disorders, and epilepsy, which are highest in Mexico; and painful somatic syndromes and headaches, which are highest in Canada. The burden of drug use disorders in the United States is twice the burden in Canada, and 7 times the burden in Mexico. MNSS become the most burdensome of all disorder groups by age 10, staying at the top until age 60, and show a distinct pattern across the lifetime. The top three MNSS disorders for men are a combination of substance use disorders and self-harm (United States), with the addition of painful somatic syndromes (Canada), and headaches (Mexico). For women, the top three are headaches and depression (all countries), drug use (United States), neurocognitive disorders (Mexico), and painful somatic syndromes (Canada). Conclusion: MNSS are the most burdensome disease grouping and should be prioritized for funding in Canada, Mexico, and the United States.

AB The United States and Canada regulate frearms, particularly handguns, quite differently. With only a few state and local exceptions, the U.S. approach emphasizes the ability of most individuals to purchase, possess, and carry handguns. By comparison, Canada has a form of restrictive licensing for handguns that places a premium on community safety. The authors first review the potential individual and community level harms and benefits associated with these differing fre-arm policies. Using this information, they explore the ethical dimensions of the U.S. and Canadian approaches through three major themes of autonomy, prevention of harms, and social justice. The authors conclude that the Canadian approach is consistent with respect for the autonomy of persons, fosters the prevention of harms, and more appropriately furthers social justice.

ID AMERICA
AB The campaign against imprisonment for debt in Upper Canada, at its peak in the 1820s and 1830s, gave new prominence to public expressions of emotion as part of a process of moral reflection. The feelings of ordinary colonists became more politically salient, as did friendship as a metaphor for the bonds created by such human sensibility. Legal reformers condemned imprisonment for debt for distorting moral reasoning and thus disrupting reciprocal social relations. This article traces how sensibility was mobilized by legal reformers and their critics in public debate, acts of charity, and narratives of suicide and death and by debtors in their own petitions. Sensibility delegitimized the principle of the law and fuelled a number of reforms, but its malleability ensured that its prescriptions were multiple, that particular emotional performances aroused suspicion of being perverse, and that existing hierarchies might be affirmed as well as challenged.

AB Death and dying are natural phenomena embedded within complex political, cultural and social systems. Nurses often practice at the forefront of this process and have a fundamental role in caring for both patients and those close to them during the process of dying and following death. While nursing has a rich tradition in advancing the palliative and end-of-life care movement, new modes of care for patients with serious and irremediable medical conditions arise when assisted death is legalized in a particular jurisdiction. In early 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada released its landmark decision Carter v. Canada (Attorney General) ('Carter'), which legalized physician-assisted suicide in particular clinical situations. The new law provided the broad national framework for Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD) in Canada but, once the law was passed, provincial and territorial governments and health professional regulatory bodies each had to undertake a process of developing policies, procedures and processes to guide MAiD-related practice specific to their jurisdiction. In this paper, we begin to examine the political ramifications and professional tensions arising from MAiD for nurses and nursing, focusing specifically upon the impacts for registered nurses. We identify how variations in the provincial and territorial literature and regulatory guidelines across Canada have given rise to role confusion and uncertainty among some registered nurses and how this may potentially impact patient care. We then continue to highlight the need for greater political activism among nurses to foster greater clarity in nursing roles in MAiD and to advocate for improved supports for patients and those close to them.

AB Canada is approaching its federal government's review of whether patients should be eligible for medical assistance in dying (MAID) where mental illness is the sole underlying medical condition, and when "natural death" is not "reasonably foreseeable". For those opposed, arguments involve the following themes: capacity, value of life, vulnerability, stigma, irremediability, and the role of physicians. It has also been suggested that those who are able-bodied should have to kill themselves, even though suicide may be painful, lonely, and violent. Opponents of MAID for severe, refractory suffering due to mental illness imply that it is acceptable to remove agency from such patients on paternalistic grounds. After years of efforts to destigmatise mental illness, these kinds of arguments effectively declare all patients with mental illness, regardless of capacity, unable to make considered choices for themselves. The current paper argues that decisions about capacity must be made on an individual-patient basis. Given the rightful importance granted to respect for patient autonomy in liberal democracies, the wholesale removal of agency advocated by opponents of a permissive MAID regime is difficult to reconcile with Canadian constitutional values.

TI MAID in Canada? Debating the Constitutionality of Canada's New Medical
   Assistance in Dying Law
SO QUEENS LAW JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Different conceptions of "the good life", as well as the "the good death", animate the longstanding and contentious debate surrounding euthanasia and assisted suicide. In Carter v Canada (Attorney General), the Supreme Court of Canada struck down Canada's blanket prohibition on medical aid in dying (MAID), but suspended its declaration of invalidity. Parliament responded by amending the Criminal Code to permit MAID in some circumstances. However, Parliament's amendment is arguably more restrictive than the vision set out in Carter, and has already been the subject of a constitutional challenge.
   In this context, this article examines Carter, the legislative response to Carter, and the debates surrounding the new MAID law, including the challenge to the new law in Lamb v Canada (Attorney General). The author aims to advance understanding of the ways in which interpretations and theories of Canadian constitutional law relate to arguments over the role law can, or should, play in governing MAID. The author distinguishes three major points of disagreement arising from the debate surrounding the new MAID law's constitutionality: the interpretation of the Court's decision in Carter; competing accounts of interpretative authority in constitutional theory; and the role that criminal law should play in governing medical assistance in dying. Examining their relationship, the author seeks to identify broader lessons that can be used when framing debates in Canadian constitutional interpretation. Specifically, the author argues that the debate over Carter raises questions not just about how the normative filter function of Canadian constitutional law operates, but also the question of who gets to operate it. While Carter may showcase the agency of the courts, equally at issue in the debate over the constitutionality of the new MAID legislation is the role and authority of Parliament.

AB Objective: To examine health services, social services, education, and justice system outcomes among First Nations children and youth with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, health and social services, education, and justice data were linked with clinical records on First Nations (FN) individuals aged 1 to 25 and diagnosed with FASD between 1999 and 2010 (n = 743). We compared the FN FASD group to non-FN individuals with FASD (non-FN FASD; n = 315) and to First Nations individuals (matched on age, sex, and income) not diagnosed with FASD (FN non-FASD; n = 2229). Rates and relative risks (RRs) were calculated using generalized linear models. Results: FN FASD individuals had similar health services use to non-FN FASD individuals but had greater involvement with child welfare (RR, 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.41) and the justice system (RR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.74) and were more likely to be charged with a crime (RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.86). There were no suicides/suicide attempts among the non-FN FASD individuals during the study, but the crude rate/100 person-years of suicides among FN FASD individuals (0.22 for females; 1.06 for males) was substantially higher than for FN non-FASD individuals (0.08 for females; 0.32 for males). There were no significant differences between groups in the education outcomes we measured. Conclusions: Young people with FASD are at risk for poor health, education, and social outcomes, but First Nations young people with FASD face comparably higher risks, particularly with child welfare and justice system involvement. The study emphasizes a critical need for appropriate resources for First Nations children with FASD.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a complex issue that poses a risk to offenders and staff in all correctional jurisdictions and understanding of this behaviour in adult male offenders is limited. One hundred and four federally sentenced men in Canada participated in semi-structured interviews that were designed to assess their history of NSSI. Interview questions centered on mental health and history of abuse, suicide attempts, and non-suicidal self-injury, including whether the behaviour occurred before or after admission to a correctional facility. Coping was the most common reason provided for engaging in self-injury. The second most frequently reported reason was instrumental reasons, which involved using NSSI to exert control or obtain external rewards. Among a subset of men who first initiated NSSI in a Canadian federal institution, institutional-specific interpersonal influence was the most frequent motivation. The emotions most commonly reported by the men prior to engaging in NSSI were anger and frustration, and the emotions most commonly reported following NSSI were relief, followed by regret. Given that the motivations for NSSI and the emotions experienced by the individual can vary considerably, interventions should consider these motivations and emotions.

AB This study examined which factors predict future suicide attempts (SAs) among people referred to psychiatric services in the emergency department (ED). It included consecutive adult (age > 18 years) presentations (N = 6919) over a 3-year period to the two tertiary care hospitals in Manitoba, Canada. Medical professionals assessed each individual on 19 candidate risk factors. Stepwise logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curves examined the association between the baseline variables and future SAs within the next 6 months. A total of 104 individuals re-presented to the ED with future SAs. Of the 19 baseline variables, only two independently accounted for the variance in future attempts. High-risk scores using this two-item model were associated with elevated odds of future SA (odds ratio, 3.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.62-6.42; p < 0.01), but this was tempered by a low positive predictive value. Further evaluation is required to determine if this two-item tool could help identify people requiring more comprehensive risk assessment referred to psychiatry in the ED.

AB Objective: To examine associations of cannabis and other illicit drug use with depression, suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts over a two year period during adolescence.
   Methods: Nine hundred and seventy-six school students in four high schools in northern Nova Scotia, Canada, were surveyed in grade 10 and followed up in grade 12. Assessments of past 30 day cannabis and illicit drug use as well as mental health variables (risk of depression, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts) were obtained at baseline (2000 and 2001) and follow-up two years later (2002 and 2003). Generalized estimating-equations modelled depression, suicidal ideation and attempts among illicit drug users and non-users.
   Results: Illicit drug use with or without cannabis use was significantly associated with higher odds of depression, suicidal ideation and suicide attempt. Heavy cannabis use alone predicted depression but not suicidal ideation or attempt.
   Conclusions: Illicit drug use, with and without accompanying cannabis use, among high school students increases the risk of depression, suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts. Heavy cannabis use alone predicts depression but not suicidal ideation or attempts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rationale: Recent studies have highlighted higher rates of suicidal ideation and behaviour and associated themes of gender role stress in Chinese women residing in North America. However, qualitative studies, which privilege their voices in the discourse of suicide prevention and provide insight into their experiences, are lacking.
   Objective: To gain an understanding of the life histories, patterns of distress and constructions of suicide of Chinese-Canadian women with a history of suicidal behaviour.
   Methods: Ten women were recruited from four mental health programs in Toronto, Canada and participated in qualitative interviewing and analysis informed by constructivist grounded theory.
   Results: Chinese-Canadian women describe experiencing "stress" or "pressure" leading to the exacerbation of depressive symptoms. Stress and pressure are managed through a coping strategy of endurance, informed by the cultural conception of "ren". Cultural influences contribute to the manifestation of stress and pressure as somatic symptoms and sleeplessness. Finally, the women describe feeling unable to endure through worsening distress, reaching a "breaking point"; suicidal behaviour is constructed as a strategy to disrupt this cycle.
   Conclusion: This study challenges the binary notion that suicidal behaviour is either a consequence of mental illness or a reaction to interpersonal stress. Rather, the women describe an ingrained pattern of enduring through psychosocial problems without acknowledging worsening anxiety, depressive and physical symptoms. The pattern of endurance also prevents early treatment of these difficulties, resulting in the intensification of symptoms until a breaking point is reached. Knowledge of these patterns and coping strategies can allow for earlier identification and intervention for women at risk to prevent the worsening of distress leading to suicidal thoughts and behaviour.

TI Variation in the Risk of Suicide Attempts and Completed Suicides by

AB Context: A US Food and Drug Administration advisory has warned that antidepressants may be associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescents. This prompted a meta-analysis of trials in adults that found no overall increase in risk, but individual agents could not be studied.
   Objective: To assess the risk of suicide and suicide attempts associated with individual antidepressant agents.
   Design: Cohort study of incident users of antidepressant agents.
   Setting: Population-based health care utilization data of all residents of British Columbia, Canada, aged 18 years and older between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2005.
   Patients: British Columbia residents who had antidepressant therapy initiated and had a recorded diagnosis of depression.
   Intervention: Initiation of various antidepressant medications.
   Main Outcome Measures: Combined suicide death or hospitalization due to self-harm.
   Results: In a population of 287 543 adults aged 18 years and older with antidepressant therapy initiated, we ob-served outcome rates ranging from 4.41/1000 person-years to 9.09/1000 person-years. Most events occurred in the first 6 months after treatment initiation. After extensive propensity score adjustment, we found no clinically meaningful variation in the risk of suicide and suicide attempt between antidepressant agents compared with fluoxetine hydrochloride initiation: citalopram hydrobromide, hazard ratio=1.00 (95% confidence interval, 0.63-1.57); fluvoxamine maleate, hazard ratio=0.98 (95% confidence interval, 0.63-1.51); paroxetine hydrochloride, hazard ratio=1.02 (95% confidence interval, 0.77-1.35); and sertraline hydrochloride, hazard ratio=0.75 (95% confidence interval, 0.53-1.05). Compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as a drug class, other classes including serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic agents, and other newer and atypical agents had a similar risk. Restriction to patients with no antidepressant use in the past 3 years further reduced apparent differences between groups.
   Conclusions: Our finding of equal event rates across antidepressant agents supports the US Food and Drug Administration's decision to treat all antidepressants alike in their advisory. Treatment decisions should be based on efficacy, and clinicians should be vigilant in monitoring after initiating therapy with any antidepressant agent.

TI Lifetime Prevalence of Suicide Attempts Among Sexual Minority Adults by
   Study Sampling Strategies: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Review
ID MENTAL-HEALTH; BISEXUAL MEN; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; RISK-FACTORS; GAY
   MEN; ORIENTATION; POPULATION; IDEATION; PARTNERS; GENDER
AB Background. Previous reviews have demonstrated a higher risk of suicide attempts for lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) persons (sexual minorities), compared with heterosexual groups, but these were restricted to general population studies, thereby excluding individuals sampled through LGB community venues. Each sampling strategy, however, has particular methodological strengths and limitations. For instance, general population probability studies have defined sampling frames but are prone to information bias associated with underreporting of LGB identities. By contrast, LGB community surveys may support disclosure of sexuality but overrepresent individuals with strong LGB community attachment.
   Objectives. To reassess the burden of suicide-related behavior among LGB adults, directly comparing estimates derived from population-versus LGB community-based samples.
   Search methods. In 2014, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and Scopus databases for articles addressing suicide-related behavior (ideation, attempts) among sexual minorities.
   Selection criteria. We selected quantitative studies of sexual minority adults conducted in nonclinical settings in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
   Data collection and analysis. Random effects meta-analysis and meta-regression assessed for a difference in prevalence of suicide-related behavior by sample type, adjusted for study or sample-level variables, including context (year, country), methods (medium, response rate), and subgroup characteristics (age, gender, sexual minority construct). We examined residual heterogeneity by using tau(2).
   Main results. We pooled 30 cross-sectional studies, including 21 201 sexual minority adults, generating the following lifetime prevalence estimates of suicide attempts: 4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3%, 5%) for heterosexual respondents to population surveys, 11% (95% CI = 8%, 15%) for LGB respondents to population surveys, and 20% (95% CI = 18%, 22%) for LGB respondents to community surveys (Figure 1). The difference in LGB estimates by sample type persisted after we accounted for covariates with meta-regression. Sample type explained 33% of the between-study variability.
   Author's conclusions. Regardless of sample type examined, sexual minorities had a higher lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts than heterosexual persons; however, the magnitude of this disparity was contingent upon sample type. Community-based surveys of LGB people suggest that 20% of sexual minority adults have attempted suicide.
   Public health implications. Accurate estimates of sexual minority health disparities are necessary for public health monitoring and research. Most data describing these disparities are derived from 2 sample types, which yield different estimates of the lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts. Additional studies should explore the differential effects of selection and information biases on the 2 predominant sampling approaches used to understand sexual minority health.

AB Firearm injuries are a significant and preventable cause of death in Canadian youth. Adolescent and young adult males are disproportionately affected; however, firearm-related deaths occur in youth of all ages. Canada's rate of firearm ownership is lower than that of the USA, but high compared with other upper-income countries. The availability of firearms to youth is an important factor in adolescent suicide, unintentional firearm deaths, gang homicide and school shootings. Guns should not be kept in homes or environments where children and adolescents live or play. Screening for the presence of a firearm in the home is an essential part of the safety assessment of a depressed or suicidal youth, and removal of the firearm from the home must be recommended in this situation. Legislative measures to strictly control the acquisition, transport, ownership and storage of firearms, and to reduce smuggling of firearms, are also recommended.

AB Social isolation has featured as a significant and oftentimes all-encompassing risk factor for male suicide, yet, as an explanatory mechanism, it has not been unpacked in terms of what it constitutes in everyday life. The current photovoice study explores the various dimensions of the lived experience of social isolation, as embedded in accounts of suicidality drawn from 35 Canadian men. Study participants narrated the following factors as underpinning their social isolation: (a) family dysfunction and estrangement, (b) marginality and feeling like misfits at school and work, (c) alienation and provisional acceptance of health care, (d) ineffectual and self-harming management, (e) intrusive dislocating thoughts, and (f) society's burdensome and immoral subjects. These interwoven but discrete spheres provide a means for understanding the phenomenology of social isolation and a basis for melding ideas about connectedness, relationality, personal history, and care, along with strategies to support and reduce men's suicidality.

AB To explore factors associated with recovery from suicidal ideation among Aboriginal peoples living off reserve in Canada. Recovery is defined as being free of serious suicidal thoughts for the past year. Data for this study came from the 2012 Aboriginal Peoples Survey, a nationally representative sample of Aboriginal peoples in Canada who are living off-reserve. The sample consisted of those who had seriously considered suicide at some point in their life (n = 2,680). Those who had been suicidal in the past year were compared to those who were no longer suicidal using Pearson chi-square and logistic regression analyses. Several factors were associated with recovery among Aboriginal peoples living off-reserve in Canada who had previously been suicidal. Recovery was higher among women, individuals who were older, and those who were food secure, spoke an Aboriginal language, had a high school degree, had a confidant, and had no previous diagnosis of mood disorders or learning disability. Several sociodemographic factors appear to influence recovery from suicidality among Aboriginal peoples. Intervention approaches to promote recovery from suicidal ideation would benefit from targeted outreach, a strength-based, culturally-specific approach using traditional practices, and encouraging involvement of various community members to foster resilience and formation of relationships.

AB This article traces the historical development of Canadian medicare and its significant influence on shaping not only the clinical services provided within Canada's public health care system but also its major impact on the nation's overall health research agenda. Particular emphasis is placed on how this has influenced the development and role of psychology in the public health care system. It is argued that all psychologists, whether their work is focused on the applied or experimental areas of the discipline, have much to offer Canadians across the entire health care spectrum. Nevertheless, psychological services in the public health care system, and particularly in hospitals, have mainly developed within and continue to be primarily focused around mental health. Services in non-mental health areas of health have been more limited, although their importance is well recognized. The current Situation partly reflects the limited training in general health issues that clinical psychologists-in-training generally receive in many graduate school programs in Canada. However, it also reflects the overall influence of medicare on the development of Canada's health care system. Medicare has tended to focus the activities of Canada's health care system primarily on treating illness rather than on preventing it and/or maintaining health. Also, medicare has oriented Canada's health care system mainly toward delivering medical services rather than providing more comprehensive health services (e.g., the "medically necessary" criterion for funding). However, times are changing. The growing emphasis among health policy-makers in Canada on illness prevention and health promotion (e.g., the creation of the federal government Public Health Agency of Canada in 2004) will significantly expand psychology's role across all areas of health. Psychology education and training programs are urged to seriously examine whether psychology practitioners and researchers are being adequately prepared at present for the much broader array of future interdisciplinary professional, research, and educational activities and responsibilities that will emerge.

AB Medical assistance in dying (MAiD) legislation is now over a year old in Canada, and consideration is turning to whether MAiD should be extended to include serious mental illness as the sole qualifying condition for being eligible for MAiD. This article considers this question from ethical and clinical perspectives. It argues that extending the eligibility for MAiD to include those with a serious mental illness as the sole eligibility criterion is not ethical, necessary, or supported current psychiatric practice or opinion.

AB Objective:To survey amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) health care providers to determine attitudes regarding physician-assisted death (PAD) after the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) invalidated the Criminal Code provisions that prohibit PAD in February 2015.Methods:We conducted a Canada-wide survey of physicians and allied health professionals (AHP) involved in the care of patients with ALS on their opinions regarding (1) the SCC ruling, (2) their willingness to participate in PAD, and (3) the PAD implementation process for patients with ALS.Results:We received 231 responses from ALS health care providers representing all 15 academic ALS centers in Canada, with an overall response rate for invited participants of 74%. The majority of physicians and AHP agreed with the SCC ruling and believed that patients with moderate and severe stage ALS should have access to PAD; however, most physicians would not provide a lethal prescription or injection to an eligible patient. They preferred the patient obtain a second opinion to confirm eligibility, have a psychiatric assessment, and then be referred to a third party to administer PAD. The majority of respondents felt unprepared for the initiation of this program and favored the development of PAD training modules and guidelines.Conclusions:ALS health care providers support the SCC decision and the majority believe PAD should be available to patients with moderate to severe ALS with physical or emotional suffering. However, few clinicians are willing to directly provide PAD and additional training and guidelines are required before implementation in Canada.

AB Objective: This study examined and compared help seeking, perceived need, satisfaction with health professionals, and barriers to care in three groups: individuals with a mental disorder without suicidal behaviors, those with suicidal ideation with or without a mental disorder, and those with a suicide attempt with or without a mental disorder in the past year. Methods: Data came from the Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 1.2. The sample consisted of 36,984 persons aged 15 years and older (esponse rate=77%). A total of 4,872 had a mental disorder without suicidal behaviors, 1,234 had suicidal ideation, and 230 had attempted suicide. Multiple logistic regressions were used to examine differences between the three groups after adjusting for sociodemographic factors and the number of mental disorders. Results: Individuals with suicidal ideation and those with suicide attempts were significantly more likely than those with a mental disorder but no suicidal behaviors to seek help and to perceive a need for care in the past year. However, 48% of individuals reporting suicidal ideation and 24% of individuals reporting a suicide attempt did not seek help and did not perceive a need for help in the past year. Significant differences existed between individuals in the three groups in terms of satisfaction with the care they received and barriers to receiving care in the past year. Conclusions: Although suicidal ideation and suicide attempts represent a significant source of evaluated need associated with help seeking and perceived need over and above the presence and severity of mental disorders, a significant proportion of individuals with suicidal behaviors did not receive care and did not perceive a need for care. Future research should be directed toward finding better ways to identify these individuals and address barriers to their care and other factors that may interfere with their receiving help.

AB Objective: We aim to concurrently examine risk and protective factors associated with intentional self-harm among community-residing older adults receiving home care services in Ontario, Canada.
   Methods: Administrative health data from the home care sector were linked to hospital administrative data to carry out the analyses. Home care data are collected in Ontario using the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care (RAI-HC), an assessment tool that identifies strengths, preferences and needs of long-stay home care clients. The sample included Ontario home care clients aged 60 years or older assessed with the RAI-HC between 2007 and 2010 (N=222,149). Multivariable analyses were performed using SAS.
   Results: Hospital records of intentional self-harm (ISH) were present in 9.3 cases per 1000 home care clients. Risks of ISH included younger age (60-74 years; OR=3.14, CI: 2.75-3.59), psychiatric diagnosis (OR=2.29, CI: 2.06-2.54), alcohol use and dependence (OR=1.69, CI: 1.34-2.14), psychotropic medication (OR=1.94, CI: 1.75-2.15) and depressive symptoms (OR=1.58, CI: 1.40-1.78). Protective effects were found for marital status and positive social relationships, yet these effects were more pronounced for men. Cognitive performance measures showed the odds of ISH 1.86 times higher for older adults with moderate to severe cognitive impairment.
   Conclusions: This study based on provincial data points to tangible areas for preventative assessment by frontline home care professionals. Of interest were the risk and protective factors that differed by sex. As demand for home care in Canada is expected to increase, these findings may inform home care professionals' appraisal and approach to suicide prevention among community-residing older adults.

AB Physical and sexual abuse in childhood is a worldwide phenomenon with potentially dramatic consequences of both a psychological and physical nature. Measures of primary prevention have been developed in some countries. In the USA, child protection services reports and research surveys indicate that child sexual abuse has been on the decline in recent decades. Results are less clear for physical and overall abuse. The aim of this study was to describe how childhood abuse has changed over the years in Canada through an analysis of the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey: Mental Health Edition data. The sample comprised 22,775 respondents ages 20 and over who completed a child abuse questionnaire. Respondents born from 1983 to 1992 reported significantly less overall abuse, physical abuse, and sexual abuse than did older generations, with the exception of people born in 1942 or earlier. The decrease was observed among men and women and across all the regions of Canada. Conclusion: The results are encouraging in that they may have an impact on life expectancy, severity of various chronic disorders, and suicide in the population. They also support policies that have focused on improving the childhood environment in the 1990s. Results also underline the importance of using different kinds of data sources for evaluating child abuse.What is Known:center dot Physical and sexual abuse in childhood has been associated with lower life expectancy in connection with an array of chronic diseases, including mental disorders, and with suicide.center dot Measures of primary prevention have been developed in some countries, such as the USA and Canada.What is New:center dot Canadians born from 1983 to 1992 report significantly less overall abuse, physical abuse, and sexual abuse than older generations do.center dot These encouraging results support policies implemented in the 1990s focused on improving the childhood environment.

AB A research study was conducted to determine public opinion in Alberta, a Canadian province, on the controversial topic of death hastening. Questions on the right to hastened death, end-of-life plans and end-of-life experiences were included in the Population Research Laboratorys annual 2010 health-care telephone survey, with 1203 adults providing results relatively representative of Albertans. Of all 1203, 72.6% said yes to the question: Should dying adults be able to request and get help from others to end their life early, in other words, this is a request for assisted suicide? Among all who provided an answer, 36.8% indicated yes, every competent adult should have this right and 40.6% indicated yes, but it should be allowed only in certain cases or situations. Over 50% of respondents in all but one socio-demographic population sub-group (Religious-other) were supportive of the right to hastened death. However, multinomial regression analysis revealed that the experiences of deciding to euthanise a pet/animal and developing or planning to develop an advance directive predicted support, while self-reported religiosity predicted non-support. Finding majority public support for death hastening suggests that legalisation could potentially occur in the future; but with this policy first requiring a careful consideration of the model of assisted suicide or euthanasia that best protects people who are highly vulnerable to despair and suffering near the end of life.

AB Introduction: This systematic review assessed the impact of race/ethnicity, education, and income on transgender individual's lifetime experience of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (SITB) in gray and published literature (1997-2017). Methods: Sixty four research projects (108 articles) were identified in WorldCat, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Articles were included if they were published in Canada or the United States, included original quantifiable data on transgender SITBs, and had >= 5 participants, at least 51% of whom were >= 18 years. Results: Across all projects suicide ideation averaged 46.55% and attempts averaged 27.19%. The majority of participants were Caucasian, whereas the highest rate of suicide attempts (55.31%) was among First Nations, who accounted for <1.5% of participants. Caucasians, by contrast, had the lowest attempt rate (36.80%). More participants obtained a bachelor's degree and fewer an associate or technical degree than any other level of education. Suicide attempts were highest among those with <= some high school (50.70%) and lowest among those with an advanced degree (30.25%). More participants made an income of $20-$50,000/year and less $10-$20,000 than any other income bracket. Conclusion: SITBs, among the transgender population, are both universally high and impacted by race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and income. These findings may be useful in creating culturally and factually informed interventions for transgender individuals experiencing SITBs and in informing future research on this topic.

AB Objectives: Investigations of the association between chronic pain conditions and suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA) have rarely taken the effect of mental disorders into account and have been limited by nonrepresentative samples. The present study used a large population-based sample to investigate the association between chronic pain conditions and SI and SA.
   Methods: Data were from the Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 1.2 public use file conducted by Statistics Canada from 2001 to 2002 (N = 36,984; response rate 77%). Respondents were asked if they had been diagnosed with the following painful conditions: migraine, back problems, arthritis, and fibromyalgia. Respondents were assessed for past 12-month SI and SA. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to assess Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV.
   Results: After adjusting for sociodemographics, Axis I mental disorders and comorbidity (3 or more mental disorders), the presence of 1 or more chronic pain conditions was associated with both SI and SA. Among respondents with a mental disorder, comorbidity with 1 or more chronic pain conditions was also associated with SI and SA. In models adjusting for other painful conditions, migraine had the strongest link with SI and SA.
   Discussion: This is the first study to demonstrate the association between several chronic pain conditions and SI and SA while adjusting for mental disorders in a nationally representative sample. Moreover, this study demonstrates that among individuals with a mental disorder, having a chronic pain condition significantly increased the association with SI and SA.

AB Background: Nationally representative Canadian data on the prevalence of child abuse and its relation with mental disorders are lacking. We used contemporary, nationally representative data to examine the prevalence of 3 types of child abuse (physical abuse, sexual abuse and exposure to intimate partner violence) and their association with 14 men tal conditions, including suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.
   Methods: We obtained data from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey: Mental Health, collected from the 10 provinces. Respondents aged 18 years and older were asked about child abuse and were selected for the study sample (n = 23 395). The survey had a multistage stratified cluster design (household response rate 79.8%).
   Results: The prevalence of any child abuse was 32% (individual types ranged from 8% to 26%). All types of child abuse were associated with all mental conditions, including suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, after adjustment for sociodemographic variables (adjusted odds ratios ranged from 1.4 to 7.9). We found a dose-response relation, with increasing number of abuse types experienced corresponding with greater odds of mental conditions. Associations between child abuse and attention deficit disorder, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts showed stronger effects for women than men.
   Interpretation: We found robust associations between child abuse and mental conditions. Health care providers, especially those assessing patients with mental health problems, need to be aware of the relation between specific types of child abuse and certain mental conditions. Success in preventing child abuse could lead to reductions in the prevalence of mental disorders, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.

AB Background/Purpose: Injuries are the leading cause of death in young people. Our aim is to examine the differences between aboriginal and non-aboriginal pediatric trauma mortality as a means to focus on prevention strategies.
   Methods: The records for all traumatic pediatric (0-18 years) deaths between 1996 and 2010 were reviewed from the regional Medical Examiner's office.
   Results: The majority of the total 932 pediatric deaths were the result of non-intentional injuries (640) followed by suicide (195), homicide (65), child abuse (15), and undetermined (17). Despite being only 3.3% of the provincial population, Aboriginals represented 30.9% of pediatric trauma fatalities. Aboriginal fatalities occurred most commonly in the home, with males and females equally affected. Road related events were the main causes of injury overall. Up to three-quarters of Aboriginal children who died in a non-pedestrian road related event did not wear an indicated protective device. Pedestrian deaths were over-represented in Aboriginal children. The second most common cause of death was suicide for both non-Aboriginal and Aboriginal children. Almost half of all of the suicides were Aboriginal. Homicide and child abuse had similar proportions for both non-Aboriginal and Aboriginal children.
   Conclusion: Pediatric Aboriginal injury prevention should be a priority and tailored for Aboriginal communities. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR

DT Article
ID PARAPROFESSIONAL HELPERS; CENTERS
AB Research since the 1960s has consistently found that lay volunteers are better at helping suicidal callers than professionals. Yet, professional degrees are increasingly becoming requirements for helpline workers. In our first study, we conducted post hoc comparisons of U.S. helplines with all professional paid staff, all lay volunteers, and a mix of both, using silent monitoring and standardized assessments of 1,431 calls. The volunteer centers more often conducted risk assessments, had more empathy, were more respectful of callers, and had significantly better call outcome ratings. A second study of five Quebec suicide prevention centers used silent monitoring to compare telephone help in 1,206 calls answered by 90 volunteers and 39 paid staff. Results indicate no significant differences between the volunteers and paid employees on outcome variables. However, volunteers and paid staff with over 140hours of call experience had significantly better outcomes. Unlike the United States, Quebec paid employees were not required to have advanced professional degrees. We conclude from these results and previous research that there is no justification for requiring that suicide prevention helpline workers be mental health professionals. In fact, the evidence to date indicates that professionals may be less effective in providing telephone help to suicidal individuals when compared to trained lay volunteers.

AB Background: Families' experiences of assisted dying are under-investigated and families are rarely considered in clinical guidelines concerning assisted dying. Aim: To systematically review family experiences of assisted dying. Design: A systematic literature review using thematic synthesis. Data sources: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine) and PsycINFO databases (January 1992 to February 2019). Studies investigating families' experiences on the practice of legalised assisted dying were included. We excluded studies prior to legalisation within the jurisdiction, secondary data analysis and opinion papers. Results: Nineteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Publications were derived from four countries: The Netherlands, United States (Oregon, Washington and Vermont), Canada and Switzerland. Dutch studies predominately investigated family involvement in euthanasia, while Swiss and American studies only reported on assisted suicide. Eleven studies had a qualitative design, using predominately in-depth interviews; seven were retrospective surveys. Five analytical themes represented families' experiences in assisted dying: (1) context of the decision, (2) grounding the decision, (3) cognitive and emotional work, (4) experiencing the final farewell and (5) grief and bereavement. The results showed that families can be very involved in supporting patients seeking assisted dying, where open communication is maintained. Family involvement appeared to be influenced by the type of legislation in their country and the families' perception of the social acceptability of assisted dying. Conclusion: Our data confirm that families across all jurisdictions are involved in assisted suicide decision and enactment. Family needs are under-researched, and clinical guidelines should incorporate recommendations about how to consider family needs and how to provide them with evidence-based tailored interventions.

AB Neighbourhood greenness has been frequently associated with improved mental health in adulthood, yet its impact among youth is less clear. Additionally, though youth spend large portions of time at school, no study has investigated associations between school-based measures of greenness and students' mental health in Canada. We addressed this gap by linking participant responses from the 2016-2017 Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey to school-based features of the built environment. Our analyses included 6313 students, ages 11-20. Measures of greenness were the mean and max of the annual mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index within 500 m and 1000 m from the centroid of the school postal code. Measures of mental health included: serious psychological distress (Kessler 6-item Psychological Distress Scale), self-rated mental health (using a five-point Likert scale), suicide ideation, and suicide attempt. In our study population, the prevalence of serious psychological distress and low self-rated mental health was 16.7% and 20.3%, respectively. Suicide ideation was reported by 13.5% of participants, while 3.7% reported a suicide attempt. Quantity of greenness was similar between schools in the lower and upper quartiles. In logistic regressions, we found no association between objective school-based greenness and mental health, as assessed by multiple measures, both before and after adjustment. Null findings held true after stratification by season, as well. Whether other characteristics of school greenness (such as type, quality, or access and use) are more impactful to students' mental health should be a focus of future analyses.

AB Use of illegal drugs is an important behavioral risk factor for burden of morbidity in developed countries. The objective was to estimate the number of diagnoses in acute care hospitals, psychiatric hospitalizations, admissions in specialized treatment, and number of days in treatment attributable to use of illegal drugs for Canada in 2002. The number of diagnoses in acute care hospitals, psychiatric hospitalizations, and hospital days were obtained from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI). Number of admissions and number of days in specialized inpatient and outpatient treatment of illegal drug dependency were obtained from provincial ministerial officials or drug addiction program coordinators. Except for effects of maternal use of drugs of addiction on the newborn, and suicide, drug-attributable fractions (DAFs) were estimated directly from available statistics in published literature. There were 61,026 illegal drug-related diagnoses in acute care hospitals, 1,517 psychiatric hospitalizations, and 139,773 admissions to specialized treatment attributable to illegal drug use in Canada. The largest contributors were mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use in acute care hospitals, and drug psychoses in psychiatric hospitalizations. Length of stay amounted to 352,121 days in acute care hospitals, 31,508 days in psychiatric hospitals, and 2,851,829 days in specialized treatment. Drug use constitutes a major contributor to burden of morbidity in Canada. Compared to 1992, the total number of illegal drug-attributable days in 2002 increased, especially in acute hospitals by a factor of 9.6. A mixture of prevention and harm reduction measures is proposed to reduce the burden of morbidity associated with drug use.

AB Carter v Canada (Attorney General) is a Canadian case that famously struck down the Canadian Criminal Code prohibitions on euthanasia and assisted suicide (now known collectively as medical assistance in dying or MAiD). The most significant issue in the Carter case was that of the status of MAiD. However, this case is also interesting to explore in relation to the issue of the use of expert evidence from social science and humanities researchers. In this paper, I offer reflections as an academic trained in philosophy and law but not expert in the use of social science and humanities evidence in litigation. As someone who was inside the litigation but outside the generation of the evidence, I seek to bring a perspective that may be useful to practitioners who might be thinking about working with academics and academics who might be thinking about getting involved in constitutional litigation that relates to their field of study.

TI Epidemiology of suicide in the state of Guanajuato.
SO SALUD MENTAL
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE Suicide; epidemiology; Guanajuato; migration; social-demograph
ID MEXICO
AB From the epidemic perspective, suicide appears as an international public health problem due to the remarkable increase of its incidence. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in the year 2000, suicide had the greater percentage (49%) in the statistics of "deaths by intentional injuries"; followed by violence (32%) and war (19%).
   This source also notifies that in countries with population over 100 millions, Mexico is the country that shows the higher increase of "changes in age-standardized groups in specific intervals of time" (+61, 9% in period 81-83/93-95). Followed in descendent order by: India (+54%, period 80-93), Brazil (+13.2%, period 79-81/93-93), and the Russian Federation (+5.3%, period 80-82/96-98). The United States of America (-5.3%, period 80-82/93-97) and Japan (-14.3%, period 80-82/95-97) have shown decreasing rates.
   The increase in the rates of suicide in Mexico has been registered by various studies, which also have proved that the States where those rates were the highest are: Veracruz, Mexico City and, in third place, Guanajuato.
   Some specific sectors of Guanajuato State show an association of two phenomena: suicide and migration, basically migrants travelling to the United States of America and Canada, both countries with a high frequency of suicides. The information on suicide in Mexico come from sources such as local or international studies, and also from reports obtained through public institutions, the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica, Geografia e Informatica (INEGI), the Secreteria de Salud (SS) and the Procuraduria General de Justicia (PGJ). Nevertheless, the data given by these institutions show discrepancies in statistics, a fact due perhaps to differences in the classification criteria for deaths, and to registration and filing mistakes.
   The aim of the present research was to collect and report epidemiological data on suicides and the characteristics of the suicidal events, in the State of Guanajuato, during the period between 1995 and 2001. To this purpose the files of the PGJ in Guanajuato State were analyzed; these files contain detailed information about suicides and the suicidal act, as well as the transcription of suicidal notes, in case they be left. They also contain declarations and testimonies from people who are close (relatives, friends, acquaintances) to the suicidal victim.
   The data gathered included socio-demographical information, migrant condition, variables related to the Suicidal act, alcohol and drug use at the moment of the event, and the transcription of the suicidal note. The declarations and testimonies from the suicide acquaintances were kept for further studies.
   The data-gathering lasted six months and was made by last semester students of the Faculty of Psychology.
   Data were analyzed according to the State distribution Of the PGJ that divides it into 4 zones: Leon, Irapuato, Celaya and San Miguel de Allende. Frequency analysis were made and for some variables, chi square statistical tests.
   Of the 747 cases of death caused by suicide registered by the PGJ in Guanajuato, during the 1995 - 2001 period, 733 were analyzed because the lacking 13 files Could not be located. From the total of cases 80.1% were men and 19.9%, women. The rank of age goes from 8 to 9 1 years. The average for men was 30 years and the mode 20 years; for women the average was 28 wars and the mode 18 years old. This shows that Suicide was committed at,an earlier age by women than by men.
   Only 10% of the whole had no schooling; almost half of the total had completed elementary Studies and 21% had attained high school level. Besides, 30% of the people who committed suicide were employees and only 1.6% were professionals.
   Regarding the characteristics of the suicidal act, the place more used to committ it, was the suicide's house (78%), mainly in the case of women (with significant difference) (p=.001). The suicide method used in most cases was different for both sexes: men preferred hanging (p=.001), and women poisoning (p=.001).
   Forty one per cent of the men had ingested alcohol before committing suicide and only 7.8% of the women. In addition, alcohol use was more frequent in the group of 35 to 44 years of age, and by those who were married. The use of other drugs was present in 13% of the total (no significant differences between sexes).
   As to the migration phenomenon, most of migrant suicides were between 20 and 34 years old. The rate of non-migrant suicides was 4:1 (4 men committed suicide for every suicidal women) and it changed in the migrant group to 3:2. This migration phenomenon is data included: returning migrants, people who were going to leave Mexico in the near future (one day or week later) and also people who had one or more close relatives living as migrant laborers in the northern countries.
   Finally, other differences found when comparing the migrant group with the non-migrants Suicidal group are: the greater use of firearms registered as suicidal method (p=.001) and the higher percentage of psychiatric medication.
   On the other hand, the higher frequency Of Suicides was registered in the month of May (13%), and the lower percentage in October (5.7%).
   State regionalization, showed the higher percentage of suicides in Celaya (254 cases), and the lower corresponded to San Miguel de Allende (103 cases).
   It may be concluded that in the State Of Guanajuato the phenomenon of suicide presents alarming peculiarities: more risked groups include children, adolescents and Young people (this sample found 42 suicidal children under 14 years old).
   Also, considering that migration is the most important social phenomenon in Guanajuato State, we may observe that it has contributed to modify the patterns Of Suicide of some population groups. This is shown by the increasing suicidal women percentage and the most frequent use of firearms, drug and alcohol usage, and psychiatric medication; a possible explanation to this has to do with the Cultural shock of the migration process.
   Although it is difficult to consider the suicidal phenomenon as a consequence of drug abuse and vice versa, from the current frequency of suicide cases involved with drugs, at least at the moment of death, we may observe that this circumstance increases the complexity and difficulty, of the suicide problem.
   Finally, we may stress that obtaining information through the files of the PGJ demonstrated to be fruitful, because they have important elements to consider in the suicide research. Data as the transcription Of suicide notes, the declaration of relatives or close friends of the suicide, and the detailed description of the suicidal event, aren't registered by Other instances. Nevertheless, it is urgent to combine the efforts of the institutions related to the study of the suicidal behaviors, in order to systematize and to unify, the official statistics. This will optimize the registration forms and add some variables aimed to favor research purposes.

TI Cost analysis of medical assistance in dying in Canada
SO CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID OF-LIFE PRACTICES; EUTHANASIA LAW; BELGIUM; TRENDS; SUICIDE
AB BACKGROUND: The legalization of medical assistance in dying will affect health care spending in Canada. Our aim was to determine the potential costs and savings associated with the implementation of medical assistance in dying.
   METHODS: Using published data from the Netherlands and Belgium, where medically assisted death is legal, we estimated that medical assistance in dying will account for 1%-4% of all deaths; 80% of patients will have cancer; 50% of patients will be aged 60-80 years; 55% will be men; 60% of patients will have their lives shortened by 1 month; and 40% of patients will have their lives shortened by 1 week. We combined current mortality data for the Canadian population with recent end-of-life cost data to calculate a predicted range of savings associated with the implementation of medical assistance in dying. We also estimated the direct costs associated with offering medically assisted death, including physician consultations and drug costs.
   RESULTS: Medical assistance in dying could reduce annual health care spending across Canada by between $34.7 million and $138.8 million, exceeding the $1.5-$14.8 million in direct costs associated with its implementation. In sensitivity analyses, we noted that even if the potential savings are overestimated and costs underestimated, the implementation of mdedical assistance in dying will likely remain at least cost neutral.
   INTERPRETATION: Providing medical assistance in dying in Canada should not result in any excess financial burden to the health care system, and could result in substantial savings. Additional data on patients who choose medical assistance in dying in Canada should be collected to enable more precise estimates of the impact of medically assisted death on health care spending and to enable further economic evaluation.

AB Although firearm homicide remains a topic of interest within criminological and policy discourse, existing research does not generally undertake longitudinal comparisons between countries. However, cross-country comparisons provide insight into whether "local" trends (e. g., declines in firearm homicide in one particular country) differ from broader, international trends. This in turn can improve knowledge about the role of factors such as policing practices and socioeconomic variables in the incidence of lethal violence using firearms. The current study compares long-term firearm homicide trends in three countries with similar social histories but different legislative regimes: Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. Using negative binomial regression, the study found that the most pronounced decline in firearm homicide over the past two decades occurred in New Zealand. Connections between social disadvantage, policing policy, and violence are discussed.

AB IMPORTANCE The United States has higher infant and youth mortality rates than other high-income countries, with striking disparities by racial/ethnic group. Understanding changing trends by age and race/ethnicity for leading causes of death is imperative for focused intervention.
   OBJECTIVE To estimate trends in US infant and youth mortality rates from 1999 to 2015 by age group and race/ethnicity, identify leading causes of death, and compare mortality rates with Canada and England/Wales.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This descriptive study analyzed death certificate data from the US National Center for Health Statistics, Statistics Canada, and the UK Office of National Statistics for all deaths among individuals younger than 25 years. The study took place from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2015, and analyses started in September 2017.
   EXPOSURES Race/ethnicity.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Average annual percent changes in mortality rates from 1999 to 2015 and absolute rate change between 1999 to 2002 and 2012 to 2015 for each age group, race/ethnicity, and cause of death.
   RESULTS Among individuals from birth to age 24 years, 1169 537 deaths occurred in the United States, 80 540 in Canada, and 121183 in England/Wales from 1999 to 2015. In the United States, 64% of deaths occurred in male individuals and 52.6% occurred in white individuals (25.1% deaths occurred in black individuals and 17.9% in Latino individuals). All-cause mortality declined for all age groups (infants younger than 1 year [38.5% of deaths], children aged 1-9 years [10.6%], early adolescents aged 10-14 years [5%], late adolescents aged 15-19 years [17.7%], and young adults aged 20-24 years [28.1%]) in the United States, Canada, and England/Wales from 1999 to 2015. However, rates were highest in the United States. Within the United States, annual declines in all-cause mortality rates occurred among all age groups of black, Latino, and white individuals, except for white individuals aged 20 to 24 years, whose rates remained stable. Mortality rates declined across most major causes of death from 1999 to 2002 and 2012 to 2015, with notable declines observed for sudden infant death syndrome, unintentional injury death, and homicides. Among infants, unintentional suffocation and strangulation in bed increased (difference between 2012-2015 and 1999-2002 range, 6.11-29.03 per 100 000). Further, suicide rates among Latino and white individuals aged 10 to 24 years (range, 0.21-2.63 per 100 000) and black individuals aged 10 to 19 years (range, 0.10-0.45 per 100 000) increased, as did unintentional injury deaths in white young adults (0.79 per 100 000). The rise in unintentional injury deaths is attributed to increases in drug poisonings and was also observed in black and Latino young adults.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Mortality rates in the United States have generally declined for infants and youths from 1999 to 2015 owing to reductions in sudden infant death syndrome, unintentional injury death, and homicides. However, US mortality rates remain higher than Canada and England/Wales, with particularly elevated rates among black and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth. Further, there is a concerning increase in suicide and drug poisoning death rates among US adolescents and young adults.

AB Developed and produced at Toronto's Workman Theatre Project (WTP) in 1993, Terry Watada's play The Tale of a Mask weaves a Japanese folktale with a contemporary tragedy inspired by a double murder and suicide in Vancouver. Since 1991, the WTP has collaborated with playwrights to develop plays that educate audiences about mental illness and destabilize representations that perpetuate stigma. The Tale of a Mask was developed as part of a WTP initiative to investigate multiculturalism, immigration, and mental illness in Canada. The eponymous mask of the title, the author argues, acts as an enigmatic symbol for mental illness read differently by different cultures.

AB This paper builds on the work of Tuffrey-Wijne et al. and explores the issue of vulnerability and persons with disabilities in relation to Euthnasia and Assisted Dying (EAS). The commentary draws on both the literature and on case examples from Canada. Specifically, it considers the issue of EAS as an alternative to, or substituted for, appropriate disability supports. Secondly, it considers the issue of the devaluation of disabled lives in general and within health care practice and ethics. It concludes that current safeguards are inadequate and that as EAS regimes become more permissive the risk to disabled persons will increase.

AB Medical assistance in dying (MAiD) was legalized by the Supreme Court of Canada in June 2016 and became a legal, viable end of life care (EOLC) option for Canadians with irremediable illness and suffering. Much attention has been paid to the balance between physicians' willingness to provide MAiD and patients' legal right to request medically assisted death in certain circumstances. In contrast, very little attention has been paid to the challenge of making MAiD accessible to vulnerable populations. The purpose of this paper was to examine the extant literature and resources that are available on the provision of MAiD in Canada. We found that the provision of EOLC in Canada offers insufficient access to palliative and EOLC options for Canadians and that vulnerable Canadians experience disproportional barriers to accessing these already limited resources. Consequently, we argue that palliative care, hospice care and MAiD must be considered a spectrum of EOLC that is inclusive and accessible to all Canadians. We conclude by imploring Canadian healthcare professionals, policy makers and legislators to consider MAiD as a viable EOLC option for all Canadians.

AB As photovoice continues to grow as a method for researching health and illness, there is a need for rigorous discussions about ethical considerations. In this article, we discuss three key ethical issues arising from a recent photovoice study investigating men's depression and suicide. The first issue, indelible images, details the complexity of consent and copyright when participant-produced photographs are shown at exhibitions and online where they can be copied and disseminated beyond the original scope of the research. The second issue, representation, explores the ethical implications that can arise when participants and others have discordant views about the deceased. The third, vicarious trauma, offers insights into the potenial for triggering mental health issues among researchers and viewers of the participant-produced photographs. Through a discussion of these ethical issues, we offer suggestions to guide the work of health researchers who use, or are considering the use of, photovoice.

AB The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with complete mental health among Canadians who had ever seriously considered suicide. Data for this study were obtained from Statistics Canada's 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health (N = 2,844). The outcome variable examined in this study was complete mental health and was analyzed using binary logistic regression. Of the 2,844 respondents with lifetime suicidal ideation, 1,088 (38.2%) had complete mental health (i.e., had flourishing mental health, no mental illness, and no suicidal ideation in the past 12 months). Those who had a confidant were seven times more likely to have complete mental health. Other factors associated with achieving complete mental health among formerly suicidal respondents include being older, being a woman, having higher income, use of religious coping, and never previously having a mental illness. Considering the importance of these protective factors in formulating public health policies will allow for a more wide-reaching approach to suicide prevention.

AB The mandate of a formal child death review (CDR) system is to advance understanding of how and why children die, to improve child health and safety, and to prevent deaths and injuries in the future. Areas in which CDR has provided valuable information and/or intervention include sudden death in infancy, unintentional injuries (the leading cause of death in Canadian children and youth one to 19 years of age), suicide in youth, and deaths due to homicide or child maltreatment. When collected systematically using common definitions, information regarding deaths in children and youth can help with understanding the scope of problems. Information about the context of a death can inform potential prevention or intervention activities. CDR can improve medical and mental health best practices, child welfare policies and procedures, and legislation and education relevant to public health and safety. In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, CDR processes are mandated by legislation. In Canada, death review teams have diverse structures and functions, and the CDR system is less well developed. The present statement addresses the need for formal, organized child and youth death review in Canada to help strengthen and systemize injury and death prevention efforts.

AB While a significant health concern for sexual minority women, there is little qualitative research investigating their experiences of childhood trauma and suicidality. In this study, we used photovoice methods and an intersectionality framework. Drawing on qualitative interviews, we inductively derived three themes (a) Traumatized and discredited, (b) Cascading marginality, estrangement, and suicidality, (c) Reconstruction and reclaiming resilience. In Traumatized and discredited, we describe the sense of abandonment flowing from childhood trauma heightened by a lack of protection and neglect on the part of parents/guardians. The lack of support to deal with childhood trauma and the layering effects of marginality characterizes the theme Cascading marginality, estrangement, and suicidality. In the third theme, we discuss strategies for reconstruction and reclaiming resilience as participants worked to overcome these challenging experiences. Our study findings offer guidance to suicide prevention counseling programs for sexual minority women and affirm actions to address health inequities.

AB Since medical assistance in dying (MAiD) became legal in Canada in 2016, there have been concerns about vulnerable people feeling pressured to end their lives. It is important to understand what people in marginalized communities know and feel about MAiD in order to help prevent any pressure to hasten death and to prevent any barriers to accessing assisted death. This qualitative study explored the perceptions and experiences of MAiD and other end-of-life care options with 46 people who were illicit substance users, living in poverty, or who worked with marginalized people in these communities. Six broad themes were identified: the importance of family, friends, and community; the effects of the opioid crisis; barriers to accessing end-of-life care services; support for MAiD; the difference between suicide and MAiD; and what constitutes a good death. Findings from this research may be used to help inform future legislation, professional guidelines, and standards of best practice.

AB The aim of this review was to review research addressing the relationship between population drinking and health, particularly mortality. The review is based primarily on articles published in international journals after 1994 to February 2005, identified via Medline. The method used in most studies is time- series analysis based on autoregressive intergrated moving average (ARIMA) modelling. The outcome measures covered included the following mortality indicators: mortality from liver cirrhosis and other alcohol-related diseases, accident mortality, suicide, homicide, ischaemic heart disease ( IHD) mortality and all- cause mortality. The study countries included most of the EU member states as of 1995 ( 14 countries), Canada and the United States. For Eastern Europe there was only scanty evidence. The study period was in most cases the post-war period. There was a statistically significant relationship between per capita consumption and mortality from liver cirrhosis and other alcohol-related diseases in all countries. In about half the countries, there was a significant relationship between consumption, on one hand, and mortality from accidents and homicide as well as all- cause mortality on the other hand. A link between alcohol and suicide was found in all regions except for mid- and southern Europe. There was no systematic link between consumption and IHD mortality. Overall, a 1-litre increase in per capita consumption was associated with a stronger effect in northern Europe and Canada than in mid- and southern Europe. Research during the past decade has strengthened the notion of a relationship between population drinking and alcohol- related harm. At the same time, the marked regional variation in the magnitude of this relationship suggests the importance of drinking patterns for modifying the impact of alcohol. By and large, there was little evidence for any cardioprotective effect at the population level. It is a challenge for future research to reconcile this outcome with the findings from observational studies, most of which suggest a protective effect of moderate drinking.

AB Anxiety disorders are more prevalent in individuals with chronic physical illness compared to individuals with no such illness, and about twice as prevalent in women as in men. This study used data collected in the 2005 Canadian Community Health Survey (21,198 women and 20,478 men) to examine factors associated with comorbid anxiety disorders and to assess the relation of these disorders on short-term disability and suicidal ideation. Comorbid anxiety disorders were more prevalent among women who were young, single, poor, and Canadian-born, and among women with chronic fatigue syndrome; fibromyalgia, bowel disorder or stomach or intestinal ulcers, or bronchitis had the highest rates of anxiety disorders. The presence of comorbid anxiety disorders was significantly associated with short-term disability, requiring help with instrumental daily activities, and suicidal ideation. Our findings underscore the importance of early detection and treatment of anxiety disorders in the physically ill, especially those who also suffer from mood disorders.

AB Introduction: The primary purpose of this article is to demonstrate the role that age, gender, and place play in rural-urban differences in mortality, in order to better develop policy to reduce these differences.
   Methods: In 2006, the Canadian Institute for Health Research published a major epidemiological investigation into the morbidity and mortality experience of Canadians, using mortality data as well as the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey. Using these data, gender differences in mortality across the rural-urban continuum were further explored. The proportion of excess deaths occurring in each of the four different types of rural places, relative to deaths in urban places, were calculated for different gender and age groups.
   Results: Differences in mortality across the urban-rural continuum are mainly driven by people under 45 years, and are particularly due to deaths caused by injury and poisoning, motor vehicle accident (MVA) and suicide. The proportion of excess deaths relative to urban places for those under 45 years increases with decreasing age. Remote places have the highest excess in mortality for suicide, MVA, injury and poisoning, relative to urban places.
   Conclusion: The relative mortality for young girls living in rural compared with urban places is similar to the relative mortality for young rural boys. There is, therefore, a need for prevention policies targeted at both boys and girls to prevent suicide, injury/poisoning, and MVAs in rural, and especially in remote, places.

AB There is widespread concern about possible long-term health effects among women who have received breast implants for cosmetic purposes; few studies have reported on the mortality patterns of such women. The authors examined cause-specific mortality in a cohort of 24,558 women with breast implants and 15,893 women who underwent other plastic surgery procedures in Ontario and Quebec, Canada, between 1974 and 1989. Deaths through 1997 were identified through linkage to the national mortality database. The authors compared the mortality of women who received implants with that of the general population by using standardized mortality ratios; Poisson regression was used to perform internal cohort comparisons. Overall mortality was lower among women who received breast implants relative to the general population (standardized mortality ratio = 0.74, 95% confidence interval: 0.68, 0.81). In contrast, higher suicide rates were observed in both the implant (standardized mortality ratio = 1.73, 95% confidence interval: 1.31, 2.24) and other plastic surgery (standardized mortality ratio = 1.55, 95% confidence interval: 1.07, 2.18) patients. No differences in mortality were found between the implant and other surgeries group for any of the 20 causes of death examined. Findings suggest that breast implants do not directly increase mortality in women. Further work is needed to evaluate risk factors for suicide among women who undergo elective cosmetic surgery.

AB Major depressive disorder (MDD) has a profound effect not only on mental health, but on all aspects of life, including employment, social functioning, and physical well-being. Depression has been associated with individual difference variables such as sex, social support, and negative childhood experiences. Other correlates of MDD include: suicidal ideation and action, distress, positive mental health and life satisfaction (both negative). Although extensive research has been done on the prevalence rate and correlates of depression, representative samples are not used often. The current study utilized data from the Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health (CCHS-MH) focus content cycle 2012, which contains a representative sample of the Canadian population. The main goal of this study was to explore prevalence rates and correlates of depression for the Canadian population. Having a representative sample from the CCHS-MH allows for more accurate inferences to be made about the population of Canada. The 12 months' prevalence rate of MDD in Canada was found to be 4.7%, and the lifetime prevalence rate was found to be 11.2%. There exists a sex difference in the prevalence rates of MDD, with females being almost twice as likely to experience MDD during their lifetime compared to males (OR = 1.8). The relationship between MDD and suicide ideation, social support, negative childhood experiences, and other correlates are also discussed in detail.

AB 'Suffering' is a central discursive trope for the right-to-die movement. In this article, we ask how proponents of physician-assisted dying (PAD) articulate suffering with the role of medicine at the end of life within the context of a decriminalization and legalization debate. We draw upon empirical data from our study of Carter v. Canada, the landmark court case that decriminalized PAD in Canada in 2015. We conducted in-depth interviews with 42 key participants of the case and collected over 4000 pages of legal documents generated by the case. In our analysis of the data, we show the different ways proponents construct relationships between suffering, mainstream curative medicine, palliative care, and assisted dying. Proponents see curative medicine as complicit in the production of suffering at the end of life; they lament a cultural context wherein life-prolongation is the moral imperative of physicians who are paternalistic and death-denying. Proponents further limit palliative care's ability to alleviate suffering at the end of life and even go so far as to claim that in some instances, palliative care produces suffering. Proponents' articulation of suffering with both mainstream medicine and palliative care might suggest an outright rejection of a place for medicine at the end of life. We further find, however, that proponents insist on the involvement of physicians in assisted dying. Proponents emphasize how a request for PAD can set in motion an interactive therapeutic process that alleviates suffering at the end of life. We argue that the proponents' articulation of suffering with the role of medicine at the end of life should be understood as a discourse through which one configuration of end-of-life care comes to be accepted and another rejected, a discourse that ultimately does not challenge, but makes productive use of the larger framework of the medicalization of dying.

AB Objective: To determine the magnitude of depression and suicidal populations, the overlap between these populations, and the associated patterns of mental health service use.
   Method: We examined depression, suicidality (ideation and nonfatal behaviours), and the mental health service use of participants in the Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 1.2: Mental Health and Well-Being. The sample comprised 36 984 household members aged 15 years or over.
   Results: Approximately 4% to 5% of the population suffered from a major depression or suicidality. About 2 of 3 of those who were suicidal did not suffer from depression, and over 70% of those with depression did not report suicidality. Persons with depression and suicidality or depression (but no suicidality) were the 2 groups most likely to report ambulatory mental health contacts, and the provider groups contacted most often included physicians. The use of provider groups was considerably lower for those who were suicidal (but had no depression). Whereas the latter were more likely to report contacts than not, suicidality, in and of itself, did not exert a strong effect oil contact with any particular provider group. For those who were suicidal (but who had no depression), less than 1 in 3 reported any mental health service contact, including an inpatient mental health stay.
   Conclusions: The lack of contact by those who are suicidal (but who have no depression) is provocative, given that almost 2 of 3 of the suicidal subjects had no depression. Detrimental outcomes such as depression may develop without effective early interventions and uptake by a sufficient supply of appropriately trained and financially accessible personnel.

AB In Indigenous communities, strong intergenerational relationships have been identified as valuable due to the ways they contribute to cultural continuity and community wellness. This project uses Photovoice, a qualitative, participatory research method in which participants take photographs to examine Southern Inuit older adult and youth representations of intergenerational relationships in Labrador, Canada. Photovoice proved to be useful in accessing elder and youth perspectives on intergenerational engagement in this community, while bringing diverse generations together in a shared, meaningful activity. Our findings suggest that family, community, and the transmission of cultural knowledge are hubs of intergenerational engagement.

AB Since the drop in the bed capacity of civil psychiatric hospitals, an increase in the bed capacity of forensic psychiatric care and prison units has been reported in the United States and Europe. However, in Canada, a decrease in the number of people with severe mental illness (SMI) during the last two decades in penitentiaries has been reported. At the same time, an increase in individuals found not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder (NCRMD) was observed in forensic hospitals. The aim of this study is to compare incarcerated severely mentally ill (I-SMI) individuals with forensic-hospitalized SMI individuals in terms of their clinical profiles and service use in the province of Quebec (Canada). A case-control study design was selected using a sample of 44 I-SMI individuals and 59 forensic-hospitalized SMI individuals. Important findings include the following: I-SMI persons had less schooling; they more often reported suicide attempts and violent and non-violent crimes; and they had a higher level of comorbidity involving Cluster B personality disorders and substance-use disorders. Forensic-hospitalized SMI persons were more likely to have been receiving psychiatric follow-up before hospitalization. The final logistic regression model showed that lifetime suicide attempts, non-violent crimes, and psychopathic traits were higher among I-SMI individuals than among forensic-hospitalized SMI individuals. In contrast, receiving regular psychiatric follow-up was associated with forensic-hospitalized SMI individuals. Differences in psychopathological characteristics and the use of mental health services were found for I-SMI persons. More research is needed to determine which new initiatives might be efficacious in addressing the mental health needs of I-SMI individuals.

AB Research has shown that bisexuals have poorer health outcomes than heterosexuals, gays, or lesbians, particularly with regard to mental health and substance use. However, research on bisexuals is often hampered by issues in defining bisexuality, small sample sizes, and by the failure to address age differences between bisexuals and other groups or age gradients in mental health. The Risk & Resilience Survey of Bisexual Mental Health collected data on 405 bisexuals from Ontario, Canada, using respondent-driven sampling, a network-based sampling method for hidden populations. The weighted prevalence of severe depression (PHQ-9 >= 20) was 4.7%, possible anxiety disorder (OASIS >= 8) was 30.9%, possible post-traumatic stress disorder (PCL-C >= 50) was 10.8%, and past year suicide attempt was 1.9%. With respect to substance use, the weighted prevalence of problem drinking (AUDIT >= 5) was 31.2%, and the weighted prevalence of illicit polydrug use was 30.5%. Daily smoking was low in this sample, with a weighted prevalence of 7.9%. Youth (aged 16-24) reported significantly higher weighted mean scores on depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, and higher rates of past year suicidal ideation (29.7% vs. 15.2%) compared with those aged 25 and older. The burden of mental health and substance use among bisexuals in Ontario is high relative to population-based studies of other sexual orientation groups. Bisexual youth appear to be at risk for poor mental health. Additional research is needed to understand if and how minority stress explains this burden.

AB Background: The impact of the prescription opioid public health crisis has been illustrated by the dramatic increase in opioid-related deaths in North America. We aimed to identify patterns and characteristics amongst opioid-users whose cause of death was related to opioid toxicity.
   Methods: This was a population-based study of Ontarians between the years 2006 and 2008. All drug-related deaths which occurred during this time frame were reviewed at the Office of the Chief Coroner of Ontario, and opioid-related deaths were identified. Medical, toxicology, pathology, and police reports were comprehensively reviewed. Narratives, semi-quantitative, and quantitative variables were extracted, tabulated, and analyzed.
   Results: Out of 2330 drug-related deaths in Ontario, 58% were attributed either in whole or in part, to opioids (n = 1359). Oxycodone was involved in approximately one-third of all opioid-related deaths. At least 7% of the entire cohort used opioids that were prescribed for friends and/or family, 19% inappropriately self-administered opioids (injection, inhalation, chewed patch), 3% were recently released from jail, and 5% had been switched from one opioid to another near the time of death. Accidental deaths were significantly associated with personal history of substance abuse, enrollment in methadone maintenance programs, cirrhosis, hepatitis, and cocaine use. Suicides were significantly associated with mental illness, previous suicide attempts, chronic pain, and a history of cancer.
   Significance/Conclusion: These results identify novel, susceptible groups of opioid-users whose cause of death was related to opioids in Ontario and provide the first evidence to assist in quantifying the contribution of opioid misuse and diversion amongst opioid-related mortality in Canada. Multifaceted prevention strategies need to be developed based on subpopulations of opioid users.

TI "Do it All by Myself": A Salutogenic Approach of Masculine Health
   Practice Among Farming Men Coping With Stress

AB Farming is often considered one of the most stressful occupations. At the same time, farming men symbolically represent a strong, traditional, or hegemonic form of masculinity based on stoicism, resourcefulness, and resilience to adversity. A contrast is observed between this social representation and their health status, marked by higher levels of stress, social isolation, psychological distress, and suicide than many other subgroups of men. A salutogenic approach was taken in this study to enable the investigation of the social contexts in which farming men positively engage in health-promoting behaviors that may prevent or ameliorate mental health problems. A focus was placed on how farming men cope with stress on their own, and the relationship of this to their popular image of being resourceful and resilient. Thirty-two individual in-depth interviews with farming men and a focus group with five key informants working in rural areas within the Province of Quebec, Canada, were carried out. Self-distraction and cognitive strategies emerged as the most relevant for participants. Notably, taking work breaks conflicted with the discourse of the "relentless worker" that farmers are expected to be. Pathways to positive coping and recovery implied an ambivalence between contemplation of strategies aligned with negative aspects of traditional masculinity norms in North America and strategies aligned with more positive, progressive aspects of these norms based on the importance of family and work life balance. Health promotion and future research should investigate how various positive masculine practices can be aligned with farmers' health and well-being and that of their family.

AB Objective: There is an increased incidence of some mental health disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in some members of the military and in some public safety personnel (PSP) such as firefighters, police officers, paramedics, and dispatchers. Upon retirement from the armed forces, many individuals go on to second careers as PSP. Individuals with prior military experience may be at even greater risk than nonveterans for developing mental health disorders. The present study was designed to examine the relationship between prior military service and symptoms of mental health disorders in PSP. Methods: This is a cross-sectional, observational study. Data for this study were collected from an anonymous, web-based, self-report survey of PSP in Canada. Invitations to participate were sent to PSP via their professional organizations. Indications of mental disorder(s) and symptom severity were assessed using well-validated self-report screening measures. Results: Of the survey respondents who provided this information, 631 (6.8%) had prior armed forces experience; however, not all responses were complete. Ex-military PSP reported significantly more exposure to traumatic events and were approximately 1.5 times more likely to screen positive for indications of PTSD, mood, anxiety, or acute stress disorders and to have contemplated suicide than those without prior armed forces experience. Conclusions: In our study, individuals in PSP with prior service experience in the armed forces were more likely to screen positive for indicators of some mental health disorders. Accordingly, mental health practitioners should inquire about previous service in the armed forces when screening, assessing, and treating PSP.

AB Medical assistance in dying (MAiD) and palliative sedation (PS) are both legal options in Canada that may be considered by patients experiencing intolerable and unmanageable suffering. A contentious, lively debate has been ongoing in the literature regarding the similarities and differences between MAiD and PS. The aim of this paper is to explore the propositions that MAiD and PS are essentially similar and conversely that MAiD and PS are distinctly different. The relevance of such a debate is apparent for clinicians and patients alike. Understanding the complex and multi-faceted nuances between PS and MAiD allows patients and caregivers to make more informed decisions pertaining to end-of-life care. It is hoped that this paper will also serve to foster further debate and consideration of the issues associated with PS and MAiD with a view to improve patient care and the quality of both living and dying in Canada.

TI Payment incentives for community-based psychiatric care in Ontario,
   Canada
SO CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article

   PHYSICIANS; IMPACT
AB BACKGROUND: In September 2011, the government of Ontario implemented payment incentives to encourage the delivery of community-based psychiatric care to patients after discharge from a psychiatric hospital admission and to those with a recent suicide attempt. We evaluated whether these incentives affected supply of psychiatric services and access to care.
   METHODS: We used administrative data to capture monthly observations for all psychiatrists who practised in Ontario between September 2009 and August 2014. We conducted interrupted time-series analyses of psychiatrist-level and patient-level data to evaluate whether the incentives affected the quantity of eligible outpatient services delivered and the likelihood of receiving follow-up care.
   RESULTS: Among 1921 psychiatrists evaluated, implementation of the incentive payments was not associated with increased provision of follow-up visits after discharge from a psychiatric hospital admission (mean change in visits per month per psychiatrist 0.0099, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.0989 to 0.1206; change in trend 0.0032, 95% CI -0.0035 to 0.0095) or after a suicide attempt (mean change -0.0910, 95% CI -0.1885 to 0.0026; change in trend 0.0102, 95% CI 0.0045 to 0.0159). There was also no change in the probability that patients received follow-up care after discharge (change in level -0.0079, 95% CI -0.0223 to 0.0061; change in trend 0.0007, 95% CI -0.0003 to 0.0016) or after a suicide attempt (change in level 0.0074, 95% CI -0.0094 to 0.0366; change in trend 0.0006, 95% CI -0.0007 to 0.0022).
   INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that implementation of the incentives did not increase access to follow-up care for patients after discharge from a psychiatric hospital admission or after a suicide attempt, and the incentives had no effect on supply of psychiatric services. Further research to guide design and implementation of more effective incentives is warranted.

AB The goal of the study is to examine how location (nationally, compared to Canadian regions) is related to indicators of a hostile school environment for sexual minority youth, particularly when physical abuse is used as the outcome variable. Data representing 5,766 Canadian students were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate techniques. Results from the multivariate analyses showed that non-physical abuse was the most significant predictor of homophobically based physical abuse, for both LGBQ and non-LGBQ students. Findings reiterate the importance of considering the progression of harmful events as an escalation of violence as well as the need to view homophobic bullying as having a significant impact on all students. Finally, while the presence of homophobia is prevalent across all Canadian regions, there are, nevertheless, many regional differences, which could be used to inform region-specific action plans.

AB This paper provides a comprehensive historical and contemporary picture of filicide in Canada for more than half a century. Focusing on 1,612 children under age 18 that were killed by their parents between 1961 and 2011, regional and temporal trends in the gender of accused are examined as well as differences in maternal and paternal filicides by the gender and age of the victim, the age and marital status of the accused, type of parental relationship, cause of death, motive, history of family violence, and clearance status. Results show that there are significant differences in filicides by mothers and fathers. Five possible emerging trends were identified: an increasing gender gap in accused, increasing presence of relationship breakdown, growing number of cases involving stepfathers and a prior history of family violence, and declines in accused who committed suicide. Implications of these trends for interventions and prevention are discussed and future research priorities highlighted. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To compare the rate of mental disorders (i.e., mood and anxiety, substance use, psychotic disorders) and suicide attempts within the same group of women across the pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, and postpartum periods, and between this perinatal cohort and a non-perinatal reference group. Method: Data were from an administrative repository of residents in Manitoba, Canada. The perinatal cohort consisted of women aged 18 to 45 years who experienced >1 live birth pregnancy between 2011 and 2014 (n = 45,362). Pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, and postpartum periods were defined over consecutive 40-week intervals. The non-perinatal cohort consisted of age-matched women with no pregnancies during the same period (n = 139,705). A reference 40-week interval was defined from the individual's birthdate in the year they entered the cohort. Rate ratios of diagnosed mental disorders were adjusted (aRR) for demographic factors, parity, and mental health history. Results: Within the perinatal cohort, pregnancy was associated with a lower rate of diagnosed mood or anxiety disorder, substance use disorder, and suicide attempt relative to pre-pregnancy (aRR range, 0.22-0.82). Pregnancy also had lower rates of all outcomes compared with the postpartum period (aRR, 0.44-0.87). Postpartum had a higher rate of psychotic disorder compared with pre-pregnancy (aRR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.17-2.21), but a lower rate of mood or anxiety disorder and suicide attempt. Compared with non-perinatal women, pregnancy was associated with lower rates of all outcomes (aRR range, 0.25-0.87). Conclusions: Compared with a non-perinatal period, the rate of a diagnosed mental disorder is lower during pregnancy but begins to rise in the postpartum period, highlighting an important period for early identification and rapid access to intervention.

AB Objectives: To identify factors associated with repeat emergency department (ED) presentations for suicide-related behaviors (SRB) hereafter referred to as repetition among children/youth to aid secondary prevention initiatives. To compare rates of repetition in children/youth with substantiated maltreatment requiring removal from their parental home with their peers in the general population.
   Methods: A population-based (retrospective) cohort study was established for children/youth with a first ED SRB presentation at risk for repetition in the Province of Ontario, Canada between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2008. Children/youth legally removed from their parental home because of substantiated maltreatment (n=179) and their population-based peers (n = 6,305) were individually linked to administrative health care records over time to ascertain social, demographic, and clinical information and subsequent ED presentations for SRB during follow-up. These children/youth were described and their repetition-free probabilities over time compared. To identify factors associated with repetition we fit multivariable, recurrent event survival analysis models stratified by repetition and present unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Results: Children/youth with substantiated maltreatment (as noted) were two times more likely to have repetition than their peers after adjustments for social, demographic, and clinical factors (conditional on prior ED SRB presentations). A number of these factors were independently associated with repetition. No one factor distinguished between having a first and second repetition nor was more strongly associated with repetition than another.
   Conclusions: The risk of repetition is higher in children with substantiated maltreatment (as noted) than their peers. No one factor stood out as predictive of repetition. Implications for secondary prevention initiatives include a non-selective approach, sensitive to family difficulties and the need to better contextualize repetition and harness data linkages.

AB Substantial media attention has focused on suicide among Canadian Public Safety Personnel (PSP; e.g., correctional workers, dispatchers, firefighters, paramedics, police). The attention has raised significant concerns about the mental health impact of public safety service, as well as interest in the correlates for risk of suicide. There have only been two published studies assessing lifetime suicidal behaviois among Canadian PSP. The current study was designed to assess past-year and lifetime suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts amongst a large diverse sample of Canadian PSP. Estimates of suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts were derived from self-reported data from a nationally administered online survey. Participants included 5,148 PSP (33.4% women) grouped into six categories (i.e., Call Centre Operators/Dispatchers, Correctional Workers, Firefighters. Municipal/Provincial Police, Paramedics, Royal Canadian Mounted Police). Substantial proportions of participants reported past-year and lifetime suicidal ideation (10.1%, 27.89%), planning (4.1 %, 13.3%), or attempts (0.4%, 4.6%). Women reported significantly more lifetime suicidal behaviors than men (ORs = 1.15 to 2.62). Significant differences were identified across PSP categories in reports of past-year and lifetime suicidal behaviois. The proportion of Canadian PSP reporting past-year and lifetime suicidal behaviors was substantial. The estimates for lifetime suicidal behaviors appear consistent with or higher than previously published international PSP estimates, and higher than reports fiom the general population. Municipal/ Provincial Police reported the lowest frequency for past-year and lifetime suicidal behaviors, whereas Correctional Workers and Paramedics reported the highest. The results provide initial evidence that substantial portions of diverse Canadian PSP experience suicidal behaviors, therein warranting additional resources and research.

AB Objective: This study attempted to determine if Housing First (HF) decreased suicidal ideation and attempts compared to treatment as usual (TAU) amongst homeless persons with mental disorders, a population with a demonstrably high risk of suicidal behaviour.
   Method: The At Home/Chez Soi project is an unblinded, randomised control trial conducted across 5 Canadian cities (Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal, Moncton) from 2009 to 2013. Homeless adults with a diagnosed major mental health disorder were recruited through community agencies and randomised to HF (n = 1265) and TAU (n = 990). HF participants were provided with private housing units and received case management support services. TAU participants retained access to existing community supports. Past-month suicidal ideation was measured at baseline and 6, 12, 18, and 21/24 months. A history of suicide attempts was measured at baseline and the 21/24-month follow-up.
   Results: Compared to baseline, there was an overall trend of decreased past-month suicidal ideation (estimate = -. 57, SE =.05, P < 0.001), with no effect of treatment group (i.e., HF vs. TAU; estimate = -. 04, SE =.06, P = 0.51). Furthermore, there was no effect of treatment status (estimate = -. 10, SE =.16, P = 0.52) on prevalence of suicide attempts (HF = 11.9%, TAU = 10.5%) during the 2-year follow-up period.
   Conclusion: This study failed to find evidence that HF is superior to TAU in reducing suicidal ideation and attempts. We suggest that HF interventions consider supplemental psychological treatments that have proven efficacy in reducing suicidal behaviour. It remains to be determined what kind of suicide prevention interventions (if any) are specifically effective in further reducing suicidal risk in a housing-first intervention.

AB In many ways, male farmers can be considered to be a vulnerable group in relation to mental health, experiencing high rates of suicide, psychological distress and low use of health services. This study highlights important connections between rurality, farming and masculinities in the context of men's mental health. In-depth interviews with 32 male farmers from Quebec, Canada were completed focusing on stress and coping strategies. Findings include informal and formal strategies. Many participants had previous positive experience of formal help and would be willing to use such help again and to recommend it to others in need. Those without such experience are sceptical about services but recognise the courage it requires to seek help. Pride and lack of knowledge about services are the main barriers to help-seeking, but it can be legitimated in certain contexts, such as divorce or other psychosocial crisis, and by alignment with particular male ideals. Role models at national or local levels can also help farmers prioritise their own and their family's wellbeing over stigmas and rigid, traditional masculine ideals. Furthermore, gender-based strengths and recommendations for practice are also discussed.

AB Background: Major and minor depression is frequent in older medical inpatients, but the prognosis of these two disorders is not clear, The current study proposed to determine the prognosis of major and minor depression in this population. Method: This prospective, observational cohort study, conducted in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, involved assessment of 380 elderly medical inpatients with major, minor, or no depression at three, six, and 12 months after enrollment using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria. Information on suicide attempts, completed suicides, and potential prognostic factors was also collected. Analysis of outcomes and potential prognostic factors involved descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression. Results: Among patients with major depression at enrollment, 13% were recovered, 14% were partially recovered, and 73% remained depressed with a protracted stable or protracted fluctuating course. Among patients with minor depression, 28% were recovered and 72% bad a protracted course. Patients diagnosed with major depression at enrollment often bad minor depression at follow up and vice versa. Conclusion: The prognosis of both major and minor depression in older medical inpatients is poor and worse than previously thought.

AB Suicide and parasuicides (i.e. suicidal ideation and suicidal attempt) have long been recognized as serious social problems, especially among youth. A series of logistic regression models were developed incorporating various internalizing and externalizing risk factors experienced by young people with the goal of predicting parasuicides among Canadian youth. The main objective of the research is to determine whether or not there are significant sex differences between these internalizing and externalizing influences on suicidal behavior. Data were used from the National Longitudinal Study of Children and Youth-Waves 3 through 6, for a total sample of 2,499 15-year olds (48.9% male). Results show that both suicidal ideation and attempt are more frequent for girls compared to boys. Contrary to expectations, externalizing problems had a greater impact on girls and internalizing problems had a marginally greater impact on boys. This casts doubt on the notion that "bad boys" and "sad girls" are at greater risk for suicidal behavior. These results are discussed in light of their substantive importance, policy implications, and suggestions for future research.

ID INCOME INEQUALITY; POPULATION HEALTH; ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; DETERMINANT;
   TRENDS
AB We investigate whether changes in economic inequality affect mortality in rich countries. To answer this question we use a new source of data on income inequality: tax data on the share of pretax income going to the richest 10% of the population in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US between 1903 and 2003. Although this measure is not a good proxy for inequality within the bottom half of the income distribution, it is a good proxy for changes in the top half of the distribution and for the Gini coefficient. In the absence of country and year fixed effects, the income share of the top decile is negatively related to life expectancy and positively related to infant mortality. However, in our preferred fixed-effects specification these relationships are weak, statistically insignificant, and likely to change their sign. Nor do our data suggest that changes in the income share of the richest 10% affect homicide or suicide rates. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of the present study was to evaluate gender differences-in a representative sample of adult Canadians-in 12-month mental health consultation among (a) the general population (n = 86,043), (b) those with major depressive disorder (n = 1,673), and (c) those with suicide ideation (n = 228). Data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), 2009-2010 (Statistics Canada, 2011a), a representative sample of Canadians, were used. Only respondents 15 years or older and who indicated that they had or had not consulted with a health professional for a mental health concern were included. Logistic regression was employed to evaluate gender differences in any mental health consultation and by specific health professional types consulted, while controlling for potentially confounding variables (e. g., demographics, psychological distress). The same analytic method was used to evaluate gender differences in number of consultations. Among all Canadians, women more frequently consulted all types of health professionals for a mental health reason. However, the magnitude of that difference varied by the concern and provider type. Overall, the greatest gender differences were among those with suicide ideation. Similarly, men had fewer consultations across mental health concerns. Findings demonstrate how gender differences in mental health consultation vary depending on the type of provider and the mental health concern. This knowledge helps identify populations of emphasis for interventions that aim to reduce stigma surrounding specific mental health concerns and consulting specific types of health professionals.

AB Objective: To estimate the financial burden of schizophrenia in Canada in 2004.
   Methods:A prevalence-based cost-of-illness (COI) approach was used. The primary sources of information for the study included a review of the published literature, a review of published reports and documents, secondary analysis of administrative datasets, and information collected directly from various federal and provincial government programs and services. The literature review included publications up to April 2005 reported in MedLine, EMBASE and PsychINFO. Where specific information from a province was not available, the method of mean substitution from other provinces was used. Costs incurred by various levels/departments of government were separated into healthcare and non-healthcare costs. Also included in the analysis was the value of lost productivity for premature mortality and morbidity associated with schizophrenia. Sensitivity analysis was used to test major cost assumptions used in the analysis. Where possible, all resource utilization estimates for the financial burden of schizophrenia were obtained for 2004 and are expressed in 2004 Canadian dollars (CAN$).
   Results: The estimated number of persons with schizophrenia in Canada in 2004 was 234305 (95% Cl, 136 201-333 402). The direct healthcare and non-healthcare costs were estimated to be CAN$2.02 billion in 2004. There were 374 deaths attributed to schizophrenia. This combined with the high unemployment rate due to schizophrenia resulted in an additional productivity morbidity and mortality loss estimate of CAN$4.83 billion, for a total cost estimate in 2004 of CAN$6.85 billion. By far the largest component of the total cost estimate was for productivity losses associated with morbidity in schizophrenia (70% of total costs) and the results showed that total cost estimates were most sensitive to alternative assumptions regarding the additional unemployment due to schizophrenia in Canada.
   Conclusions: Despite significant improvements in the past decade in pharmacotherapy, programs and services available for patients with schizophrenia, the economic burden of schizophrenia in Canada remains high. The most significant factor affecting the cost of schizophrenia in Canada is lost productivity due to morbidity. Programs targeted at improving patient symptoms and functioning to increase workforce participation has the potential to make a significant contribution in reducing the cost of this severe mental illness in Canada.

AB Psychiatric hospitalizations, completed suicides, and suicide attempts are rare after predictive testing for Huntington's disease (HD). Case studies have shown that major depression can be a consequence of being tested, although no studies have shown how common this is. The present study evaluated the prevalence of major depression during the first year after disclosure. We conducted retrospective data and chart reviews of 153 persons (50 testing positive, 103 testing negative) evaluated every 3 months for depression. There was no significant baseline difference in the percentage of "positives" and "negatives" who had pre-testing major depressive episodes (14% vs. 12%, respectively). A senior psychiatrist reviewed data from the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Change Version, from the Beck Depression Inventory, and from clinical notes for every follow-up contact completed. The I-year prevalence of major depression among positives was 6.0%, compared to 3.0% among negatives (p = 0.30), and an estimated 3% population prevalence. One-year prevalence of clinically significant depressive symptoms, whether or not major depression was diagnosed, was 20.0% in positives and 12.6% in negatives (p = 0.17). Although not statistically significant, depressive symptoms and major depression occurred more frequently among those who tested positive. Despite some evidence to the contrary, including our own studies, a positive predictive test for HD is not psychologically benign. Clinical testing programs should assess patients for depressive symptoms after testing, and patients with clinically significant complaints should be referred to a mental health professional.

   Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD)
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF HOSPITAL PHARMACY

DT Article
DE medical assistance in dying; assisted suicide; hospital pharmacists;
   pharmacy technicians; pharmacy assistants
AB Background: In February 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that it was unconstitutional to prohibit physicians from assisting in a patient's consensual death, thereby setting the groundwork for the legalization of medical assistance in dying (MAiD). Much of the research on this topic has focused on physicians, although other health care professionals will be involved in the process, including pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and pharmacy assistants. In many provinces, the medications required for MAiD will be dispensed from hospital pharmacies, which will result in direct involvement of hospital pharmacy staff.
   Objectives: The primary objective was to investigate the knowledge and attitudes of hospital pharmacy staff in Canada regarding MAiD. The secondary objective was to determine the factors that might influence those opinions.
   Methods: A 34-question web-based survey was available for 6 weeks during early 2017 to hospital pharmacy staff throughout Canada. For most questions, responses were based on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree". Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data.
   Results: A total of 1040 valid survey responses were received: 607 from pharmacists, 273 from pharmacy technicians, and 160 from pharmacy assistants. Most respondents were supportive of MAiD; however, nearly all respondents (99% [601/607] of pharmacists, 73% [315/431] of technicians and assistants]) reported lacking comprehensive education on the topic. Despite high levels of overall support, pharmacists tended to be less supportive of MAiD than pharmacy technicians or assistants. Factors that influenced opinions included strong religious beliefs, region, and knowledge of provincial and federal legislation.
   Conclusions: The majority of respondents, particularly technicians and assistants, were supportive of MAiD, but most respondents lacked education about the topic.

AB Some jurisdictions that have decriminalized assisted dying (like Canada) exclude psychiatric patients on the grounds that their condition cannot be determined to be irremediable, that they are vulnerable and in need of protection, or that they cannot be determined to be competent. We review each of these claims and find that none have been sufficiently well-supported to justify the differential treatment psychiatric patients experience with respect to assisted dying. We find bans on psychiatric patients' access to this service amount to arbitrary discrimination. Proponents of banning the practice ignore or overlook alternatives to their proposal, like an assisted dying regime with additional safeguards. Some authors have further criticized assisted dying for psychiatric patients by highlighting allegedly problematic practices in those countries which allow it. We address recent evidence from the Netherlands, showing that these problems are either misrepresented or have straightforward solutions. Even if one finds such evidence troubling despite our analysis, other jurisdictions need not adopt every feature of the Dutch system.

AB Aspects of social integration including religion and residential stability have often been found to serve as protective factors against suicide in sociological analyses. However, empirical research on Canadian indigenous suicidality has neglected these dimensions of integration. The present study fills this gap, while controlling for other major predictors of suicide ideation (SI). Methods: Data are from a national representative sample (N = 15,294) from the 2012 Aboriginal Peoples Survey. The dependent variable is a dichotomy: lifetime prevalence of SI. Measures of social integration include religious affiliation, marital status, family ties, and residential stability. Controls are incorporated for alternative predictors of SI including psychiatric symptoms (e.g., mood disorder), economic strain, ethnicity, and demographics. Results: Findings from a multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed an association between SI and most measures of social integration (e.g., married persons were 14% less apt to report SI than non married persons), but not with religious affiliation. Further, each unit increase in income reduced the risk of SI by 3.8%. Psychiatric symptoms increased risk of SI (e.g., mood disorder, OR = 3.16, substance abuse, OR = 2.38), and Inuit ethnicity increased SI risk by 57% (OR = 1.57). The model explained 26.1% of the variance in SI. Conclusions: Generally, measures of social integration, psychiatric symptoms, and economic strain predicted SI. However, there was no evidence that religion acted as a protective factor against SI. Future research is needed on other dimensions of religion such as self-reported religiousness, which may protect against suicidality.

AB Background: Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD) was legalized in Canada in June 2016. There are no documented experiences of MAiD provision within a home palliative care program. The majority of palliative care physicians in Canada object to MAiD. As one of the largest home-based palliative care providers in Canada, the Temmy Latner Centre for Palliative Care (TLCPC) developed processes to implement MAiD provision within a home palliative care team with diverse attitudes toward MAiD. Objective: To demonstrate the feasibility of providing MAiD within a home palliative care setting and describe the population that received MAiD in the first year of legalization. Design: A retrospective chart review identified patients who received or were assessed for MAiD and had a known outcome between June 17, 2016 and June 30, 2017. Setting/Subjects: Patients receiving home-based palliative care. Measurements: Data extracted included age, gender, primary diagnosis, length of time receiving home-based palliative care, and final clinical outcome. Results: Of the 45 patients who were assessed for MAiD, 27 (60%) received MAiD and 18 (40%) did not. The mean age was 74 (range 20-95), 24 (53%) were male, and 33 (73%) had cancer as a primary diagnosis. These 27 patients represent 1.2% of our total patient population during this time period. Conclusions: MAiD was accessed by 1.2% of the patients within a home palliative care center in the first year of legalization. Patient demographics were consistent with those documented elsewhere.

TI The nature and scope of gambling in Canada
SO ADDICTION
LA English
DT Article
DE problem gambling prevention and treatment; gambling regulation; gambling
   legislation; Gambling expansion
AB Aims
   This paper provides a historical review of gambling in Canada and examines the benefits and shortcomings of present-day Canadian gambling policies and practices. This includes a discussion of provincial and federal government roles in gambling regulation and an overview of problem gambling prevention and treatment initiatives.
   Methods
   The gambling studies literature was probed for pertinent information on factors such as historical development, legislative changes, economic conditions and cultural influences that have affected gambling participation and social responsibility strategies in Canada.
   Results
   Two major Criminal Code of Canada amendments (in 1969 and 1985) were pivotal in Canadian gambling expansion. The first decriminalized lotteries and casinos, while the second allowed electronic gambling devices and authorized provinces to operate and regulate gambling. These changes resulted in a radical gambling expansion which, in addition to raising provincial revenues, created public policy concerns. Varying provincial government interpretations of the ambiguous Criminal Code gambling statutes led to a lack of uniformity in how provinces regulate and operate gambling; when gambling expanded, there were no legislative safeguards in place to deal with the personal and societal effects of problem gambling. Subsequent programs designed to prevent and treat problem gambling have not been overly effective.
   Conclusions
   Canadian provinces have a monopoly on gambling within their borders and treat the activity as a profit-driven business enterprise. Problems associated with widespread gambling such as addiction, increased crime, bankruptcy and suicide are seen as minor concerns and not addressed in an aggressive fashion. Given the Canadian federal government's detachment from gambling policy and Canadian provinces' heavy reliance on gambling revenues, little change in the Canadian gambling landscape is anticipated in the near future.

LA English
DT Review
DE child; adolescent; mental health; policies
ID PREVALENCE; DISORDERS; SUICIDE
AB Objective: Child and adolescent mental disorders are common, with a substantial disease burden, yet services for young people are nationally inadequate. As services should be based on policies and (or) plans, we analyzed the availability and content of child and adolescent mental health policies and plans in all provinces and territories.
   Method: The World Health Organization (WHO) framework for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Policy and Plans was applied.
   Results: Four provinces in Canada have a child and adolescent mental health policy and (or) plan. The other provinces do not have a policy or plan in place, or else try to integrate these components into existing mental health strategies. Among the policies and plans that exist, there is substantial variability regarding content as well as degree of adherence to the WHO template. Five essential content areas: legislation and human rights, information systems, quality improvement, improving access to and use of psychotropics, and human resource development and training are poorly or very poorly addressed in existing policies and (or) plans.
   Conclusion: This lack of specific policy and (or) plans for child and adolescent mental health care and the variability of content in plans that exist may help explain why child and adolescent mental health services are poorly developed across Canada. We suggest that a national child and adolescent mental health policy framework be developed for Canada so that the provinces and territories may be encouraged to create or amend their current child and adolescent mental health frameworks in a manner that may enhance national cohesion and commonly addresses service needs in this population.

AB Introduction: Mortality data by occupation are not routinely available in Canada, so we analyzed census-linked data to examine cause-specific mortality rates across groups of occupations ranked by skill level.
   Methods: A 15% sample of 1991 Canadian Census respondents aged 25 years or older was previously linked to 16 years of mortality data (1991-2006). The current analysis is based on 2.3 million people aged 25 to 64 years at cohort inception, among whom there were 164 332 deaths during the follow-up period. Occupations coded according to the National Occupation Classification were grouped into five skill levels. Age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs), rate ratios (RRs), rate differences (RDs) and excess mortality were calculated by occupational skill level for various causes of death.
   Results: ASMRs were clearly graded by skill level: they were highest among those employed in unskilled jobs (and those without an occupation) and lowest for those in professional occupations. All-cause RRs for men were 1.16, 1.40, 1.63 and 1.83 with decreasing occupational skill level compared with professionals. For women the gradient was less steep: 1.23, 1.24, 1.32 and 1.53. This gradient was present for most causes of death. Rate ratios comparing lowest to highest skill levels were greater than 2 for HIV/AIDS, diabetes mellitus, suicide and cancer of the cervix as well as for causes of death associated with tobacco use and excessive alcohol consumption.
   Conclusion: Mortality gradients by occupational skill level were evident for most causes of death. These results provide detailed cause-specific baseline indicators not previously available for Canada.

TI Non-communicable disease and injury-related mortality on rural and urban
   place of residence - A comparison between Canada and Australia
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SANTE PUBLIQUE
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH; US; WOMEN
AB Background: Few published studies looking at cross-national comparisons of rural-urban health status are available. As a first step towards addressing the lack of information on how rural populations in Canada compare with rural populations elsewhere in the world, this paper examines and contrasts Canadian mortality risks of selected diseases in rural and urban areas with those of Australia.
   Methods: Age-standardized mortality ratios for selected causes of deaths were calculated at the national level and broken down into place of residence categories using country-specific definitions of rurality (Metropolitan Influence Zones in Canada and the Australian Standard Geographical Classification [ASGC] Remoteness in Australia).
   Results: Patterns of rural-urban mortality risk were mostly similar in both countries. However, depending on the causes of death examined, important differences were found Mortality from motor vehicle accidents, suicide and a few cancer sites showed similar urban-rural gradients in both Canada and Australia. Notable differences were found for diabetes, all cancers combined, as well as lung and colorectal cancer. Rural Australians were at higher risk of dying from these diseases than their urban counterparts, whereas rural Canadians were at lower risk than urban Canadians.
   Discussion: Overall, the patterns that have emerged from this comparison of Canadian and Australian mortality risks suggest that health status disparities between rural and urban populations are not limited to a specific country or region of the world. However, there are also important differences between the two countries, as the geographic mortality patterns varied according to sex and according to disease category. This analysis is an initial step in promoting discussion of rural health in an international context.

AB IMPORTANCE There have been concerns raised by patients and regulatory agencies regarding serious psychiatric adverse effects associated with 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors.
   OBJECTIVE To determine if there is an increased risk of suicide, self-harm, or depression among older men starting a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor for prostatic enlargement.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A population-based, retrospective, matched cohort study using linked administrative data for 93 197 men ages 66 years or older (median [IQR] age, 75 [70-80] years) in Ontario, Canada, who initiated a new prescription for a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor during the study period (2003 through 2013). Participants were matched (using a propensity score that included 44 of our 96 covariates that included medical comorbidities, medication usage, and health care system utilization) to an equal number of men not prescribed a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor. EXPOSURES Duration of finasteride or dutasteride usage.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Suicide. Secondary outcomeswere self-harm and depression.
   RESULTS Men who used 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors were not at a significantly increased risk of suicide (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.53-1.45). Risk of self-harm was significantly increased during the initial 18 months after 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor initiation (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.34-2.64), but not thereafter. Incident depression risk was elevated during the initial 18 months after 5a-reductase inhibitor initiation (HR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.73-2.16), and continued to be elevated, but to a lesser degree, for the remainder of the follow-up period (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.08-1.37). The absolute increases in the event rates for these 2 outcomes were 17 per 100 000 patient-years and 237 per 100 000 patient-years, respectively. The type of 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor (finasteride or dutasteride) did not significantly modify the observed associations with suicide, self-harm, and depression.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a large cohort of men ages 66 years or older, we did not demonstrate an increased risk of suicide associated with 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor use. However, the risk of self-harm and depression were increased compared with unexposed men. This is in keeping with postmarketing experience and patient concerns, and discontinuation of the medication in these circ umstancesmay be appropriate.

AB Background: Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug. In the general population, its use has been linked to a heightened propensity for suicidal behavior (SB). We hypothesize that this association varies in patients with psychiatric disorders. SB is known to vary by sex and therefore an investigation of cannabis' association with SB must consider sex differences. The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between cannabis use and suicide attempts in men and women with psychiatric disorders.
   Methods: We merged data collected for two studies based in Ontario, Canada (n = 985). We employed a multivariable logistic regression to assess the association between cannabis use and suicide attempts in men and women with psychiatric disorders.
   Results: We analyzed data from 465 men and 444 women. Amongst these, 112 men and 158 women had attempted suicide. The average age of our participants was 40 years (standard deviation (SD) 12.4). We found no significant association between suicide attempts and cannabis use in men (odds ratio (OR) = 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81, 2.22, p = 0.260) or women (OR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.61, 1.54, p = 0.884). In a sensitivity analysis using a sample of patients with substance use disorder only, the heaviness of cannabis use was associated with small but significant association with SB in men (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.01, 1.05, p = 0.007).
   Conclusion: Our findings indicate that there is no association between cannabis use and suicidal behavior in men or women with psychiatric disorders unlike what was reported for the general population, though the heaviness of cannabis use may have an effect in men. The impact of cannabis use in psychiatric disorders needs ongoing examination in light of its common use, impending legalization with expected increased access and the uncertainty about cannabis' effects on prognosis of psychiatric disorders. In addition, research should continue to investigate modifiable risk factors of SB in this population of which cannabis is not a significant factor based on this study.

AB The conceptualization of assisted death as an act performed by physicians has resulted in a lack of attention to nurses' roles and experiences with the processes that surround an assisted death. In this article, we synthesize evidence from 6 articles focusing on the experiences of 55 nurses from Canada, Belgium, and the Netherlands, with relevant ethical and policy implications derived from the literature. Nurses have a central role in negotiating inquiries about assisted death and in providing wraparound care for patients, families, and other health care providers. This role is impactful for nurses and requires significant personal and professional moral work.

AB The article aimed to characterize pathological gambling, showing the main consequences of this disorder. Bibliographic survey on this theme was conducted, covering both national and international literature. Publications whose main findings emphasized related prevalence, social and economic costs, gambling legalization and resulting impact on public health, were selected. High suicide rate, comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders, family and work problems, and illicit behavior were consequences reported. The prevalence of this disorder is higher in countries that have legalized gambling and in Brazil there is evidence of growth in the number of pathological gamblers. The development of national research is fundamental to define public policies that are adequate for the Brazilian context.

AB The consideration of laypeople's views of conditions under which euthanasia is justifiable is important for policy decisions. In an online survey of US respondents, we examined how patient's symptoms influence justifiability of euthanasia. Euthanasia was judged more justifiable for conditions associated with physical suffering and negative impact on other people. The weight given to physical suffering and negative impact on others in evaluation of justifiability of euthanasia also differed based on personal characteristics. The results suggest that public discourse about medical assistance in dying should take into account differences in its perceived justifiability for patients with different conditions.

The authors reviewed all consecutive coroners' files on these cases and found that 27 mothers and 37 fathers were the victims of parricide. The sample included 56 perpetrators: 52 sons and 4 daughters; 9 cases of double parricide were found. Approximately 15 percent of the perpetrators (8/56) attempted suicide following the parricide. A psychiatric motive (stemming from depression or psychotic illness) was determined for 65.5 percent (36/56) of the perpetrators, and 67 percent of them had a psychotic disorder. Similarities and differences were found between cases of matricide and patricide.

AB Scant research has addressed health and well-being among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) persons in the Arctic. The Northwest Territories (NWT) has among Canada's highest rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). LGBTQ persons in NWT are at the nexus of LGBTQ and Arctic health disparities. Yet little is known of their sexual health needs. This qualitative study explored the sexual health needs of LGBTQ persons in the NWT. We conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 51 participants, including 16 LGBTQ youth aged 15-24, 21 LGBTQ adults aged 25 and above, and 14 key informants who worked with LGBTQ persons. Social-ecological approaches to understanding sexual health guided this study. Participants discussed how structural contexts such as heteronormativity in sexual health education and a lack of access to safer sex tools constrained their ability to practice safer sex. Social contexts of intersectional stigma resulted in shame, concealing identities, and fear of accessing safer sex materials. Myriad factors influenced partner communication about safer sex practices, including honesty, consent, and relationship power. Findings suggest the need for comprehensive sexuality education and interventions that address syndemics of substance use, stigma, and low self-esteem to advance sexual health among LGBTQ persons in Northern Canada.

LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; EUTHANASIA; SUICIDE; ATTITUDES; DEATH
AB Background: Canada legalized assisted dying with the passing of Bill C-14, Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD), in June 2016. This legislation has implications for health care professionals participating in MAiD. This research aims to understand the effect that MAiD has on pharmacists and pharmacy technicians in Canada.
   Methods: We conducted a thematic document analysis of pharmacy guidelines, position statements and standards of practice from pharmacy regulatory authorities across Canada. In addition, the Ontario Pharmacists Association surveyed its members (including pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and pharmacy students) about their perceptions of MAiD.
   Results: Our thematic analysis of the reviewed documents resulted in 3 major themes: pharmacists' role in quality assurance, practice considerations when implementing MAiD and resources for pharmacy staff involved in MAiD. Survey responses illustrated that most (68%) pharmacy staff would dispense MAiD medications. Nonetheless, many respondents perceived that they lacked knowledge or comfort with different aspects of the MAiD process. Overall, 80% of participants reported a desire for professional development about MAiD.
   Conclusion: Despite the rapidly changing landscape surrounding medical assistance in dying within the past year, most pharmacy regulatory authorities have provided direction and resources to their pharmacists. Ontario pharmacists and pharmacy technicians are willing to dispense MAiD medications; however, additional support in the form of professional development may be necessary based on participants' desire for education coupled with their perceived lack of knowledge. Future research may focus on the efficacy of provincial guidelines in supporting pharmacists' participation in MAiD.

AB Background Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID) in Canada came into effect in 2016 with the passing of Bill C-14. As patient interest and requests for MAID continue to evolve in Canada, it is important to understand the attitudes of future providers and the factors that may influence their participation. Attitudes towards physician hastened death (PHD) in general and the specific provision of MAID (e.g., causing death by lethal prescription or injection) are unknown among Canadian residents. This study examined residents' attitudes towards PHD and MAID, and identified factors (e.g., demographics, clinical exposure to death and dying) that may influence their decision to participate in PHD and provide MAID. Methods A cross-sectional survey was adapted from prior established surveys on MAID to reflect the Canadian setting. All Canadian family medicine programs were invited to participate. The survey was distributed between December 2016 and April 2017. Analysis of the results included descriptive statistics to characterize the survey participants and multivariable logistic regressions to identify factors that may influence residents' attitudes towards PHD and MAID. Results Overall, 247 residents from 6 family medicine training programs in Canada participated (response rate of 27%). While residents were most willing to participate in treatment withdrawal (52%), active participation in PHD (41%) and MAID by prescription of a lethal drug (31%) and lethal injection (24%) were less acceptable. Logistic regressions identified religion as a consistent and significant factor impacting residents' willingness to participate in PHD and MAID. Residents who were not strictly practicing a religion were more likely to be willing to participate in PHD (OR = 17.38, p < 0.001) and MAID (lethal drug OR = 10.55, p < 0.01, lethal injection OR = 8.54, p < 0.05). Increased clinical exposure to death and dying crudely correlated with increased willingness to participate in PHD and MAID, but when examined in multivariable models, only a few activities (e.g., declaring death, completing a death certificate) had a statistically significant association. Other significant factors included the residents' sex and location of training. Conclusions Residents are hesitant to provide MAID themselves, with religious faith being a major factor impacting their decision.

AB Recent Indigenist scholarship has situated high rates of traumatic life experiences, including sexual abuse, among Indigenous peoples of North America within the larger context of their status as colonized peoples. Sexual abuse has been linked to many negative health outcomes including mental, sexual and drug-related vulnerabilities. There is a paucity of research in Canada addressing the relationship between antecedent sexual abuse and negative health outcomes among Aboriginal people including elevated risk of HIV infection. The primary objectives of this study were to determine factors associated with sexual abuse among participants of the Cedar Project, a cohort of young Aboriginal people between the ages of 14 and 30 years who use injection and non-injection drugs in two urban centres in British Columbia, Canada; and to locate findings through a lens of historical and intergenerational trauma. We utilized post-colonial perspectives in research design, problem formulation and the interpretation of results. Multivariate modeling was used to determine the extent to which a history of sexual abuse was predictive of negative health outcomes and vulnerability to HIV infection. Of the 543 eligible participants, 48% reported ever having experienced sexual abuse; 69% of sexually abused participants were female. The median age of first sexual abuse was 6 years for both female and male participants. After adjusting for sociodemographic variables and factors of historical trauma, sexually abused participants were more likely to have ever been on the streets for more than three nights, to have ever self-harmed, to have suicide ideation, to have attempted suicide, to have a diagnosis of mental illness. to have been in the emergency department within the previous 6 months, to have had over 20 lifetime sexual partners, to have ever been paid for sex and to have ever overdosed. The prevalence and consequences of sexual abuse among Cedar Project participants are of grave concern. Sexual trauma will continue to impact individuals, families and communities until unresolved historical trauma is meaningfully addressed in client-driven, culturally safe programming.

AB The objectives of this study were to examine the prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) among adolescents with mental health needs and specific factors associated with NSSI among adolescents aged 14 to 18 years who received mental health services in adult mental health facilities in Ontario, Canada. Data on 2,013 adolescents were obtained from the Ontario Mental Health Reporting System using the Resident Assessment Instrument-Mental Health (RAI-MH) and were analyzed using logistic regression. Approximately, 20.2% (407 adolescents) of the sample engaged in NSSI within the last 12 months. Results from multivariate logistic regression indicate that females were 2.19 times more likely to engage in NSSI than males. Intentional misuse of prescription medication emerged as the most important factor associated with NSSI. Other factors found to be associated with NSSI included multiple psychiatric admissions, sexual abuse, use of alcohol, mood disorders (e.g., depression), adjustment disorders, personality disorders and symptoms of depression. The article discusses the implications of the findings, with suggestions for future research.

AB Objective: This study aims (1) to assess physicians' attitudes toward different palliative end-of-life (EOL) practices in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) care, including forgoing artificial nutrition and hydration (FANH), continuous sedation until death (CSD), and withdrawing invasive ventilation (WIV), and toward physician-assisted dying (PAD) including physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia and (2) to explore variables influencing these attitudes. Methods: We used two clinical vignettes depicting ALS patients in different stages of their disease progression to assess the influence of suffering (physical/psycho-existential) on attitudes toward WIV and the influence of suffering and prognosis (short-term/long-term) on attitudes toward FANH, CSD, and PAD. Results: 50 physicians from European ALS centers and neurological departments completed our survey. Short-term prognosis had a positive impact on attitudes toward offering FANH (p = 0.014) and CSD (p = 0.048) as well as on attitudes toward performing CSD (p = 0.036) and euthanasia (p = 0.023). Predominantly psycho-existential suffering was associated with a more favorable attitude toward WIV but influenced attitudes toward performing CSD negatively. Regression analysis showed that religiosity was associated with more reluctant attitudes toward palliative EOL practices and PAD, whereas training in palliative care was associated with more favorable attitudes toward palliative EOL practices only. Conclusion: ALS physicians seem to acknowledge psycho-existential suffering as a highly acceptable motive for WIV but not CSD. Physicians appear to be comfortable with responding to the patient's requests, but more reluctant to assume a proactive role in the decision-making process. Palliative care training may support ALS physicians in these challenging situations.

AB Objective: Cutaneous body image (CBI) dissatisfaction, feelings of social exclusion and stigmatization have been associated with increased suicidality in dermatology patients. We examined the relation between CBI dissatisfaction and suicidal ideation in a non-clinical sample, and examined the possible mediating effect of interpersonal sensitivity (IS), a symptom dimension related to self-consciousness, feelings of inferiority and social exclusion.
   Methods: As part of a larger study, 312 community-based participants from London, Ontario, Canada (241 women, 71 men; mean +/- SD age: 38.4 +/- 14.9 years) rated their CBI satisfaction, measured with the Cutaneous Body Image Scale (Gupta MA et al., 2004). The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) (Derogatis Let al.,1982) was used to measure the constructs of suicidal ideation (4 suicide-related items from the BSI) and IS (Interpersonal Sensitivity subscale of BSI).
   Results: Assessing mediation using the Baron & Kenny (1986) model, CBI satisfaction had a significant negative effect on suicidal ideation [c = -0.316, t(296) = -5.73, p<0.001] and IS [a = -0.365, t(297) = -6.76, p<0.001]; when CBI satisfaction and IS were considered together, IS had a significant positive effect on suicidal ideation (b = .690, t(295) = 15.80, p<.001) while the effect of CBI satisfaction on suicidal ideation was no longer significant [c*=-.063, t(295) = -1.44, ns].
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest an inverse relationship between CBI satisfaction and suicidal ideation, which is mediated by IS. This relationship likely falls in a continuum between non-clinical and clinical situations, with suicide risk being greater when individuals experience greater CBI dissatisfaction and social alienation.

AB Hurricane Juan, which struck Atlantic Canada on 29 September, 2003, revealed the full extent of public vulnerability to severe weather events in Nova Scotia. In this study, 130 people were interviewed via a systematic sampling technique to examine their perception of severe weather warnings, and to determine what actions (if any) they are most likely to take when a warning has been posted. It was found that different target groups (e.g. the elderly, students) use different modes of media to obtain their severe weather information. It is recommended that forecast centres tailor their advisories for specific media sources so as best to reach various target groups. It was also found that respondents are generally satisfied with the weather warnings they receive, but there is a lack of awareness of the existence and extent of public vulnerability in Nova Scotia. The development of a comprehensive education campaign which will outline various facets of social vulnerability, while also offering recommendations on how best to lower existing social vulnerability, is critical.

   RATES; MORTALITY; SMOKING; DEATH; POPULATION; COMPONENTS
AB Over the course of the 20th century the sex differential in life expectancy at birth in the industrialized countries has widened considerably in favour of women. Starting in the early 1970s, the beginning of a reversal in the long-term pattern of this differential has been noted in some high-income countries. This study documents a sustained pattern of narrowing of this measure into the later part of the 1990s for six of the populations that comprise the G7 countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, England and Wales (as representative of the United Kingdom) and USA. For Japan, a persistence of widening sex differences in survival is noted. The sex differences in life expectancy are decomposed over roughly three decades (early 1970s to late 1990s) from the point of view of four major cause-of-death categories: circulatory diseases, cancers, accidents/violence/suicide, and,other' (residual) causes. In the six countries where the sex gap has narrowed, this has resulted primarily from reduced sex differences in circulatory disease mortality, and secondarily from reduced differences in male and female death rates due to accidents, violence and suicide combined. In some of the countries sex differentials in cancer mortality have been converging lately, and this has also contributed to a narrowing of the difference in life expectancy. In Japan, males have been less successful in reducing their survival disadvantage in relation to Japanese women with regard to circulatory disease and cancer; and in the case of accidents/violence/suicide, male death rates increased during the 1990s. These trends explain the divergent pattern of the sex difference in life expectation in Japan as compared with the other G7 nations.

AB BACKGROUND: Nonfatal injuries are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. In 2008, 14,065 patients with major trauma were hospitalized across Canada. With individuals surviving trauma, the psychosocial sequelae of severe physical injury have become an important area of research. No previous studies have used a population-based sample to estimate the incidence of suicidality (suicide or suicide attempt) following physical injury. This study aimed to assess the odds ratio (OR) of suicidality among adults with major trauma compared with a matched cohort.
   METHODS: This retrospective study included persons older than 18 years who experienced an unintentional major traumatic injury (Injury Severity Score [ISS] > 12) at a regional academic trauma center between April 1, 2001, and March 31, 2011. Individuals who had no suicide attempts in the previous 5 years were identified from the trauma registry. These individuals were matched with data from provincial administrative databases. A cohort matched in terms of age, sex, and date of indexed injury was created from the general population with five controls for each trauma case, and the rate of suicidality was compared between groups.
   RESULTS: A total of 2,198 adults with major were matched to 10,990 individuals. Suicidality was increased in the trauma cohort (OR, 4.31). This increase persisted even if adjusted for anxiety/mood disorders and substance abuse (adjusted OR1, 3.65) as well as residence, physical comorbidities, income quintile and those factors in adjusted OR1 (adjusted OR2, 3.30). All ORs were significant with p < 0.05
   CONCLUSION: Individuals who experience major traumatic injuries are at a greater risk for postinjury suicidality compared with those in a matched cohort. Copyright (C) 2014 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins

AB This narrative review highlights key issues in men's mental health and identifies approaches to research, policy and practice that respond to men's styles of coping. Issues discussed are: 1) the high incidence of male suicide (80% of suicide deaths in Canada, with a peak in the mid-50 s age group) accompanied by low public awareness; 2) the perplexing nature of male depression, manifesting in forms that are poorly recognised by current diagnostic approaches and thus poorly treated; 3) the risky use of alcohol among men, again common and taking a huge toll on mental and physical health; 4) the characteristic ways in which men manage psychological suffering, the coping strengths to be recognised, and the gaps to be addressed; 5) the underutilization of mental health services by men, and the implication for clinical outcomes; and 6) male-specific approaches to service provision designed to improve men's accessing of care, with an emphasis on Canadian programs. The main conclusion is that a high proportion of men in Western society have acquired psychological coping strategies that are often dysfunctional. There is a need for men to learn more adaptive coping approaches long before they reach a crisis point. Recommendations are made to address men's mental health through: healthcare policy that facilitates access; research on tailoring interventions to men; population-level initiatives to improve the capacity of men to cope with psychological distress; and clinical practice that is sensitive to the expression of mental health problems in men and that responds in a relevant manner.

AB Attention to power imbalances when seeking help for suicidality after having been controlled within intimate partner violence (IPV) is crucial in improving health care delivery. Well documented in the literature is the correlation between suicidality and IPV and that help-seeking for each is difficult; however, a gap exists when both intersect. The process of women's help-seeking is explored in this feminist grounded theory and photovoice multiple qualitative method study. Analysis of interviews with 32 women from New Brunswick, Canada, and photovoice meetings with seven women revealed a basic psycho-social problem. System Entrapment or being dehumanized while seeking help for suicidality occurred as a result of perceived invalidation from health care providers' lack of empathy. Further harm while providing services to women feeling suicidal can be prevented with a shift from an individualist model toward a trauma and violence informed approach. Understanding the contextual factors influencing women's suicidality may reduce victim blaming.

AB A grounded theory study of senior citizens' preferences for end-of-life care was conducted in 1998 in Canada. Seniors who had experienced the deaths of others and who had considered their own death and dying were the target population. The sample was 49 seniors who met the study criteria. Participants provided end-of-life care in a variety of settings for 1-8 family members or friends. Two concepts identified were expected dependency while dying and appropriate end-of-life care. Almost all participants preferred to be cared for at home, yet family caregivers who could provide appropriate end-of-life care when dependent were needed for this to occur. The appropriateness of end-of-life care was contingent upon the place where end-of-life care occurred, as well as the type of care provided. Life prolongation was not desired, 53% even endorsed euthanasia as a way of bringing about the inevitable end to life.

   MORTALITY; LIFE
AB Background We estimate the intergenerational relationship between the residential school (RS) attendance of an older generation family member and the physical and mental health of a younger generation.
   Methods Data from the 2012 Aboriginal Peoples Survey (APS) is used to examine the relationship between previous generational family RS attendance and the current physical and mental health of off-reserve First Nations, Metis and Inuit Canadians. Five outcomes are considered (self-perceived health, mental health, distress, suicidal ideation and suicide attempt). Direct (univariate) and indirect (multivariate) effects of family RS attendance are examined for each dependent variable. We draw from the general and indigenous-specific social determinants of health literature to inform the construction of our models.
   Results Familial RS attendance is shown to affect directly all five health and mental health outcomes, and is associated with lower self-perceived health and mental health, and a higher risk for distress and suicidal behaviours. Background, mediating and structural-level variables influence the strength of association. Odds of being in lower self-perceived health remain statistically significantly higher with the presence of familial attendance of RS when controlling for all covariates. The odds of having had a suicide attempt within the past 12 months remain twice as high for those with familial attendance of RS.
   Conclusions Health disparities exist between indigenous and non-indigenous Canadians, an important source of which is a family history of RS attendance. This has implications for clinical practice and Canadian public health, as well as countries with similar historical legacies.

TI Identification of hospitalizations for intentional self-harm when
   E-codes are incompletely recorded
SO PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
LA English
DT Article
DE intentional self-harm; suicide; depression
ID SUICIDE; ADULTS; SAFETY; RISK
AB Context Suicidal behavior has gained attention as an adverse outcome of prescription drug use. Hospitalizations for intentional self-harm, including suicide, can be identified in administrative claims databases using external cause of injury codes (E-codes). However, rates of E-code completeness in US government and commercial claims databases are low due to issues with hospital billing software.
   Objective To develop an algorithm to identify intentional self-harm hospitalizations using recorded injury and psychiatric diagnosis codes in the absence of E-code reporting.
   Methods We sampled hospitalizations with an injury diagnosis (ICD-9 800-995) from two databases with high rates of E-coding completeness: 1999-2001 British Columbia, Canada data and the 2004 US Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Our gold standard for intentional self-harm was a diagnosis of E950-E958. We constructed algorithms to identify these hospitalizations using information on type of injury and presence of specific psychiatric diagnoses.
   Results The algorithm that identified intentional self-harm hospitalizations with high sensitivity and specificity was a diagnosis of poisoning, toxic effects, open wound to elbow, wrist, or forearm, or asphyxiation; plus a diagnosis of depression, mania, personality disorder, psychotic disorder, or adjustment reaction. This had a sensitivity of 63%, specificity of 99% and positive predictive value (PPV) of 86% in the Canadian database. Values in the US data were 74, 98, and 73%. PPV was highest (80%) in patients under 25 and lowest those over 65 (44%).
   Conclusions The proposed algorithm may be useful for researchers attempting to study intentional self-harm in claims databases with incomplete E-code reporting, especially among younger populations. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Objectives. We assessed the impact of the minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) on hospital-based treatment for alcohol-related conditions or events in Ontario, Canada.
   Methods. We conducted regression-discontinuity analyses to examine MLDA effects with respect to diagnosed alcohol-related conditions. Data were derived from administrative records detailing inpatient and emergency department events in Ontario from April 2002 to March 2007.
   Results. Relative to youths slightly younger than the MLDA, youths just older than the MLDA exhibited increases in inpatient and emergency department events associated with alcohol-use disorders (10.8%; P = .048), assaults (7.9%; P < .001), and suicides related to alcohol (51.8%; P = .01). Among young men who had recently crossed the MLDA threshold, there was a 2.0% increase (P = .01) in hospitalizations for injuries.
   Conclusions. Young adults gaining legal access to alcohol incur increases in hospital-based care for a range of serious alcohol-related conditions. Our regression-discontinuity approach can be used in future studies to assess the effects of the MLDA across different settings, and our estimates can be used to inform cost-benefit analyses across MLDA scenarios.

AB Objective: To compare place and cause of death for people with and without schizophrenia in Manitoba, Canada.
   Method: By using deidentified administrative databases at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy, a 1: 3 matched cohort of decedents aged >= 10 years in fiscal years April 1995-March 2008 (n = 3,943 with schizophrenia; n = 11,827 without schizophrenia) was selected and matched on age, sex, geography, and date of death +/- 2 months. Schizophrenia was defined as ICD-9-CM code 295 or ICD-10-CA codes F20, F21, F23.2, or F25 in hospital/physician files at least once within 12 years of death.
   Results: The median age at death was 77 years. The attributable percentage of deaths was higher for respiratory illnesses (all ages) and suicide (age 10-59 years only), similar for circulatory illnesses, and lower for cancer in decedents with schizophrenia compared to matched controls. For cancer deaths, decedents with schizophrenia were equally likely to die of gastrointestinal, breast, or prostate cancer, but more likely to die of lung cancer at ages 10-59 (32.5% versus 20.6%, P<.004). Place of death was more likely a nursing home (29.7% vs 13.9%) and less likely a hospital (55.5% vs 70.5%) (P<.0001) for decedents with schizophrenia overall and by specific cause, with the exception of suicide deaths showing no difference by place. Except for those who died in nursing homes, decedents with schizophrenia had higher general practitioner but lower specialist rates and inpatient hospital separations.
   Conclusions: Generally, patients with schizophrenia were more likely to die in nursing homes but less likely to die in hospitals. Understanding where these patients die is critical for improving access to quality palliative end-of-life care.

AB This study reports on the prevalence and correlates of perceived historical loss among 459 North American Indigenous adolescents aged 11-13 years from the northern Midwest of the United States and central Canada. The adolescents reported daily or more thoughts of historical loss at rates similar to their female caretakers. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that our measure of perceived historical loss and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale were separate but related constructs. Regression analysis indicated that, even when controlling for family factors, perceived discrimination, and proximal negative life events, perceived historical loss had independent effects on adolescent's depressive symptoms. The construct of historical loss is discussed in terms of Indigenous ethnic cleansing and life course theory.

AB In an eight-year review (1991 to 1998) of all consecutive coroners' files in Quebec, Canada, the authors identified a total of 34 cases of victims who were killed by their mothers. Most victims were less than six years of age, and there were several cases in which multiple siblings were murdered. There were 27 mothers in the sample, and 15 of those women committed suicide after the filicide. A psychiatric motive was determined for more than 85 percent of the mothers, and most of the mothers had received previous treatment for a depressive or psychotic disorder. Based on the characteristics of this sample, the authors developed a filicide classification system that is flexible and simple to use but must be standardized to become a useful tool for clinicians.

ID PROPOSAL; SUICIDE; POLICY; DISABILITY; INUIT
AB While the multidimensionality of poverty is well-recognised, one dimension of poverty which has been often overlooked is weak social connectedness. This paper draws on conceptual, participatory and measurement literatures to show that social connectedness appears to be an important missing ingredient of multidimensional poverty analyses, with social isolation being a feature which exacerbates the condition of poor persons. To provide contextual detail as to its impact on persons in marginalized communities, we present qualitative primary data from South Africa and Mozambique and review pertinent studies of the First Nations of Canada and among persons with disability. A policy challenge for social isolation is that it is often seen as stemming from an individuals' capacity rather than resulting from the broader social context. The closing section outlines areas for policy.

AB In Canada, it is challenging to find examples of positive population mental health interventions that meet scientific standards of evidence. It is even more difficult to identify effective interventions that address health equity. The discrepancy between standards of evidence in the health sciences, and the evidence that can be gleaned from social experiments, is not new. Efforts to reconcile these differences show a general tendency toward controlled interventions in public health. However, it is possible to extract findings from quasi-experimental interventions that meet scientific standards while also showing promise of positive impacts on mental health equity. This article describes work undertaken in 2015 to begin to address this evidence gap.

AB Background: Existing research and media reports convey conflicting impressions of trends in the prevalence of mental illness. We sought to investigate trends in the prevalence of symptoms of mental illness in a large population-based cohort of Canadian children and adolescents.
   Methods: We obtained population-based data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth. Every 2 years, participants completed self-reported measures of mental illness indicators, including conduct disorder, hyperactivity, indirect aggression, suicidal behaviour, and depression and anxiety. We analyzed trends in mean scores over time using linear regression.
   Results: We evaluated 11 725 participants aged 10-11 years from cycles 1 (1994/95) through 6 (2004/05), 10 574 aged 12-13 years from cycles 2 (1996/97) through 7 (2006/07), and 9835 aged 14-15 years from cycles 3 (1998/99) through 8 (2008/09). The distribution of scores on depression and anxiety, conduct and indirect aggression scales remained stable or showed small decreases over time for participants of all ages. The mean hyperactivity score increased over time in participants aged 10-11 years (change per 2-year cycle: 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.12) and those aged 12-13 years (0.13, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.18). Over time, fewer participants aged 12-13 years (0.40% per cycle, 95% CI -0.78 to -0.07) and aged 14-15 years (0.56% per cycle, 95% CI -0.91 to -0.23) reported attempting suicide in the previous 12 months.
   Interpretation: With the exception of hyperactivity, the prevalence of symptoms of mental illness in Canadian children and adolescents has remained relatively stable from 1994/95 to 2008/09. Conflicting reports of escalating rates of mental illness in Canada may be explained by differing methodologies between studies, an increase in treatment-seeking behaviour, or changes in diagnostic criteria or practices.

AB Benzodiazepines are commonly prescribed psycho-pharmaceuticals (e.g., for anxiety, tension, and insomnia); they are generally considered safe but have potential adverse effects. Benzodiazepine use in Canada versus internationally is comparably high, yet no recent comprehensive review of use, misuse, or related (e.g., morbidity, mortality) harm at the population level exists; the present review aimed to fill this gap. We searched four key scientific literature databases (Medline, CINAHL, EBM Reviews, and Web of Science) with relevant search terms, and collected relevant "gray literature" (e.g., survey, monitoring, government reports) data published in 1995-2015. Two reviewers conducted data screening and extraction; results were categorized and narratively summarized by key sub-topics. Levels of benzodiazepine use in the general population have been relatively stable in recent years; medical use is generally highest among older adults. Rates of non-medical use are fairly low in general but higher in marginalized (e.g., street drug use) populations; high and/or inappropriate prescribing appears common in older adults. Benzodiazepines are associated with various morbidity outcomes (e.g., accidents/injuries, cognitive decline, sleep disturbances, or psychiatric issues), again commonly observed in older adults; moreover, benzodiazepines are identified as a contributing factor in suicides and poisoning deaths. Overall there is a substantial benzodiazepine-related health problem burden-although lower than that for other psycho-medications (e.g., opioids)-in Canada, mainly as a result of overuse and/or morbidity. National benzodiazepine prescription guidelines are lacking, and few evaluated interventions to reduce benzodiazepine-related problems exist. There is a clear need for reducing inappropriate benzodiazepine use and related harm in Canada through improved evidence-based practice as well as monitoring and control.

AB Understanding suicidal ideation is crucial for preventing suicide. Although healthy immigrant effect is a phenomenon that has been well documented across a multitude of epidemiological and social studieswhere immigrants are, on average, healthier than the native-born, little research has examined the presence of such effect on suicidal ideation. The objective of this study is to investigate if there is a differential effect of immigration identity on suicidal ideation and how the effect varies by socio-demographic characteristics in the Canadian population. Data from the Canadian Community Health Survey in year 2014 were used. Multivariate logistic regression was employed. Our findings indicated that recent immigrants (lived in Canada for 9 or less years) were significantly less likely to report suicidal ideation compared with non-immigrants. However, for established immigrants (10 years and above of living in Canada), the risk of suicidal ideation converged to Canadian-born population. Moreover, male immigrants were at significantly lower risk of having suicidal ideation than Canadian-born counterparts; whereas, female immigrants did not benefit from the healthy immigrant effect. Our findings suggest the need for targeted intervention strategies on suicidal ideation among established immigrants and female immigrants.

AB Bills C-51 (1977), C-17 (1991), and C-68 (1995) were enacted into law by the Government of Canada with a view to tightening controls on firearms in order to prevent homicides related to their use. The effectiveness of these laws has fuelled several debates on the political scene. Given the many limitations of assessments conducted to this day, the credibility of their results is often questioned. Using a multiple-time-series design, the purpose of this article is to assess the impact of the three most recent Canadian gun control lazes, all the while overcoming the limitations identified in the scientific literature. Our results show that the enactment of Bills C-51 and C-68 was followed by a significant drop in the number of homicides committed with a firearm, a decrease of 5% to 10%, depending on the province. This reduction was most noticeable in the case of homicides committed with a shotgun or a hunting rifle. No tactical displacement was observed. Finally, results suggest that the effectiveness of these laws is due to the reduced access and availability of firearms rather than to the severity of sentences provided in the legislation.

AB Huntington's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder inherited as a dominant trait. In 1993 the mutation responsible for the disorder was identified as an expansion of a polymorphic trinucleotide repeat (CAG) in the coding sequence of the gene IT-15. The ability to assess the number of CAG repeats offered a direct test with a high degree of specificity and sensitivity, independent of family structure and co-operation of relatives. The present review will be focused on the genetic testing of Huntington's disease and its principal applications, namely the predictive and the prenatal testing and the possibility of direct diagnosis of symptomatic individual. The possible implications and effects of these procedures will also be addressed.

AB The recent practice in Belgium and the Netherlands of accepting addiction as a reason for performing euthanasia raises important issues for the field of addiction and the practice of euthanasia. In this paper we outline some of these issues. We also argue that physicians making decisions about whether to accept requests for euthanasia from people with an allegedly untreatable addiction should consider two issues carefully. They should ensure that: (1) the person has the capacity to give free and informed consent to undergo euthanasia; and (2) their request is the outcome of a deliberative process in which all reasonable treatment options and harm reduction measures have been offered to and considered by the person.

AB Randomized controlled trials indicate that antidepressant treatment increases the probability of remission in acute treatment of major depression, diminishes the frequency of relapse during continuation phase treatment and diminishes the risk of recurrence during maintenance treatment. As antidepressant coverage increases in the population, the benefits of antidepressant treatment should begin to translate into improved population health. However, adverse effects can also occur, as can unnecessary treatment. Monitoring the impact of antidepressant treatment on population health should be a priority for health surveillance. Quantitative description of the relationship between treatment provision and population health status will require the use of epidemiological models. A variety of such models have been reported in the literature. None of the existing models, however, are fully satisfactory.

AB The study of Native childrens development in the United States and Canada has lagged behind that of other populations. As a result, there is limited research literature to inform efforts to address the challenges faced by Native children and their families, including disparities in mental health problems such as substance abuse, suicide, mental disorders, and academic achievement. This article provides a brief overview of the historical context of childrens development in Native communities and introduces the Native Childrens Research Exchange (NCRE), formed in 2008 to facilitate child development research with tribal communities. The following collection of articles, written by NCRE scholars, reviews existing research, highlights challenges encountered in this work, and points to an agenda for furthering developmental research within Native cultures.

AB Major findings of the Survey of Living Conditions in the Arctic (SLiCA) are: (1) A combination of traditional activities and cash employment is the prevailing lifestyle of Arctic indigenous peoples; (2) family ties, social support of each other, and traditional activities have a lot to do with why indigenous people choose to remain in Arctic communities; (3) well-being is closely related to job opportunities, locally available fish and game, and a sense of local control. Well-being and depression (and related problems like suicide) are flip sides of the same coin. Improving well-being may reduce social problems; and, (4) health conditions vary widely in the Arctic: three-in-four Greenlandic Inuit self-rate their health as at least very good compared with one-in-two Canadian and Alaska Inuit and one-in-five Chukotka indigenous people. Findings are based on 7,200 interviews in a probability sample of Inupiat settlement regions of Alaska, the four Inuit settlement regions of Canada, all of Greenland, and the Anadyrskij, Anadyr, Shmidtovs, Beringovskij, Chukotskij, Iujl'tinskij, Bilibinskij, Chaunskij, Providenskij, Uel'Kal' districts of Chukotka. Indigenous people and researchers from Greenland, Russia, Canada, the United States, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland collaborated on all phases of the study.

AB Critically reconsidering Durkheim's sociology of suicide, we develop a quantitative analysis of individual level data contained in the Canadian Community Health Survey (2009-2012) to investigate the relationship between perceptions of social support and suicidality in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Saskatchewan. We operationalize Durkheim's general sociology to investigate relationships between people's perceptions of the more objective aspects of social life (structural-institutional) and the more subjective dimensions of social life, on suicidal ideation. We find that people's perceptions of the quality of social support available to them significantly affect susceptibility to suicidality, lending credence to key aspects of Durkheim's general sociology of social pathology.

DE First Nations; Inuit; indigenous populations; injury indicators;
   modified-Delphi technique; surveillance
AB Introduction: The purpose of this research was to take the initial step in developing valid indicators that reflect the injury issues facing First Nations and Inuit children and youth in Canada.
   Methods: Using a modified-Delphi process, relevant expert and community stakeholders rated each indicator on its perceived usefulness and ability to prompt action to reduce injury among children and youth in indigenous communities. The Delphi process included 5 phases and resulted in a refined set of 27 indicators.
   Results: Indicators related to motorized vehicle collisions, mortality and hospitalization rates were rated the most useful and most likely to prompt action. These were followed by indicators for community injury prevention training and response systems, violent and inflicted injury, burns and falls, and suicide.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that a broad-based modified-Delphi process is a practical and appropriate method, within the OCAP (TM) (Ownership, Control, Access and Possession) principles, for developing a proposed set of indicators for injury prevention activity focused on First Nations and Inuit children and youth. Following additional work to validate and populate the indicators, it is anticipated that communities will utilize them to monitor injury and prompt decisions and action to reduce injuries among children and youth.

AB Background: Multimorbidity is significant for obesity and mental health issues. As a consequence, mental illness is overrepresented in patients seeking bariatric surgery. This review addresses that overlap, with a focus on Canadian data.
   Conclusion: The healthcare system in Canada is unique, but issues related to prevalence of mental health in patients seeking bariatric surgery are similar to those in studies conducted in other countries. Although data on suicide are lacking, Canadian data have shown similar rates of self-harm behaviours and linkages between psychopathology and weight regain after surgery. Geographic issues that make it difficult for individuals to attend regular follow-up appointments have encouraged the use of e-health tools to engage patients and ensure access to follow-up care, which may provide unique opportunities going forward. Additional work is needed to inform best practices in the Canadian system, but in keeping with other data, the consistent message from Canada is that appropriate evaluation and aftercare are essential components of a well-informed bariatric program.

AB Excessive gambling results in a range of diverse harms experienced by individuals and their family members. However, little consideration has been given to specifically assessing such harms. Despite recent attempts to comprehensively 'list' and describe the 'wide net' of specific harms, what remains particularly unclear is the best way to measure the presence of harm and quantify its relationship to gambling. This article proposes a two-step method for quantifying gambling-related harm. From the literature, 104 questions assessing 48 items of harm were categorized into seven domains. Items were administered to 391 clinical and 151 community gamblers. Results suggest that while high-impact harms such as suicide and divorce are commonly associated with problem gambling, the reported frequency is low. Most gamblers sustain low-impact harms such as reduced savings and worry. This study presents the evaluation of specific gambling-related harms distributed in a clinical and community sample taking into account severity and its relationship to gambling behaviours. It is concluded that gambling-related harms negatively impact on quality of life with a minority suffering more severe harms. It is argued that the proposed two-step methodology provides a basis for developing a psychometrically valid measure of gambling-related harm.

AB Objective: The objective was to compare, in a real-world setting, the risk of mental and physical health events associated with different antipsychotic drugs (clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine and first-generation antipsychotics) in patients with SZ.
   Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study using administrative data. Outcome measures included any mental health event (suicide, hospitalization or emergency visit for mental disorders) and physical health event (death other than suicide, hospitalization or emergency visit for physical disorders). Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratios of the events associated with the use of the different antipsychotic drugs.
   Results: The cohort included 18 869 adult patients living in the province of Quebec (Canada) with SZ and starting antipsychotic drugs between January 1998 and December 2005. Results show that quetiapine and not using any antipsychotics were associated with an increased risk of mental and physical health events as compared to other drugs. The second finding is the confirmation of better performance of clozapine. The results were robust across sensitivity analyses.
   Conclusion: Both findings call for an international public health and drug agencies surveillance of 'real-world' antipsychotic medication to ensure the optimal choices in treatment guidelines for SZ.

ID TERMINALLY-ILL; SUICIDE; EUTHANASIA
AB The researchers investigated, through online survey, the opinions of Canadian registered psychologists on the practice of assisted death and their confidence in their abilities for assessing competency in those who request assisted death. This research topic is of significant value given that there have been few published data on this topic specific to this target population. Further, changes to Canada's current legislation surrounding assisted death may require psychologists to develop familiarity with this issues surrounding end-of-life care. In total, 97 participants were recruited through the Canadian Psychological Association Research Portal, Facebook advertising, and provincial and territorial psychological associations. Descriptive statistics were used. The data demonstrated that these participants support physician-assisted death for terminal, but not mental, illness. In addition, these psychologists had limited confidence in their ability to assess the competency of terminally ill individuals to provide informed consent to the receipt of physician-assisted death. Participants expressed an interest in professional training. Implications for this study include a new perspective being added to the debate on assisted death as well recognition that psychologists may have an important role to play in the legalization and regulation of these controversial practices. Future challenges and opportunities for psychologists are provided.

SO CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID BLACK-BOX; SUICIDALITY; DEPRESSION; PATTERNS
AB Background: Regulatory bodies worldwide, including Health Canada, have issued warnings about prescribing antidepressants to children and adolescents. We sought to determine whether the Health Canada warning had the desired effects on prescribing patterns and outcomes and whether it had any unintended health consequences.
   Methods: We examined data from prescription and health care databases representing more than 265 000 children, adolescents and young adults annually to determine changes in the rates of antidepressant prescription, use of health services and outcomes in these populations in the 9 years before and the 2 years after the Health Canada warning. We also examined the data for unintended changes in these rates among patients with anxiety disorders. We used young adults as the comparison group because they were not targeted by the warning.
   Results: Following the warning, the rate of antidepressant prescriptions decreased among children and adolescents (relative risk [RR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81-0.91) and among young adults (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.86-0.93). Ambulatory visits because of depression decreased among children and adolescents (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.85-0.96) and young adults (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.87-0.96). The rate of completed suicides among children and adolescents rose significantly after the warning (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08-1.44; annual rate per 1000 = 0.04 before and 0.15 after the warning). There was no equivalent change in the rate of completed suicides among young adults (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93-1.10; annual rate per 1000 = 0.15 before and 0.22 after the warning). Among patients with an anxiety disorder, the prescription rates did not change among children and adolescents, except for a decrease in the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors other than fluoxetine, but the rates among young adults changed similar to the pattern of changes in the overall prescribing of antidepressants. There was also a significant decrease in the rate of physician visits because of anxiety disorders among young adults after the warning.
   Interpretation: Health advisories and warnings issued by regulatory bodies may have unintended consequences on the provision of care, delivery of health services and clinical outcomes. Further efforts are required to ensure that health warnings do not result in unexpected harm.

AB Aim To investigate palliative care nurse attitudes towards medical assistance in dying. Design An exploratory cross-sectional study design. Methods A mailed letter recruited participants with data collection occurring on a secure online survey platform between November 2017-February 2018. Data analyses included descriptive and bivariate statistics and stepwise linear regression. Results Palliative care nurse attitudes towards medical assistance in dying were explained by perceived expertise in the social domain of palliative care, personal importance of religion/faith, professional importance of religion/faith, and nursing designation. Conclusion This study reveals the perceived importance of religion, versus religious affiliation alone, as significant in influencing provider attitudes towards assisted dying. Further research is needed to understand differences in attitudes between Registered Nurses and Registered Practical Nurses and how the social domain of palliative care influences nurse attitude. Impact Organizations must prioritize nursing input, encourage open interprofessional dialogue and provide support for ethical decision-making, practice decisions, and conscientious objection surrounding medical assistance in dying. Longitudinal nursing studies are needed to understand the impact of legislation on quality and person-centred end-of-life care and the emotional well-being/retention of palliative care nurses.

   MEDICATIONS; SUICIDE; RISK; TRIALS; RATES
AB Objectives. We studied whether 5 regulatory agency advisories concerning the possible increased risk of suicidal behavior during antidepressant therapy had an effect on antidepressant prescription trends in Ontario.
   Methods. We conducted a population-based, time-series analysis of new monthly antidepressant prescriptions dispensed by the Ontario Drug Benefits program in 3 age groups (younger than 20 years, 20-65 years old, and older than 65 years) over a 7-year period (April 1998 to March 2005). The impact of five advisories about the possible risk of suicide during antidepressant therapy was also analyzed.
   Results. The number of new prescriptions for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as a group did not change after any antidepressant warning in any age group. However, the rate of new paroxetine prescriptions in patients younger than 20 years declined by 54% immediately after the first warning for paroxetine was issued in the United Kingdom in June 2003. That same warning had no effect on new paroxetine prescriptions in the other age categories.
   Conclusion. The warning about paroxetine use in depressed patients younger than 18 years that was issued in the United Kingdom led to a significant decrease in new paroxetine prescriptions for young patients in this country. By contrast, warnings in North America did not influence new antidepressant prescription rates in any patient group.

AB The purpose of this systematic review was to identify the instruments created or adapted to assess non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) among adolescents. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology was used. Two individual reviewers analyzed the psychometric properties of instruments published in English or Spanish from 1990 to 2016 considering standardized quality criteria. The PsycINFO, PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, SciELO, ScienceDirect, and EBSCO databases were consulted. Eighteen studies that created or adapted 11 instruments were selected. Most were developed in the United States or Canada, and none were developed in Latin America. Several studies presented no evidence of the psychometric properties of their instruments. Seven of the 18 studies obtained at least one positive score. The Alexian Brothers Urge to Self-Injure Scale (ABUSI) and the Impulse, Self-harm, and Suicide Ideation Questionnaire for Adolescents (ISSIQ-A) obtained the highest positive scores. The limitation of this study is that only seven databases were employed for the literature search in English and Spanish. The reporting of the psychometric properties of NSSI instruments among adolescents should be improved, and adaptations to Latin American countries should be developed for international comparisons.

DT Article
DE mental health; campus; policy; postsecondary; suicide
AB Mental health issues are of growing concern on postsecondary campuses. Creating institutional policies targeting student mental health contributes to creating a supportive campus environment and is a major contributor to campus mental health. This study evaluated the current state of campus mental health policies at Canadian postsecondary institutions and compared them across regions. Policy-specific questions were extracted from a 54-item online survey of campus mental health and completed by respondents (mainly mental health frontline workers dealing directly with students) from Canada's publicly funded postsecondary institutions. Data were analyzed in the aggregate and according to provinces/regions (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Atlantic Provinces [New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland], and Territories [Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut]). One hundred sixty-eight out of 180 institutions were represented (response rate, 96%; 274 respondents). In all geographic regions, Canadian postsecondary institutions were lacking in policies regarding mental health research, initiatives, and program evaluation. Ontario emerged as one of the national leaders in programs addressing suicide threat. In conclusion, this study is the first of its kind to compare mental health policy at postsecondary institutions across Canadian regions. Despite work in several jurisdictions, there is still a need for comprehensive strategies and policies that are inclusive of campus mental health.

AB Objective: Outcome measures are rarely available for surveillance and system performance monitoring for mental disorders and addictions. Our study aims to demonstrate the feasibility and face validity of routinely measuring the mortality gap in the Canadian context at the provincial and regional levels using the methods and data available to the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System (CCDSS) of the Public Health Agency of Canada.
   Methods: We used longitudinal data from the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System, which also provides aggregated data to the CCDSS. This includes data from the health insurance registry physician claims and the hospital discharge abstract for all mental disorder diagnoses (International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-9 290-319 or ICD-10 F00-F99). Patients were defined as having had received a mental disorder diagnosis at least once during the year. Life expectancy was measured using Chiang's method for abridged life tables, complemented by the Hsieh method for adjustment of the last age interval.
   Results: We found a lower life expectancy among psychiatric patients of 8 years for men and 5 years for women. For patients with schizophrenia, life expectancy was lowered by 12 years for men and 8 years for women. Cardiovascular disease and cancer were the most common causes of premature death. Findings were consistent across time and regions of the province. Lower estimates of the mortality gap, compared with literature, could be explained by the inclusion of primary care patients and methods.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using administrative data to measure the impact of current and future mental health plans in Canada provided the techniques can be replicated in other Canadian provinces.

AB Objectives In 2015, the Province of Quebec, Canada passed a law that allowed voluntary active euthanasia (VAE). Palliative care stakeholders in Canada have been largely opposed to euthanasia, yet there is little research about their views. The research question guiding this study was the following: How do palliative care physicians in Quebec position themselves regarding the practice of VAE in the context of the new provincial legislation? Methods We used interpretive description, an inductive methodology to answer research questions about clinical practice. A total of 18 palliative care physicians participated in semistructured interviews at two university-affiliated hospitals in Quebec. Results Participants positioned themselves in opposition to euthanasia. Their justifications were framed within their professional commitment to not hasten death, which sat in tension with the value of patients' autonomy to choose how to die. Participants described VAE as unacceptable if it impeded opportunities to evaluate and alleviate suffering. Further, they contested government rhetoric that positioned VAE as a way to improve end-of-life care. Participants felt that VAE would diminish the potential of palliative care to relieve suffering. Dilemmas were apparent in their narratives, about reconciling respect for patient autonomy with broader palliative care values, and the value of accompanying and not abandoning patients who make requests for VAE while being committed to neither prolonging nor hastening death. Conclusions This study provides insight into nuanced positions of experienced palliative care physicians in Quebec and confirms expected tensions between an important stakeholder and the practice of VAE as guided by the new legislation.

AB Cyberbullying: a worldwide trend of misusing technology to harass others.
   Technology has led to a new form of bullying in the 21(st) century called cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is using the Internet or a cell phone to harass a victim with pictures and text. There have been reports in the media of youth being harassed by e-mail, postings on websites, instant messages, and mobile text messages worldwide.
   This paper summarizes findings about the prevalence and effects of cyberbullying from studies conducted in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Results of the studies were compared to media reports of cyberbullying and traditional bullying research. Strategies to stop and prevent cyberbullying were discussed.
   The percentage of respondents experiencing incidents of cyberbullying in the studies ranged from 10% to 42%. The mobile phone was the predominant method of cyberbullying in Australia and the United Kingdom, whereas the Internet was the favoured method in the United States and Canada.
   Some victims of cyberbullying have been driven to suicide while others remain unaffected by it. The most common feelings of victims were anger, sadness, frustration, and fear. Independent studies in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada documented that parents and children do not discuss cyberbullying.
   It is recommended that schools establish and post acceptable use policies for the Internet. Parents need to be educated about cyberbullying so that they can impose consequences if their child is harassing another child. Real time computerized reporting systems such Text Someone can be used to augment reporting of incidents. Showing students how mobile phone calls and e-mail messages can be traced may deter cyberbullying.

AB Aim ACCESS Open Minds (ACCESS OM) is a pan-Canadian project aimed at improving youth mental healthcare. This paper describes implementation of the ACCESS OM objectives for youth mental health service transformation within a pre-existing Fish Net Model of transformative youth mental healthcare service in the First Nation community of Eskasoni, on Canada's east coast. Methods We describe an adaptation of the ACCESS OM service transformation objectives through the complementary blending of Indigenous and Western methodologies. This concept of "Two-Eyed Seeing" is illustrated as central to engaging youth in the community and attending to their mental health needs and wellness. Results The ACCESS OM Eskasoni First Nation Youth Space acts as a central location for the site team and its activities, which expand into the rest of the community to facilitate early identification of youth in need. Rapid access to care is promoted via barrier-free availability through a central intake crisis and referral centre, and ease of contact through social media and other modalities. Youth are given the choice between standard Western mental health services, or Indigenous methods of improving well-being, or a combination of the two. Conclusions The ACCESS OM framework has shown early results of being a positive addition to the Eskasoni community. Local leadership and community buy-in are identified as key factors to success. Further exploration, research, and evaluation of this transformation is ongoing. Successful implementation of this model in Eskasoni could act as a model for youth mental health programmes in other First Nations across Canada.

AB Objective The goal of the study was to systematically review available evidence regarding differences in injury incidence between rural and urban paediatric populations in Canada and the USA.
   Data source Eight electronic databases, institutional websites and reference lists of relevant studies including published and unpublished reports.
   Selection criteria Population-based observational studies or surveys published from 1970 to February 2011 that compared injury incidence or injury-related healthcare outcomes between rural and urban children (<18) living in Canada or the USA.
   Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently applied selection criteria and assessed methodological quality of studies. Data were extracted by one author and independently verified by the second author. Injury rate ratios for rural and urban children were extracted or calculated. Data were synthesised descriptively due to substantial heterogeneity among studies.
   Results A total of 41 studies were included for this review (seven surveys and 34 studies using administrative health databases). Internal validity of included studies was moderate. Rural children were at higher risk of overall injury, motor vehicle crash injury and suicide, whereas urban children in the USA experienced higher rates of firearm-related homicides. Greater rural-urban injury disparities were likely to be found between more extreme rural and urban areas. In particular, children in remote rural areas are at increased risk of severe injuries than urban counterparts. Overall, healthcare costs per child for injury were higher for rural children.
   Conclusion These findings indicate the need of developing geographic area-specific injury-prevention strategies. Future research is required to investigate rural-urban disparity for less-studied injuries and related health outcomes (eg, disability).

   AVOIDABLE MORTALITY; FUNDAMENTAL CAUSES; UNITED-STATES; POSITION
AB Background
   People with lower incomes tend to have less favourable health outcomes than do people with higher incomes. Because death registrations in Canada do not contain information about the income of the deceased, vital statistics cannot be used to examine mortality by income at the individual level. However, through record linkage, information on the individual or family income of people followed for mortality can be obtained. Recently, a large, population-based sample of Canadian adults was linked to almost 16 years of mortality data.
   Methods
   This study examines cause-specific mortality rates by income adequacy among Canadian adults. It is based on data from the 1991 to 2006 Canadian census mortality and cancer follow-up study, which followed 2.7 million people aged 25 or older at baseline, 426,979 of whom died during the 16-year period. Age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs), rate ratios, rate differences and excess mortality were calculated by income adequacy quintile for various causes of death.
   Results
   For most causes examined, ASMRs were clearly graded by income: highest among people in the in the lowest income quintile, and lowest among people in the highest income quintile. Inter-quintile rate ratios (quintile 1/quintile 5) were greater than 2.00 for HIV/AIDS, diabetes mellitus, suicide, cancer of the cervix, and causes of death closely associated with smoking and alcohol.
   Interpretation
   These individually based results provide cause-specific information by income adequacy quintile that was not previously available for Canada.

AB The purpose of the study was to identify the current prevalence of mental disorders and mental health needs among incarcerated male and female youths in Canada, and to present these data in the context of rates found in other jurisdictions. One hundred forty male and 65 female incarcerated young offenders in British Columbia were screened with the Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument Version 2 (MAYSI-2); provisional psychiatric diagnoses were assessed with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV (DISC-IV); abuse history and aggressive symptoms of Conduct Disorder (CD) were coded from file information. Nearly all youths (91.9% of males and 100% of females) met the criteria for at least one mental disorder. Substance abuse and dependence disorders were highly prevalent (85.5% of males and 100% of females). Aggressive forms of CD were common (72.9% of males and 84.3% of females), as were exposure to physical abuse (60.8% of males and 54.3% of females) and sexual abuse (21.2% of males and 42.4% of females). Female youths had significantly higher odds of presenting with: (1) substance abuse/dependence disorders; (2) current suicide ideation; (3) sexual abuse; (4) PTSD; (5) symptoms of depression and anxiety; (6) Oppositional Defiant Disorder; and (7) multiple mental disorder diagnoses. Male youths had significantly higher odds of presenting with aggressive symptoms of CD. Overall, rates of mental disorder among this sample of serious and violent young offenders were higher than rates previously reported for incarcerated youths - both in Canada and in other jurisdictions.

AB The objective of this study was to examine mental disorders and treatment use among bereaved siblings in the general population. Siblings (N=7243) of all deceased children in the population of Manitoba, Canada who died between 1984 and 2009 were matched 1:3 to control siblings (N=21,729) who did not have a sibling die in the study period. Generalized estimating equations were used to compare the two sibling groups in the two years before and after the index child's death on physician-diagnosed mental disorders and treatment utilization, with adjustment for confounding factors including pre-existing mental illness. Analyses were stratified by age of the bereaved (<13 vs. 13+). Results revealed that, in the two years after the death of the child, bereaved siblings had significantly higher rates of mental disorders than control siblings, even after adjusting for pre-existing mental illness. When comparing the effect of a child's death on younger versus older siblings, the rise in depression rates from pre-death to post-death was significantly higher for siblings aged under 13 (p<0.0001), increasing more than 7-fold (adjusted relative rate, ARR=7.25, 95% CI: 3.65-14.43). Bereaved siblings aged 13+ had substantial morbidity in the two years after the death: 25% were diagnosed with a mental disorder (vs. 17% of controls), and they had higher rates of almost all mental disorder outcomes compared to controls, including twice the rate of suicide attempts (ARR=2.01, 95% CI: 1.29-3.12). Siblings in the bereaved cohort had higher rates of alcohol and drug use disorders already before the death of their sibling. In conclusion, the death of a child is associated with considerable mental disorder burden among surviving siblings. Pre-existing health problems and social disadvantage do not fully account for the increase in mental disorder rates.

SO BMJ OPEN
LA English
DT Review
ID NETHERLANDS; EUTHANASIA; SUICIDE
AB Introduction Medical assistance in dying (MAID), a term encompassing both euthanasia and assisted suicide, was decriminalised in Canada in 2015. Although Bill C-14 legislated eligibility criteria under which patients could receive MAID, it did not provide guidance regarding the technical aspects of providing an assisted death. Therefore, we propose a scoping review to map the characteristics of the existing medical literature describing the medications, settings, participants and outcomes of MAID, in order to identify knowledge gaps and areas for future research.
   Methods and analysis We will search electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, PsycINFO), clinical trial registries, conference abstracts, and professional guidelines and recommendations from jurisdictions where MAID is legal, up to June 2017. Eligible report types will include technical summaries, institutional policies, practice surveys, practice guidelines and clinical studies. We will include all descriptions of MAID provision (either euthanasia or assisted suicide) in adults who have provided informed consent for MAID, for any reason, including reports where patients have provided consent to MAID in advance of the development of incapacity (eg, dementia). We will exclude reports in which patients receive involuntary euthanasia (eg, capital punishment). Two independent investigators will screen and select retrieved reports using pilot-tested screening and eligibility forms, and collect data using standardised data collection forms. We will summarise extracted data in tabular format with accompanying descriptive statistics and use narrative format to describe their clinical relevance, identify knowledge gaps and suggest topics for future research.
   Ethics and dissemination This scoping review will map the range and scope of the existing literature on the provision of MAID in jurisdictions where the practice has been decriminalised. The review will be disseminated through conference presentations and publication in a peer-reviewed journal. These results will be useful to clinicians, policy makers and researchers involved with MAID.

AB Objectives: To determine whether the rates of a first presentation to the emergency department (ED) for suicide-related behavior (SRB) are higher among children/youth permanently removed from their parental home because of substantiated maltreatment than their peers. To describe the health care settings accessed by these children/youth before a first SRB presentation to help design preventive interventions.
   Methods: A population-based (retrospective) cohort of 12-17-year-olds in Ontario, Canada was established. Children/youth removed from their parental home because of the above noted maltreatment (n = 4683) and their population-based peers (n = 1,034,546) were individually linked to administrative health care records over time to ascertain health service use and subsequent ED presentations for SRB during follow-up. Person-time incidence rates were calculated and Cox regression models used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI).
   Results: After controlling for demographic characteristics and prior health service use, maltreated children/youth were about five times more likely to have a first ED presentation for SRB compared to their peers, in both boys (HR: 5.13, 95% CI: 3.94, 6.68) and girls (HR: 5.36, 95% CI: 4.40, 6.54).
   Conclusions: Children/youth permanently removed from their parental home because of substantiated child maltreatment are at an increased risk of a first presentation to the ED for SRB. The prevention of child maltreatment and its recurrence and the promotion of resilience after maltreatment has occurred are important avenues to study toward preventing ED SRB presentations in children/youth. Provider and system level linkages between care sectors may prevent the need for such presentations by providing ongoing environmental support. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: As Canada's mission in Afghanistan winds down, the Canadian Forces (CF) are reflecting on the psychological impact of the mission on more than 40,000 deployed personnel.
   Methods: All major CF studies of mental health outcomes done before and during the Afghanistan era are summarized, with an eye toward getting the most complete picture of the mental health impact of the mission. Studies on traumatic brain injury (TBI), high-risk drinking, and suicidality are included given their conceptual link to mental health.
   Results: CF studies on the mental health impact of pre-Afghanistan deployments are few, and they have inadequate detail on deployment experiences. Afghanistan era findings confirm service-related mental health problems (MHPs) in an important minority. The findings of the studies cohere, both as a group and in the context of data from our Allies. Combat exposure is the most important driver of deployment-related MHPs, but meaningful rates will be found in those in low-threat areas. Reserve service and cumulative effects of multiple deployments are not major risk factors in the CF. Many deployed personnel will seek care, but further efforts to decrease the delay are needed. Only a fraction of the overall burden of mental illness is likely deployment attributable. Deployment-related mental disorders do not translate into an overall increase in in-service suicidal behavior in the CF, but there is concerning evidence of increased suicide risk after release. TBI occurred in a distinct minority on this deployment, but severe forms were rare. Most TBI cases do not have persistent "post-concussive'' symptoms; such symptoms are closely associated with MHPs.
   Conclusion: The mental health impact of the mission in Afghanistan is commensurate with its difficult nature. While ongoing and planned studies will provide additional detail on its impacts, greater research attention is needed on preventive and therapeutic interventions.

ID BURNS
AB Throwing highly corrosive acid into someone's face to cause the deliberate destruction of an individual's appearance is a serious assault. Some victims die as a result of the attack, some are blinded, and all have their facial features marred for life, causing severe social isolation and ostracism and leading some victims to commit suicide years after the attack.
   Acid attacks in Cambodia are commonplace occurrences: a personal revenge for a variety of interpersonal disputes and perceived insults. Similar attacks occur in other developing countries, most especially in South and South-East Asia, and the first case occurring in Canada was recently reported in the press. Children's Surgical Centre (CSC) has seen and treated at least 195 patients with acid bums since 1998, and some of the characteristics of the individual circumstances and the surgical care are discussed.

AB Objective: Euthanasia has been considered unethical for most of the history of medicine. Recently it has been legalised in some countries, including parts of Australasia. We describe the recent history of euthanasia, paying attention to the extension of criteria that impact on the poor, elderly and vulnerable members of society in countries that currently have legalised this. In four of the five countries where euthanasia is legalised, there have been extensions of its criteria, either by revision of legislation or changes in practice. Conclusions: We suggest that this dynamic can be halted by international agreements of medical societies to shun involvement in euthanasia, as has been the case with other legal interventions that stigmatise. We may, as we have in the past, need to work collectively to meet this ethical challenge.

AB Approximately 1 in 4 deaths of patients maintained on dialysis in the United States is preceded by a decision to discontinue treatment. Once considered to be a form of suicide, dialysis discontinuation is now increasingly common in most countries that are fortunate enough to offer renal replacement therapies. Given an aging and progressively sicker chronic kidney disease patient population, the rate of terminating dialysis is likely to increase. The literature on dialysis discontinuation includes studies principally from Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The research is reviewed, critiqued, and examined to determine its relevance to practice. Future issues include the need to explore variability in dialysis practice as well as employment of a more patient-centered approach that is consistent with modern palliative medicine.

TI Mortality among residents of shelters, rooming houses, and hotels in
   Canada: 11 year follow-up study

DT Article
ID HOMELESS ADULTS; STREET YOUTH; HEALTH; COHORT; PEOPLE; DEATH; MEN
AB Objective To examine mortality in a representative nationwide sample of homeless and marginally housed people living in shelters, rooming houses, and hotels.
   Design Follow-up study.
   Setting Canada 1991-2001.
   Participants 15 100 homeless and marginally housed people enumerated in 1991 census.
   Main outcome measures Age specific and age standardised mortality rates, remaining life expectancies at age 25, and probabilities of survival from age 25 to 75. Data were compared with data from the poorest and richest income fifths as well as with data for the entire cohort
   Results Of the homeless and marginally housed people, 3280 died. Mortality rates among these people were substantially higher than rates in the poorest income fifth, with the highest rate ratios seen at younger ages. Among those who were homeless or marginally housed, the probability of survival to age 75 was 32% (95% confidence interval 30% to 34%) in men and 60% (56% to 63%) in women. Remaining life expectancy at age 25 was 42 years (42 to 43) and 52 years (50 to 53), respectively. Compared with the entire cohort, mortality rate ratios for men and women, respectively, were 11.5 (8.8 to 15.0) and 9.2 (5.5 to 15.2) for drug related deaths, 6.4 (5.3 to 7.7) and 8.2 (5.0 to 13.4) for alcohol related deaths, 4.8 (3.9 to 5.9) and 3.8 (2.7 to 5.4) for mental disorders, and 2.3 (1.8 to 3.1) and 5.6 (3.2 to 9.6) for suicide. For both sexes, the largest differences in mortality rates were for smoking related diseases, ischaemic heart disease, and respiratory diseases.
   Conclusions Living in shelters, rooming houses, and hotels is associated with much higher mortality than expected on the basis of low income alone. Reducing the excessively high rates of premature mortality in this population would require interventions to address deaths related to smoking, alcohol, and drugs, and mental disorders and suicide, among other causes.

AB The social environment in which lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) youths live influences health and well-being. We describe the development of the LGBTQ Supportive Environments Inventory (LGBTQ SEI), designed to quantify the LGBTQ-inclusiveness of social environments in the United States and Canada. We quantify aspects of the social environment including: (1) presence/quality of LGBTQ youth-serving organizations; (2) LGBTQ-inclusive community resources; and (3) socioeconomic and political environment. Using geographic information systems (GIS) tools, we aggregated data to buffers around 397 schools in three regions. The LGBTQ SEI can be used to assess the role of the social environment in reducing health disparities for LGBTQ youths.

AB Postpartum depression has been described as a thief that steals motherhood. It can result in tragedy and sometimes in headline-gripping maternal suicide or infanticide. Because one of the highest priorities for nursing is to continually advance the knowledge the underlies nursing practice, it is essential that we understand what nurse researchers have done to advance the knowledge base of postpartum depression. This integrative review is a two-part series for MCN that summarizes 141 postpartum depression studies conducted by nurse researchers from around the globe, including United States, Australia, Canada, China (Hong Kong, Taiwan), Finland, Iceland Sweden, Turkey, and Malaysia. Specific areas of postpartum depression to which nurse researchers have devoted their primary attention include epidemiology, risk factors, transcultural perspectives, instrument development, screening, interventions and mother-infant interactions.

AB The study of vernacular religion looks at faith as it is lived and emphasizes praxis. Research conducted among Ukrainian Canadians living on the prairies shows that the location where beliefs are expressed plays a role in the relationship between individual religion, folk religion, and official religion. Vernacular religion is freely expressed in the home, while its expression within the confines of the church is constrained. Negotiation, sometimes leading to change in church policy, takes place in cemeteries. As parishioners change their definition of personhood and see stillborn babies as human, as they come to consider suicide to be the result of illness rather than sin, their new views can affect the burial practices of their church, forcing it to include previously excluded persons in the sanctified ground of the cemetery.

AB Increasing rates of prescription opioid-related death are well documented in Ontario (ON) but little is known about prescription opioid-related harms in other Canadian provinces. Using administrative mortality data from 2004 to 2013, we found that rates of prescription opioid-related death in British Columbia (BC) were higher but more stable than published rates for ON over the same period. Methadone was involved in approximately 25% of the prescription opioid-related deaths in BC. The majority of prescription opioid-related deaths among men and women were unintentional. Men had higher overall rates of prescription opioid-related deaths in BC; women had lower rates of prescription opioid-related deaths but a larger proportion of them were suicides. Efforts to reduce prescription opioid-related deaths must consider sex differences in patterns of prescription opioid use and associated harms.

AB Age-cohort variation in childhood trauma; as examined in the present study. The data; were taken from the 1994/95 Canadian National Population Health Survey of household residents (n = 15,106). Childhood trauma trauma was measured by a seven-item index (items reflected physical abuse, fearful experiences,; hospitalization, being sent away from home, and and parental disturbance). Reported prevalence of childhood trauma increased with each sucessfully younger age-cohort (range = 31% to). Females showed a larger change than males, and age differences grew more pronounced as trauma exposure increased. The ata suggest chat childhood trauma has been on the increase over the last few decades. This L in accord with findings from other studies which showed that depression and social problems have also been on the rise. This suggests that adult psychiatric sequelae of early trauma can be expected to show an increase in future years.

AB Context: Sexually transmitted infections (STI) and mental health and substance use (MHSU) disorders all occur at elevated rates in sexual and gender minorities. These overlapping epidemics, or syndemics, are exacerbated by challenges these same populations face in accessing sexual/gender minority-affirming services. Many publicly funded STI clinics are a low barrier and provide sexual minority-competent care. These sites therefore may be uniquely situated to address clients' MHSU-related needs. Objective: We characterize the need and desire for MHSU services among STI clinic clients. Design, Setting, Participants: We conducted a waiting room survey at 6 STI clinics in Metro Vancouver, Canada. Main Outcome Measures: We calculated the proportion of clients with self-reported unmet MHSU needs in the previous 12 months and, among these clients, barriers to accessing MHSU services and desire for MHSU services within the STI clinic. We also examined social disparities in barriers to accessing MHSU services. Results: Among 1115 respondents-65% of whom were sexual minorities-39% reported a recent need for MHSU-related care, most frequently in relation to anxiety (29%), depression (26%), substance use (10%), or suicide ideation (7%). Seventy-two percent of this group had not yet talked to a provider about their concern. Common barriers included shame (26%) and inability to afford the service (24%). Eighty-three percent of clients with unmet MHSU needs indicated that they were comfortable discussing MHSU concerns with an STI clinic provider, and 94% expressed desire to receive MHSU assessments, referrals, or counseling in the STI clinic. Sexual and gender minorities and those attending a suburban clinic were more likely to report barriers to accessing MHSU services. Conclusions: More than a quarter of STI clinic clients report unmet MHSU health care needs; moreover, these clients report high levels of comfort with and desire to discuss MHSU concerns with STI clinic providers. Sexually transmitted infections clinics are thus opportune sites for syndemic service integration.

TI Intentional injury among the indigenous and total populations in British
   Columbia, Canada: trends over time and ecological analyses of risk
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Wounds and injuries; American Indian; Aboriginal; Indigenous population;
   Suicide; attempted; Hospitalization; Canada; Inequities
AB Background: Our objective was to explore intentional injury disparity between Indigenous populations and the total population in the province of British Columbia (BC), Canada. We focus on hospitalizations, including both self-inflicted injuries and injuries inflicted by others.
   Methods: We used data from BC's universal health care insurance plan, 1991 to 2010, linked to Vital Statistics databases. Indigenous people were identified through the insurance premium group, and birth and death records. Place of residence was identified through postal code. We calculated crude hospitalization incidence rates and the Standardized Relative Risk (SRR) of hospitalization, standardized by gender, 5-year age group, and Health Service Delivery Area (HSDA). With HSDA populations as the units of observation, linear regression was used to test hypothesized associations of Indigenous ethnicity, geographic, and socio-economic characteristics with SRR of injury.
   Results: During the period 1991-2010, the crude rate of hospitalization for intentional injuries was 8.4 per 10,000 person-years (95% confidence interval (CI): 8.3 to 8.5) for the total BC population, compared to 45.3 per 10,000 (95% CI: 44.5 to 46.1) for the Indigenous population. For both populations, risk declined over the period for injuries self-inflicted and inflicted by others. The linear regression model predicts that the off-reserve Indigenous population will have SRR of intentional injury 3.98 greater, and the on-reserve Indigenous population 4.17, greater than the total population. The final model was an excellent fit (R-2 = 0.912, F = 177.632, p < 0.001), and found that three variables - occupational risk, high school diploma, and university degree - each provide independent effects when interacting multiplicatively with Indigenous ethnicity.
   Conclusions: The observation of substantially declining rates of intentional injury for both the Indigenous and total BC populations is off-set by the high disparity in risk between the two populations, which will likely continue until Canada reduces disparity with respect to discriminatory practices, and physical, social, and economic conditions.

TI Prevalence of adults who are the targets of parental alienating
   behaviors and their impact
SO CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID DARK TRIAD; AGGRESSION
AB Estimating the prevalence of parental alienation is challenging because not all children who are exposed to parental alienating behaviors become alienated (Harman, Bernet, & Harman, 2019). The purpose of the current study was to determine whether the proportion of adults who indicate being alienated from a child will be similar to results from a previous poll of North Carolina adults (Harman, Leder-Elder, & Biringen, 2016) using three nationally representative on-line survey panels from United States and Canada, and to determine the mental health impact of parental alienating behaviors. Results from the first two polls indicate that the prevalence of parents who feel they are being alienated from their children is higher than originally estimated: 35.5% (of 273) in the U.S. and 32% (of 397) in Canada. Using another means of assessment for the third poll, 39.1% (of 594) of parents in the US are the non-reciprocating targets of parental alienating behaviors, which is over 22 million parents and confirms previous estimates that did not differentiate between reciprocating and non-reciprocating parents (Harman et al., 2016). Of these, 6.7% of the parents had children who were moderately to severely alienated, which is at least 1.3% of the US population. Alienated parents also had high levels of depression, trauma symptoms, and risk for suicide. Ramifications of these findings for researchers and practitioners are discussed.

AB Depression in old age significantly decreases the quality of life and may lead to serious consequences, such as suicide. Existing literature indicates that elderly Korean immigrants may experience higher levels of depression than other racial ethnic group elders. The purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate factors that influence depression among older Korean immigrants in Toronto. A total of 148 participants, ages 60 years or older (mean age = 74.01, SD = 8.24), completed face-to-face interviews in Korean language. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted by adding variables in three steps: 1) demographic variables; 2) acculturation variables (years of immigration and English proficiency); and 3) social determinants (social integration variables, physical health, and financial satisfaction). Results showed that acculturation factors were not associated with depression. Instead, social determinants variables, including lower physical health status and lower financial status, living alone, and lower level of social activity, predicted higher level of depressive symptoms, along with lower education. The final regression model explained about 37% of variance of depression in the sample. These results suggest that social determinants, not acculturation, are important factors explaining the levels of depression in Korean immigrant elders living in a metropolitan city in Canada. Implications for practice are discussed.

AB Aim This article presents a strategy to prevent trauma, support and care for railway personnel who experience critical incidents (CI) on the job, usually fatalities by accident or suicide. Method We reviewed all publications on CI management, support and care practices in the railway industry, as well as practices in place in Canada (unpublished protocols). Semi structured interviews were conducted with 40 train engineers and conductors involved in CIs and the content was coded and analysed quantitatively. Results Employees' satisfaction with the help received after the incident varies according to the behaviour of the local manager, company officers and police, the level of compliance with existing company protocols to help them, the presence of unmet expectations for support and care, their perceived competency of clinicians they consulted and the level of trust toward their employers. Conclusion On the basis of the interview results, the review of existing railway practices and discussions with railway stakeholders, a model protocol was developed for a comprehensive workplace prevention, support and care protocol to reduce the negative impact of railway critical incidents on employees. This protocol includes preventive actions before traumatic events occur, immediate responses at the site of incident, interventions within the first few days after the incident and longer term support and interventions provided by the company and by outsourced experts.

AB Health inequalities of Indigenous children and youth in Canada are well documented. Recently, the perspectives of children and youth are being recognized as valuable. However, there is a paucity of literature that seek children and youth's perspective regarding their health and well-being. The purpose of this study was to understand how children and youth in Winneway, QC view health and well-being and to identify their main health and well-being concerns. A focused ethnographic study with Indigenous decolonizing framework was used with data primarily collected through interviews of fifteen participants aged 6 to 17. Children and youth in Winneway view their health and well-being as multidimensional and view themselves as decision-makers in their health and well-being. Their main health and well-being concerns include poor eating choices, difficulty expressing emotional and mental concerns, how children and youth treat others, and youth participation in unhealthy behaviours. These findings reveal the valuable perspectives that Indigenous children and youth can have regarding their health and well-being. They also suggest that future health and well-being interventions targeting Indigenous children and youth seek out and respect the knowledge and perspectives that children and youth have of their health and well-being.

AB This qualitative study explored the experiences and patterns of recovery of Chinese-born women living in Canada with a history of suicidal behaviour. It explores a number of dimensions of recovery including clinical, existential, functional, physical, and social. The women described engaging in "survival" recovery in the short term and "thriving" recovery in the long term, with survival strategies extending into the thriving phase of recovery during their complex path to it. The survival recovery phase included accessing culturally sensitive mental health care and obtaining social and instrumental support to help ensure safety, manage stress, and treat psychiatric symptoms. The thriving phase of recovery was described as involving six components: developing an explanatory model with their health care provider; undertaking a process of narrative reflection and prioritizing self-care; engaging in interdisciplinary care team support; engaging the support of family and friends; exploring spiritual and existential supports; and creating goals for the future and a sense of mastery. Through these six avenues, the women began to experience a sense of self-efficacy and agency that improved their ability to cope with stress and pressure, leading to building a life with meaning. The interviews provided insights into how clinical care can be improved and how practitioners can implement a more recovery-oriented approach to practice.

AB The issue of caregiver burden within the context of end-of-life care has received considerable attention. Less focus has been directed at the corresponding issue of care recipients' perceptions of being a burden to others, referred to as "self-perceived burden". The purpose of this interpretative phenomenological study was to gain a better understanding of self-perceived burden from the patient's perspective. Fifteen patients (ten women, five men) from Ottawa, Canada, receiving palliative care for advanced cancer were interviewed. Participants' experiences of self-perceived burden were reflected in two major interrelated categories. "Concern for Others" included the physical, social, and emotional hardships participants believed they were creating for others, as well as concerns about the future and likely effect of their death on those around them. "Implications for Self" reflected feelings of responsibility for causing hardships to others, resulting in distress and a diminished sense of self. A third category, "Minimizing Burden", was also identified, which described coping strategies used by participants to alleviate the burden on others and to reduce the negative impact on themselves. These categories and themes are discussed from the perspective of social psychology theory pertaining to the maintenance of equity in relationships. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article explores the ethical challenges of providing Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID) in a paediatric setting. More specifically, we focus on the theoretical questions that came to light when we were asked to develop a policy for responding to MAID requests at our tertiary paediatric institution. We illuminate a central point of conceptual confusion about the nature of MAID that emerges at the level of practice, and explore the various entailments for clinicians and patients that would flow from different understandings. Finally, we consider the ethical challenges of building policy on what is still an extremely controversial social practice. While MAID is currently available to capable patients in Canada who are 18 years or older-a small but important subsection of the population our hospital serves-we write our policy with an eye to the near future when capable young people may gain access to MAID. We propose that an opportunity exists for MAID-providing institutions to reduce social stigma surrounding this practice, but not without potentially serious consequences for practitioners and institutions themselves. Thus, this paper is intended as a road map through the still-emerging legal and ethical landscape of paediatric MAID. We offer a view of the roads taken and considered along the way, and our justifications for travelling the paths we chose. By providing a record of our in-progress thinking, we hope to stimulate wider discussion about the issues and questions encountered in this work.

ID APPROXIMATE INFERENCE; PREDICTION
AB Penalized quasi-likelihood(PQL) procedure for statistical inference in generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) and in Bayesian disease mapping and ecological modeling are revisited. In GLMM framework, empirical Bayes PQL (EBPQL) procedure is discussed in the context of approximating posterior point and interval prediction of random effects. An in-depth Monte Carlo assessment on EBPQL point and interval estimation of random effects, fixed effects, and prior parameters in univariate and bivariate (shared component) disease mapping and ecological models is presented, with illustrative examples including spatial and ecological modeling of infant mortality rates (relative uncommon events), suicide hospitalization rates (rare events) and suicide mortality rates (extremely rare events), and associated ecological risk factors in local health areas in British Columbia Canada. In particular, EBPQL interval prediction of random effects is explored by prediction uncertainty attributions with respect to uncertainties associated with estimation of random effects, fixed effects, and prior parameters. Estimation of percent attributions of EBPQL random effects prediction errors to prior uncertainty is developed in the context of GLMMs and explored in Bayesian disease mapping and ecological models, suggesting evidence that uncertainty about prior parameter(s) may have minor and negligible influence on EBPQL interval prediction of random effects in Bayesian hierarchical disease mapping and ecological modeling of moderate Poisson observations. The EBPQL inference procedure may be judiciously and profitably utilized in Bayesian disease mapping and ecological model development. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Studies worldwide have reported an increased prevalence of abuse histories among bariatric surgery candidates. The impact of abuse history on weight loss after surgery has not been examined in Canada. Objectives: Determine the prevalence of abuse and its impact on postoperative outcomes in Ontario, Canada.
   Setting: Data from the Ontario Bariatric Registry.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study of laparoscopic gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy surgeries from 2010 to 2014, for which any follow-up data were available (N = 6016). Weight loss outcomes at 3 months (n = 5147), 6 months (n = 4749), and 1 year (n = 4024) were compared between those with and without a self-reported history of any of emotional, physical or sexual abuse and those with and without a history of sexual abuse specifically. Mixed repeated measures models were adjusted for age, sex, type of surgery, and baseline body mass index. One-year postoperative occurrence of revisions or repairs, hospitalization, and death were also examined.
   Results: The prevalence of documented abuse was 21.5%. Emotional abuse was most common (13.1%), followed by sexual abuse (10.6%), then physical abuse (8.9%). There was no significant association between presence of abuse history and weight loss at any time point in repeated measures analyses.
   Conclusion: Abuse histories are common in bariatric surgery candidates in Ontario, but at a lower prevalence than what has been reported elsewhere. History of abuse does not appear to affect weight loss out to 1 year postoperatively and may alert providers to offer additional support perioperatively and postoperatively, particularly in the setting of psychiatric co-morbidity.

AB Objectives: Injuries are responsible for 10% of the global burden of disease; however, the epidemiology of injury among people living with HIV (PLHIV) has not been well elucidated. This study seeks to characterize rates and predictors of injury among PLHIV compared to the general population in British Columbia (BC), Canada.
   Design: A population-based dataset was created via linkage between the BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS and PopulationDataBC.
   Methods: PLHIV aged 20 years and older were compared to a random 10% sample of the adult general population. The International Classification of Diseases 9 and 10 codes were used to classify unintentional and intentional injuries based on the external cause of the injury from 1996 to 2013. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) Poisson regression models were fit to estimate the effect of HIV status on rates of unintentional and intentional injury, and to identify correlates of injury among PLHIV.
   Results: The crude incidence rate of unintentional injury was 18.56/1000 person-years [95% confidence interval (CI) 17.77-19.39] among PLHIV and 8.51/1000 person-years (95% CI 8.42-8.59) in the general population. Among PLHIV, 13.45% of deaths were due to injury, compared to 5.52% of deaths in the general population. In adjusted models, PLHIV were more likely to report unintentional (incidence rate ratio 1.42, 95% CI 1.32-1.52) and intentional injury (incidence rate ratio 1.93, 95% CI 1.70-2.18) compared to the general population.
   Conclusions: We identified elevated rates of intentional and unintentional injury among PLHIV. Injuries are largely preventable; as such, targeted efforts are needed to decrease the burden of injury-related disability and death among PLHIV. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Specialty-specific bioethical education is a mandated component of gastroenterology training programs in Canada, but no gastroenterology-specific bioethical curriculum is available.
   PURPOSE: To assess the relative importance of a variety of bioethical issues to the practice of gastroenterology.
   METHOD: A convenience sample of Canadian gastroenterology residents and staff was surveyed at a national meeting for Canadian gastroenterology trainees. They were asked to indicate their opinions of the relative importance of 24 different bioethical issues in their practice of gastroenterology.
   RESULTS: Respondents made distinctions in the relevance of different bioethical issues to the practice of gastroenterology and there was substantial concordance in the rankings indicated by residents and staff. Truth telling, consent and the capacity to give consent, and consent with regard to specific endoscopic procedures were ranked by both residents and staff as most important to their practice of gastroenterology. In contrast, the issue of euthanasia and assisted Suicide was ranked near the bottom of the list by both residents and staff. The results differ in sortie respects from the key ethical questions identified by opinion leaders in gastroenterology.
   INTERPRETATION: Gastroenterology residents and staff identify some topics as much more relevant than others to the practice of gastroenterology. It is proposed that this can provide a framework for developing a gastroenterology-specific bioethical curriculum, and that there is an important opportunity for developing a joint program through collaboration among gastroenterology training programs across Canada.

DE suicide; parasuicide; ecological; sociodemographic
AB Objective: From 1986 to 1999, the suicide rate in the Edmonton Regional Health Authority (RHA) was greater than that in the Calgary RHA (mean rate ratio 1.4). We conducted a study to determine whether a similar relation holds for parasuicide, and if so, whether the pattern can be explained at the ecologic level by sociodemographic factors.
   Methods: The Edmonton and Calgary RHAs provided data on emergency department visits for nonfatal intentional self-injury for 1997. We obtained sociodemographic data from the 1996 national census for the Edmonton and Calgary census metropolitan areas (CMAs) from Statistics Canada's public-use files. In each CMA, which is nearly coterminous with the corresponding RHA, we created 10 geographic areas based on average income. We analyzed the data at the ecologic level, using linear regression and multilevel Poisson regression.
   Results: The parasuicide rate in the Edmonton CMA was greater than that in the Calgary CMA (rate ratio 1.3). In both CMAs, the parasuicide rate decreased as average income increased. In the final regression models, the only independent variables were average income, CMA, and their interaction term (linear regression model R-2 = 0.82).
   Conclusions: The parasuicide rate in the Edmonton CMA is elevated, compared with that in the Calgary CMA. At the ecologic level, much of the variation in rates can be explained by average income and CMA. The high degree of correlation among the sociodemographic variables suggests that it may not be low income Per se that is affecting the parasuicide rate but, rather, the consequences of belonging to a socially disadvantaged stratum of society.

AB Canada has implemented legislation covering all firearms since 1977 and presents a model to examine incremental firearms control. The effect of legislation on homicide by firearm and the subcategory, spousal homicide, is controversial and has not been well studied to date. Legislative effects on homicide and spousal homicide were analyzed using data obtained from Statistics Canada from 1974 to 2008. Three statistical methods were applied to search for any associated effects of firearms legislation. Interrupted time series regression, ARIMA, and Joinpoint analysis were performed. Neither were any significant beneficial associations between firearms legislation and homicide or spousal homicide rates found after the passage of three Acts by the Canadian Parliament-Bill C-51 (1977), C-17 (1991), and C-68 (1995)-nor were effects found after the implementation of licensing in 2001 and the registration of rifles and shotguns in 2003. After the passage of C-68, a decrease in the rate of the decline of homicide by firearm was found by interrupted regression. Joinpoint analysis also found an increasing trend in homicide by firearm rate post the enactment of the licensing portion of C-68. Other factors found to be associated with homicide rates were median age, unemployment, immigration rates, percentage of population in low-income bracket, Gini index of income equality, population per police officer, and incarceration rate. This study failed to demonstrate a beneficial association between legislation and firearm homicide rates between 1974 and 2008.

AB OBJECTIVES: Following the onset of intensive colonial intervention and rapid social change in the lives of Inuit people, youth in Nunavik have experienced high rates of mental health problems and suicide. Inuit people describe a broad range of contextual influences on mental wellness based on lived experience, but most epidemiological studies have focused on individual risk factors and pathologies. This study aimed to assess the influence of multiple determinants of mental wellness among Inuit youth in Nunavik, including culturally meaningful activities, housing and community social characteristics.
   METHODS: Mental wellness was measured in the form of two primary outcomes: self-esteem and suicidal ideation. Using cross-sectional data from the 2004 Nunavik Inuit Health Survey and multilevel regression modelling, we estimated associations between these two outcomes and various independent individual-and community-level explanatory factors among Inuit youth. All variables were selected to reflect Inuit perspectives on determinants of mental wellness. The study design and interpretation of results were validated with Inuit community representatives.
   RESULTS: Pride in Inuit identity, traditional activities, community-level social support and community-level socio-economic status were found to be protective. Barriers to participating in traditional activities, household crowding and high community rates of violence were risk factors.
   CONCLUSION: These findings support Inuit perspectives, expand the scope of epidemiological analysis of Inuit mental wellness and reinforce the need for locally informed, community-wide approaches to mental wellness promotion for Inuit youth.

DE suicide; premature mortality; epidemiology; borderline personality

AB Background: Cluster B personality disorders (PDs) are prevalent mental health conditions in the general population (1%-6% depending on the subtype and study). Affected patients are known to be heavier users of both mental and medical health care systems than patients with other clinical conditions such as depression.
   Methods: Several rates were estimated using data from the integrated monitoring system for chronic diseases in the province of Quebec, Canada. It provides a profile of annual and period prevalence rates, mortality rates, and years of lost life as well as health care utilisation rates for Quebec residents. All Quebec residents are covered by a universal publicly managed care health plan. It is estimated that the monitoring system includes 99% of Quebec's 8 million inhabitants.
   Results: Quebec residents aged 14 years and older were included in the study. The lifetime prevalence of cluster B PDs was 2.6%. The mean years of lost life expectancy were 13 for men and 9 for women compared to the provincial population. The 3 most important causes of death are suicide (20.4%), cardiovascular diseases (19.1%), and cancers (18.6%). In 2011 to 2012, 78% had consulted a general practitioner and 62% a psychiatrist, 44% were admitted to an emergency department, and 22% were hospitalised.
   Conclusions: Considering mortality, cluster B personality disorder is a severe condition, is highly prevalent in the population, and is associated with heavy health care services utilisation, especially in emergency settings.

AB The government of Quebec (Canada) is poised to adopt a proposition to legalize euthanasia in the form of "Medical Aid in Dying," which presents a new option for end-of-life care. This proposition arouses concerns among palliative care providers. The aim of this article is to provide a palliative care perspective on Quebec's proposition to legalize euthanasia. Based on the epistemological and methodological framework of critical theory, the following three questions are raised: First, in Quebec's current state of the law, is it possible to relieve the suffering of end-of-life patients? Second, can the Quebec proposition to legalize euthanasia in specific circumstances be harmful? Third, is the Quebec proposition on euthanasia compatible with palliative care and social values? In conclusion, recommendations and alternatives to the current Quebec proposition are suggested. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Religious and spiritual factors are increasingly being examined in psychiatric research. Religious beliefs and practices have long been linked to hysteria, neurosis, and psychotic delusions. However, recent studies have identified another side of religion that may serve as a psychological and social resource for coping with stress. After defining the terms religion and spirituality, this paper reviews research on the relation between religion and (or) spirituality, and mental health, focusing on depression, suicide, anxiety, psychosis, and substance abuse. The results of an earlier systematic review are discussed, and more recent studies in the United States, Canada, Europe, and other countries are described. While religious beliefs and practices can represent powerful sources of comfort, hope, and meaning, they are often intricately entangled with neurotic and psychotic disorders, sometimes making it difficult to determine whether they are a resource or a liability.

TI Denying Assisted Dying Where Death is <i>Not</i> 'Reasonably

LA English
DT Article
DE assisted dying; disability; euthanasia; medical assistance in dying;
   suicide
AB The recent change in Canadian law to allow access to medical assistance in dying restricts eligibility, among its other criteria, to those for whom "natural death has become reasonably foreseeable." A recent review of certain aspects of the law examined the evidence pertaining to extending access to assisted dying in three particular request situations currently denied: requests by mature minors, advance requests, and requests where mental illness is the sole underlying medical condition [1]. The requirement for this review was included in the legislation that introduced medical assistance in dying in Canada. Both the original change in the law and the review itself neglected to consider those with intolerable suffering for whom natural death is not reasonably foreseeable. This paper explores the possibility that access to assisted dying should be extended by removing this limiting criterion. It also considers the ethical challenges this might present for those who work in rehabilitation.

AB Objective: To examine associations between Aboriginal enculturation, Canadian acculturation, and alcohol problems among Aboriginal university students living in an urban area in Canada.
   Methods: Data for this mixed methods study were collected through in-person surveys with a convenience sample of Aboriginal university students (n = 60) in 2008/2009.
   Results: Students evidenced high levels of Aboriginal enculturation and Canadian acculturation. Aboriginal enculturation was significantly associated with reduced alcohol problems for Aboriginal university students. There was no association between Canadian acculturation and alcohol problems. Qualitative findings suggest Aboriginal cultural practices helped students cope with problems in their daily lives and provided them with both personal and social rewards.
   Conclusions: This study found Aboriginal enculturation was significantly associated with reduced alcohol problems among Aboriginal university students. Results support the growth of programs and services that encourage Aboriginal students to maintain their cultural identity within the university setting.

Over a 1-year period, 507 cases of parasuicide and 200 controls were recruited from emergency departments in Edmonton, Canada and interviewed using the Beck Hopelessness Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, State Anger Scale, Trait Anger Scale, Self-Esteem Scale, and Social Adjustment Scale. Over the ensuing 1 to 2 years, 414 cases were reinterviewed using the same questionnaires. Mean symptom scores on all questionnaires improved over the course of follow-up, but did not reach control levels. The pattern of improvement varied according to questionnaire. Only half of cases received treatment for the parasuicide from a psychiatrist, psychologist, or other health care provider during the 3 months following the emergency department visit.

AB The Foehn is a warm, dry, downslope wind found on the lee side of mountains; the type-location for this adiabatic wind is the European Alps. In the Swiss village of Leukerbad, residents are quite familiar with the Foehn, which sweeps regularly through the main Rhone valley from the southeast. Leukerbad, located in a side valley, rarely experiences the full force of the Foehn, but the effects of this wind are well known: people say that the Foehn brings headaches, makes them depressed, invites suicide, and generates a feeling of ill health. In contrast, another wind occurring in this valley, the Gemmiwind - which comes over the Gemmi pass into Leukerbad from the north - is known only as a cold wind. Drawing on ethnographic data and literary representations as well as biomedical and meteorological analyses, we consider the meanings of the Foehn as it has penetrated the bodies and minds of mountain inhabitants in Switzerland and beyond.

AB Objective: The objective of the study was to estimate the odds ratio for the association between unemployment and parasuicide, controlling for potential confounding variables.
   Methods: A case-control study was conducted involving 507 cases of parasuicide and 200 age- and sex-matched controls presenting to emergency departments in Edmonton, Canada. Subjects were interviewed using an extensive questionnaire developed for a World Health Organization study of parasuicide. The data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression.
   Results: In a crude analysis, the odds ratio for the association between unemployment and parasuicide was 12.0 (95% confidence interval, 6.0-23.9). After controlling for sociodentographic factors, lifetime prevalence of several Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition, disorders, previous parasuicide, hopelessness, childhood experiences, and emotional support from family and friends, the odds ratio was 5.2 (95% confidence interval, 2.3-11.4).
   Conclusions: Those who are unemployed have an increased risk of parasuicide, and this association persists after accounting for a wide range of potential confounders. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Analyses of fratricide rates based on national homicide data have provided some general information pertaining to offenders and victims of sibling homicide but are limited by data constraints to examining a few major variables. Exploring fratricide from a forensic psychiatric perspective could uncover other related factors and provide insight into why some individuals murder their siblings. In a retrospective study of data from coroners' files on domestic homicide pertaining to individuals killed by their siblings over a 10-year period in Quebec, Canada, we identified several specific offender and victim characteristics and circumstances surrounding offenses. The impact of mental illness and substance abuse on fratricidal behavior is indicated, underscoring the importance of identifying existing psychopathology. From a forensic psychiatric perspective, we identify characteristic patterns and discuss potential dynamics operating in fratricide. We raise some issues relevant to treatment and prevention, including the fact that most cases are alcohol-related, impulsive, and unpredictable until the moment they occur.

TI A Brief Measure of Unbearable Psychache
SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective Psychache has been proposed to cause suicide when it becomes unbearable. However, existing measures of psychache do not directly target unbearable psychache. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to provide initial validation for a brief measure of unbearable psychache.
   Method Three items were selected to create the Unbearable Psychache Scale (UP3). Psychometric properties were assessed in two populations: (1) an online sample composed of 1,006 adults (53% male) from various locations in the United States and (2) a sample of 190 psychiatric inpatient adults (47% male) from a hospital in Western Canada.
   Results In both samples, the UP3 demonstrated excellent internal reliability, and strong convergent and predictive validity. Additionally, the UP3 predicted significant variance in suicidal ideation over and above documented correlates of suicidal ideation including general psychache, hopelessness, perceived burdensomeness, and low belongingness.
   Conclusions The UP3 is a brief, psychometrically sound measure of unbearable psychache that may be well-suited for use in research protocols and clinical assessments.

AB This study investigated the prevalence of depressive symptoms and diagnoses among older adults newly admitted to long-term care facilities (LTCFs) in Ontario, Canada. Using anonymous cross-sectional and longitudinal Minimum Data Set 2.0 (MDS 2.0) assessments (N = 63,095), changes in depressive symptoms and predictors of depression following admission to institutional care were examined. Depressive symptoms were present in 54.3 cases per 100 residents at initial assessment, increasing to 60.8 cases per 100 residents by follow-up. Although depressive symptoms worsened, approximately 30% of residents showed moderate to significant improvement following LTCF admission. Results are discussed in the context of the MDS 2.0 and interRAI Mood CAP as a resource for LTCF care staff.

AB Background. There is a lack of knowledge about how cultural ideas affect First Nations peoples' perception of rehabilitation needs and the ability to access services. Purpose. The study explored the perceptions of treating and healing brain injury from First Nations elders and traditional healers in the communities served by Wassay-Gezhig-Na-Nahn-Dah-We-Igamig (Kenora Area Health Access Centre). Methods. A participatory action approach was used, leading to a focus group with elders and traditional healers. Findings, established through a framework analysis method, were member checked prior to dissemination. Findings. Four themes arose from the data: pervasiveness of spirituality, "fixing" illness or injury versus living with wellness, working together in treating brain injury, and financial support needed for traditional healing. Implications. Funding is required for traditional healing services to provide culturally safe and responsive occupational therapy services to First Nations individuals with brain injury.

AB Approximately half of the skeleton of an adult male (minus the cranium) was found in a forested part of Greater Vancouver, Canada, in August 2000 by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Authorities ruled the death as suicide. The only compelling signs of perimortem trauma were symmetrically fractured coronoid processes of the mandible, which can be attributed to a gunshot in the mouth. However, the remains had also been scavenged by canids, raising a problem in differential diagnosis. Could canid scavenging produce bilateral fracturing of the mandible indistinguishable from gunshot wounds to the mouth?
   We found that canid scavengers could not mimic the type of damage to the mandible caused by intra-oral gunshot wounding using a sheep model (n = 20). Bilateral fracturing of the coronoid processes was found to be characteristic of intra-oral gunshot wounding, while canid scavengers typically ignore this region of the mandible.

AB This community-based research applied environmental dispossession as a theoretical framework for understanding Anishinabe youth perceptions about health, social relationships and contemporary Anishinabe way of life in Northern Ontario, Canada. Qualitative interviews with 19 youth reveal considerable worry about their community's health. Youth perceive changes in the Anishinabe way of life, including decreased access to their traditional lands, to be central to poor health at the community level. Youth emphasized the importance of social relationships for fostering healthy behaviours and developing community wide initiatives that will provide opportunities for reconnecting to land, and for learning and practicing Indigenous Knowledge. This study builds on the growing body of decolonizing research with Indigenous communities, and it concludes by offering the concept of environmental repossession as a way forward for studies on the Indigenous environment-health interface.

AB Our objectives were to (1) compare the risks for poor long-term mental health outcomes among indigenous women with and without a teenage pregnancy and (2) determine if community and cultural factors modify this risk. We conducted a secondary analysis of the 2012 Aboriginal Peoples Survey. Respondents were women aged 25 to 49 years who had given birth to at least one child. Teenage mothers (age at first birth 13 to 19 years; n = 1330) were compared to adult mothers (age at first birth 20 years or older; n = 2630). Mental health outcomes were psychological distress, mental health status, suicide ideation/attempt, and alcohol consumption. To address objective 1, we used binary logistic regression analyses before and after controlling for covariates. To address objective 2, we tested the significance of interaction terms between teenage pregnancy status and effect measure modifiers. In unadjusted analyses, teenage pregnancy was associated with increased risk for poor/fair mental health [odds ratio (OR) 1.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24-2.53] and suicide attempt/ideation (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.07-3.54). However, the associations were not statistically significant after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, environmental, and health covariates. Teenage pregnancy was not associated with increased risk for high psychological distress or heavy alcohol consumption in unadjusted or adjusted analyses. The interaction term for involvement in cultural activities was statistically significant for poor/fair mental health; however, after stratification, ORs were non-significant. Among indigenous mothers, teenage pregnancy was less important than broader social and health circumstances in predicting long-term mental health.

AB Background: Ketamine is known to rapidly reduce depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation (SI) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), but evidence is limited for its acceptability and effectiveness in "real-world" settings. This case series examines serial ketamine infusions in reducing SI and depression scores in adults with MDD admitted to a tertiary care hospital.
   Methods: Five inpatients with MDD and SI admitted to hospital in Toronto, Canada received six infusions of 0.5 mg/kg intravenous (IV) ketamine (n = 5) over approximately 12 days, in addition to treatment-as-usual. Suicide and depression rating scores (Scale for Suicidal Ideation, SSI; Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, MADRS) were obtained at baseline, on treatment days, on days 14 and 42 (primary endpoint).
   Results: All patients experienced benefit with ketamine. SSI scores diminished by 84% from 14.0 +/- 4.5 at baseline to 2.2 +/- 2.5 at study endpoint. MADRS scores diminished by 47% from 42.2 +/- 5.3 at baseline to 22.4 +/- 8.0. Two patients withdrew from the study, one to initiate electroconvulsive therapy and one due to an adverse event (dissociative effects) during the ketamine infusion.
   Limitations: The major limitation of this study is the small sample size.
   Discussion: These preliminary pilot data are promising with a greater than two-fold reduction in SI following ketamine infusions. They demonstrate that six serial ketamine infusions may be safe and feasible. These findings support the need for large scale randomized controlled trials to confirm the efficacy of serial ketamine for treatment of SI in "real-world" settings.

AB Objectives. To examine injury mortality rates in Native and non-Native children in the province of Alberta, Canada, over a 10-year period, temporal trends in injury mortality rates (Native vs. non-Native), as well as relative risks of injury mortality (Native vs. non-Native) by injury mechanism and intent, were calculated.
   Methods. An observational, population-based study design was used. Mortality data were obtained from provincial vital statistics, with injury deaths identified using external injury codes (E-codes). The relative risk (RR) of injury mortality (Native vs. non-Native) along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Stratified analyses and Poisson regression modeling were used to calculate adjusted relative risk.
   Results. Injury mortality rates declined over the study period, with no difference in the rate of decline between Native and non-Native children. The adjusted relative risk for all-cause injury death (Native vs. non-Native) was 4.6 (95% CI 4.1 to 5.2). The adjusted relative risks (Native vs. non-Native) by injury intent categories were: unintentional injuries, 4.0 (95% CI 3.5 to 4.6); suicide, 6.6 (95% CI 5.2 to 8.5); and homicide, 5.1 (95% CI 3.0 to 8.5). injury mortality rates were consistently higher for Native children across all injury mechanism categories. The largest relative risks (Native vs. non-Native) were pedestrian injury (RR=17.0), accidental poisoning (RR=15.4), homicide by piercing objects (RR=15.4), and suicide by hanging (RR=13.5).
   Conclusion. The burden of injury mortality is significantly greater in Native children compared with non-Native children. Therefore, injury prevention strategies that target both intentional and unintentional injuries are needed.

LA English
DT Article
ID FAMILY-STRUCTURE; SUBSTANCE USE; US ADOLESCENTS; RACE/ETHNICITY;
   CHILDREN; SUICIDE
AB Objective: To determine the association of socio-economic (SES) factors with risk behaviours among adolescents.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried out on students in four high schools in northern Nova Scotia, Canada. Associations between SES variables and substance use behaviours, having early intercourse and suicide attempt in the past year were examined using multivariate analysis (logit regression). Negative binomial regression was performed for associations of SES with a total risk score summing risk behaviours.
   Results: Participants included 2,198 students (48% males; 52% females) ranging in age from 14 to 20 years. Almost 25% of youth smoked regularly, 19% of males smoked marijuana greater than or equal to10 times monthly, more than 40% of males regularly drank excessively, and 10% of students >14 years old had had intercourse before age 15. Smoking was the behaviour most often associated with lower SES in both genders. Mother's not being employed was protective against all substance use variables except driving after drinking. Living both with lone mother and in any family arrangement other than with both parents was associated with smoking, using marijuana, and early sex. Higher risk score was associated with living with a lone mother or other family arrangement. Lower risk score was associated with father having more than high school education and mother not working.
   Interpretation: Lower socio-economic status is associated with adolescent risk behaviours. These findings point to the importance of these factors to risk-taking in youth, their relevance to social policy, and also their importance as factors to consider in targeted interventions.

AB OBJECTIVE: The goals of analyzing all non-natural childhood deaths in Manitoba for the 22-year period (1989-2010) are to highlight preventable causes of death and to document temporal trends that might be influenced by changes in society.
   METHODS: The 1989 to 2010 pediatric autopsy database at the Winnipeg Health Sciences Centre and records from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner were searched for all non-natural deaths <= 18 years age. All files were reviewed in detail. Data collected included demographic characteristics, manner of death, details of cause and circumstances leading to death, and survival time after the event.
   RESULTS: For the 22-year period, the total number of non-natural childhood deaths after which autopsy was performed in Manitoba was 581 for males and 409 for females in a population of approximately 1.23 million (2010 estimate). This represents 22.1% of the total childhood deaths in Manitoba during the study period. A higher proportion of children living in rural and northern communities died from non-natural causes. Of all accidents, which peaked in 1999, road traffic incidents accounted for the majority. Of suicides, which peaked in 2005, hanging in the 15-18 year group accounted for almost all cases. Of homicides, child abuse deaths at <3 years age was the most frequent cause. For all causes, most individuals were dead at the scene or died shortly thereafter.
   CONCLUSIONS: Most non-natural childhood deaths in Manitoba might be avoidable through education about prevention strategies and by correction of social inequities. Improved transportation to hospital from remote locations would likely have little impact on survival.

DT Article
DE adolescents; depression; suicidality; service use; young adults
ID CHILDREN; CARE; RISK
AB Objectives: Despite being recognized as a serious public health concern, suicidality among adolescents and young adults is frequently missed, and completed suicide remains the second leading cause of death for young Canadians. With such close links between depression, suicidality, and completed suicide, any intervention must address all 3 of these issues. However, to develop effective interventions, we must understand the types and rates of mental health service use among adolescents and young adults. This study examines service use rates in young Canadians with depression and suicidality and the influence of sex on the types of service provider chosen.
   Methods: We used data from the Canadian Community Health Survey: Mental Health and Well-Being. Our sample included 619 individuals, aged 15 to 24 years, who screened positive for depression and suicidality in the past 12 months. We examined mental health service use rates in general and by provider type.
   Results: Among adolescents aged 15 to 18 years with depression, 40% had not used any mental health services. This rate was higher for adolescents with suicidality at 50%. In young adults aged 19 to 24 with depression, 42% had not used any mental health services. Among young adults with suicidality, 48% had not accessed services. Female adolescents and young adults were more likely to receive services from nonspecialty mental health providers.
   Conclusions: In Canada, many adolescents and young adults with depression and suicidality do not receive mental health services. Further, there may be a preferential treatment of young men by mental health specialists. Further research is needed to understand the quality of care received by these young Canadians and the factors influencing service use.

AB There is growing evidence supporting the notion that exposure to air pollution can contribute to cognitive and psychiatric disorders, including depression and suicide. Given the relationship between exposure to acute stressors and substance abuse, the present study assessed the association between exposure to ambient air pollution and emergency department (ED) visits for alcohol and drug abuse. ED visit data selected according to International Classification of Disease (ICD-9) coding 303 (alcohol dependence syndromes) and 305 (non-dependent abuse of drugs) were collected in five hospitals in Edmonton, Canada. A time-stratified case crossover design was used. Conditional logistic regression was applied to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Season, temperature, and relative humidity were adjusted for using natural splines.
   Results are reported for an increase in pollutant concentrations equivalent to one interquartile range (IQR). Statistically significant positive associations with substance abuse were observed for CO, NO2 and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 mu m (PM10) and 2.5 mu m (PM2.5). The strongest results were obtained in the cold period (October-March) for 1-day lagged CO (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.05, IQR = 0.4 ppm) and NO2 (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.07, IQR = 12.8 ppb); ORs were also significant for CO and NO2 with lags of 2 to 6 days and 2 to 7 days, respectively. The study suggests that, even at low levels, increases in ambient CO, NO2, and PMs are associated with increased hospital admissions for substance abuse, possibly as a result of impacts of air quality on mental health or depression.

AB Background: For decades we have understood the risk factors for suicide in the general population but have fallen short in understanding what distinguishes the risk for suicide among patients with serious psychiatric conditions. Aims: This prompted us to investigate risk factors for suicidal behavior among psychiatric inpatients. Method: We reviewed all psychiatric hospital admissions (2008-2011) to a centralized psychiatric hospital in Ontario, Canada. Using multivariable logistic regression we evaluated the association between potential risk factors and lifetime history of suicidal behavior, and constructed a model and clinical risk score to predict a history of this behavior. Results: The final risk prediction model for suicidal behavior among psychiatric patients (n = 2,597) included age (in three categories: 60-69 [OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.73-0.76], 70-79 [OR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.44-0.46], 80+ [OR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.30.31]), substance use disorder (OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.27-1.32), mood disorder (OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.47-1.52), personality disorder (OR = 2.30, 95% CI = 2.25-2.36), psychiatric disorders due to general medical condition (OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.50-0.55), and schizophrenia (OR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.41-0.43). The risk score constructed from the risk prediction model ranges from 9 (lowest risk, 0% predicted probability of suicidal behavior) to +5 (highest risk, 97% predicted probability). Conclusion: Risk estimation may help guide intensive screening and treatment efforts of psychiatric patients with high risk of suicidal behavior.

AB Objective. Research has indicated that school connectedness acts as a buffer against depressive symptoms and suicidality. However, little is known about the role of socioeconomic status (SES) on these links. The present study examined the moderating role of subjective SES and parental education on the relationships between school connectedness and psychological distress, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.
   Methods. Data were gathered from 4955 participants within the 2013 cycle of the Ontario Students Drug Use and Health Survey, a province-wide repeated school-based survey of students in grade 7 to 12 across Ontario, Canada.
   Results. Results indicated that higher subjective SES is associated with high levels of school connectedness. Subjective SES is also a significant moderator of the association between school connectedness and psychological distress, but not between school connectedness and suicidal ideation or attempts. At low subjective SES, there was no difference in risk of psychological distress between students with high and low levels of school connectedness. However, at higher subjective SES, students with high levels of school connectedness have lower odds of psychological distress than those with low levels of school connectedness. The associations between school connectedness and each of the mental health outcomes did not significantly vary with parental education.
   Conclusions. These findings suggest that the beneficial effects of school connectedness on mental health problems may be more strongly related to adolescents' status beliefs rather than parental education. Future research is needed to better understand the mechanism through which subjective SES and school connectedness influence psychological distress. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: There is limited information to guide health-care service providers and policy makers on the burden of mental disorders and addictions across the Canadian provinces. This study compares interprovincial prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), alcohol use disorder, substance use disorders, and suicidality. Method: Data were extracted from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health (n = 25,113), a representative sample of Canadians over the age of 15 years across all provinces. Cross tabulations and logistic regression were used to determine the prevalence and odds of the above disorders for each province. Adjustments for provincial sociodemographic factors were performed. Results: The past-year prevalence of all measured mental disorders and suicidality, excluding GAD, demonstrated significant interprovincial differences. Manitoba exhibited the highest prevalence of any mental disorder (13.6%), reflecting high prevalence of MDD and alcohol use disorder compared to the other provinces (7.0% and 3.8%, respectively). Nova Scotia exhibited the highest prevalence of substance use disorders (2.9%). Quebec and Prince Edward Island exhibited the lowest prevalence of any mental disorder (8.5% and 7.7%, respectively). Manitoba also exhibited the highest prevalence of suicidal ideation (5.1%); however, British Columbia and Ontario exhibited the highest prevalence of suicidal planning (1.4% and 1.3%, respectively), and Ontario alone exhibited the highest prevalence of suicide attempts (0.7%). Conclusions: Significant interprovincial differences were found in the past-year prevalence of mental disorders and suicidality in Canada. More research is necessary to explore these differences and how they impact the need for mental health services.

TI Trends in childhood injury mortality in Canada, 1979-2002
SO INJURY PREVENTION
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; DEATH RATES; ADULT BEDS; CHILDREN; PREVENTION; INFANTS
AB Objective: To examine national trends in mortality rates for injuries among Canadian children younger than 15 years in 1979-2002.
   Methods: Data on injury deaths were obtained from the Canadian Vital Statistics system at Statistics Canada. Injuries were classified using the codes for external cause of injury and poisoning (E-codes) by intent and by mechanism. Mortality rates were age adjusted to the 1990 world standard population. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate the secular trends.
   Results: Annual mortality rates for total and unintentional injuries declined substantially (from 23.8 and 21.7 in 1979 to 7.2 and 5.8 in 2002, respectively), whereas suicide deaths among children aged 10-14 showed an increasing trend. All Canadian provinces and territories showed a decreasing trend in mortality rates of total injuries. Motor vehicle related injuries were the most common cause of injury deaths (accounted for an average of 36.4% of total injury deaths), followed by suffocation (14.3%), drowning (13.5%), and burning (11.1%); however, suffocation was the leading cause for infants. The number of potential years of life lost due to injury before age 75 decreased from 89 343 in 1979 to 27 948 in 2002 for children aged 0-14 years.
   Conclusions: During the period 1979-2002, there were dramatic decreases in childhood mortality for total injuries and unintentional injuries as well as various degrees of reduction for all causes of injury except suffocation in children aged 10-14 years and drowning in infants. The reason for the reduction in injury mortality might be multifactoral.

ID MENTAL-HEALTH; MUNICIPAL WATER; CONTAMINATION; DISASTER; LINKING;
   SUICIDE; CONTEXT; WELL
AB The implications of a public health emergency on a community may be devastating and long-term. The severity of the implications depends on the gravity of the emergency and the capacity of individuals and communities to respond to and recover from its effects. However, the long-term implications of emergencies are often excluded from disaster management research making it difficult to determine whether communities are truly able to achieve and maintain resilience post-crisis. This interdisciplinary, qualitative study examined the impacts of the May 2000 Escherichia coli outbreak in Walkerton, Canada sixteen years post-outbreak on the present-day resilience status of the community. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with a purposeful sample of 29 Walkerton community members. The data were transcribed verbatim and coded using conventional content analysis to identify themes inductively. The study's findings reveal the importance of various elements of the social capital dimension in facilitating (i.e., capacity building, positive perspective) and hindering (i.e., ongoing health effects) the community's collective resilience status today both directly and indirectly. Some elements, including local economy, local government, rural community characteristics, preparedness, and reputation act as both facilitators and barriers to the social capital component of community resilience. The findings from this work are critical for designing preparedness and recovery programs for emergency situations, particularly in rural communities. They also suggest disaster management program plans and strategies for rural communities should encompass a proactive, long-term, community-centered approach integrating social capital.

AB Background
   Little information has been published about the mortality of the Metis people of Canada. This study describes mortality patterns among Metis and Registered Indian adults, compared with the non-Aboriginal population.
   Data source and methods
   The 1991 to 2001 Canadian census mortality follow-up study tracked mortality among a 15% sample of respondents aged 25 or older, including 11,800 Metis, 56,700 Registered Indians and 2,624,300 non-Aboriginal adults, all of whom were enumerated by the 1991 census long-form questionnaire. Age-specific and age-standardized mortality rates and period life tables based on the number of person-years at risk were calculated across the various groups. Metis were defined by ethnic origin (ancestry).
   Results
   Compared with non-Aboriginal members of the cohort, life expectancy at age 25 was 3.3 and 5.5 years shorter for Metis men and women, respectively, and 4.4 and 6.3 years shorter for Registered Indians. For both Aboriginal groups, mortality rate ratios were highest at younger ages. Mortality rate differences among Metis men were particularly elevated for external causes and circulatory, respiratory and digestive system diseases; among Metis women, for circulatory system diseases, cancers, and digestive and respiratory system diseases. Generally, rate differences for Registered Indian men and women were further elevated.
   Conclusions
   Metis adults had higher mortality rates compared with non-Aboriginal members of the cohort, but lower rates than did Registered Indians.

AB Objective: Previous studies have not examined associations of school connectedness with adolescent suicidal behaviours stratified by gender, while including a measure of depression. We analyzed survey data to determine whether there are independent protective associations of higher school connectedness with suicidal behaviours in Canadian adolescents, while controlling for potential confounders, including risk of depression; and whether such associations differ by gender.
   Method: Using data from a stratified cluster sample of randomly selected classes of students in schools in 3 of Canada's Atlantic provinces, we used multiple logistic regression to examine whether associations of risk of depression, measured using the 12-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale, lessened protective associations of higher school connectedness with suicidal behaviours in grades 10 and 12 students, while stratifying by gender.
   Results: After adjusting for risk of depression, higher school connectedness was independently associated with decreased suicidal ideation in both genders and with suicidal attempt in females. In males, higher connectedness was no longer protective for suicide attempt when risk of depression was included in the model.
   Conclusions: School connectedness, which is felt to have positive influences on many types of adolescent behaviour, appears to also be both directly and indirectly protective for suicidality. These effects may occur through different pathways in females and males. Given the protection it offers both genders, including those at risk and not at risk of depression, increasing school connectedness should be considered as a universal adolescent mental health strategy. Studies that examine school connectedness should include analyses that examine potential differences between males and females.

AB STI rates are high for First Nations in Canada and the United States. Our objective was to understand the context, issues, and beliefs around high STI rates from a nehiyaw (Cree) perspective. Twenty-two in-depth interviews were conducted with 25 community participants between March 1, 2011 and May 15, 2011. Interviews were conducted by community researchers and grounded in the Cree values of relationship, sharing, personal agency and relational accountability. A diverse purposive snowball sample of community members were asked why they thought STI rates were high for the community. The remainder of the interview was unstructured, and supported by the interviewer through probes and sharing in a conversational style. Modified grounded theory was used to analyze the narratives and develop a theory. The main finding from the interviews was that abuse of power in relationships causes physical, mental, emotional and spiritual wounds that disrupt the medicine wheel. Wounded individuals seek medicine to stop suffering and find healing. Many numb suffering by accessing temporary medicines (sex, drugs and alcohol) or permanent medicines (suicide). These medicines increase the risk of STIs. Some seek healing by participating in ceremony and restoring relationships with self, others, Spirit/religion, traditional knowledge and traditional teachings. These medicines decrease the risk of STIs. Younger female participants explained how casual relationships are safer than committed monogamous relationships. Resolving abuse of power in relationships should lead to improvements in STI rates and sexual health. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Since the FDA Black box warning in 2004, there has been a 58% drop in antidepressant use among children and adolescents with depression. Paralleling this decrease is an associated increase in completed suicides in youth. To date, no study has examined, on a clinician level, the changes in practice that have occurred subsequent to the FDA warning. Objective: To examine changes in pediatrician clinical practice resulting from the FDA warning on antidepressants. Methods: Subjects were recruited through a national program sponsored by the Canadian Pediatric Society that regularly surveys practicing pediatricians. The mail survey inquired about knowledge of the Black-box warning, whether their practice changed and reasons for changes in prescribing practices with antidepressants after the warning. We surveyed a total of 2395 pediatricians in Canada. Results: Of the 1748 eligible pediatricians, 670 (38%) responded.
   Seventy-two percent (n = 484) of respondents were aware of the FDA warning. of the 484 respondents who were aware of the warning, 80% (n = 386) changed their prescribing practices including 32% (n = 154) who followed their patients more closely. Seven percent (n = 35) stopped treatment with SSRIs in at least one patient.
   Physicians who had observed worsening depression/suicidality were more likely to discontinue treatment with SSRI's compared to those who had not observed these side effects previously (25% versus 6%, p < 0.001). Conclusion: This is the first national study to examine individual pediatrician practice changes in antidepressant use subsequent to the FDA warning. Further research is needed to better understand the reasons for these changes to aid in the development of strategies that could help clinicians to optimally integrate these warnings into clinical practice.

AB Background. Ethnicity is an important determinant of mental health outcomes including suicidality (i.e. suicidal ideation and suicide attempt). Understanding ethnic differences in the pathways to suicidality is important for suicide prevention efforts in ethnically diverse populations. These pathways can be conceptualized within a social stress framework.
   Method. The study examines ethnic differences in the pathways to suicidality in Canada within a social stress framework. Using data from the Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 1.1 (CCHS 1.1) and path analysis, we examined the hypotheses that variations in (1) socio-economic status (SES), (2) sense of community belonging (SCB), (3) SES and SCB combined, and (4) SES, SCB and clinical factors combined can explain ethnic differences in suicidality.
   Results. Francophone whites and Aboriginals were more likely to report suicidality compared to Anglophone whites whereas visible minorities and Foreign-born whites were least likely. Disadvantages in income, income and education, income and its combined effect with depression and alcohol dependence/abuse led to high rates even among the low-risk visible minority group. Indirect pathways for Asians differed from that of Blacks and South Asians, specifically through SCB. With the exception of SCB, Aboriginals were most disadvantaged, which exacerbated their risk for suicidality. However, their strong SCB buffered the risk for suicidality across pathways. Disadvantages in education, income and SCB were associated with the high risk for suicidality in Francophone whites.
   Conclusions. Francophone whites and Aboriginals had higher odds of suicidality compared to Anglophone whites; however, some pathways differed, indicating the need for targeted program planning and prevention efforts.

AB Background: Population based mortality rates from liver cirrhosis, and alcohol consumption, have increased sharply in Britain in the past 35 years. Little is known about the long term trends over time in mortality rates after hospital admission for liver cirrhosis.
   Aims: To analyse time trends in mortality in the year after admission for liver cirrhosis from 1968 to 1999.
   Subjects: A total of 8192 people who were admitted to hospital in a defined population of Southern England.
   Methods: Analysis of hospital discharge statistics linked to death certificate data. The main outcome measures were case fatality rates (CFRs) and standardised mortality ratios (SMRs).
   Results: At 30 days after admission, CFR was 15.9% and the SMR was 93 (86 in men and 102 in women, compared with 1 in the general population). At one year, the overall CFR was 33.6% and SMR was 16.3. There was no improvement from 1968 to 1999 in mortality rates. SMRs were highest for alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver (27.4 at one year) but lower for biliary cirrhosis (11.4) and chronic hepatitis (10.0). Mortality from most of the main causes of death, including accidents and suicides, was increased.
   Conclusions: The high mortality rates after hospital admission, and the fact that they have not fallen in the past 30 years, show that liver cirrhosis remains a disease with a very poor prognosis. Increased mortality from accidents, suicides, and mental disorders, particularly among those with alcoholic cirrhoses, indicates that prognosis is influenced by behavioural as well as by physical pathology.

AB Objective. Synthesize evidence on effectiveness of interventions designed to improve access to health services by indigenous populations.
   Methods. Review of systematic reviews published as of July 2015, selecting and analyzing only studies in the Region of the Americas. The bibliographic search encompassed MEDLINE, Lilacs, SciELO, EMBASE, DARE, HTA, The Cochrane Library, and organization websites. Two independent reviewers selected studies and analyzed their methodological quality. A narrative summary of the results was produced.
   Results. Twenty-two reviews met the inclusion criteria. All selected studies were conducted in Canada and the United States of America. The majority of the interventions were preventive, to surmount geographical barriers, increase use of effective measures, develop human resources, and improve people's skills or willingness to seek care. Topics included pregnancy, cardiovascular risk factors, diabetes, substance abuse, child development, cancer, mental health, oral health, and injuries. Some interventions showed effectiveness with moderate or high quality studies: educational strategies to prevent depression, interventions to prevent childhood caries, and multicomponent programs to promote use of child safety seats. In general, results for chronic non-communicable diseases were negative or inconsistent.
   Conclusions. Interventions do exist that have potential for producing positive effects on access to health services by indigenous populations in the Americas, but available studies are limited to Canada and the U.S. There is a significant research gap on the topic in Latin America and the Caribbean.

AB In Canada, the issue of creating safe and inclusive school environments for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer students has been in the spotlight. Several researchers and advocates have pointed out the positive effects of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer-positive policy frameworks on the health and wellbeing of all young people. In this article, we take a critical approach to analyzing narrative findings from qualitative interviews conducted with youth in three communities in British Columbia, Canada: "the North," Vancouver, and Abbotsford. Using a Foucauldian Discourse Analytic Approach and Butler's concept of Citationality, our analysis suggested that although explicit homophobia was largely absent from youth discussions, young people discursively constructed lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer identities and "communities" in ways that reified heteronormativity. Youth made references to sociopolitical discourses of libertarianism and liberalism and to homonormative stereotypes regarding gay masculinity. A few young people also alluded to egalitarian, queer-positive discourses, which appeared to interrogate structures of heteronormativity. Since studies suggest a connection between the existence of institutional supports for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer students in schools and their mental and physical wellbeing, we conclude by considering the limitations and possibilities of these sociopolitical discourses in the struggle for sexual and gender equity, and how they might help frame future health-related, anti-homophobia policy frameworks in educational settings.

AB Background: Currently, there is a dearth of baseline data on the health of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) populations in the province of Nova Scotia, Canada. Historically, LGBTQ health research has tended to focus on individual-level health risks associated with poor health outcomes among these populations, which has served to obscure the ways in which they maintain their own health and wellness across the life course. As such, there is an urgent need to shift the focus of LGBTQ health research towards strengths-based perspectives that explore the complex and resilient ways in which LGBTQ populations promote their health.
   Methods: This paper discusses the findings of our recent scoping review as well as the qualitative data to emerge from community consultations aimed at developing strengths-based approaches to understanding and advancing LGBTQ pathways to health across Nova Scotia.
   Results: Our scoping review findings demonstrated the lack of strengths-based research on LGBTQ health in Nova Scotia. Specifically, the studies examined in our scoping review identified a number of health-promoting factors and a wide variety of measurement tools, some of which may prove useful for future strengths-based health research with LGBTQ populations. In addition, our community consultations revealed that many participants had negative experiences with health care systems and services in Nova Scotia. However, participants also shared a number of factors that contribute to LGBTQ health and suggestions for how LGBTQ pathways to health in Nova Scotia can be improved.
   Conclusions: There is an urgent need to conduct research on the health needs, lived experiences, and outcomes of LGBTQ populations in Nova Scotia to address gaps in our knowledge of their unique health needs. In moving forward, it is important that future health research take an intersectional, strengths-based perspective in an effort to highlight the factors that promote LGBTQ health and wellness across the life course, while taking into account the social determinants of health.

AB Background: Inuit in Canada have experienced dietary changes over recent generations, but how this relates to psychological distress has not been investigated.
   Objective: To evaluate how nutritional biomarkers are related to psychological distress.
   Design: A total of 36 communities in northern Canada participated in the International Polar Year Inuit Health Survey (2007-2008). Of 2796 households, 1901 (68%) participated; 1699 Inuit adults gave blood samples for biomarker analysis and answered the Kessler 6-item psychological distress questionnaire (K6). Biomarkers included n-3 fatty acids and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D). The K6 screens for psychological distress over the last 30 days with six items scored on a 4-point scale. A total score of 13 or more indicates serious psychological distress (SPD). Logistic regression models were used to investigate any associations between SPD and biomarkers while controlling for age, gender, marital status, days spent out on the land, feeling of being alone, income and smoking.
   Results: The 30-day SPD prevalence was 11.2%, with women below 30 years having the highest and men 50 years and more having the lowest SPD prevalence at 16.1% and 2.6%, respectively. SPD was associated with being female, younger age, not being married or with a common-law partner, spending few days out on the land, feelings of being alone, smoking and low income. Low levels of both 25(OH) D and long-chain n-3 FAs were associated with higher odds for SPD in both unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models.
   Conclusion: In this cross-sectional analysis, low levels of 25(OH) D and long-chain n-3 FAs were associated with higher odds ratios for SPD, which highlights the potential impact of traditional foods on mental health and wellbeing. Cultural practices are also important for mental health and it may be that the biomarkers serve as proxies for cultural activities related to food collection, sharing and consumption that increase both biomarker levels and psychological well-being.

AB In this retrospective study, relevant demographic, social, and clinical variables were examined in 77 cases of paternal filicide. Between 1991 and 200 1, all consecutive coroners' files on domestic homicide in Quebec, Canada, were reviewed, and 77 child victims of 60 male parent perpetrators were identified. The results support data indicating that more fathers commit filicide than do mothers. A history of family abuse was characteristic of a substantial number of cases, and most of the cases involved violent means of homicide. Filicide was frequently (60%) followed by the suicide of the perpetrator and more so (86%) in cases involving multiple sibling victims. The abuse of drugs and alcohol was rare. At the time of the offense, most of the perpetrators were suffering from a psychiatric illness, usually depressive disorder. Nearly one-third were in a psychotic state. The proportion of fatal abuse cases was comparatively low. Many of the perpetrators had had contact with health professionals prior to the offense, although none had received treatment for a psychiatric illness.

AB This paper reads the recent Ontario fertility program as a pro-natalist neo-eugenics project that is enacted through the logic of homonationalism in Canada. It demonstrates that the program's use of pinkwashing through an emphasis on LGBTQ+ people obscures not only the inaccessibility of fertility treatment both on individual and structural levels particularly to Indigenous people, people of colour and poor people, but also to other minoritized populations, who have survived but continue to face a genocidal government. The paper moves past questions of inclusion to question the nation-state's priorities with regard to the allocation of $50 million to facilitate the reproduction of primarily white people in the context of suicide crises on reserves and Black youth experiencing alarming rates of police violence. When the nation-state is positioned in terms of these factors, it becomes clear that it is using coded strategies to foster the building of a wealthy white citizenship.

DT Article
DE conscience; referral; complicity; assisted dying; moral disagreement;

AB Complicity in an immoral, and even criminal, activity, such as robbery or murder, is itself regarded as involving responsibility for those acts. What should the position be of health professionals who are expected to participate in actions that they believe are morally wrong? Professional responsibilities may clash with private conscience. Even referring a patient to someone else, when what is in question may be assisted suicide, or euthanasia, seems to involve some complicity. This is a live issue in Canada, but similar dilemmas occur elsewhere. Physicians and others should not be coerced into involvement of any kind in what they regard as wrong. Such coercion goes against the very principles of liberal democracy. Conscience matters. Reasonable accommodation should be given to those whose moral judgment may be at variance with prevailing professional norms. Moral questions should still be given weight within medicine, and disagreements respected. Dedication to the promotion of human welfare should be paramount, but it should be recognized that there may be different visions of what such welfare consists of.

AB Objective: Given the increasing use of atypical antipsychotics in psychiatric populations and the very limited data concerning the safety of such drugs, we examined the available data on olanzapine in untreated overdose situations. Methods: Available toxicity data concerning olanzapine were obtained from the Offices of the Medical Examiners of Canada, the Canadian Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring Program and a review of the literature. Results: Despite the complexities and limitations of postmortem data analysis, 29 deaths were identified where an overdose of olanzapine was either the principal cause of toxicity or a significant contributor in combined toxicity. Conclusions: Olanzapine is associated with toxicity in certain overdose situations, but evidence of any relation is limited and likely influenced by the higher rates of cardiovascular disease and sudden death in subjects with schizophrenia. Recommendations: Similar toxicity data reviews should be conducted for all commonly prescribed psychotropics. Early signal detection and effective notification processes are crucial in the event that serious adverse effects do occur.

AB We examined income source and match between recommended and received care among users of community mental health services. We conducted a secondary analysis of needs-based planning data on adults in Ontario community mental health programs from 2000 to 2002. The outcome was whether clients were severely underserved (yes/no) based on the match between level of care recommended and received. A logistic regression model investigated if income source predicted this outcome. 13% of clients were severely underserved. Over 40% were on public assistance and they had a higher risk of being severely undeserved than the others. Men were at greater risk. One aim of mental health reform is to increase access to care for vulnerable individuals. The finding that among users of community mental health services, individuals with public assistance income support are most vulnerable to being severely underserved should be considered by service planners and providers.

AB This paper unpacks the slippery slope argument as it pertains to assisted death.
   The assisted-death regimes of the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and the states of Washington and Oregon are discussed and examined with respect to the slippery slope analytical rubric. In addition to providing a preliminary explanation of how the slippery slope argument has been academically defined and constructed, the paper examines assisted-death models from the perspective of considering what might exist at the top and at the bottom of the slippery slope. It also explores the nature and scope of safeguards implemented to avoid slippage, and shows that what lies at the top and bottom of the slippery slope may be different from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. After identifying some of the recent concerns that have arisen within each of the jurisdictions (concerns that might be viewed by some as evidence of slide), the paper concludes by making note of certain critical issues in the current assisted-death debate that merit deeper examination.

AB Although adolescents often struggle to regulate their anger, few studies have examined anger regulation within the period of adolescence. In view of this, this study explored potential sex and age differences in anger experience, expressions, and control among Grades 8-12 adolescents (n = 766) in Western Canada. Anger regulation was evaluated by the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory. Three separate multivariate analyses of variance and post hoc tests were performed. Results revealed that Grade 12 students experienced more anger than Grade 8 students. Furthermore, Grades 10-12 students engaged in greater levels of anger-expressive suppression compared with those in Grade 8; Grade 12 students also suppressed their anger more than Grade 9 students. Lastly, girls were less likely to control their outward anger as compared with boys. These results provide important implications for intervention efforts by suggesting nonlinear developmental patterns in anger experience and expressions as well as sex differences in anger control.

AB As access to technology is increasing in children and adolescents, there are growing concerns over the dangers of cyber bullying. It remains unclear what cyber bullying looks like among young Canadian children and how common these experiences are. In this study, we examine the psychometric properties of a measure of cyber bullying behaviors and victimization experiences. We also examine the frequency of these behaviors and experiences among fifth- and sixth-grade Canadian children at the beginning (n = 714) and end (n = 638) of a school year. Children's cyber bullying behaviors and victimization experiences were relatively stable across the school year and were highest for sixth-grade students who reported greater access to and use of technology. Cyber bullying behaviors representing joking around were endorsed more frequently than aggressive types of behaviors (i.e., spreading rumours or posting embarrassing pictures online). Implications for school-based prevention efforts are discussed.

AB Per capita consumption of alcohol has traditionally been considered to be the leading indicator of population levels of alcohol problems. However, some recent research suggests that this relationship may be weakening, and that drinking pattern measures may be preferable to per capita consumption as problem-level indicators. We compared the ability of per capita alcohol consumption and survey-based measures of alcohol use to predict deaths from injuries in Ontario, Canada, for the period 1977-1996. Per capita consumption and percentage of daily drinkers were significantly related to injury mortality, but percentage of drinkers and percentage of episodic heavy drinkers (those who drank five or more drinks on a drinking occasion) were not. Of the measures we examined, per capita consumption was the strongest indicator of mortality rates from injuries. However, the survey-derived measure of percentage of daily drinkers was similar to per capita consumption in ability to predict problem levels.

AB Children of more than 3 years of age and adolescents have been largely overlooked in the forensic literature, especially the 4-9 age group. Thus, the present study was undertaken to address this particular issue of child and adolescent victims in forensic autopsies. On a 5-year period (2000-2004) in Quebec province (Canada), all forensic autopsy cases of children and adolescents from 4 to 19 years of age were retrospectively studied. A total of 223 cases of child and adolescent deaths (148 males, 75 females; 6.6% of all forensic autopsies) were reviewed. Age, gender, manner of death and cause of death were analyzed for all victims organized into three groups of age: 4-9, 10-14, and 15-19. Moreover, homicide cases (n = 54) are further analyzed in terms of method(s) used (firearm, sharp force, asphyxia, blunt force, intoxication). This 5-year retrospective study may contribute to a better understanding of typical deaths in the 4-19 group of age and therefore, bring a working basis for the forensic pathologist or medical examiner/coroner.

AB Objective: This study was designed to provide a representative description of the mental health of youth accessing homelessness services in Canada. It is the most extensive survey in this area to date and is intended to inform the development of mental health and addiction service and policy for this marginalized population.
   Methods: This study reports mental health-related data from the 2015 "Leaving Home" national youth homelessness survey, which was administered through 57 agencies serving homeless youth in 42 communities across the country. This selfreported, point-in-time survey assessed a broad range of demographic information, pre-homelessness and homelessness variables, and mental health indicators.
   Results: Survey data were obtained from 1103 youth accessing Canadian homelessness services in the Nunavut territory and all Canadian provinces except for Prince Edward Island. Forty-two per cent of participants reported 1 or more suicide attempts, 85.4% fell in a high range of psychological distress, and key indicators of risk included an earlier age of the first episode of homelessness, female gender, and identifying as a sexual and/or gender minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and 2 spirit [LGBTQ2S]).
   Conclusions: This study provides clear and compelling evidence of a need for mental health support for these youth, particularly LGBTQ2S youth and female youth. The mental health concerns observed here, however, must be considered in the light of the tremendous adversity in all social determinants faced by these youth, with population-level interventions best leveraged in prevention and rapid response.

ID SRI-LANKA; SUICIDE; ANTIDEPRESSANTS; OVERDOSE; PESTICIDES; EXPERIENCE
AB Objective: To examine population trends in serious intentional overdoses leading to admission to intensive care units (ICUs) in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.
   Method: Participants consisted of 1,011 individuals presenting to any of the 11 ICUs in Winnipeg, Canada, with deliberate self-poisonings from January 2000 to December 2010. Eight categories of substances were created: poisons, over-the-counter medications, prescription medications, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), sedatives and antidepressants, anticonvulsants, lithium, and cocaine. Using the population of Winnipeg as the denominator, we conducted generalized linear model regression analyses using the Poisson distribution with log link to determine significance of linear trends in overdoses by substance over time.
   Results: Women accounted for more presentations than men (57.8%), and the largest percentage of overdoses occurred among individuals in the 35-to 54-year age range. A large proportion of admissions were due to multiple overdoses, which accounted for 65.7% of ICU admissions. At the population level, multiple overdoses increased slightly over time (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.02, P <.05), whereas use of poisons (IRR = 0.897, P <.01), over-the-counter medications (IRR = 0.910, P <.01), nonpsychotropic prescription medications (IRR = 0.913, P <.01), anticonvulsants (IRR = 0.880, P <.01), and TCAs (IRR = 0.920, P <.01) decreased over time. Overdoses did not change over time as a function of age or sex. However, severity of overdoses classified by length of stay increased over time (IRR = 1.08, P <.01).
   Conclusions: It is important for physicians to exercise vigilance while prescribing medication, including being aware of other medications their patients have access to. (C) Copyright 2015 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB Objective: The epidemiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) was first described in the Canadian national population in 2002. Updated information is now available from a 2012 survey: the Canadian Community Health Study-Mental Health (CCHS-MH).
   Method: The CCHS-MH employed an adaptation of the World Health Organization World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview and had a sample of n = 25 113. Demographic variables, treatment, comorbidities, suicidal ideation, and perceived stigma were assessed. The analysis estimated adjusted and unadjusted frequencies and prevalence ratios. All estimates incorporated analysis methods to account for complex survey design effects.
   Results: The past-year prevalence of MDD was 3.9% (95% CI 3.5% to 4.2%). Prevalence was higher in women and in younger age groups. Among respondents with past-year MDD, 63.1% had sought treatment and 33.1% were taking an antidepressant (AD); 4.8% had past-year alcohol abuse and 4.5% had alcohol dependence. Among respondents with past-year MDD, the prevalence of cannabis abuse was 2.5% and that of dependence was 2.9%. For drugs other than cannabis, the prevalence of abuse was 2.3% and dependence was 2.9%. Generalized anxiety disorder was present in 24.9%. Suicide attempts were reported by 6.6% of respondents with past-year MDD. Among respondents accessing treatment, 37.5% perceived that others held negative opinions about them or treated them unfairly because of their disorder.
   Conclusions: MDD is a common, burdensome, and stigmatized condition in Canada. Seeking help from professionals was reported at a higher frequency than in prior Canadian studies, but there has been no increase in AD use among Canadians with MDD.

AB Beginning in the mid-1990s, the construct of historical trauma was introduced into the clinical and health science literatures to contextualize, describe, and explain disproportionately high rates of psychological distress and health disparities among Indigenous populations. As a conceptual precursor to racial trauma, Indigenous historical trauma (IHT) is distinguished by its emphasis on ancestral adversity that is intergenerationally transmitted in ways that compromise descendent well-being. In this systematic review of the health impacts of IHT, 32 empirical articles were identified that statistically analyzed the relationship between a measure of IHT and a health outcome for Indigenous samples from the United States and Canada. These articles were categorized based on their specific method for operationalizing IHT, yielding 19 articles that were grouped as historical loss studies, 11 articles that were grouped as residential school ancestry studies, and three articles that were grouped as "other" studies. Articles in all three categories included diverse respondents, disparate designs, varied statistical techniques, and a range of health outcomes. Most reported statistically significant associations between higher indicators of IHT and adverse health outcomes. Analyses were so complex, and findings were so specific, that this groundbreaking literature has yet to cohere into a body of knowledge with clear implications for health policy or professional practice. At the conceptual level, it remains unclear whether IHT is best appreciated for its metaphorical or literal functions. Nevertheless, the enthusiasm surrounding IHT as an explanation for contemporary Indigenous health problems renders it imperative to refine the construct to enable more valid research.

AB ObjectiveThe road to legalization of Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID) across Canada has largely focused on legislative details such as eligibility and establishment of regulatory clinical practice standards. Details on how to implement high-quality, person-centered MAID programs at the institutional level are lacking. This study seeks to understand what improvement opportunities exist in the delivery of the MAID process from the family caregiver perspective.MethodThis multi-methods study design used structured surveys, focus groups, and unstructured e-mail/phone conversations to gather experiential feedback from family caregivers of patients who underwent MAID between July 2016 and June 2017 at a large academic hospital in Toronto, Canada. Data were combined and a qualitative, descriptive approach used to derive themes within family perspectives.ResultImprovement themes identified through the narrative data (48% response rate) were grouped in two categories: operational and experiential aspects of MAID. Operational themes included: process clarity, scheduling challenges and the 10-day period of reflection. Experiential themes included clinician objection/judgment, patient and family privacy, and bereavement resources.Significance of resultsTo our knowledge, this is the first time that family caregivers' perspectives on the quality of the MAID process have been explored. Although practice standards have been made available to ensure all legislated components of the MAID process are completed, detailed guidance for how to best implement patient and family centered MAID programs at the institutional level remain limited. This study provides guidance for ways in which we can enhance the quality of MAID from the perspective of family caregivers.

ID COVERAGE; NEWS; HEALTH; SUICIDE; DEATH; LIFE; END
AB Objective To examine how Canadian newspapers portrayed physicians' role and medical assistance in dying (MAiD).
   Design Qualitative textual analysis.
   Setting Online and print articles from Canadian French and English newspapers.
   Participants 813 newspaper articles published from 1972 to 2016.
   Results Key Canadian events defined five eras. From 1972 to 1990, newspapers portrayed physician's MAiD role as a social issue by reporting supportive public opinion polls and revealing it was already occurring in secret. From 1991 to 1995, newspapers discussed legal aspects of physicians' MAiD role including Rodriguez' Supreme Court of Canada appeal and Federal government Bills. From 1996 to 2004, journalists discussed professional aspects of physicians' MAiD role and the growing split between palliative care and physicians who supported MAiD. They also reported on court cases against Canadian physicians, Dr Kevorkian and suffering patients who could not receive MAiD. From 2005 to 2013, newspapers described political aspects including the tabling of MAiD legislation to change physicians' role. Lastly, from 2014 to 2016, newspapers again portrayed legal aspects of physicians' role as the Supreme Court of Canada was anticipated to legalise MAiD and the Quebec government passed its own legislation. Remarkably, newspapers kept attention to MAiD over 44 years before it became legal. Articles generally reflected Canadians' acceptance of MAiD and physicians were typically portrayed as opposing it, but not all did.
   Conclusions Newspaper portrayals of physicians' MAiD role discussed public opinion, politicians' activities and professional and legal aspects. Portrayals followed the issue- attention cycle through three of five stages: 1) preproblem, 2) alarmed discovery and euphoric enthusiasm and 3) realising the cost of significant progress.

AB Around the world, the recent introduction of assisted death laws has meant that undertaking medical assistance in dying (MAID) is now an option for some persons wishing to end their life. Some of these people donate their bodies to medical science, and by doing so have created a new route from which donor programs can now receive bodies. Such donations have also illuminated a myriad of novel ethical questions. This article considers the emotive and controversial topic of MAID in relation to body donation, describing the experiences of McMaster University, Canada, where several MAID body donors have been received by the anatomical donor program. It provides background on the development and implementation of MAID in Canada, and describes the experience of staff and students at McMaster to MAID donations. It also explores the relevance of MAID to body donation programs, and discusses several of the ethical challenges facing body donation programs who may encounter MAID body donors. These include the appropriateness of accepting MAID donors, issues with informed consent, the effect of personal engagement with MAID donors, information sharing around MAID donations, governance issues, and negative historical parallels between MAID and euthanasia. Suggestions on how to manage MAID body donation focus on how issues affecting institutions, faculty, and students may be approached utilizing appropriate transparency and communication, some of which may facilitate student professional development around the topic of MAID. It is also suggested that the development of ethically appropriate guidelines on MAID body donations may positively guide the anatomical community.

AB Objective: To examine sociodemographic variations among children <18 years in (1) rates of self-harm visits to emergency departments (EDs) and (2) physician follow-up after the self-harm visit in Alberta.
   Methods: A retrospective, population-based cohort (2002-2011) of ED visits for self-harm by individuals <18 years was conducted using administrative databases from Alberta, Canada. Individuals were grouped by First Nations status or type of health care premium subsidy (family receipt of government subsidy, human services program subsidy, no subsidy received). Visits from 104 EDs were summarized by crude and directly standardized visit rates (DSVRs) per 100,000 individuals. Kaplan-Meier estimates for median estimated time to physician follow-up were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Results: During the study period, visit rates decreased with the exception of children from families receiving government-sponsored program subsidy (DSVRs 163/100,000 to 250/100,000; p=0.032). First Nations children had disproportionately fewer follow-up visits compared to other children. The median time to follow-up for First Nations children was 39 days (95% CI: 32, 48) compared to 16 days for children from families receiving no subsidy (95% CI: 14, 19), who had the shortest follow-up time after an ED visit.
   Conclusions: Sociodemographic differences were evident in ED visit rates as well as the number of and time to physician follow-up visit. The disparities experienced by First Nations children in the follow-up period highlight an opportunity for culturally-grounded risk and needs assessment in the ED to determine and facilitate timely and appropriate follow-up care.

AB Conduct problems place children at increased risk for a broad array of negative health and social outcomes that include conduct disorder, injuries and violence, school failure, substance abuse, depression, and suicide. Prevention interventions have the potential to interrupt the chain of events linking early conduct problem symptoms to future negative life outcomes, but have received much less emphasis than interventions designed to treat established cases of disorder. Reading problems are a well-established correlate of conduct disorder. However, whether or not reading problems cause conduct disorder continues to be debated. If they are in fact a causal risk factor this would justify the design and evaluation of interventions designed to enhance reading skills and/or remediate problems. In this paper we use logistic regression techniques to evaluate the relation between reading achievement at school entry and conduct problems 30 months later, in a representative, non-clinic sample of kindergarten and grade one children, in Ontario, Canada. The findings show that an eight point increase in reading scores (equivalent to an moderate effect size of 0.5) would result in a 23 per cent decrease in the risk of conduct problems 30 months later, after controlling for gender, income and baseline conduct problem symptoms. We conclude that reading problems may contribute to the early onset of conduct disorder. Randomized experimental studies designed to evaluate the effects of reading programmes in non-clinic samples of children are needed to: (i) establish whether the link between reading problems at school entry and conduct disorder is causal; and (ii) determine whether reading intervention programmes are an effective conduct disorder prevention strategy.

TI Death and dying abroad:: The Canadian experience
SO JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID TRAVEL; OVERSEAS
AB Background:The objective was to examine the characteristics of international travelers from Canada, who have died while abroad, and to review the health protection and promotion strategies for prevention of adverse health outcomes associated with travel, which may have prevented these deaths.
   Method:An EpiInfo 6 program was created to analyse all of the Consular reports received in 1995 via the Secure Integrated Global Network, which provides communications and computerization services to the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Canada. The Consular Management and Operations System was designed to support the delivery of consular services by the Department, and to link Headquarters in Ottawa with missions in other countries, through case management files, including a "Death Abroad" file. The type of data collected included personal demographics (age, gender), date, country, and cause of death.
   Results: In 1995, consular services received 309 reports of Canadians dying abroad. Two hundred and twenty deaths were males (71.2%), and 69 were females (22.3%). The average age (56 years) and median age (43 years) were similar for males and females (age range 0.3-86 years). Recorded causes of death were: natural (62.1%), accidents (24.9%), murder (7.8%), and suicide (5.2%). Cardiovascular disease and trauma were the two most commonly specified causes of death.
   Conclusions: At least 36% of the deaths occurring in Canadian travelers would be considered preventable. Pretravel medical interventions for travelers with known preexisting medical problems, may have prevented many more deaths. International travelers need to be aware of the health risks associated with travel. Access to appropriate health risk assessment, prior to exposure, in many cases, would have prevented death abroad.

AB Objective: Identifying child and household characteristics that are associated with specific child maltreatment types and child functional impairment are important for informing prevention and intervention efforts. Our objectives were to examine the distribution of several child and household characteristics among substantiated child maltreatment types in Canada; to determine if a specific child maltreatment type relative to all other types was associated with increased odds of child functional impairment; and to determine which child and household characteristics were associated with child functional impairment.
   Method: Data were from the Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect (collection 2008) from 112 child welfare sites across Canada (n = 6163 children).
   Results: Physical abuse, sexual abuse, and emotional maltreatment were highly prevalent among children aged 10 to 15 years. For single types of child maltreatment, the highest prevalence of single-parent homes (50.6%), social assistance (43.0%), running out of money regularly (30.7%), and unsafe housing (30.9%) were reported for substantiated cases of neglect. Being male, older age, living in a single-parent home, household running out of money, moving 2 or more times in the past year, and household overcrowding were associated with increased odds of child functional impairment.
   Conclusions: More work is warranted to determine if providing particular resources for single-parent families, financial counselling, and facilitating adequate and stable housing for families with child maltreatment histories or at risk for child maltreatment could be effective for improving child functional outcomes.

SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID INUIT HEALTH; IMPACTS; VULNERABILITY; DETERMINANTS; COMMUNITIES
AB As the impacts from anthropogenic climate change are increasing globally, people are experiencing dramatic shifts in weather, temperature, wildlife and vegetation patterns, and water and food quality and availability. These changes impact human health and well-being, and resultantly, climate change has been identified as the biggest global health threat of the 21st Century. Recently, research is beginning to indicate that changes in climate, and the subsequent disruption to the social, economic, and environmental determinants of health, may cause increased incidences and prevalence of mental health issues, emotional responses, and large-scale sociopsychological changes. Through a multi-year, community-led, exploratory case study conducted in Rigolet, Nunatsiavut, Labrador, Canada, this research qualitatively explores the impacts of climate change on mental health and well-being in an Inuit context. Drawing from 67 in-depth interviews conducted between January 2010 and October 2010 with community members and local and regional health professionals, participants reported that changes in weather, snow and ice stability and extent, and wildlife and vegetation patterns attributed to climate change were negatively impacting mental health and well-being due to disruptions in land-based activities and a loss of place-based solace and cultural identity. Participants reported that changes in climate and environment increased family stress, enhanced the possibility of increased drug and alcohol usage, amplified previous traumas and mental health stressors, and were implicated in increased potential for suicide ideation. While a preliminary case study, these exploratory findings indicate that climate change is becoming an additional mental health stressor for resource-dependent communities and provide a baseline for further research.

AB Objective The Canadian province of Quebec has recently legalized medical aid in dying (MAID) for competent patients who satisfy strictly defined criteria. The province is considering extending the practice to incompetent patients. We compared the attitudes of four groups of stakeholders toward extending MAID to incompetent patients with dementia. Methods We conducted a province-wide postal survey in random samples of older adults, informal caregivers of persons with dementia, nurses, and physicians caring for patients with dementia. Clinical vignettes featuring a patient with Alzheimer's disease were used to measure the acceptability of extending MAID to incompetent patients with dementia. Vignettes varied according to the stage of the disease (advanced or terminal) and type of request (written or oral only). We used the generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach to compare attitudes across groups and vignettes. Results Response rates ranged from 25% for physicians to 69% for informal caregivers. In all four groups, the proportion of respondents who felt it was acceptable to extend MAID to an incompetent patient with dementia was highest when the patient was at the terminal stage, showed signs of distress, and had written a MAID request prior to losing capacity. In those circumstances, this proportion ranged from 71% among physicians to 91% among informal caregivers. Conclusion We found high support in Quebec for extending the current MAID legislation to incompetent patients with dementia who have reached the terminal stage, appear to be suffering, and had requested MAID in writing while still competent.

AB Objective: Although the high prevalence of mental health issues among postsecondary students is well documented, comparatively little is known about the adequacy, accessibility, and adherence to best practices of mental health services (MHSs)/initiatives on postsecondary campuses. We evaluated existing mental health promotion, identification, and intervention initiatives at postsecondary institutions across Canada, expanding on our previous work in one Canadian province.
   Methods: A 54-question online survey was sent to potential respondents (mainly front-line workers dealing directly with students [e.g., psychologists/counsellors, medical professionals]) at Canada's publicly funded postsecondary institutions. Data were analyzed overall and according to institutional size (small [<2000 students], medium [2000-10 000 students], large [>10 000 students]).
   Results: In total, 168 out of 180 institutions were represented, and the response rate was high (96%; 274 respondents). Most institutions have some form of mental health promotion and outreach programs, although most respondents felt that these were not a good use of resources. Various social supports exist at most institutions, with large ones offering the greatest variety. Most institutions do not require incoming students to disclose mental health issues. While counselling services are typically available, staff do not reliably have a diverse complement (e.g., gender or race diversity). Counselling sessions are generally limited, and follow-up procedures are uncommon. Complete diagnostic assessments and the use of standardized diagnostic systems are rare.
   Conclusions: While integral MHSs are offered at most Canadian postsecondary institutions, the range and depth of available services are variable. These data can guide policy makers and stakeholders in developing comprehensive campus mental health strategies.

DE Inuit; women; health
ID ABORIGINAL POPULATIONS; MENTAL-HEALTH; EXPOSURE; OUTCOMES; NATIVES;
   QUEBEC
AB Objectives. Inuit women face challenging health and wellness issues in Northern communities. Literature examining these contexts and the processes through which health is affected is virtually non-existent. The ojective of this review is to examine and consolidate the available literature on Inuit women's health issues from the last decade in order to identify priorities for future research.
   Study design. This study is a review of literature from the last decade. Inuit women's health issues that have been raised in the literature and in various reports are examined within a health-determinants framework.
   Methods. Government reports and statistics, publications by Inuit organizations and publications available on MEDLINE were examined for this review.
   Results. Inuit women's health is a crucial part of the health of their communities. Inuit women face serious health issues related to reproductive and sexual health, such as high rates of sexually transmitted infections and challenging circumstances surrounding childbirth. Wellness, suicide and stress are more significant issues for Inuit women compared with non-Inuit women. Food security and accessibility is an issue for all Northerners. Alcohol and substance abuse and exposure to violent situations endanger both the health and safety of Inuit women in many Northern communities.
   Conclusions. There exists an urgent need to better understand the mechanisms through which determinants of health affect Inuit women. As well as adding to the body of knowledge on health determinants in Canada, further examining these issues will provide valuable information for health policy decision-makers and program development in the North and facilitate the direction of resources to the necessary areas of health services provision in Nunavut.

AB Objective. To determine the prevalence of suicidal ideation among Metis men and women (20-59 years) and identify its associated risk and protective factors using data from the nationally representative Aboriginal Peoples Survey (2006).
   Study design. Secondary analysis of previously collected data from a nationally representative cross-sectional survey.
   Results. Across Canada, lifetime suicidal ideation was reported by an estimated 13.3% (or an estimated 34,517 individuals) of the total population of 20-to-59-year-old Metis. Of those who ideated, 46.2% reported a lifetime suicide attempt and 6.0% indicated that they had attempted suicide in the previous 12 months. Prevalence of suicidal ideation was higher among Metis men than in men who did not report Aboriginal identity in examined jurisdictions. Metis women were more likely to report suicidal ideation compared with Metis men (14.9% vs. 11.5%, respectively). Metis women and men had some common associated risk and protective factors such as major depressive episode, history of self-injury, perceived Aboriginal-specific community issues, divorced status, high mobility, self-rated thriving health, high self-esteem and positive coping ability. However, in Metis women alone, heavy frequent drinking, history of foster care experience and lower levels of social support were significant associated risk factors of suicidal ideation. Furthermore, a significant interaction was observed between social support and major depressive episode. Among Metis men, history of ever smoking was the sole unique associated risk factor.
   Conclusion. The higher prevalence of suicidal ideation among Metis women compared with Metis men and the observed gender differences in associations with some associated risk and protective factors suggest the need for gender-responsive programming to address suicidal ideation.

AB Objectives Patients with advanced disease sometimes express a wish to hasten death (WTHD). In 2012, we published a systematic review and meta-ethnography of qualitative studies examining the experience and meaning of this phenomenon. Since then, new studies eligible for inclusion have been reported, including in Europe, a region not previously featured, and specifically in countries with different legal frameworks for euthanasia and assisted suicide. The aim of the present study was to update our previous review by including new research and to conduct a new analysis of available data on this topic.
   Setting Eligible studies originated from Australia, Canada, China, Germany, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Thailand and USA.
   Participants Studies of patients with life-threatening conditions that had expressed the WTHD.
   Design The search strategy combined subject terms with free-text searching of PubMed MEDLINE, Web of Science, CINAHL and PsycInfo. The qualitative synthesis followed the methodology described by Noblit and Hare, using the 'adding to and revising the original' model for updating a meta-ethnography, proposed by France et al. Quality assessment was done using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist.
   Results 14 studies involving 255 participants with life-threatening illnesses were identified. Five themes emerged from the analysis: suffering (overarching theme), reasons for and meanings and functions of the WTHD and the experience of a timeline towards dying and death. In the context of advanced disease, the WTHD emerges as a reaction to physical, psychological, social and existential suffering, all of which impacts on the patient's sense of self, of dignity and meaning in life.
   Conclusions The WTHD can hold different meanings for each individual-serving functions other than to communicate a genuine wish to die. Understanding the reasons for, and meanings and functions of, the WTHD is crucial for drawing up and implementing care plans to meet the needs of individual patients.

AB Objectives
   Since 2006, the British Columbia HIV/AIDS Drug Treatment Program (DTP) has expanded enrolment and dramatically increased its number of participants. We examined the effect this expansion has had on the underlying cause of death in HIV-infected individuals.
   Methods
   We analysed data from participants aged 18 years and older in the DTP to measure 2-year mortality rates and causes of death from 2001 to 2012. We conducted tests of trend for all-cause and cause-specific mortality, and compared demographics and characteristics of individuals. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the risk of death.
   Results
   A total of 8185 participants received antiretroviral therapy (ART) during the study period. Mortality declined from 3.88 per 100 person-years (PY) in 2001-2002 to 2.15 per 100 PY in 2011-2012 (P = 0.02). There were significant decreases in HIV-related deaths (2.34 to 0.56 per 100 PY; P = 0.02) and deaths attributable to chronic liver disease (0.20 to 0.09 per 100 PY; P = 0.01), cardiovascular disease (0.24 to 0.05 per 100 PY; P = 0.03) and suicides (0.47 to 0 per 100 PY; P = 0.003). Multivariate models, adjusted for age, gender, history of injecting drug use, AIDS diagnoses and baseline CD4 cell counts, demonstrated that initiation of ART in all time periods after 2001-2002 was independently associated with reduced mortality (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions
   We observed declines in HIV-related mortality and certain non-HIV-related causes of death among participants in the BC DTP from 2001 to 2012. These findings suggest that there may be broader benefits to the increasingly liberal HIV treatment guidelines, including reductions in death caused by cardiovascular disease and chronic liver disease.

AB Objective: To explore the association between obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) and suicidal behavior.
   Method: Subjects referred for a psychiatric consultation were evaluated with structured interviews for mood and personality disorders (the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Axis Il Disorders), a history of suicidal behavior, and levels of coping. A total of 311 subjects were investigated using a 3-group design to test the association between OCPD and suicidal behavior, controlling for the presence of depression. Subjects with OCPD and a history of depression were compared to depressed subjects without any Axis 11 diagnosis and to subjects without depression or personality disorders. The study was conducted at Verdun Community Psychiatric Clinic, Douglas Hospital, McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and subjects were recruited from 2003 until 2005.
   Results: Subjects in the comorbid OCPD-depression group presented increased current and lifetime suicide ideation compared to the groups with depression alone or without depression or personality disorders (P = .004); they also had increased history of suicide attempts (P = .04), which were often multiple attempts (P = .01). They also scored lower on the Reasons for Living Inventory (RFL) and the Death Anxiety Questionnaire. Interestingly, comorbid OCPD-depression patients differed from patients with depression alone on the Moral Objections items of the RFL, on which individuals with OCPD-depression scored lowest. Limitations of this study were its cross-sectional design, retrospective sample, and limited generalizability to the population at large.
   Conclusions: Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is a factor increasing risk for nonfatal suicidal behavior independently of risk conferred by depressive disorders. J Clin Psychiatry 2009;70(11):1551-1556 (C) Copyright 2009 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB Background: Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a frequent phenomenon in adolescents and is closely related to eventual suicide. Although the effect of air pollution on various diseases has been extensively investigated, no studies examined its effect on NSSI in young students.
   Objectives: We investigated the effect of air pollution on NSSI in Chinese students.
   Methods: We investigated the incidence of NSSI in the past 12 months in 54 923 Chinese students with an anonymous questionnaire. We assessed the air pollution exposure of each student by the air quality matched with their schools, which were calculated by the inverse distance weighting method from the environmental monitoring data. We discussed the association between ambient air pollutants and the incidence of NSSI using generalized additive mixed models.
   Results: A 10 mu g/m(3) increase in the annual moving average concentration of particulate matter with diameters less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3) was associated with a 13.9 percent and a 10.5 percent increase in the odds ratio (OR) of NSSI, respectively. In addition, a 0.1 mg/m(3) increase in the annual moving average concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) was associated with a 4.8 percent increase in the OR of NSSI. NO2 and SO2 were not related to NSSI. CO and O-3 show non-linear effects on NSSI. Male students in high school are the most s to the effects of PM2.5 on NSSI.
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that increases in PM2.5, O-3 and CO may increase the incidence of NSSI among adolescent students. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   expression; right to privacy
AB This paper examines two recent Canadian legislative initiatives intended in whole or in part to combat cyberbullying: the Cyber-Safety Act of Nova Scotia and the Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act. Both pieces of legislation were responses to the suicide deaths of female teenagers Rehtaeh Parsons in Nova Scotia and Amanda Todd in British Columbia. It is questionable whether either suicide was directly caused by cyberbullying. Todd was primarily a victim of an adult "capper" living in the Netherlands, who persuaded her to expose her breasts via web cam, and then attempted to use the captured images to extort money and more images. Parsons was filmed engaging in what police concluded was consensual sex with several teenage boys at a house party. The cell phone video was posted on the Internet, making Parsons a victim of "sexting." In 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada fired a shot across the bow of Bill C-30, the immediate predecessor to the Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act, ruling that a police search (permissible under Bill C-30) in a child pornography case infringed upon constitutional protection against unreasonable search and seizure, and upon the right to privacy in cyberspace. In 2015, the Cyber-Safety Act of Nova Scotia was struck down by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia because it violated constitutional rights to freedom of expression and to life, liberty and security of person. In a criminal harassment case involving Twitter, the Ontario Court of Justice ruled in 2016 that Twitter is like a public square, where freedom of expression is protected, and where there is no reasonable expectation of privacy. These three court decisions can be expected to limit the extent to which Canadian legislators and law enforcement agencies can go in their efforts to pursue and prosecute cyberbullies and/or cyber criminals.

AB Objective To describe the prevalence of patients who screen positive for symptoms of bipolar disorder in primary care practice using the validated Mood Disorders Questionnaire (MDQ).
   Design Prevalence survey.
   Setting Fifty-four primary care practices across Canada.
   Participants Adult patients presenting to their primary care practitioners for any cause and reporting, during the course of their visits, current or previous symptoms of depression, anxiety, substance use disorders, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
   Main outcome measures Subjects were screened for symptoms suggestive of bipolar disorder using the MDQ. Health-related quality of life, functional impairment, and work productivity were evaluated using the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey and Sheehan Disability Scale.
   Results A total of 1416 patients were approached to participate in this study, and 1304 completed the survey. Of these, 27.9% screened positive for symptoms of bipolar disorder. All 13 items of the MDQ were significantly associated with screening positive for bipolar disorder (P < .05). Patients screening positive were significantly more likely to report depression, anxiety, substance use, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, family history of bipolar disorder, or suicide attempts than patients screening negative were (P < .001). Health-related quality of life, work or school productivity, and social and family functioning were all significantly worse in patients who screened positive (P < .001).
   Conclusion This prevalence survey suggests that more than a quarter of patients presenting to primary care with past or current psychiatric indices are at risk of bipolar disorder. Patients exhibiting a cluster of these symptoms should be further questioned on family history of bipolar disorder and suicide attempts, and selectively screened for symptoms suggestive of bipolar disorder using the quick and high-yielding MDQ.

"Individual level" variables were sex, age, ethnicity, household income, rurality, and small area socioeconomic deprivation. Logistic regression was used for the analyses. Sensitivity analyses for the level of regional aggregation were conducted.
   Participants: 1.4 million New Zealand census respondents aged 25-64 years followed up for mortality for three years.
   Main results: Controlling for age, ethnicity, rurality, household income, and regional mean income, there was no association of income inequality with all cause mortality for either men (OR= 1.007 for a 0.01 increase in the Gini, 95% confidence intervals 0.989 to 1.024) or women (OR= 1.004, 0.983 to 1.026). By cause of death (cancer, cardiovascular disease, unintentional injury, and suicide) there was some suggestion of a positive association for female unintentional injury (OR= 1.068, 0.952 to 1.198) and suicide (OR= 1.087, 0.957 to 1.234) but the 95% confidence intervals all included 1.0. Failure to control for ethnicity at the individual level resulted in some association of increasing regional income inequality with increasing mortality risk. Using fewer (n= 14) or more (n=73) regional divisions did not substantially change the findings.
   Conclusion: There is no convincing evidence of an association of income inequality within New Zealand with adult mortality. Previous ecological analyses within New Zealand suggesting an association of income inequality with mortality were confounded by ethnicity at the individual level. However, this study does not refute the possibility that income inequality at the national level affects health.

AB Objectives: First-responder mental health, especially in Canada, has been a topic of increasing interest given the high incidence of poor mental health, mental illness, and suicide among this cohort. Although research generally suggests that resiliency and stigma reduction programs can directly and indirectly affect mental health, little research has examined this type of training in first responders. The current paper examines the efficacy of the Road to Mental Readiness for First Responders program (R2MR), a resiliency and anti-stigma program. Methods: The program was tested using a pre-post design with a 3-month follow-up in 5 first-responder groups across 16 sites. Results: A meta-analytic approach was used to estimate the overall effects of the program on resiliency and stigma reduction. Our results indicate that R2MR was effective at increasing participants' perceptions of resiliency and decreasing stigmatizing attitudes at the pre-post review, which was mostly maintained at the 3-month follow-up. Conclusions: Both quantitative and qualitative data suggest that the program helped to shift workplace culture and increase support for others.

DE conscientious objection; abortion; euthanasia; physician-assisted

ID ETHICS
AB In a recent (2015) Bioethics editorial, Udo Schuklenk argues against allowing Canadian doctors to conscientiously object to any new euthanasia procedures approved by Parliament. In this he follows Julian Savulescu's 2006 BMJ paper which argued for the removal of the conscientious objection clause in the 1967 UK Abortion Act. Both authors advance powerful arguments based on the need for uniformity of service and on analogies with reprehensible kinds of personal exemption. In this article I want to defend the practice of conscientious objection in publicly-funded healthcare systems (such as those of Canada and the UK), at least in the area of abortion and end-of-life care, without entering either of the substantive moral debates about the permissibility of either. My main claim is that Schuklenk and Savulescu have misunderstood the special nature of medicine, and have misunderstood the motivations of the conscientious objectors. However, I acknowledge Schuklenk's point about differential access to lawful services in remote rural areas, and I argue that the health service should expend more to protect conscientious objection while ensuring universal access.

AB To date, only few reports are available regarding the long-term outcome of borderline personality disorder (BPD) in Japan. We conducted a retrospective follow-up study on the long-term outcome and predictive factors of BPD in Japan. Of 72 patients who received treatment at Fukuoka University Hospital between 1973 and 1989 and met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria for BPD retrospectively, 19 patients (26.4%) were followed up. We evaluated global outcome at follow-up using the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale scored from a completed self-reported questionnaire. The mean Global Assessment of Functioning score was 60.7, which meant fair to good functioning. The suicide rate was 6.9% (5/72). Using a logistic regression model, overinvolvement in family relationships and the number of medical facilities where patient was previously treated predicted poor outcome. These results are similar to those reported in the United States and Canada, except for the result that Japanese patients with BPD are more likely to live with their original family at follow-up than American patients.

AB The workplace provides an important setting to promote men's mental health, yet few studies have explored the gendered views of men and workplace representatives in male-dominated industries about workplace mental health promotion. Consultations with working men (N = 23) and interviews with seven representatives from male-dominated industries in northern British Columbia, Canada were conducted. Findings highlight the impact of masculine workplace cultures on men's mental health and practices that limit men's disclosures about vulnerabilities, as well as discussions about promoting mental health. Within such milieus a healthy mind was viewed as vital for workplace safety. Participant recommendations focused on reducing stigma, promoting enjoyable activities, and creating sustainable efforts toward building social cohesion. Overall, efforts to promote mental health in male-dominated industries should be tailored for the unique needs of men and should include paid time to engage in wellness activities and positive strategies that facilitate group comradery. Given male-dominated workplaces in particular constitute unique contexts where adherence to masculine ideals is normed, the findings hold potential for advancing mental health promotion programs designed to reach men.

AB The field of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is dominated by research conducted with Caucasian-majority samples in Western countries such as United States, Canada, Australia and European countries. This article critically reviewed the empirical research on NSSI in non-Western countries and among ethnic/racial minority individuals who live in the West to give voice to and understand the patterns of NSSI among individuals who do not fall within the dominant Caucasian majority. The study found both similarities and differences between Western and non-Western data in terms of characteristics and functions of NSSI. Differences in gender patterns in regards to prevalence of NSSI and methods used as well as presence of a more relational functionality of NSSI rather than emotion regulation functionality were two points of divergence in the findings of these studies. In addition, the findings seem to indicate that the role of ethnicity/race is mediated by important factors such as socioeconomic status (SES) and gender. Existing gaps in the literature and suggestions for further research are discussed.

AB The misdiagnosis of pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) has become a major public health concern. Would available evidence-based assessment (EBA) strategies help improve diagnostic accuracy and are clinicians willing to consider these strategies in practice? The purpose of the present study was to document the extent to which using an EBA decision tool-a probability nomogram-improves the interpretation of family history and test data by clinicians and to examine the acceptability of the nomogram technique to clinicians. Over 600 clinicians across the U.S. and Canada attending continuing education seminars were trained to use the nomogram. Participants estimated the probability that a youth in a clinical vignette had bipolar disorder, first using clinical judgment and then using the nomogram. Brief training of clinicians (less than 30 minutes) in using the nomogram for assessing PBD improved diagnostic accuracy, consistency, and agreement. The majority of clinicians endorsed using the nomogram in practice. EBA decision aids, such as the nomogram, may lead to a significant decrease in overdiagnosis and help clinicians detect true cases of PBD.

AB Purpose: To understand the magnitude and the national trends of mortality and hospitalization due to injuries among Canadian adolescents aged 15-19 years in 1979-2003.
   Methods: Data on injury deaths and hospitalizations were obtained from the national Vital Statistical System and the Hospital Morbidity Database. Injuries were classified by intent and by mechanism.
   Results: In 15-19-year-olds, 75.6% of all deaths and 16.6% of all hospitalizations were attributed to injuries. Unintentional and self-inflicted injuries accounted for 70.2% and 24.1 %, respectively, of total injury deaths as well as 72.6% and 17.4%, respectively, of total injury hospitalizations. The main causes for injury were motor vehicle traffic-related injury (MVT), suffocation, firearm, poisoning, and drowning for injury deaths; and MVT, poisoning, fall, struck by/against, and cut/pierce for injury hospitalizations. Mortality and hospitalization rates of total and unintentional injuries decreased substantially, whereas those of self-inflicted injuries decreased only slightly, with a small increase in females. Rates also decreased for all causes except suffocation, which showed an increasing trend. Males had higher rates for all intents and causes than females, except for self-inflicted injury hospitalization (higher in females). The territories and Prairie Provinces also had higher ones of total injuries and self-inflicted injuries than in other provinces.
   Conclusions: Injury is the leading cause of deaths and a major source of hospitalizations in Canadian adolescents. However, prevention programs in Canada have made significant progress in reducing injury mortality and hospitalization. The graduated driver licensing, enforcement of seat-belt use, speed limit and alcohol control, and Canadian tough gun control may have contributed to the decline.

AB ObjectiveThe objective was to characterize the relationship between geography, concurrent psychiatric services, all-cause mortality, and acute health care use for individuals enrolled in Opioid Agonist Treatment, in Ontario, Canada.MethodsWe conducted a propensity score matching study of patients enrolled in Opioid Agonist Treatment in Ontario for the first time between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2015. We first compared outcomes between patients who were actively engaged and patients who were not actively engaged in Opioid Agonist Treatment. We created treatment and a control groups on the basis of an individual's access to psychiatric care within an episode of Opioid Agonist Treatment. Relative risk and number needed to treat were calculated to determine the correlation between psychiatric care and health outcomes among patients enrolled in Opioid Agonist Treatment at two time points within an episode of care and for two geographic regions in Ontario (north and south).ResultsDuring the first year of Opioid Agonist Treatment, concurrent psychiatric care was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality in southern Ontario (RR 0.80, 95% CI, 0.73-0.87), a reduction in emergency department visits in both northern and southern Ontario (north: RR=0.76, 95% CI, 0.72-0.81; south: RR=0.87, 95% CI, 0.86-0.88), and a reduction in hospitalizations (north: RR=0.88, 95% CI. 0.82-0.94, south: RR=0.92, 95% CI, 0.91-0.93).ConclusionOur findings have significant clinical and political implications for health system planning highlighting the need for integrated mental health and addiction services for individuals with Opioid Use Disorder.

ID EUTHANASIA; SUICIDE; REQUEST; CANADA; DEATH
AB Objective To explore the experiences, wishes, fears, and beliefs of people who requested and were eligible for medical assistance in dying (MAID) in Canada in the first year after legalization.
   Design Qualitative study using semistructured interviews.
   Setting A clinic in Vancouver, BC, that provides MAID.
   Participants People requesting and eligible for MAID between February 6 and December 17, 2016. Family and friends who were identified as the patients' primary support people were also interviewed.
   Methods Semistructured interviews were conducted over the telephone, by e-mail, or in person. The interviews were audiorecorded and transcribed and then analyzed using thematic qualitative analysis. The investigators read the transcripts and created a coding scheme to identify themes in the patients' experiences. The identified themes were compiled and evaluated in the context of what is already known based on current literature. Basic demographic characteristics were recorded for context.
   Main findings Of the 23 patients whose experiences were explored, most had a malignancy, a neurologic disorder, or organ failure. A main theme was that patients thought it was important to have autonomy and control over their own end-of-life decisions. Main reasons for requesting MAID were a self-perceived unacceptable quality of life, most commonly owing to loss of independence, mobility, ability to communicate, a sense of purpose, and participation in meaningful activity. Some people expressed fear of future suffering and future disability. Pain was seldom mentioned as a cause of suffering. Some participants believed they could discuss their decision with the people in their lives while others chose to keep it a private matter. Most people were not religious.
   Conclusion The participants' reasons for choosing to pursue MAID were consistent with those of people in other jurisdictions that have been studied. They felt confident in their decision to pursue MAID and did not have fears about the process.

AB Study Design: An exploratory, qualitative methodology.
   Objectives: To explore perceptions of quality of life (QOL) among community-dwelling people with high spinal cord injuries (SCI) and the factors they identified as contributing to, enabling or constraining the quality of their lives.
   Setting: Urban communities on Vancouver Island and in the lower mainland of British Columbia, Canada.
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews with both men (n = 11) and women (n = 4) with complete high SCI (C1-C4). Interpretive analysis was grounded in the themes that arose from the interview transcripts.
   Results: Time since injury ranged from 4 to 28 years. The mean current age was 35 years, with a range from 21 to 50 years of age. High SCI disrupted not just a body but an entire biography of plans, daily activities and valued occupations. Initially feeling helpless and useless, the participants were unanimously glad to be alive at the time of the study and several described perceptions of very high QOL. The themes which emerged from the data were over-lapping and inter-dependent and described a process of refocusing values and re-establishing a view of the self as able and valuable following injury. The three primary themes addressed issues of autonomy, the meaningful use of time, and relationships.
   Conclusions: The study findings suggest that life with a high SCI can be rich and fulfilling if society is prepared to enable and support this; and that QOL outcomes might be maximized by adopting a biographical orientation to the rehabilitation process.
   Sponsorship: This research was funded by a University of British Columbia Graduate Fellowship, a studentship from the Rick Hansen Man in Motion Foundation and a doctoral fellowship from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.

AB Objectives: Physicians rarely engage severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) patients in end-of-life care discussion despite an increased risk of debilitating medical illnesses and mortality. Access to quality palliative care and medical assistance in dying (MAID) has become a priority in Canada and many jurisdictions. In this study, we compared SPMI and chronic medically ill (CMI) patients' end-of-life care preferences and comfort level with end-of-life care discussion, and identified potential predictors of interest in MAID. Design: Comparative cross-sectional study. Setting: Hospital-based. Participants: We recruited 106 SPMI and 95 CMI patients at the Jewish General Hospital, Canada. Patients aged >= 40 years, without severe cognitive impairment, able to communicate in English or French and provide written informed consent were included. Measurements: Attitudes towards pain management, palliative sedation, MAID, and artificial life support were collected with the Health Care Preferences Questionnaire. Adjusted odd ratios (aOR) were calculated for each end-of-life care intervention. Comfort with discussion was rated on a Likert scale. A stepwise regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of interest in MAID. Results: SPMI was not correlated to any end-of-life care intervention, except for MAID where SPMI patients were less likely to support its use (aOR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.25-0.94, p = 0.03). Religiosity was also correlated with interest in MAID (aOR: 0.14, 95% CI: 0.06-0.31, p < 0.001). Patients in both groups were comfortable talking about end-of-life care. Conclusions: SPMI patients are able to voice their end-of-life care preferences, and contrary to some fears, do not want MAID more than CMI patients.

AB Background: Euthanasia remains controversial in Canada and an issue of debate among physicians. Most studies have explored the opinion of health professionals regarding its legalization, but have not investigated their intentions when faced with performing euthanasia. These studies are also considered atheoretical. The purposes of the present study were to fill this gap in the literature by identifying the psychosocial determinants of physicians' intention to practice euthanasia in palliative care and verifying whether respecting the patient's autonomy is important for physicians.
   Methods: A validated anonymous questionnaire based on an extended version of the Theory of Planned Behavior was mailed to a random sample of 445 physicians from the province of Quebec, Canada.
   Results: The response rate was 38.3% and the mean score for intention was 3.94 +/- 2.17 (range: 1 to 7). The determinants of intention among physicians were: knowing patients' wishes (OR = 10.77; 95%CI: 1.33-86.88), perceived behavioral control-physicians' evaluation of their ability to adopt a given behavior-(OR = 4.35; 95% CI: 1.44-13.15), moral norm-the appropriateness of adopting a given behavior according to one's personal and moral values-(OR = 3.22; 95%CI: 1.29-8.00) and cognitive attitude-factual consequences of the adoption of a given behavior-(OR = 3.16; 95%CI: 1.20-8.35). This model correctly classified 98.8% of physicians. Specific beliefs that might discriminate physicians according to their level of intention were also identified. For instance, physicians' moral norm was related to the ethical principle of beneficence.
   Conclusions: Overall, physicians have weak intentions to practice euthanasia in palliative care. Nevertheless, respecting patients' final wishes concerning euthanasia seems to be of particular importance to them and greatly affects their motivation to perform euthanasia.

AB PurposeTo assess whether traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases the risks of subsequent problem gambling.MethodsWe conducted a matched case-control analysis of adults in Ontario, Canada. The study included those who self-reported their gambling activities in the Canadian Community Health Survey 2007-2008. Using Problem Gambling Severity Index, we defined cases as those who were problem gamblers and controls who were recreational gamblers. Cases were matched to controls 1:2 using propensity scores based on demographics, prior mental health, and self-reported behaviours. The main predictor was prior TBI defined as requiring emergency care and identified using ICD-10 codes from administrative health databases. We estimated the likelihood of prior TBI in problem gamblers compared to controls using conditional logistic regression.ResultsOf 30,652 survey participants, 16,002 (53%) reported gambling activity of whom 14,910 (49%) were recreational gamblers and 4% (n=1092) were problem gamblers. A total of 1469 respondents (5%) had a prior TBI. Propensity score matching yielded 2038 matched pairs with 1019 cases matched to 2037 controls. Case-control analysis showed a significant association between prior TBI and subsequent problem gambling (odds ratio 1.27, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.51, P=0.007). The increased risk was mostly apparent in men aged 35 to 64years who reported alcohol use or smoking. The relative risk of problem gambling in those with two or more TBIs equated to an odds ratio of 2.04 (95% confidence interval 1.05-3.99).ConclusionsWe found that a prior TBI was associated with an increased subsequent risk of problem gambling. Our findings support more awareness, screening, and treating problem gambling risks among TBI patients.

AB Objectives: One of the first stages in the development of new clinical decision rules (CDRs) is determination of need. This study examined the clinical priorities of emergency physicians (EPs) working in Australasia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States for the development of future CDRs.
   Methods: The authors administered an e-mail and postal survey to members of the national emergency medicine (EM) associations in Australasia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Results were analyzed via frequency distributions.
   Results: The total response rate was 54.8% (1,150/2,100). The respondents were primarily male (74%), with a mean age of 42.5 years (SD +/- 8), and a mean of 12 years of experience (SD +/- 7). The top 10 clinical priorities (% selected) were: 1) investigation of febrile child < 36 months (62%); 2) identification of central or serious vertigo (42%); 3) lumbar puncture or admission of febrile child < 3 months (41%); 4) imaging for suspected transient ischemic attack (39%); 5) admission for anterior chest pain (37%); 6) computed tomography (CT) angiography for pulmonary embolus (30%); 7) admission for suicide risk (29%); 8) ultrasound for pain or bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy (28%); 9) nonspecific weakness in elders (26%); and 10) CT for abdominal pain (25%). Between study countries, there was consistency in identification of clinical problems, but variation in prioritization.
   Conclusions: This international survey identified the sampled EPs' priorities for the future development of CDRs. The top priority overall was investigation of the febrile child < 36 months. These results will be valuable to researchers for future development of CDRs in EM that are relevant internationally.

AB Aim In many parts of the world, there is growing concern about youth homelessness. Homeless youth are particularly vulnerable to psychological distress, substance use and mental disorders, and premature mortality caused by suicide and drug overdose. However, their access to and use of mental health care is very limited. Methods The Reseau d'intervention de proximite aupres des jeunes (RIPAJ), a Montreal network of over 20 community stakeholders providing a wide array of cohesive services, was created to ease homeless youth's access to mental health and psychosocial services. Its philosophy is that there should be no "wrong door" or "wrong timing" for youth seeking help. In 2014, the network partnered with the pan-Canadian transformational research initiative, ACCESS Esprits ouverts. Results Created through this partnership, ACCESS Esprits ouverts RIPAJ has been promoting early identification through outreach activities targeting homeless youth and agencies that serve them. An ACCESS Clinician was hired to promote and rapidly respond to help-seeking and referrals. By strengthening connections within RIPAJ and using system navigation, the site is working to facilitate youth's access to timely appropriate care and eliminate age-based transitions between services. A notable feature of our program, that is not usually evident in homelessness services, has been the engagement of the youth in service planning and design and the encouragement of contact with families and/or friends. Conclusion Challenges remain including eliminating any remaining age-related transitions of care between adolescent and adult services; and the sustainability of services transformation and network coordination. Nonetheless, this program serves as an example of an innovative, much-needed, community-oriented model for improving access to mental health care for homeless youth.

AB Sexual victimization and depression are common on university campuses, especially among females. Both are associated with negative health outcomes and efforts are made to minimize these as much as possible on university campuses. The current study examines the prevalence of, and independent association between, non-consensual sex and current risk of depression after controlling for related factors. The primary study question is as follows: Are female undergraduate students who have been sexually victimized while attending university at an increased risk of depression compared with those who have not been victimized? Cross-sectional data collected online from female students below the age of 30 at eight universities in Maritime Canada were analyzed. Non-consensual sex while at university was measured using one dichotomous item and current risk of depression was measured using the validated Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale. All analyses were weighted and data were imputed using the sequential regression multiple imputation (SRMI) method. Analyses involved basic descriptive statistics, a series of unadjusted logistic regressions, and an adjusted multiple logistic regression. A total of 36.7% of female undergraduate students were found to be at risk of depression and 6.8% have been victim of non-consensual sex while attending university. After adjusting for covariates, females who were victimized were 2.11 times more likely to be at risk of depression than females who were not victimized (p < .0001). This study points to the possible unmet need for more mental health support for victims of sexual victimization and more efforts to prevent sexual violence on Canadian campuses. These findings can help to inform university mental health services such as mental health support for victims of sexual assault and can also be used to inform prevention and health promotion activities.

AB We examined the well-being of mothers and non-mothers reporting exclusive opposite-gender sexual partners (OG), same-gender sexual partners (SG), or both (BI) in a representative sample of 20,773 participants (11,034 women) 15-years-old or older from the population of Quebec province in Canada. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire and SG and BI women (n = 179) were matched to a sample of OG women (n = 179) based on age, income, geographical area, and children (having at least one 18-year-old or younger biological or adopted child at home). We assessed social milieu variables, risk factors for health disorders, mental health, and quality of mothers' relationship with children. The findings indicated a sexual orientation main effect: Mothers and non-mothers in the SG and BI group, as compared to their OG controls, were significantly less likely to live in a couple relationship, had significantly lower levels of social support, higher prevalence of early negative life events, substance abuse, suicide ideation, and higher levels of psychological distress. There were no Sexual Orientation X Parenthood status effects. The results further indicated that sexual orientation did not account for unique variance in women's psychological distress beyond that afforded by their social milieu, health risk factors, and parenthood status. No significant differences were found for the quality of mothers' relationship with children. SG-BI and OG mothers with low levels of social integration were significantly more likely to report problems with children than parents with high levels of social integration. We need to understand how marginal sexualities and their associated social stigma, as risk indicators for mothers, interact with other factors to impact family life, parenting skills, and children's adjustment.

AB Depression, sadness, low self-esteem, and self-harm affect a substantial number of young people in North America. However, the prevalence of these symptoms has been found to be consistently higher for sexual minority (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual) populations. In this study, we traced the trends and disparities in mental health, including self-harm, forgone mental health care, good feelings, feelings of sadness, and feeling good about oneself, with provincially representative data from Canada (N = 99,373; M age = 15). We reported whether the disparities have narrowed, widened, or remained the same for sexual orientation subgroups over time. We found that though sexual minorities report higher rates of all negative mental health indicators, the disparity in self-harm for gay adolescent males compared to their heterosexual counterparts has narrowed over time. However, some disparities have widened: the gap in feeling sad has widened for sexual minorities compared to their heterosexual counterparts. These findings have implications for the efficacy of interventions and the next steps in working to ameliorate mental health issues for vulnerable sexual minority adolescents in North America.

AB The Relation Between Research and Clinical Practice - A Survey ofDeutsche Gesellschaft fur Gruppenanalyse mid Gruppenpsychotherapie (D3G) Members Perceptions of Psychotherapy Research Bridging the science and practice of group psychotherapy is a constant challenge. In order to achieve a meaningful synthesis of science and practice, scientists must attend to the issues that practitioners identify as important and useful. In 2010, Ogrodnizcuk et al. published a survey of Canadian Group Psychotherapy Association members' perceptions of psychotherapy research. The objective of the survey was to identify research topics and issues that were important to group psychotherapists. The purpose of the present study was to extend this survey to a different country - Germany. The German service delivery model for group psychotherapy is vastly different from the North American model. Most group psychotherapies in Germany are provided in a very well established and funded inpatient health care system, while the majority of group psychotherapies in the US and Canada are offered in outpatient settings, which often are not paid by health insurance (especially in the US). Such differences may have implications for the type of research that therapists regard as important and useful.

AB Objective: To monitor Canadian HIV/AIDS mortality following the introduction of antiretroviral therapies in 1996, and to compare this with the US experience.
   Methods: Deaths were extracted by underlying cause of death, age, sex, marital status and place of residence at time of death. Age-specific leading causes of death, potential years of life lost before age 65, and rates are presented.
   Results: HIV deaths peaked in 1995 at 1,764, representing 1% of all deaths, 15% of male deaths aged 25-44, and the second leading cause of death for males age 25-44, trailing suicides. From 1995 to 1997, HIV deaths dropped by 66% for males and 43% for females. Rates for Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal were 6 times higher than in rural areas, and 2.5 times higher than in other Census Metropolitan Areas.
   Conclusions: As of 1998, HIV still was a leading cause of premature mortality. The trend in Canadian HIV mortality was similar to that in the US, though US rates remain double the Canadian rates. The drop in HIV deaths may not be sustained in the long term, as antiretroviral therapy is not a cure and the number of people living with HIV is increasing.

AB The assessment of self-harm risk is a common, difficult, and perplexing task for many physicians, especially those working in emergency departments (ED). Attempts have been made to determine objective methods for assessing patients with suicidal ideation or self-harm though there is still a lack of knowledge about objective assessments of these patients. A study was conducted where 181 suicidal patients were enrolled in two EDs within the city of Edmonton, Canada. Initial interviews were conducted in the ED which collected basic demographics and medical history as well as psychometric measures including the Beck Hopelessness Scale, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, Brief Symptom Inventory, Drug Abuse Screening Test 10, and CAGE questionnaire. The results of these measures were compared between those who presented to the ED with self-harm and those who presented only with ideation. Those with recent self-harm scored lower on many of the scales and subscales of distress and impulsivity measured compared to those with no recent self-harm. Possible explanations for this difference include differences in psychological traits between the two groups and possible cathartic effects of self-harm. The lower scores obtained by those that present with self-harm may complicate attempts to use psychometric tools to determine future self-harm risk.

ID SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; CANADA; CONTEXT; GAPS
AB Background: Canadian cities are becoming more segregated by income. As such, investigation is required into the magnitude of health disparity between low-, average- and high-income neighbourhoods in order to quantify the level of health disparity at the scale of an urban city.
   Methods: A cross-sectional ecological study design was used to review all hospital discharges, physician visits, medication utilization, public health information and vital statistics for an entire city by neighbourhood income status. Postal code information was used to identify six existing contiguous residential neighbourhoods in the city of Saskatoon that were defined as low-income cut-off neighbourhoods (N=18,228). There were two comparison groups: all other Saskatoon residents (N=184,284) and the five most affluent neighbourhoods in Saskatoon (N=16,683).
   Findings: Statistically significant differences in health care utilization by neighbourhood income status were observed for suicide attempts, mental disorders, injuries and poisonings, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis C, teen birth, low birthweight, infant mortality and all-cause mortality. The rate ratios increased in size when comparing low-income neighbourhoods to high-income neighbourhoods. No clear trend was observed for stroke or cancer.
   Interpretation: The findings suggest that low-income neighbourhoods are associated with increased health care utilization in Saskatoon.

AB There have been several attempts made to reduce the occurrence of violence in hospital settings, with most professional organizations taking a stance. The impact of violent incidence on the therapeutic environment and the cost in human terms led to the declaration by the World Health Organization that violence is a public health problem. There are strategies for reducing violence that flow out of known trends. We sought to examine the trends in institutional violence in a contextual sense. We reviewed the records of all incidents of violence, categorized by severity, victims and trends over five years in a multilevel secure forensic hospital in Canada. The rate of violence perpetrated by female patients was significantly higher than for male patients. Higher occurrence of violence was recorded in the winter months compared with any other season and was related to unstructured activities. There is a window of opportunity to develop some engaging programmes during the long winter months and improve supervision at all times of unstructured activity. The reasons for increased women perpetration and the winter peak of violence require further investigation. Med Sci Law 2013; 53: 72-79. DOI: 10.1258/msl.2012.012016

AB Introduction: This study describes rates of self-inflicted and assault-related injury hospitalizations in areas with a relatively high percentage of residents identifying as First Nations, Metis and Inuit, by injury cause, age group and sex.
   Methods: All separation records from acute in-patient hospitals for Canadian provinces and territories excluding Quebec were obtained from the Discharge Abstract Database. Dissemination areas with more than 33% of residents reporting an Aboriginal identity in the 2006 Census were categorized as high-percentage Aboriginal-identity areas.
   Results: Overall, in high-percentage Aboriginal-identity areas, age-standardized hospitalization rates (ASHRs) for self-inflicted injuries were higher among females, while ASHRs for assault-related injuries were higher among males. Residents of high-percentage Aboriginal-identity areas were at least three times more likely to be hospitalized due to a self-inflicted injury and at least five times more likely to be hospitalized due to an assault-related injury compared with those living in low-percentage Aboriginal-identity areas.
   Conclusion: Future research should examine co-morbidities, socio-economic conditions and individual risk behaviours as factors associated with intentional injury hospitalizations.

AB Mood disorders are more prevalent in individuals with chronic physical illness compared to individuals with no such illness. These disorders amplify the disability associated with the physical condition and adversely affect its course, thus contributing to occupational impairment, disruption in interpersonal and family relationships, poor health and suicide. This study used data collected in the Canadian Community Health Survey, cycle 3.1 ( 2005) to examine factors associated with comorbid mood disorders and to assess their association with the quality of life of individuals living in Ontario. Results indicate that individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, bowel disorder or stomach or intestinal ulcers had the highest rates of mood disorders. The odds of having a comorbid mood disorder were higher among women, the single, those living in poverty, the Canadian born and those between 30 and 69 years of age. The presence of comorbid mood disorders was significantly associated with short-term disability, requiring help with instrumental daily activities and suicidal ideation. Health care providers are urged to proactively screen chronically ill patients for mood disorders, particularly among the subgroups found to have elevated risk for these disorders.

TI Drawing the line on physician-assisted death
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS

ID MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; MEDICAL ASSISTANCE; PATERNALISM; DRINKING;
   SUICIDE; ILLNESS
AB Drawing the line on physician assistance in physician-assisted death (PAD) continues to be a contentious issue in many legal jurisdictions across the USA, Canada and Europe. PAD is a medical practice that occurs when physicians either prescribe or administer lethal medication to their patients. As more legal jurisdictions establish PAD for at least some class of patients, the question of the proper scope of this practice has become pressing. This paper presents an argument for restricting PAD to the terminally ill that can be accepted by defenders as well as critics of PAD for the terminally ill. The argument appeals to fairness- based paternalism and the social meaning of medical practice. These two considerations interact in various ways, as the paper explains. The right way to think about the social meaning of medical practice bears on fair paternalism as it relates to PAD and vice versa. The paper contends that these considerations have substantial force when directed against proposals to extend PAD to non- terminally ill patients, but considerably less force when directed against PAD for the terminally ill. The paper pays special attention to the case of non- terminally ill patients who suffer from treatment- resistant depression, as these patients present a potentially strong case for extending PAD beyond the terminally ill.

AB Objective: Consultation-liaison (C-L) psychiatrists are involved in physician-assisted death (PAD) teams in many permitting jurisdictions. This paper will describe our Canadian PAD experience over 2 years, highlighting the role of C-L psychiatrists, at a large hospital network that provides medical assistance in dying (MAID, as this is called in Canada).
   Methods: We will describe the Canadian criteria for MAID, our multispecialty MAID team experience and the roles, issues and concerns experienced by C-L psychiatrists. Some brief patient examples will be provided.
   Results: Our MAID team has managed 186 MAID inquiries, assessed 95 MAID requests and provided 49 MAID interventions over a 24 month period. The 2 co-leaders of the MAID team, 8 assessors and 1 intervention physician are C-L psychiatrists. Each of the MAID criteria: grievous medical condition, advanced state of irreversible decline, intolerable suffering, natural death reasonably foreseeable, voluntary request, capacity and informed consent pose specific challenges to be resolved in the assessment. Several unique MAID issues, including the role of education and mandatory psychiatric assessment and protocols will also be discussed.
   Conclusions: Our experience shows that C-L psychiatrists are well-situated to provide vital expertise and leadership to multispecialty PAD teams.

TI The Dilemma of Positive Rights: Access to Health Care and the
   <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>
SO JOURNAL OF CANADIAN STUDIES-REVUE D ETUDES CANADIENNES
LA English
DT Article
ID EQUALITY
AB An important debate implicating rights and Canadian social policy concerns whether the Charter of Rights and Freedoms should largely be limited to protecting negative rights, which prevent interference from government, or whether it should include positive rights, which require governments to provide entitlements to social services like health care, housing, or some minimum standard of welfare. After examining the Supreme Court of Canada's approach to social rights under the Charter, this essay critically assesses the arguments in favour of expanding constitutional protection for positive rights. Although the essay finds that much of the judicial caution regarding positive rights is appropriate, the court's reasoning in several controversial health policy cases is insufficiently attentive to the positive rights implications of its ostensibly negative rights approach. This essay thus sheds new light on the debate by demonstrating how cases on abortion, supervised drug injection facilities, and assisted suicide present a difficult dilemma from both a policy and rights perspective: courts may rightly avoid creating new social and economic rights, but the rationale they advance in applying negative rights in these cases provides an equally compelling basis for a positive right to access. It is a conundrum that both courts and the elected branches of government need to do more to address.

AB Dignity therapy is a novel therapeutic approach designed to decrease suffering, enhance quality of life and bolster a sense of dignity for patients approaching death. The benefits of dignity therapy were previously documented in a sample of 100 terminally ill patients. One of the products of dignity therapy is a transcript of the edited therapy session(s). In this qualitative study, 50 of the 100 (17 from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, and 33 from Perth, Australia) dignity therapy transcripts were randomly drawn, and independently coded and analysed by three investigators using a grounded theory approach. The transcripts revealed that dignity therapy serves to provide a safe, therapeutic environment for patients to review the most meaningful aspects of their lives in such a manner that their core values become apparent. The most common values expressed by the patients included 'Family', 'Pleasure', 'Caring', 'A Sense of Accomplishment', 'True Friendship', and 'Rich Experience'. Exemplars of each of these values illustrate the pervasive, defining role of values in our lives. The findings are discussed in terms of values theory, the role of dignity therapy, and consideration of values clarification in clinicians' efforts to enhance the dignity of terminally ill patients.

AB Background: Community-based studies can describe health status and related variables in people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) while avoiding biases introduced by help-seeking in specific clinical settings. Objective: To describe general health status, stress perceptions and life satisfaction in people with MS, in comparison to those with other types of disabilities. Materials & Methods: The Participation and Activity Limitation Survey (PALS) was a post-censual survey conducted by Statistics Canada in association with the 2006 Canadian Census. PALS collected data from a random sample of n = 22,513 respondents identified as having health-related impairments. Frequencies and quartiles as well as mean values, along with associated 95% confidence intervals, were calculated in the analysis. Results: PALS identified 245 individuals with MS. Health status, both perceived and when weighted for societal preference, was markedly lower than that of other disabled groups. No differences in self-perceived stress were seen. People with MS reported lower levels of satisfaction with their health but slightly higher levels of satisfaction with their family and friends. Conclusions: People with MS report lower levels of general health status and more impairment than those with other disabling conditions. Higher levels of satisfaction with friends and family may reflect psychological adaptation to the illness.

AB The problem of self-injuring behaviour among adolescents is still not publicly discussed in our country, and as it is the case with some other mental disorders, this occurrence is stigmatised and remains hidden from the public. This paper presents a theoretical review of the phenomenon of self-injuring behaviour, the prevalence of the problem abroad, primarily in the USA, Great Britain and Canada, and the research conducted in our country, in the Psychiatric hospital for the children and young persons in Zagreb, Kukuljeviceva 11. This research included 26 adolescents, and its purpose was to determine who frequently were the analysed risk factors present among those adolescents. The analysed risk factors are: who the child lives with, the marital status of the parents, employment status of the parents, relations between the family members, violence and addiction in the family, abuse of the child, an earlier attempt/intention to commit suicide and suicidal thoughts of the child, aggressiveness of the child, behavioural disorders (the child's perpetration of criminal and summary offences) and the presence of mental disorders of the child (diagnosis). The results show that social and psychiatric characteristics of the adolescents influence the occurrence of self-injury.

AB IMPORTANCE Self-harm behaviors, including suicidal ideation and past suicide attempts, are frequent in bariatric surgery candidates. It is unclear, however, whether these behaviors are mitigated or aggravated by surgery.
   OBJECTIVE To compare the risk of self-harm behaviors before and after bariatric surgery.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this population-based, self-matched, longitudinal cohort analysis, we studied 8815 adults from Ontario, Canada, who underwent bariatric surgery between April 1, 2006, and March 31, 2011. Follow-up for each patient was 3 years prior to surgery and 3 years after surgery.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-harm emergencies 3 years before and after surgery.
   RESULTS The cohort included 8815 patients of whom 7176 (81.4%) were women, 7063 (80.1%) were 35 years or older, and 8681 (98.5%) were treated with gastric bypass. A total of 111 patients had 158 self-harm emergencies during follow-up. Overall, self-harm emergencies significantly increased after surgery (3.63 per 1000 patient-years) compared with before surgery (2.33 per 1000 patient-years), equaling a rate ratio (RR) of 1.54 (95% CI, 1.03-2.30; P = .007). Self-harm emergencies after surgery were higher than before surgery among patients older than 35 years (RR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.05-2.94; P = .03), those with a low-income status (RR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.20-3.65; P = .01), and those living in rural areas (RR, 6.49; 95% CI, 1.42-29.63; P = .02). The most common self-harm mechanism was an intentional overdose (115 [72.8%]). A total of 147 events (93.0%) occurred in patients diagnosed as having a mental health disorder during the 5 years before the surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, the risk of self-harm emergencies increased after bariatric surgery, underscoring the need for screening for suicide risk during follow-up.

AB Suicide is a critical public health concern globally. Sex workers experience a disproportionate burden of social and health inequities driven by forms of violence, stigma, and criminalization, yet empirical research on suicidality is limited. This study longitudinally investigated the burden and socio-structural correlates of recent suicidality among women sex workers in Vancouver, Canada. Data (2010-2017) were drawn from a community-based, prospective cohort of cis and trans women sex workers across Metro Vancouver. Women completed biannual interviewer-administered questionnaires, and correlates of suicidality in the last 6 months were analyzed using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression with generalized estimating equations (GEE). Of 867 women at baseline, 48% (n = 413) reported lifetime suicidality, 16% (n = 141) reported suicidality in the last 6 months, and 29% reported suicidality at some point during the study. In multivariable analysis, factors independently associated with suicidality included physical/sexual childhood abuse (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.99; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.75, 5.10]), mental health issues (depression/anxiety/posttraumatic stress disorder; AOR = 2.19; 95% CI = [1.63, 2.95]), intimate partner violence (AOR: 2.11; 95% CI = [1.60, 2.80]), physical/sexual client violence (AOR: 1.82; 95% CI = [1.33, 2.50]), and homelessness (AOR: 1.44; 95% CI = [1.10, 1.89]). Older age (AOR: 0.97; 95% CI = [0.95, 0.99]) and higher social cohesion (AOR: 0.88; 95% CI = [0.78, 0.99]) were significantly associated with reduced odds of suicidality. Findings reveal key socio-structural correlates of suicidality among sex workers including experiences of historical and interpersonal violence, trauma/mental health issues, and homelessness. Strengthening social cohesion may have a protective effect on suicidality. Trauma-informed community-led structural interventions tailored to sex workers are urgently needed alongside a legal framework that enables collectivization and connectedness.

AB The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of, and factors associated with, sexual violence in childhood, adolescence and adulthood, among injection drug using men and women. The Vancouver Injection Drug User Study is a prospective cohort of injection drug users (IDU) begun in 1996. The analysis included all individuals who completed the baseline questionnaire who responded to a question about sexual assault. Multivariate modeling was used to determine and to what extent a history of sexual violence at different ages is predictive of HIV risk and other health risk behaviors. HIV prevalence was calculated as the total current number of HIV-positive individuals in the cohort. Of the 1437 eligible individuals, 36% reported a lifetime history of sexual violence; 68% of women, and 19% of men (p < 0.001). After adjusting for fixed sociodemographics, these individuals were more likely to have ever been in the sex trade, to knowingly share needles/rigs with HIV-positive people, to have attempted suicide, to have ever accidentally overdosed, to binge on alcohol, and to have been diagnosed with a mental disorder/disability. The prevalence of child sexual abuse in this cohort is 21%; 33% for women, and 13% for men. The data show a dose-response relationship between age at first sexual violence and most risk behaviors examined. These relationships are further mediated by gender. The prevalence of HIV among individuals who ever experienced sexual violence was 25%, compared to 19% among those who never experienced sexual violence (p = 0.006). Sexual violence, and especially child sexual abuse, is highly prevalent among this cohort, particularly among women. Child sexual abuse has worse consequences for both genders than sexual violence later in life. Nevertheless, women and men are affected differently by sexual violence at different ages, and this has significant implications for health promotion programs, and specifically HIV prevention.

AB Background: In February, 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the ban on medical assistance in dying (MAiD). In June, 2016, the federal government passed Bill C-14, permitting MAiD. Current medical students will be the first physician cohort to enter a system permissive of MAiD, and may help to ensure equitable access to care. This study assessed medical student views on MAiD, factors influencing these views, and opportunities for medical education.
   Methods: An exploratory cross-sectional survey was developed and distributed to medical students across all years of a three-year Canadian undergraduate medical program. The investigators administered the survey to participants during academic sessions from November to December, 2015. Analysis of the results included summary descriptive statistics, Pearson's chi-square test of independence to identify differences between participants by year of study, logistic regression to identify factors that influence students' stances on MAiD, and Wilcoxon signed rank test to measure changes in student support for MAiD and comfort discussing MAiD.
   Results: There were 405 participants for a response rate of 87%. The majority of students (88%) supported the Supreme Court's decision, 61% would provide the means for a patient to end their life, and 38% would personally administer a lethal medication. Students who were more willing to provide the means for MAiD found medical education/clinical experience and patient autonomy to be important contributors to their stances on MAiD. Those students who were less willing to provide the means for MAiD found religious/spiritual beliefs and teachings, as well as concern about potential negative consequences, to be important contributors to their stances on MAiD. Educational training desired by participants included medicolegal (91%), communication skills (80%), technical skills (75%), and religious (49%).
   Conclusions: Medical students generally supported and would provide the means for MAiD to patients. They also indicated a desire for directed medical education on MAiD.

AB Purpose: The aim of this study was to examine the association between gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and depression incidence in mothers and fathers during prenatal and postnatal periods.
   Patients and methods: Matched pairs (GDM vs no GDM) of randomly selected mothers with singleton live births (matched by age group, delivery year, and health region) and their partners (Quebec, Canada; cohort inception 1990-2007) were assessed for a composite outcome of depression/self-harm/suicide using a health administrative database. We examined the association of GDM and the composite outcome in the following three nonoverlapping periods: 1) 24 weeks gestation up to delivery; 2) delivery up to 1 year postpartum; and 3) 1 year postpartum to study end (March 31, 2012). We used stratified Cox proportional regression hazards models, with three models in mothers and three models in fathers, corresponding to each of the time periods of interest.
   Results: In the 58,400 mothers, women with GDM had a nearly twofold greater risk (adjusted HR: 1.82, 95% CI 1.28, 2.59) of being diagnosed with depression compared to those without GDM during the prenatal period. In the first year postpartum, there was no conclusive difference observed between the two groups of mothers (adjusted HR: 1.05, 95% CI 0.84, 1.30). Beyond the first year postpartum, there was an 8% increased risk (adjusted HR: 1.08, 95% CI 1.03, 1.14) of depression in women with a history GDM compared to those without. A total of 63,384 fathers were included in our analyses, and no association between GDM in one's partner and depression was found during any of the three time periods evaluated.
   Conclusion: GDM is associated with an increased risk of depression in women particularly during pregnancy highlighting the need to screen for depression and provide supportive interventions during this period.

AB In the USA, the use of advance directives (ADs) has been studied extensively, in order to identify opportunities to increase their use. We investigated the prevalence of ADs and the factors associated with formulation of an AD in The Netherlands, using samples of three groups: the general population up to 60 years of age, the general population over 60 years of age, and the relatives of patients who died after euthanasia or assisted suicide. The associated factors were grouped into three components: predisposing factors (e.g. age, gender), enabling factors (e.g. education) and need factors (e.g. health-related factors). We found that living wills had been formulated by 3% of younger people, 10% of older people, and 23% of the relatives of a person who died after euthanasia or assisted suicide. Most living wills concerned a request for euthanasia. In all groups, 26-29% had authorized someone to make decisions if they were no longer able to do so themselves. Talking to a physician about medical end-of-life treatment occurred less frequently, only 2% of the younger people and 7% of the older people had done so. Most people were quite confident that the physician would respect their end-of-life wishes, but older people more so than younger people. In a multivariate analysis, many predisposing factors were associated with the formulation of an AD: women, older people, non-religious people, especially those who lived in an urbanized area, and people with less confidence that the physician would respect their end-of-life wishes were more likely to have formulated an AD. Furthermore, the enabling factor of a higher level of education, the need factor of contact with a medical specialist in the past 6 months, and the death of a marital partner were associated with the formulation of an AD.

Of particular difficulty is determination of whether the request is voluntary and well considered. Results: Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) are both legal in The Netherlands, Luxemburg, Colombia, and Canada. Euthanasia is legal in Belgium, while PAS is legal in Switzerland and Oregon, Washington, Montana, Vermont, and California (USA). Upon a PAD request, evaluation of the capacity to consent medical treatment is relevant for the decision-making process, while evaluation of testamentary capacity is appropriate before an advance euthanasia directive is written. Anosognosia assessment throughout the Alzheimer's disease continuum provides essential and relevant information regarding the voluntary and well-considered nature of the PAD request; meanwhile, early assessment of hypernosognosia or subjective cognitive decline assists in formulation of a clinical prognosis. Furthermore, the assessment of physical and psychological suffering should incorporate verbal and nonverbal cues as well as consideration of the psychosocial factors that might affect due care criteria. Conclusion: The clinical approach to a PAD request should consider the legal framework and the decision-making capacity, assess memory deficit awareness and the perception of suffering, and evaluate mental competency when considered pertinent.

AB The range of end-of-life options is expanding across North America. Specifically, medical aid in dying (AID), or the process by which a patient with a terminal illness may request medical assistance with hastening death, has recently become legal in eight jurisdictions in the United States and all of Canada. Debates about AID often rely on cultural constructions that define some deaths as 'good' and others as 'bad'. While research has found commonalities in how patients, family members and health care providers define good and bad deaths, these constructions likely vary across social groups. Because of this, the extent to which AID is seen as a route to the good death also likely varies across social groups. In this article, we analyse qualitative data from six focus groups (n = 39) across three racial and ethnic groups: African American, Latino and white Californians, just after a medical AID law was passed. We find that definitions of the 'good death' are nuanced within and between groups, suggesting that different groups evaluate medical AID in part through complex ideas about dying. These findings further conversations about racial and ethnic differences in choices about end-of-life options.

AB We tested a model in which psychosocial and disease-related variables act as multiple protective and risk factors for psychological distress in patients with metastatic cancer. We hypothesized that depression and hopelessness constitute common pathways of distress, which mediate the effects of psychosocial and disease-related factors on the desire for hastened death. This model was tested on a cross-sectional sample of 406 patients with metastatic gastrointestinal or lung cancer recruited at outpatient clinics of a Toronto cancer hospital, using structural equation modeling. The results supported the model. High disease burden, insecure attachment, low self-esteem, and younger age were risk factors for depression. Low spiritual well-being was a risk factor for hopelessness. Depression and hopelessness were found to be mutually reinforcing, but distinct constructs. Both depression and hopelessness independently predicted the desire for hastened death, and mediated the effects of psychosocial and disease-related variables on this outcome. The identified risk factors support a holistic approach to palliative care in patients with metastatic cancer, which attends to physical, psychological, and spiritual factors to prevent and treat distress in patients with advanced disease.

ID URBAN DIFFERENCES
AB Context: For those residing in rural and isolated parts of Canada, obtaining quality mental health services is often an unfulfilled wish. Rural and isolated communities share the problems of health status and access to care. Health deteriorates the greater the distance from urban areas in the following dimensions: lower life expectancy than the national average; higher rates of disability, violence, poisoning, suicide and accidental death; and more mental and physical health issues than those who live in urban areas. The Canadian Collaborative Mental Health Initiative (CCMHI) was formed to provide, in part, a practical means to encouraging collaborations between primary care and mental health providers.
   Issue: This article provides a synopsis of the Rural and Isolated (R&I) toolkit developed through the CCMHI, which was intended to develop primary care and mental health collaboration in such areas. This toolkit was developed using focus group discussions with mental health providers, and surveys completed by providers and consumers.
   Lessons learned: Key messages from the consultative process included: access to services; interprofessional education; consumer involvement; research and evaluation; models of collaboration; ethics; funding; and policy and legislation. A flow diagram was devised to detail the synthesis and practical application of the toolkit, as well as the challenges, key questions and principles of implementation associated with collaborative care initiatives in rural and isolated regions.

AB In this study, a series of focus groups were conducted to gain an understanding of the nature of stress among Canadian Aboriginal women and men living with diabetes. Specifically, attention was given to the meanings Aboriginal peoples with diabetes attach to their lived experiences of stress, and the major sources or causes of stress in their lives. The key common themes identified are concerned not only with health-related issues (i.e. physical stress of managing diabetes, psychological stress of managing diabetes, fears about the future, suffering the complications of diabetes, and financial aspects of living with diabetes), but also with marginal economic conditions (e.g. poverty, unemployment); trauma and violence (e.g. abuse, murder, suicide, missing children, bereavement); and cultural, historical, and political aspects linked to the identity of being Aboriginal (e.g. 'deep-rooted racism" identity problems). These themes are, in fact, acknowledged not as mutually exclusive, but as intertwined. Furthermore, the findings suggest that it is important to give attention to diversity in the Aboriginal population. Specifically, Metis-specific stressors, as well as female-specific stressors, were identified. An understanding of stress experienced by Aboriginal women and men with diabetes has important implications for policy and programme planning to help eliminate or reduce at-risk stress factors, prevent stress-related illnesses, and enhance their health and life quality.

AB Purpose: Given limited resources, it is essential to determine which Mechanisms of Injury (MOIs) to prioritize for injury prevention policy and research. We developed objective, evidence-based Injury Prevention Priority Scores (IPPSs) for Canadian children across three prevention perspectives: mortality, injury severity, and resource utilization.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all injuries in Canada in individuals aged 0 to 19 years old from 2009 to 2014. For each MOI, an IPPS was calculated as a balanced measure of frequency and either mortality rate, median ICD-10 derived Injury Severity Score (ICISS), or median cost per hospitalization.
   Results: Of 87,017 injuries, 83,112 were nonfatal hospitalizations, and 3905 were deaths. Overall mortality rate was 0.04 deaths/injury, median ICISS was 0.994 (IQR 0.75-0.996), and median cost per hospitalization was CAD$3262 (IQR $2118-$5001). The top three mechanisms were falls (IPPS 72), intentional self-harm (IPPS 68), and drowning (IPPS 65) for mortality, falls (IPPS73), drowning (IPPS 61), and suffocation (IPPS 61) for injury severity and falls (IPPS 70), fires (IPPS 65), and intentional self-harm (IPPS 60) for resource utilization.
   Conclusion: Falls, if prevented, would provide the most benefit to the largest proportion of the Canadian pediatric population and should be targeted for injury prevention. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVE: Despite agreement that preadult onset of depression is associated with greater illness severity, and that children can meet the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD), few studies have examined the presentation of MDD among young children. This is the first nationwide study of MDD among preadolescent children in Canada.
   METHODS: Pediatrician members (2500) of a Canadian pediatric surveillance network were surveyed monthly over 3 years to report new cases of MDD among 5- to 12-year-olds. Survey response and questionnaire completion rates were 80% and 85%, respectively. Symptom presentation and duration, impairment, medical and psychiatric history, and management were reported.
   RESULTS: Twenty-nine new cases of MDD were identified by pediatricians. Of these, 23 (79%) experienced symptoms for > 6 months before presentation with global functional impairment. Parental depression or anxiety, commonly maternal, was present in 21 cases (72%). Twenty-two children (76%) reported suicidal ideation; 6 (21%) had attempted suicide. Twenty-three children (79%) were treated with medication. Thirteen children (45%) were treated with 2 or more medications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Children with MDD frequently had a parental history of mood disorders, experienced long-standing symptom presence, high symptom burden and functional impairment prior to presentation; and commonly treatment with polypharmacy.

AB Assisted dying is a highly controversial moral issue incorporating both physician-assisted dying (PAD) and voluntary active euthanasia. End-of-life practices are debated in many countries, with assisted dying receiving different consideration across various jurisdictions. In this paper, we provide an analytic framework of the current position and the main arguments related to the rights and moral principles concerning assisted dying. Assisted dying proponents focus on the respect of autonomy, self-determination and forestalling suffering. On the other hand, concerns are raised regarding the interpretation of the constitutional right to life and balancing this with the premise of assisted dying, alongside the impacts of assisted dying on the doctor-patient relationship, which is fundamentally based on trust, mutual respect and the premise of 'first do no harm'. Our review is underpinning the interpretation of constitutional rights and the Hippocratic Oath with the premise of assisted dying, alongside the impacts of assisted dying on the doctor-patient relationship. Most clinicians remain untrained in such decision making, with fears against crossing key ethical divides. Due to the increasing number of cases of assisted dying and lack of consensus, our review enables the integration of ethical and legal aspects and facilitates decision making.

AB Objective: To determine whether, and to what extent, those who reported suicidal ideation and (or) attempts in the previous year, without meeting the criteria for major depressive episode (MDE), might still have experienced subthreshold depression.
   Method: Data from the Canadian Community Health Survey: Mental Health and Well-Being (CCHS 1.2) were examined to estimate and compare the prevalence of depressed mood, a core symptom of MDE and subthreshold depression, within the previous month for the following 4 population groups: MDE within the previous month [D(1 month)], MDE within the previous year but not the previous month [D(1 year)], suicidality without MDE within the previous year (D-S+), and no MDE or suicidality within the previous year (D-S-).
   Results: As expected, the D(1 month) group showed the highest prevalence of depressed mood in the previous month. However, the D - S+ group had a significantly higher prevalence of depressed mood than the D-S-group and only a slightly lower level than that of the D(1 year) group.
   Conclusions: A fraction of those who reported suicidality in the previous year met the criteria for MDE during that time; however, subthreshold depression might be common in the suicidal population. Future epidemiologic research in the areas of suicidality and depression will benefit from a comprehensive assessment of subthreshold depression.

AB The Canadian Arctic is experiencing rapid changes in climatic conditions, with implications for Inuit communities widely documented. Youth have been identified as an at-risk population, with likely impacts on mental health and well-being. This study identifies and characterizes youth-specific protective factors that enhance well-being in light of a rapidly changing climate, and examines how climatic and environmental change challenges these. In-depth conversational interviews were conducted with youth aged 15-25 from the five communities of the Nunatsiavut region of Labrador, Canada: Nain, Hopedale, Postville, Makkovik, and Rigolet. Five key protective factors were identified as enhancing their mental health and well-being: being on the land; connecting to Inuit culture; strong communities; relationships with family and friends; and staying busy. Changing sea ice and weather conditions were widely reported to be compromising these protective factors by reducing access to the land, and increasing the danger of land-based activities. This study contributes to existing work on Northern climate change adaptation by identifying factors that enhance youth resilience and, if incorporated into adaptation strategies, may contribute to creating successful and effective adaptation responses.

AB Public health planning can benefit from Visual exploration and analysis of geospatial data. Maps and geo-visualization tools must be developed with the user-group in mind. User-needs assessment and usability testing are crucial elements in the iterative process of map design and implementation. This study presents the results of a usability test of static, animated and interactive maps of injury rates and socio-demographic determinants of injury by a simple of potential end-users in Toronto, Canada. The results of the user-testing Suggest that different map types are useful for different purposes and for satisfying the varying skill level of the individual user. The static maps were deemed to be easy to use and versatile, while the animated maps Could be made more useful if animation controls were provided. The split-screen concept of the interactive maps was highlighted as particularly effective for map comparison. Overall, interactive maps were identified as the preferred map type for comparing patterns of injury and related socio-demographic risk factors. Information collected from the user-tests is being used to expand and refine the injury web maps for Toronto, and could inform other public health-related geo-visualization projects.

ID SUICIDE ATTEMPTS; HEALTH SURVEY
AB Objective: To determine provincial 12-month prevalence rates for selected psychiatric disorders and to assess the association between these and the Canadian Social Problem Index (SPI).
   Method: Psychiatric data for depression, mania, panic disorder, social phobia, and agoraphobia were derived from the results of the 2002 Canadian Community Health Survey: Mental Health and Well-Being. The Canadian SPI was updated for 2002, and correlations were calculated between the SPI and the 5 diagnostic prevalence values across provinces.
   Results: The results showed that the SPI had maintained its tendency to increase from east to west in Canada, a trend reflected by depression and mania. The psychiatric disorders did not show strong correlations with the SPI in 2002, but depression and mania did show relatively strong associations with index values from earlier years. High-to-low ratios across provinces for individual social problems averaged over 5, and the results were essentially of the same magnitude for the ranges of particular psychiatric diagnoses.
   Conclusions: The differences in need found here suggest that per capita allocation of funding for mental health and social programs may not be appropriate. The mixed findings on the association between mental disorders and social problem behaviour across provinces leads to more research questions than research answers.

AB Objective: To compare the causes and rates of death for people with and without schizophrenia in Manitoba, Canada.
   Method: Using de-identified administrative databases at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy, a population-based analysis was performed to compare age-and sex-adjusted 10-year (1999-2008) mortality rates, overall and by specific cause, of decedents aged 10 years or older who had 1 diagnosis of schizophrenia (ICD-9-CM code 295, ICD-10-CA codes F20, F21, F23.2, F25) over a 12-year period (N = 9,038) to the rest of the population (N = 969,090).
   Results: The mortality rate for those with schizophrenia was double that of the rest of the population (20.00% vs 9.37%). The all-cause mortality rate was higher for people with schizophrenia compared to all others (168.9 vs 99.1 per thousand; relative risk [RR] = 1.70, P <.0001); rates of death due to suicide (RR = 8.67, P <.0001), injury (RR = 2.35, P <.0001), respiratory illness (RR = 2.00, P <.0001), and circulatory illness (RR = 1.64, P <.0001) were also significantly higher in people with schizophrenia. Overall cancer deaths were similar (28.6 vs 27.3 per thousand, P =.42, NS) except in the middle-aged group (40-59), in which cancer death rates were significantly higher for those with schizophrenia (28.7 vs 11.6 per thousand; RR = 2.48, P <.01). Mortality rates due to lung cancer were significantly higher in people with schizophrenia (9.4 vs 6.4 per thousand, RR = 1.45, P <.001).
   Conclusions: People with schizophrenia are at increased risk of death compared to the general population, and the majority of these deaths are occurring in older age from physical disease processes. Risk of cancer mortality is significantly higher in middle-aged but not younger or older patients with schizophrenia. Understanding these patients' vulnerabilities to physical illness has important public health implications for prevention, screening, and treatment as the population ages.

AB OBJECTIVE: With recent increasing rates of medical student and physician suicide, there has been a focus on examining depression in medical providers and trainees, particularly surgical residents. However, there is a paucity of data specific to orthopedic surgery. Our goal was to evaluate the mental health status of current trainees across North America in order to determine whether or not there were specific demographic or program characteristics correlated with improved mental health scores.
   DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was developed and administered to collect basic demographic information as well as residency program qualities. The Mental Health Inventory 5 (MHI-5) was used to assess depression and anxiety in study participants. We then evaluated the associations between various resident and program characteristics and depression scores with a p value set at <0.05 for significance.
   SETTING: Orthopedic Surgery residency programs across the United States and Canada. Surveys were distributed to 44 programs and responses were received from 41 of those programs.
   PARTICIPANTS: An anonymous survey was distributed to Orthopedic Surgery residents across the United States and Canada; participation in the survey was voluntary and free of coercion. We received a total of 279 responses from 41 institutions across North America.
   RESULTS: The mean MHI-5 score of all respondents was 71.5 (range 8.0-100). Women, PGY2 and PGY3 residents and those working >80 hours per week were found to have significantly lower MHI-5 scores. Greater MHI-5 scores were seen in respondents who felt their program offered them an adequate level of surgical independence, case volume/variety, mentorship, and educational opportunities as well as adequate resources to deal with personal or work-related issues.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the prevalence of low-level depression in United States and Canadian orthopedic surgery residents. Additionally, we identified several characteristics that residency programs may focus on to help prevent burnout and depression in trainees. ((C) 2019 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

TI Exploring attitudes toward physician-assisted death in patients with

DT Article
DE Palliative care; Medical assistance in dying; Physician-assisted death;

ID TERMINALLY-ILL PATIENTS; HASTENED DEATH; DESIRE; CANCER; EUTHANASIA;
   SUICIDE; DEPRESSION
AB Background: On February 6th, 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that competent adults suffering intolerably from a grievous and irremediable medical condition have the right to the assistance of a physician in ending their own lives, an act known as physician-assisted death, and later defined as medical assistance in dying, allowing for provision by a physician or a nurse practitioner. As of June 6th, 2016, this is no longer illegal across Canada. There is strong support amongst the general population for physician-assisted death, however there is no recent data on the attitudes of terminally ill patients. Our main objective was to gain information on terminally ill patients' general and personal attitudes toward physician-assisted death.
   Methods: This is an exploratory pilot study. We surveyed three groups of patients with life-limiting diagnoses: one with new referrals to palliative care; one with no palliative care involvement; and one with prior and ongoing management by a palliative care team. Respondents were surveyed twice, approximately two weeks apart, and rated their general attitudes toward physician-assisted death and the hypothetical consideration of physician-assisted death for oneself on a five-point Likert scale at baseline and follow-up. Respondents with new referrals to palliative care were surveyed before and after palliative care consultation. This study was approved by The Western University Health Sciences Research Ethics Board and Lawson Health Research Institute.
   Results: We surveyed 102 participants, 70 of whom completed both surveys (31% dropout rate). Participants in all groups predominantly responded between somewhat agree (4 on a 5-point Likert scale) and strongly agree (5 on the Likert scale) when asked about their general attitude toward physician-assisted death. Patients with prior palliative care involvement reported the highest average ratings of hypothetical consideration of physician-assisted death for oneself on a 5-point Likert scale (3.4 at baseline; 3.9 at follow-up), followed by patients with a new palliative consultation (3.2 at baseline; 3.3 at follow-up), and patients with no palliative involvement (2.6 at baseline; 2.9 at follow-up).
   Conclusions: Given the preliminary results of this pilot study, we can conclude that terminally ill patients generally agree that physician-assisted death should be available to patients with life-limiting illnesses. Furthermore, descriptive data show a trend for higher hypothetical consideration of physician-assisted death in those patients with prior and ongoing palliative care involvement than patients without palliative involvement. Responses in all groups remained fairly consistent over the two-week period.

AB Background: Bipolar illness is associated with significant psychosocial morbidity and health resource utilization. Second generation antipsychotics, used alone or in combination with mood stabilizers are effective in treating acute mania in community settings. This study was designed to compare the change in clinical parameters and resource utilization at one month in a group of patients who required treatment intervention for exacerbation of mania. The clinical response at one year was also evaluated.
   Methods: 496 patients were enrolled at 75 psychiatric practices across Canada. The Olanzapine cohort (n = 287) included patients who had olanzapine added to their medication regimen or the dose of olanzapine increased. The Other cohort (n = 209) had a medication other than olanzapine added or the dose adjusted. Changes from baseline in the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory and SF-12 Health Survey were compared at one month using ANCOVA. Categorical variables at one month for health resource utilization, employment status, abuse/dependency, and the number of suicide attempts were compared using Fisher's Exact test. Patients were followed for one year and a subgroup was evaluated.
   Results: At one month, patients in the Olanzapine cohort recorded a mean reduction in the YMRS of 11.5, significantly greater than the mean reduction in the Other cohort of 9.7 (ANCOVA P = 0.002). The Olanzapine cohort was significantly improved compared to the Other cohort on the scales for depression and anxiety and did not experience the deterioration in physical functioning seen in the Other cohort. No significant differences were detected in health-related quality-of-life measures, employment status, drug abuse/dependency, number of suicide attempts, mental functioning, emergency room visits or inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations. In a subgroup treated for 12 months with a single second generation antipsychotic, improvements in illness severity measures were maintained with no evidence of significant differences among the antipsychotics.
   Conclusions: Patients with bipolar disorder requiring treatment intervention for exacerbation of mania in the community setting responded to olanzapine at one month. In a subset analysis, second generation antipsychotic treatment continued to be beneficial in reducing bipolar symptoms at one year.

TI Organ donation after medical assistance in dying or cessation of

DT Article
ID AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; CARDIAC DEATH; CARDIOCIRCULATORY DEATH;
   SUICIDE; EUTHANASIA; PROCUREMENT; KIDNEY
AB In June 2016, following the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada to decriminalise assistance in dying, the Canadian government enacted Bill C-14, legalising medical assistance in dying (MAID). In 2014, the province of Quebec had passed end-of-life care legislation making MAID available as of December 2015. The availability of MAID has many implications, including the possibility of combining this practice with organ donation through the controlled donation after cardiac death (cDCD) protocol. cDCD most often occurs in cases where the patient has a severe neurological injury but does not meet all the criteria for brain death. The donation is subsequent to the decision to withdraw life-sustaining treatment (LST). Cases where patients are conscious prior to the withdrawal of LST are unusual, and have raised doubts as to the acceptability of removing organs from individuals who are not neurologically impaired and who have voluntarily chosen to die. These cases can be compared with likely scenarios in which patients will request both MAID and organ donation. In both instances, patients will be conscious and competent. Organ donation in such contexts raises ethical issues regarding respect for autonomy, societal pressure, conscientious objections and the dead-donor rule. In this article, we look at relevant policies in other countries and examine the ethical issues associated with cDCD in conscious patients who choose to die.

AB Objective: Alcohol and (or) illicit drug use (AIDU) problems are associated with mental health difficulties, but low-to-moderate alcohol consumption may have mental health benefits, compared with abstinence. Our study aimed to explore the hypothesis of a nonlinear, or J-curve, relation between AIDU profiles and psychological distress, psychiatric disorders, and mental health service use in the general Canadian population.
   Methods: Data were collected from a representative sample of the Canadian population (n = 36 984). Multiple correspondence analyses and cluster analyses were used to extract AIDU profiles. Sociodemographics, psychological distress, psychiatric disorders, and mental health service use were assessed and compared between profiles.
   Results: Seven AIDU profiles emerged, including 3 involving risky or problematic AIDU that correlate with major affective disorders, anxiety disorders, suicidal behaviours, and higher levels of psychological distress. No J-curve relation was found for psychiatric disorders and mental health service use. The lifetime-abstainer profile correlates with the lowest rates of psychiatric disorders and mental health service use. Lifetime abstainers are also more often female, immigrant, and unemployed. Compared with other profiles, spirituality is more important in their life.
   Conclusions: The hypothesis of a nonlinear relation between psychiatric disorders and AIDU was not supported. Lifetime AIDU abstainers have specific sociodemographic and cultural background characteristics in Canada.

AB Substance use disorders (SUDs) are highly prevalent in homeless populations, and rates are typically greater among males. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common co-occurring condition among individuals with SUDs; however, little attention has been directed to examining this comorbidity in homeless populations. Although some studies indicate considerable sex differences among individuals with PTSD, it has also been suggested that sex differences in PTSD rates diminish in populations with severe SUDs. This cross-sectional study investigated SUD-PTSD comorbidity and its associations with indicators of psychosocial functioning in a sample of 500 homeless individuals from Canada. Sex-related patterns of SUD, PTSD, and their comorbidity were also examined. Males and females had similar SUD prevalence rates, but the rates of PTSD and PTSD-SUD comorbidity were higher in females. PTSD and sex were found to have significant main effects on suicidality, psychological distress, somatic symptoms, and incarceration among individuals with SUD. Sex also moderated the association of PTSD with suicide risk and psychological distress. Our results contradict assumptions that sex differences in PTSD rates attenuate in samples with severe SUDs. Organizations providing SUD treatment for homeless people should address PTSD as an integrated part of their services. SUD and integrated treatment programs may benefit from sex-specific components.

AB Objective: Psychiatric conditions are known to have a detrimental impact on functioning and may therefore influence patterns of disability associated with MS. Population-based studies are needed to evaluate such interactions. The objective of this study was to describe the pattern of interaction of MS and mental disorders on health-related impairments. Methods: The Participation and Activity Limitation Survey (PALS) was a post-censual survey conducted by Statistics Canada in association with the 2006 Canadian Census. PALS collected detailed data from a random sample of n = 28,640 respondents with health-related impairments reported on their census form. The PALS interview collected self-reported diagnostic data and included scales to assess functioning and participation in society. Results: PALS identified 245 individuals with MS, leading to an estimated (weighted) population prevalence of 0.2% (200 per 100,000), consistent with other Canadian estimates. As expected, impaired agility, vision, communication, mobility, pain, and memory were strongly associated with MS. Mental disorders were also associated with impairment, but interactions between these conditions and MS were generally not evident. Conclusions: Mental disorders are associated with a higher level of disability in MS but, with the exception of communication, there was no evidence of synergistic interaction between mental disorders and MS in contributing to health-related impairments.

AB Purpose - While epidemiological studies have linked economic hardship and financial difficulties with psychological distress and suicide, investigation of financial concerns among users of public mental health services has been limited. Moreover, empirical data regarding a relationship between financial difficulties and mental health symptoms are lacking. The purpose of this paper is to examine the prevalence of financial difficulties among patients attending community mental health clinics, and to examine the relationship between such difficulties and psychological distress and suicidality.
   Design/methodology/approach - Participants attending three community mental health clinics in British Columbia, Canada provided demographic information, including annual income, and completed brief measures of personal financial management, psychological distress and suicidal behavior.
   Findings - Although more than half of participants reported good-to-excellent ability to pay their bills on time, nearly half indicated poor long-range saving and financial planning. Lower annual income was directy related to suicidality. Financial management difficulties were associated with psychological distress, and were significantly related to suicidality after controlling for the effects of income and psychological distress.
   Originality/value - The findings highlight the need for attention to distress and suicidality as potential sequelae of financial management difficulties, and carry implications for further research, clinical intervention and social policy. The findings confirm the need to address financial needs and money management abilities among users of public mental health services.

AB Objective To compare gambling behaviors in a random sample of community residents with and without mental disorders identified by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Method A large national community survey conducted by Statistics Canada included questions about problems arising from gambling activities as per the Canadian Problem Gambling Index (CPGI). We compared respondents within three gambling severity categories (non-problem, low severity and moderate/high severity gambling) across three diagnostic groupings (mood/anxiety disorders, substance dependence/harmful alcohol use, no selected psychiatric disorder). Results Of the 14,934 respondents age 18-64 years who engaged in at least one type of gambling activity in the previous 12 months, 5.8% fell in the low severity gambling category while 2.9% fell in the moderate/high severity category. Females accounted for 51.7% of the sample. The risk of moderate/high severity gambling was 1.7 times higher in persons with mood or anxiety disorder compared to persons with no selected disorder. For persons with substance dependence or harmful alcohol use, the risk of moderate/high severity gambling was 2.9 times higher. Persons with both mood/anxiety and substance/alcohol disorders were five times more likely to be moderate/high severity gamblers. The odds ratio for females was 0.6 and for those with less than post- secondary education it was 1.52. Differences in age and personal income were not significant.

AB This study assesses the contribution of predisposing, enabling, and needs factors and related variables that predicted the number of healthcare professionals consulted for mental health reasons among 746 individuals with mental disorders and high psychological distress. The data were drawn from the third (T3) and fourth data collection periods (T4) of a longitudinal study conducted in a Quebec/Canada epidemiological catchment area. Hierarchical linear regression was performed on the number of types of healthcare professionals consulted in the 12 months prior to T4. Predictors were identified at T3, classified as predisposing, enabling, and needs factors (i.e., clinical and related variables) according to the Andersen Behavioral Model. Three needs factors were associated with the number of types of healthcare professionals consulted: Post-traumatic stress disorder, stressful events, and marginally suicide ideation. Three enabling factors: Having a family physician, previous use of mental health services, and employment status were also related to the dependent variable. Poor self-perception of mental health status was the only predisposing factor retained. While needs factors were the main predictors of the number of types of healthcare professionals consulted, enabling factors may reduce the influence of needs factors, by the deployment of various strategies that facilitate continuous and appropriate care.

AB Objectives Sexual and mental health disparities exist in the Northwest Territories (NWT) compared with other Canadian regions. STI rates are 10-fold higher, and youth suicide rates double the Canadian average. Scant research has examined associations between mental and sexual health among youth in the NWT. The study objective was to explore pathways from depression to multiple sex partners (MSP) among young women in the NWT, Canada. Methods We implemented a cross-sectional survey in 2015-2016 with a venue-based recruitment sample of young women aged 13-17 attending secondary schools in 17 NWT communities. We conducted path analysis to test a conceptual model examining associations between depression and a history of MSP, examining substance use and peer support as mediators. Results Participants (n=199; mean age: 13.8, SD: 1.27) mostly identified were Indigenous (n=154; 77.4%) and one-fifth (n=39; 20.5%) were sexually diverse/non-heterosexual. Almost two-thirds (n=119; 63.3%) reported depression symptoms. One-quarter (n=53; 26.6%) were currently dating, and 16.1% (n=32) reported a lifetime history of >1 sex partner (classified as having MSP). There was no direct effect between depression and MSP (beta=0.189, p=0.087, 95% CI 0.046 to 0.260). Depression had a direct effect on substance use (beta=0.023, p<0.050, 95% CI 0.118 to 0.500), and an indirect effect on MSP through substance use (beta=0.498, SE=0.10, p<0.001, 95% CI 0.141 to 0.280). Depression was associated with lower peer support (beta=-0.168, p<0.010, 95% CI -0.126 to 0.280); peer support was not associated with MSP (beta=-0.158, p=0.130, 95% CI -0.126 to 0.001). Conclusion This research is among the first to identify mental health factors associated with STI vulnerability among young women in the NWT. Findings demonstrate the importance of addressing depression and substance use in sexual health interventions in Northern contexts.

AB There is mounting urgency regarding the mental health of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBM). We examined how GBM are understanding the relationship between HIV and their mental health given the increasing biomedicalisation of HIV prevention and care. Our Grounded Theory analysis derived from qualitative interviews with 24 GBM living in Toronto, Canada, including both HIV-negative and HIV-positive men. Participants understood biomedical advances, such as undetectable viral load and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), as providing some relief from HIV-related distress. However, they offered ambivalent perspectives on the biomedicalisation of HIV. Some considered non-HIV-specific stressors (e.g. unemployment, racial discrimination) more significant than HIV-related concerns. These men expressed HIV-related distress as being under control due to biomedical advances or as always negligible when compared to non-HIV-specific stressors. Others emphasised the ongoing mental health implications of HIV (e.g. enduring risk and stigma). We describe a tension between optimistic responses to biomedicine's ability to ease the psychosocial burdens associated with HIV and the inability for biomedicine to address the social and economic determinants driving the dual epidemics of HIV and mental distress amongst GBM. We argue for more socio-material analysis over further sexual behavioural analysis of GBM mental health disparities.

TI An International Consensus Definition of the Wish to Hasten Death and

AB Background
   The desire for hastened death or wish to hasten death (WTHD) that is experienced by some patients with advanced illness is a complex phenomenon for which no widely accepted definition exists. This lack of a common conceptualization hinders understanding and cooperation between clinicians and researchers. The aim of this study was to develop an internationally agreed definition of the WTHD.
   Methods
   Following an exhaustive literature review, a modified nominal group process and an international, modified Delphi process were carried out. The nominal group served to produce a preliminary definition that was then subjected to a Delphi process in which 24 experts from 19 institutions from Europe, Canada and the USA participated. Delphi responses and comments were analysed using a pre-established strategy.
   Findings
   All 24 experts completed the three rounds of the Delphi process, and all the proposed statements achieved at least 79% agreement. Key concepts in the final definition include the WTHD as a reaction to suffering, the fact that such a wish is not always expressed spontaneously, and the need to distinguish the WTHD from the acceptance of impending death or from a wish to die naturally, although preferably soon. The proposed definition also makes reference to possible factors related to the WTHD.
   Conclusions
   This international consensus definition of the WTHD should make it easier for clinicians and researchers to share their knowledge. This would foster an improved understanding of the phenomenon and help in developing strategies for early therapeutic intervention.

AB School interventions to address sexual orientation discrimination can be important tools for fostering inclusive school climate, and improving student wellbeing. In this study, we empirically evaluated a film-based intervention, Out in Schools, designed to reduce sexual orientation prejudice and foster inclusive school attitudes. Our evaluation mapped data about Out in Schools presentations onto student data from the random cluster-stratified, province-wide 2013 British Columbia Adolescent Health Survey (BCAHS) as well as potential confounding variables of Gay-Straight Alliance clubs (GSAs) and inclusive school policies. Outcome measures included past year sexual orientation discrimination, bullying, suicidal ideation, and school connectedness among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) and heterosexual (HET) students in grades 8 through 12 (ages 13 to 18; unweighted N = 21,075, weighted/scaled N = 184,821). Analyses used complex samples logistic regression, adjusted for sample design, conducted separately by gender and orientation. We found Out in Schools presentations were associated with reduced odds of LGB students experiencing discrimination, and both LGB and HET girl students being bullied or considering suicide, and increased levels of school connectedness, even after controlling for GSAs and policies. Out in Schools appears to have an additive contribution to reducing orientation prejudice and improving LGB and heterosexual student wellbeing within schools.

DE anxiety; bereavement; depression; motor vehicle collision
ID SUICIDE; ACCIDENT; SUPPORT; SUDDEN; CHILD; NEEDS
AB Motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) are the leading cause of death in young people in North America. The effects of such deaths on parents have not been systematically studied. Administrative data sets were used to identify all parents (n 1,458) who had an offspring die in a MVC between 1996 and 2008 in the province of Manitoba, Canada. They were matched to general population control parents who had not had offspring die from any sudden cause during the study period. Generalized estimating equations were used to compare the rates of physician-diagnosed mental and physical disorders, social factors, and treatment utilization in the 2 parent groups in the 2 years before and after offspring death, with adjustment for confounding factors. The risk of depression among bereaved parents almost tripled (adjusted prevalence ratio 2.85, 95 confidence interval: 2.44, 3.33; P 0.001) during the 2 years after death of an offspring. Significant increases in the risk of anxiety disorders (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.45, 95 confidence interval: 1.26, 1.67; P 0.001) were also observed. When compared with nonbereaved parents, bereaved parents had significant increases in the risks of depression (P 0.001), anxiety disorders (P 0.001), marital break-up (P 0.015), and physician visits for mental illness (P 0.001) in the post-death period. In conclusion, parents who lose an offspring in a MVC experience considerable mental illness and marital disruption.

AB Background: Most studies on euthanasia fail to explain the intentions of health professionals when faced with performing euthanasia and are atheoretical.
   Research objective: The purpose of this study was to identify the psychosocial determinants of nurses' intention to practise euthanasia in palliative care if it were legalised.
   Research design: A cross-sectional study using a validated anonymous questionnaire based on an extended version of the Theory of Planned Behaviour.
   Participants and research context: A random sample of 445 nurses from the province of Quebec, Canada, was selected for participation in the study.
   Ethical considerations: The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Centre hospitalier universitaire de Quebec.
   Findings: The response rate was 44.2% and the mean score for intention was 4.61 1.90 (range: 1-7). The determinants of intention were the subjective (odds ratio = 3.08; 95% confidence interval: 1.50-6.35) and moral (odds ratio = 2.95; 95% confidence interval: 1.58-5.49) norms. Specific beliefs which could discriminate nurses according to their level of intention were identified.
   Discussion: Overall, nurses have a slightly positive intention to practise euthanasia. Their family approval seems particularly important and also the approval of their medical colleagues. Nurses' moral norm was related to beneficence, an ethical principle.
   Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify nurses' motivations to practise euthanasia in palliative care using a validated psychosocial theory. It also has the distinction of identifying the ethical principles underlying nurses' moral norm and intention.

AB The present study explored female university athletes' experiences with protracted concussion symptoms, including the factors that impeded or facilitated their recovery. Five female athletes who competed in 4 different university sports in Canada participated in this study. All participants suffered concussion symptoms that lasted from 10 weeks to 14 months. An interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to inductively analyze the interview data. The participants discussed the unique challenges that stemmed from suffering a prolonged concussion while competing in university sport, which included serious emotional responses (depression, attempted suicide) and reduced academic performances. Participants also alluded to the types of emotional and informational support from their coaches, doctors, athletic therapists, and parents that facilitated their recovery. Overall, the detailed descriptions provided by the participants in this study offer a rare look into their lived experiences of university athletes suffering from protracted concussion symptoms. Given the serious emotional responses reported in this study, the present findings highlight the need to monitor concussed university athletes' psychological health and academic performance. These results provide individuals such as coaches, medical professionals, and sport psychology specialists with detailed information about the impact of protracted symptomatology on an athlete from a personal (social), athletic, and academic perspective, which may enhance their applied work with this population. The present findings also highlight the need for social support for concussed university athletes throughout their recoveries to help them cope during this important and challenging time of their lives.

AB The objective of this study was to identify seasonal variations in mental health-related hospitalizations among children, adolescents, and adults using administrative health data. Hospital admission records from January 2004 to March, 2014 were sourced from the New Brunswick Discharge Abstract Database. Seasonality was measured using a cosinor model to estimate the phase. amplitude, and peak of seasonal variations in psychiatric admissions over the 12-month period from January through December. A general linear model using a Poisson distribution was used to calculate rate ratios that measured the significance of monthly variations in psychiatric admissions. We adjusted for the average number of days per month and provincial population counts using offsets in both models. Between 2004 and 2014, there were 57,730 mental health-related hospital admissions by 41,690 patients. Psychiatric admissions by children and adolescents (aged 3-19 years) increased from 44 admissions per 100,000 in 2004 to 51 admissions per 100.000 in 2014. Rates of psychiatric admissions among children, adolescents, and adults exhibited seasonality confirmed through the detection of a statistically significant sinusoidal pattern (p < .025). The highest rates of child and adolescent admissions were in February (phase = 2, amplitude = 4.4), whereas adult admissions to the hospital peaked in early May (phase = 5.3, amplitude = 9.7). These findings lend support to existing efforts to identify the complex array of individual, family, community, and environmental factors that influence the likelihood of acute care utilization for management of psychiatric disorders.

AB The increasing availability of physician-assisted death (PAD) has opened up a novel means of making donated bodies available for anatomical dissection. This practice has come to the fore in Canada, but is unlikely to be confined to that country as legislation changes in other countries. The ethical considerations raised by this development are placed within the framework of the ethical guidelines on body donation promulgated by the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists. The discussion centers on understanding the ethical dimensions of moral complicity, and whether it is accepted or rejected. If rejected it is possible to separate ethical concerns regarding PAD from subsequent use of donated bodies, as long as there is fully informed consent and complete ethical and procedural separation of the two. Openness about the origin of bodies for dissection is essential. Students should be instructed on the nuances of moral complicity, and consideration be given to those with moral doubts about PAD. Two issues are raised in considering whether these moves represent an ethical slippery slope: the attraction represented by obtaining relatively "high quality" bodies, and the manner in which organ donation following PAD has led to challenges to the dead donor rule. Although body donation raises fewer concerns, the ethical dimensions of the two are similar. The ethical constraints outlined here have the capacity to prevent an ethical slippery slope and constitute a sound basis for addressing an innovative opportunity for anatomists.

AB In June 2016, Canada joined the handful of nations that have legalized physician-assisted dying (PAD). Yet, with legislation restricting PAD to the terminally ill, many have been left contending for the right to PAD in cases of debilitating chronic illness, including, but not limited to, severe mental illness. This commentary serves to evaluate and continue the discussion of Canadian PAD for the mentally ill as introduced by Karesa and McBride (2016), present and compare the results of our own research, and promote ongoing discourse on this subject. Karesa and McBride (2016) surveyed psychologists regarding a prospective role for their profession in the PAD process, as well as their attitudes toward PAD. We evaluate their methodology and findings, suggesting manners in which future investigations of psychologists' attitudes toward PAD can be improved. Implementing some of these suggestions, our own study assessed n = 201 Canadian undergraduates' attitudes toward PAD for 2 mental illnesses (schizophrenia, depression) as compared with PAD for physical illness (multiple sclerosis [MS]). In a repeated measures design, participants read vignettes depicting individuals who suffer grievously from 1 of MS, schizophrenia, or depression. In accordance with the primary hypotheses, schizophrenia and depression received lower levels of support for PAD, and were perceived as involving less suffering, rationality, and futility of treatment compared to MS. Our study provides further insight into the ways in which people differentiate physical and mental illnesses, and our discussion adds a Canadian perspective to a pressing subject that, to date, has not been thoroughly investigated.

AB Objective-To measure veterinarian satisfaction with companion animal visits through an adaptation of a previously validated physician visit satisfaction scale and to identify demographic, personality, appointment, and communication factors that contribute to veterinarian visit satisfaction.
   Design-Cross-sectional descriptive study.
   Sample-Random sample of 50 companion animal practitioners in southern Ontario, Canada, and convenience sample of 300 clients and their pets.
   Procedures-For each practitioner, 6 clinical appointments were videotaped, and the resulting 300 videotapes were analyzed by use of the Roter interaction analysis system. The physician satisfaction scale, Rosenberg self-esteem scale, and interpersonal reactivity index were used to measure veterinarian visit satisfaction, self-esteem, and empathy, respectively. Linear regression analysis was conducted to study the relationship between factors and veterinarian visit satisfaction.
   Results-Veterinarian visit satisfaction ranged from 1 to 5 (mean +/- SD, 3.97 +/- 0.99) and differed significantly between wellness appointments (mean scale score, 4.13) and problem appointments (mean scale score, 3.81). Various elements of client and veterinarian communication as well as personality measures of veterinarian self-esteem and empathy were associated with veterinarian satisfaction. The specific factors differed depending on the nature of the appointment.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results suggested that veterinarian visit specific satisfaction is enhanced through the use of communication that builds relationships with clients and is associated with degrees of veterinarian empathetic concern and veterinarian self-esteem.The implications extend to overall job satisfaction and its potential link to the health and well-being of individual veterinarians.

   MISSION
AB Objective: Military personnel in Canada and elsewhere have been found to have higher rates of certain mental disorders relative to their corresponding general populations. However, published Canadian data have only adjusted for age and sex differences between the populations. Additional differences in the sociodemographic composition, labour force characteristics, and childhood trauma exposure in the populations could be driving these prevalence differences. Our objective is to compare the prevalence of past-year mental disorders and suicidal behaviours in the Canadian Armed Forces Regular Force with the rates in a representative, matched sample of Canadians in the general population (CGP).
   Methods: Data sources were the 2013 Canadian Forces Mental Health Survey and the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health. CGP sample was restricted to match the age range, employment status, and history of chronic conditions of Regular Force personnel. An iterative proportional fitting method was used to approximate the marginal distribution of sociodemographic and childhood trauma variables in both samples.
   Results: Relative to the matched CGP, Regular Force personnel had significantly higher rates of past-year major depressive episode, generalized anxiety disorder, and suicide ideation. However, lower rates of alcohol use disorder were seen in Regular Force personnel relative to the matched CGP sample.
   Conclusions: Factors other than differences in sociodemographic composition and history of childhood trauma account for the excess burden of mental disorders and suicidal behaviours in the Canadian Armed Forces. Explanations to explore in future research include occupational trauma, selection effects, and differences in the context of administration of the 2 surveys.
   Objectif: Le personnel militaire du Canada et d'ailleurs s'est revele avoir des taux plus eleves de certains troubles mentaux, relativement aux populations generales correspondantes. Cependant, les donnees canadiennes ne sont ajustees que pour les differences selon l'age et le sexe entre les populations. Des differences additionnelles de la composition sociodemographique, des caracteristiques de la main-d'OEuvre, et de l'exposition a des traumatismes dans l'enfance dans les populations pourraient etre a l'origine de ces differences de prevalence. Notre objectif est de comparer la prevalence des troubles mentaux et des comportements suicidaires de l'annee precedente dans la Force reguliere (Freg) des Forces armees canadiennes (FAC) avec les taux d'un echantillon representatif apparie de Canadiens de la population generale (CPG).
   Methodes: Les sources des donnees etaient l'Enquete sur la sante mentale des Forces canadiennes de 2013 et l'Enquete sur la sante dans les collectivites canadiennes - Sante mentale, de 2012. L'echantillon de CPG a ete restreint pour correspondre aux groupes d'age, au statut d'emploi, et aux antecedents d'affections chroniques du personnel de la Freg. Une methode d'ajustement proportionnel iteratif a ete utilisee pour approximer la distribution marginale des variables sociodemographiques et de traumatisme dans l'enfance dans les deux echantillons.
   Resultats: Relativement a l'echantillon apparie de CPG, le personnel de la Freg avait des taux significativement plus eleves d'episode depressif majeur, de trouble d'anxiete generalisee, de dependance a l'alcool, et de d'ideation suicidaire de l'annee precedente. Toutefois, des taux plus faibles d'abus d'alcool ont ete constates dans la Freg relativement aux CPG.
   Conclusion: Des facteurs autres que les differences de composition sociodemographique et des antecedents de traumatismes dans l'enfance sont a l'origine du fardeau excessif des troubles mentaux chez le personnel militaire canadien. Les explications a explorer dans la recherche future sont notamment les traumatismes subis au travail, les effets de selection, et les differences de contexte de l'administration des deux enquetes.

TI Association of Pediatric Resident Physician Depression and Burnout With

AB Purpose To determine whether higher rates of medical errors were associated with positive screenings for depression or burnout among resident physicians. Method The authors conducted a prospective cohort study from 2011 to 2013 in seven pediatric academic medical centers in the United States and Canada. Resident physicians were screened for burnout and depression using the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS) and Harvard Department of Psychiatry/National Depression Screening Day Scale (HANDS). A two-step surveillance methodology, involving a research nurse and two physician reviewers, was used to measure and categorize errors. Bivariate and mixed-effects regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between burnout, depression, and rates of harmful, nonharmful, and total errors. Results A total of 388/537 (72%) resident physicians completed the MBI-HSS and HANDS surveys. Seventy-six (20%) and 178 (46%) resident physicians screened positive for depression and burnout, respectively. Screening positive for depression was associated with a 3.0-fold higher rate of harmful errors (incidence rate ratio = 2.99 [95% CI 1.40-6.36], P = .005). However, there was no statistically significant association between depression and total or nonharmful errors or between burnout and harmful, nonharmful, or total errors. Conclusions Resident physicians with a positive depression screen were three times more likely than those who screened negative to make harmful errors. This association suggests resident physician mental health could be an important component of patient safety. If further research confirms resident physician depression increases the risk of harmful errors, it will become imperative to determine what interventions might mitigate this risk.

TI Community vulnerability to climate change in the context of other

AB Climate change in the Canadian north is, and will be, managed by communities that are already experiencing social, political, economic and other environmental changes. Hence, there is a need to understand vulnerability to climate change in the context of multiple exposure-sensitivities at the community level. This article responds to this perceived knowledge need based on a case study of the community of Kugluktuk in Nunavut, Canada. An established approach for vulnerability assessment is used to identify current climatic and non-climatic exposure-sensitivities along with their associated contemporary adaptation strategies. This assessment of current vulnerability is used as a basis to consider Kugluktuk's possible vulnerability to climatic change in the future. Current climate-related exposure-sensitivities in Kugluktuk relate primarily to subsistence harvesting and community infrastructure. Thinner and less stable ice conditions and unpredictable weather patterns are making travel and harvesting more dangerous and some community infrastructure is sensitive to permafrost melt and extreme weather events (e. g., flash floods). The ability of individuals and households to adapt to these and other climatic exposure-sensitivities is influenced by non-climatic factors that condition adaptive capacity including substance abuse, the erosion of traditional knowledge and youth suicide. These and other non-climatic factors often underpin adaptive capacity to deal with and adapt to changing conditions and must be considered in an assessment of vulnerability. This research argues that Northern communities are challenged by multiple exposure-sensitivities-beyond just those posed by climate-and effective adaptation to climate change requires consideration if not resolution of socio-economic and other issues in communities.

AB Background Substance use disorders and major depressive episodes (MDEs) often co-occur. Alcohol consumption may contribute to the aetiology of depressive episodes and/or vice versa. In Canada, the National Population Health Survey (NPHS) evaluated several aspects of alcohol use and MDE in a large population cohort over 12 years of follow-up. We evaluated the incidence of MDE in relation to different patterns of alcohol use, and examined the incidence of alcohol misuse in respondents with and without MDE. Methods The NPHS is a longitudinal study that began data collection in 1994 and whose cohort has been followed with biannual interviews. These interviews assess MDE using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short Form for Major Depression (CIDI-SFMD). Another CIDI-SF module assessed alcohol dependence during two interviews. Any alcohol consumption, exceeding moderate drinking guidelines and binge drinking were also assessed. We used logistic regression and proportional hazards models to assess longitudinal relationships between these variables Results Respondents with alcohol dependence were at higher risk of MDE, but any alcohol consumption, exceeding guidelines for moderate drinking and binge drinking were not. Respondents with MDE showed no increase of alcohol consumption, but the risk of alcohol dependence was elevated in depressed men. Conclusion Of direct clinical significance is the bidirectional relationship between alcohol dependence and MDE. Associations between alcohol consumption and MDE were not observed except when dependence was indicated. Alcohol dependence increased the risk of MDE, and MDE increased the risk of alcohol dependence, but only in men. Depression and Anxiety 29: 1058-1064, 2012. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Background: Intentional overdose is the commonest form of self-harm in adolescents globally. We explored temporal trends in intentional overdose among youth. Methods: Using multiple linked healthcare databases, we conducted a population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada, from 2002 to 2015. We included all patients aged 8 to 19 years who presented to an emergency department (ED) or were hospitalized for intentional overdose, stratifying by age and agent(s) consumed. We determined the annual rate of intentional overdose over time. For context, we contrasted these data against the annual rate of select unintentional injuries (laceration of face or scalp, upper extremity fracture, and accidental burn) in the same group over the same period. Results: We identified 31,419 unique intentional overdose events in youth, with a striking U-shaped trend apparent over the study period. From 2002 to 2010, hospital presentations for intentional overdose gradually declined. However, from 2010 to 2015, ED visits increased by 75% and hospital admissions doubled. The sharpest increases were observed in adolescents aged 14 to 17 years, and the most commonly implicated substances were acetaminophen, antidepressants and Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs). Over the study period, intentional overdoses involving antidepressants nearly doubled and those involving acetaminophen increased by 50%. In contrast, we observed steady and sustained declines in rates of hospital care for unintentional injuries in the same population over the same period. Conclusions: Since 2010, intentional overdoses have increased among youth, while other forms of unintentional injury have continued to decline. Further research is needed to understand the reasons for the unexpected rise in intentional overdose in adolescents, and strategies developed to mitigate this phenomenon.

   services; interrupted time series analysis

AB OBJECTIVE: Despite the high prevalence of mental illnesses and addictions, treatment rates remain low. In April 2010, a regional mass media campaign was implemented to increase awareness of mental health services in central Toronto, Canada. We studied the impact of this campaign on rates of psychiatric emergency department (PED) visits among all hospital emergency departments (EDs) located in Toronto.
   DESIGN: Monthly PED visit totals were obtained for all Toronto EDs from April 1, 2007 to March 31, 2012 (n = 148,704). The campaign's impact on visit rates was measured using interrupted time series analysis and a difference-in-difference estimator. We conducted pre- and post-campaign analyses to examine whether volume increases were explained by specific diagnostic categories and/or new presentations (new patients with no prior PED visits), and to examine geographic trends.
   RESULTS: The campaign was associated with an increased volume of PED visits at downtown hospitals (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, an increase of 7.6 visits/month [p < 0.0001]; University Health Network, 5.8 visits/month [p < 0.0001]; St. Michael's Hospital, 4.2 visits/month [p < 0.0001]; and Mount Sinai Hospital, 3.2 visits/month [p < 0.0001]) but not in hospitals located outside of the downtown area. Neither new patient visits nor specific diagnostic categories disproportionately accounted for the overall observed increases. Following the campaign, patients travelled greater distances to receive ED services.
   CONCLUSIONS: Mass media campaigns promoting mental health and psychiatric services can affect health care-seeking behaviour and utilization. Our findings have implications for system-level service planning, which should anticipate volume increases when public mental health campaigns are being considered.

AB Background: Assessing factors associated with non-fatal overdose is important as these could be useful to identify individuals with substance use disorders at high risk of adverse outcomes and consequences. Depression may play an important role in terms of overdose risk. We aimed to test if drug users suffering from a depressive disorder might have significantly higher risk of non-fatal overdose as compared with drug users without depression.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed, Embase and Web of Knowledge were searched. The pooled analyses were based on prevalence rates, risk difference (RD) and odds ratio (OR), reporting 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The combined estimates were obtained weighting each study according to random effects model for meta-analysis.
   Results: Seven articles, involving 12,019 individuals, and run in the US, Canada, Sweden, Norway, and Australia, were included. Pooled analyses comparing depressed with not depressed individuals highlighted a RD (95% CIs) for non-fatal overdose of 7.3% (4.8-9.7%) and an OR (95% CIs) of 1.45 (1.17-1.79). The subgroups analyses based on specific characteristics of included studies confirmed the association between depression and overdose.
   Conclusions: Depressive disorders seem to be important factors associated to the risk of-non-fatal overdose. Longitudinal studies might appropriately clarify causal inference issues. Future research should address the role of depressive disorders as predictors of subsequent non-fatal overdoses. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVES: Self-harm is an important public health issue among youth, including as a major risk factor for suicide (a leading cause of death in this age group). This study used population-based emergency department data to describe clinical and demographic characteristics of emergency department presentations for self-harm among youth (12-17 year-olds) in the province of Ontario, Canada.
   METHODS: Administrative data capturing every emergency department visit in Ontario between April 1, 2002 and March 31, 2009 were used to identify and describe self-harm presentations.
   RESULTS: Over the 7-year period between 2002/03 and 2008/09, there were 16,835 self-harm presentations by 12,907 youth. Two thirds of self-harm presentations were self-poisonings (almost always with medicinal agents), followed by self-cutting, which accounted for about one quarter. Incidence rates were higher in girls than boys, increased with age, were inversely related to neighbourhood income and were highest in rural areas. Self-harm accounted for about 1 in 100 emergency department presentations by youth, but also a disproportionate number of presentations triaged as high acuity or admitted to hospital (about 1 in 20).
   CONCLUSION: Self-harm is an important public health issue, requiring a comprehensive approach to prevention. Ontario has useful data with which to study emergency department presentations for self-harm, and the similarities between self-harm presentations among Ontario youth and those reported from the United States and Europe suggest generalizability of results between populations. Further research is needed to address the reasons for the geographic differences in frequency of self-harm.

AB Objective: Food insufficiency, defined by the experience of hunger, is known to be prevalent and a source of health-related harm among-street involved youth, but little is known about its relationship with depression in this population. Therefore, we sought to assess the association between food insufficiency and symptoms of depression among a cohort of street-involved youth.
   Design: Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between food insufficiency, defined as being hungry but not having enough money to buy food, and depression as measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale.
   Setting: Data from April 2006 to November 2013 were derived from the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS), a prospective cohort of street-involved youth who use illicit drugs in Vancouver, Canada.
   Subjects: There were 1066 street-involved youth enrolled in the study, including 340 (31-9%) females.
   Results: Of 1066 youth enrolled in the study, 724 (67.9 %) reported some food insufficiency and 565 (53.0 %) met criteria for depression. Compared with youth who did not report food insufficiency, those who reported often experiencing food insufficiency had a higher likelihood of reporting depression (adjusted OR= 2.52; 95% CI 1.74, 3.67), as did those who reported sometimes experiencing food insufficiency (adjusted OR =1.99; 95% CI 1.47, 2.70).
   Conclusions: Food insufficiency was prevalent and associated in a dose-dependent trend with symptoms of depression among street-involved youth in our setting. Findings highlight the need to address the nutritional and mental health needs of youth and identify pathways by which food insufficiency may contribute to depression among vulnerable populations.

AB Compared to the general population, military personnel are particularly vulnerable to developing gambling problems. The present study examined the presentation of gambling-including gambling frequency, personal thoughts on reducing gambling and recommendations from others to reduce gambling-across these populations. Additionally, the study measured the association between gambling and various psychosocial risk and protective factors-including psychological distress, suicidal ideation, external encouragement to reduce substance use, days out of role, personal wellbeing, resilience, social support and intimate bonds. Data was extracted from the Global Health & Wellbeing Survey, an online self-report survey conducted in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. Of the 10,765 eligible respondents, 394 were military veterans and 337 were active military personnel. Consistent with previous research, a higher proportion of gambling behaviours were observed in both current and ex-serving military samples, compared to the general population. To varying degrees, significant associations were found between the different gambling items and all psychosocial risk and protective factors in the general population sample. However, the military sample yielded only one significant association between gambling frequency and the protective factor 'resilience'. A post hoc stepwise linear regression analysis demonstrated the possible mediating role resilience plays between gambling frequency and other psychosocial risk (psychological distress, and suicidal thoughts and behaviour) and protective factors (personal wellbeing) for the military sample. Given the findings, it is recommended that routine screening tools identifying problem gambling are used within the military, and subsequent resilience focused interventions are offered to at risk personnel.

AB Background. Many studies have concluded that cannabis use disorder (CUD) negatively influences outcomes in first-episode psychosis (FEP). However, few have taken into account the impact of concurrent misuse of other substances.
   Methods. This 2-year, prospective, longitudinal study of FEP patients, aged between 18 and 30 years, admitted to early intervention programs in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, examined the specific influence of different substance use disorders (SUD) (alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines) on service utilization, symptomatic and functional outcomes in FEP.
   Results. Drugs and alcohol were associated with lower functioning, but drugs had a greater negative impact on most measures at 2-year follow-up. Half of CUD patients and more than 65% of cocaine or amphetamine abusers presented polysubstance use disorder (poly-SUD). The only group that deteriorated from years 1 to 2 (symptoms and functioning) were patients with persistent CUD alone. Outcome was worse in CUD than in the no-SUD group at 2 years. Cocaine, amphetamines and poly-SUD were associated with worse symptomatic and functional outcomes from the 1st year of treatment, persisting over time with higher service utilization (hospitalization).
   Conclusion. The negative impact attributed to CUD in previous studies could be partly attributed to methodological flaws, like including polysubstance abusers among cannabis misusers. However, our investigation confirmed the negative effect of CUD on outcome. Attention should be paid to persistent cannabis misusers, since their condition seems to worsen over time, and to cocaine and amphetamine misusers, in view of their poorer outcome early during follow-up and high service utilization.

AB Numerous studies demonstrate that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) children and youth are likely to experience abuse by peers, parents, and other adults and that these experiences correlate with a host of mental health problems. However, there is little understanding of the experiences of LGBT children and youth living in countries where social and legal protections for sexual and gender minorities are limited or nonexistent. This qualitative study used thematic analysis to explore the child and adolescent abuse experiences and their impact on the pre-migration mental health of LGBT forced migrants. We analyzed 26 interviews with individuals who obtained refugee or asylee status in the United States or Canada on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Participants originated from countries in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. Analysis revealed the following themes: abuse by parents and caregivers, abuse by peers and school personnel, having nowhere to turn, and dealing with psychological distress. Findings indicate that participants experienced severe verbal, physical, and sexual abuse throughout childhood and adolescence and that this abuse occurred at home, in school, and in the community. Furthermore, there were no resources or sources of protection available to them. Participants linked their abuse to subjective experiences of depression, anxiety, and traumatic stress, as well as suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. We conclude with implications for refugee adjudication practices, mental health care, and international policy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   SUICIDE
AB Objective: Although widely used in the general population, sleeping pills and minor tranquilizers, also known as antianxiety agents, have been associated with undesirable outcomes. Reports about the association of these drugs with an elevated mortality rate are inconsistent and controversial. This study was designed to assess the mortality hazard associated with anxiolytic and hypnotic drug use in the National Population Health Survey in Canada. It was hypothesized that anxiolytic and hypnotic drug use would be associated with an elevated mortality hazard.
   Method: A population-based sample of 14 117 people aged 18 to 102 years participated in a longitudinal panel survey, with data collected every second year from 1994 to 2007. The primary outcome measures reported in this study are self-report use of anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs, and death.
   Results: For respondents who reported anxiolytic or hypnotic drug use in the past month the odds of mortality were 3.22 times more (95% CI 2.70 to 3.84) than for those who did not use anxiolytic or hypnotic drugs in the past month. After controlling for confounding sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health factors (including depression), the odds ratio was reduced to 1.36 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.70) but remained significant.
   Conclusion: Sedative drug use is associated with a small but significant increase in mortality risk. Further research is required to confirm the mechanisms by which sedative drug use increases mortality risk. Where possible, physicians should systematically consider possibilities for nonpharmacological treatment of sleep disturbances and anxiety.

AB Background: The US immigrant population has grown considerably in the last three decades, from 9.6 million in 1970 to 32.5 million in 2002. However, this unprecedented population rise has not been accompanied by increased immigrant health monitoring. In this study, we examined the extent to which US- and foreign-born blacks, whites, Asians, and Hispanics differ in their health, life expectancy, and mortality patterns across the life course.
   Methods: We used National Vital Statistics System (1986-2000) and National Health Interview Survey (1992-1995) data to examine nativity differentials in health outcomes. Logistic regression and age-adjusted death rates were used to examine differentials.
   Results: Male and female immigrants had, respectively, 3.4 and 2.5 years longer life expectancy than the US-born. Compared to their US-born counterparts, black immigrant men and women had, respectively, 9.4 and 7.8 years longer life expectancy, but Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino immigrants had lower life expectancy. Most immigrant groups had lower risks of infant mortality and low birthweight than the US-born. Consistent with the acculturation hypothesis, immigrants' risks of disability and chronic disease morbidity increased with increasing length of residence. Cancer and other chronic disease mortality patterns for immigrants and natives varied considerably, with Asian Immigrants experiencing substantially higher stomach, liver and cervical cancer mortality than the US-born. Immigrants, however, had significantly lower mortality from lung, colorectal, breast, prostate and esophageal cancer, cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis, diabetes, respiratory diseases, HIV/AIDS, and suicide.
   Interpretation: Migration selectivity, social support, socio-economic, and behavioural characteristics may account for health differentials between immigrants and the US-born.

ID POLITICS; SUICIDE; DEATH; HPV
AB In this paper I test the methodological potential of a set of six questions, called the "What's the Problem Represented to be?," or WPR approach, borrowed from the field of discursive policy analysis (Bacchi, 2012a) for doing critical health communication (CHC) research. WPR is generative for critical health researchers because it shares the goal of challenging implicit and explicit causality and correlation within discourse. I apply these questions to examine the case of legalized medical assistance in dying (MAiD) in Canada, arguing that their simplicity and capaciousness facilitate critical responses to care disparities. This particular case is edifying for CHC researchers, because ideals of good living, "dignified" death, and the role of medicine are all crystallized within legal, media, and medical discourse on assisted dying. Debating what death can or should look like depends on a clearer understanding of how the logics of embodied difference (especially ability, race, and gender) are always already stacking the odds against equal political participation in, and access to health. The WPR approach flips the "proper objects" of health-centered critical research, beginning by scrutinizing proposed solutions in order to rethink the problems implicit therein. Asking such questions as "How has this representation of the "problem" come about?," "What effects are produced by this representation of the 'problem'?" and "How has it been (or could it be) questioned, disrupted and replaced?" productively situates the researcher between the discursive practices governing health and health care praxis itself. Ultimately, I argue that the WPR method encapsulates some of the best critical perspectives from the corpus of CHC research praxis, making it a helpful tool for advancing health communication research.

AB Highly publicized incidents of in-custody deaths have drawn attention to the well-being of individuals who are held in custodial settings and have contributed to questions surrounding the role played by mental illness and substance use. The data for this descriptive study consist of administrative records from the Office of the Chief Coroner of Ontario. Section 10(4) jury verdicts filed from January 1, 1996 through December 31, 2010 were drawn for analysis. The final sample includes 478 males who died while in custody. Logistic and multinomial regressions were conducted to assess how a history of mental illness and substance use is related to deaths in custody and how those deaths vary across custodial jurisdictions. Approximately half of all deaths in custody occurred among those with a history of mental illness or substance use and those deaths disproportionately occurred in local police or provincial custody, compared to those held in federal custody. Further, the joint effects of a co-occurring history of mental illness and substance use were found to be statistically significant with the strongest effects observed in local police custody. The results from this study underscore concerns surrounding the well-being of individuals with a history of mental illness or substance use and who come into contact with the criminal justice system. With more offenders presenting with complex mental-health and substance-use problems, the implications for local police become apparent in the context of developing policies and practices directed towards preventing deaths.

AB The results of the study of sex-age features of the attitude of Russians towards death are presented. The attitude toward death was assessed on the basis of measuring five different attitudes identified by the Canadian psychologist P.T. Wong with colleagues, using the questionnaire DAP-R (Fear of death, Avoidance of the theme of death, Neutral acceptance of death, Approach acceptance of death, Escape acceptance of death). The study was conducted with the participation of 352 people (M = 36.6 years, SD = 19.5, 58.5% of women), divided into four age groups (12-17 years, 18-29 years, 30-59 years, 60-83 years). Sex-age differences in the preference for different attitudes toward death were found. It is shown that, regardless of age, the attitudes for an approach acceptance of death is more pronounced in women than in men. For adolescents, the most common attitude is the escape acceptance of death, and in adults, as their age increases, the neutral acceptance of death begins to predominate. In all age groups, except for the elderly, there was also a mixed attitude towards death, which manifested itself in the form of links between negative attitudes and positive ones. Comparison of the data obtained in the Russian sample with the results of foreign studies conducted in Canada and Hong Kong demonstrated the specific features of Russian culture in attitudes toward death. The findings indicate the need for a broader and more systematic study of attitudes toward death in adolescence in order to study the causes of teen suicides.

AB Background: Mental disorders in childhood have a considerable health and societal impact but the associated negative consequences may be ameliorated through early identification of risk and protective factors that can guide health promoting and preventive interventions. The objective of this study was to inform health policy and practice through identification of demographic, familial and environmental factors associated with emotional or behavioural problems in middle childhood, and the predictors of resilience in the presence of identified risk factors.
   Methods: A cohort of 706 mothers followed from early pregnancy was surveyed at six to eight years post-partum by a mail-out questionnaire, which included questions on demographics, children's health, development, activities, media and technology, family, friends, community, school life, and mother's health.
   Results: Although most children do well in middle childhood, of 450 respondents (64% response rate), 29.5% and 25.6% of children were found to have internalising and externalising behaviour problem scores in the lowest quintile on the NSCLY Child Behaviour Scales. Independent predictors for problem behaviours identified through multivariable logistic regression modelling included being male, demographic risk, maternal mental health risk, poor parenting interactions, and low parenting morale. Among children at high risk for behaviour problems, protective factors included high maternal and child self-esteem, good maternal emotional health, adequate social support, good academic performance, and adequate quality parenting time.
   Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that several individual and social resilience factors can counter the influence of early adversities on the likelihood of developing problem behaviours in middle childhood, thus informing enhanced public health interventions for this understudied life course phase.

AB Background Considerations of dignity are often raised in reference to the care of dying patients. However, little research that addresses this issue has been done. Our aim was to identify the extent to which dying patients perceive they are able to maintain a sense of dignity, and to ascertain how demographic and disease-specific variables relate to the issue of dignity in these individuals.
   Methods We did a cross-sectional study of a cohort of terminally ill patients with cancer, who had a life expectancy of less than 6 months. We enrolled 213 patients from two palliative care units in Winnipeg, Canada, and asked them to rate their sense of dignity. Our main outcome measures included: a 7-point sense of dignity item; the symptom distress scale; the McGill pain questionnaire; the index of independence in activities of daily living (IADL); a quality of life scale; a brief battery of self-report measures, including screening for desire for death, anxiety, hopelessness, and will to live; burden to others; and requirement for social support.
   Findings 16 of 213 patients (7.5%; 95% Cl 4-11) indicated that loss of dignity was a great concern. These patients were far more than likely than the rest of the cohort to report psychological distress and symptom distress, heightened dependency needs, and loss of will to live.
   Interpretation Loss of dignity is closely associated with certain types of distress often seen among the terminally ill. Preservation of dignity should be an overall aim of treatment and care in patients who are nearing death.

AB Background: Community pharmacists frequently encounter patients at risk of medication misuse, diversion, and intentional overdose. However, few studies have examined the perspective of the pharmacist on the identification and management of these patients. Objective: To understand the perspective of community pharmacists on the dispensing of select medications commonly associated with misuse, diversion, and overdose. Methods: An online survey was disseminated by electronic mail to community pharmacists listed in the College of Pharmacists of Manitoba directory. The survey was open from July to September 2014. Descriptive statistics were used to describe demographic information of the pharmacist and practice setting, and pharmacists' perceptions on the dispensing of select medications. Results: A total of 82 community pharmacists completed the survey. Most pharmacists considered a one-month supply appropriate for a psychotropic agent; but a 7-10 day-supply was considered appropriate for an opioid for acute pain. Factors that aid pharmacist decisions on providing select medications to patients include familiarity with the patient, ease of access to medical history information, and ease of access to the prescribing physician. Only 10.3%, 16.2%, and 32.4% felt they have received adequate training on the management of patients at risk for suicide, drug diversion, and medication misuse, respectively. Conclusion: Findings from this study demonstrated a need for improved systems for managing patients at risk for medication misuse, diversion, and overdose. Strategies that warrant further attention for limiting the means of medication misuse include increased access to electronic medical records and providing additional continuing education support for community pharmacists.

AB Background: To inform public health suicide prevention and mental health promotion campaigns, this study will carry out gender-specific analyses to ascertain the determinants of suicidal ideation or death thoughts in a large representative sample of community dwelling older adults.
   Methods: Data used in this study were from the ESA survey (Enquete sur la Sante des Aines - Survey on the Health of the Elderly) on a large representative sample of community dwelling older adults (n = 2,494). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to study the association between suicidal ideation, mental health service, and antidepressant use and a number of clinical and socio-demographic factors.
   Results: The prevalence of suicidal ideation reached 6.3%. The findings of this study show that the presence of suicidal ideation in females is associated with younger age, single or widowed status, the reporting of daily life stressors, and chronic conditions as well as the presence of major or minor depression in the past year. In males, suicidal ideation is associated with older age, single or widowed status, and depression. Furthermore, suicidal ideation is significantly associated with antidepressant use in females but not males and this after controlling for a number of clinical factors.
   Conclusion: Although no gender differences are observed between suicidal ideation and mental health service use, females with suicidal ideation are more likely to be dispensed antidepressants than males with suicidal ideation. Future research should focus on gender-specific determinants of antidepressant and mental health service use associated with suicidal ideation.

TI Factors predicting coroners' decisions to hold discretionary inquests
SO CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID CARE
AB Coroners in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and other countries in the Commonwealth hold inquests into deaths in two situations. Mandatory inquests are held when statutory rules dictate they must be; discretionary inquests are held based on the decisions of individual coroners. Little is known as to how and why coroners select particular deaths for discretionary inquests.
   Methods: We analyzed the deaths investigated by Australian coroners for a period of seven and one-half years in five jurisdictions. We classified inquests as mandatory or discretionary. After excluding mandatory inquests, we used logistic regression analysis to identify the factors associated with coroners' decisions to hold discretionary inquests.
   Results: Of 20 379 reported deaths due to external causes, 1252 (6.1%) proceeded to inquest. Of these inquests, 490 (39.1%) were mandatory and 696 (55.6%) were discretionary. In unadjusted analyses, the rates of discretionary inquests varied widely in terms of age of the decedent and cause of death. In adjusted analyses, the odds of discretionary inquests declined with the age of the decedent; the odds were highest for children (odds ratio [OR] 2.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.54-3.06) and lowest for people aged 65 years and older (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.28-0.51). Using poisoning as a reference cause of death, the odds of discretionary inquests were highest for fatal complications of medical care (OR 12.83, 95% CI 8.65-19.04) and lowest for suicides (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.30-0.65).
   Interpretation: Deaths that coroners choose to take to inquest differ systematically from those they do not. Although this vetting pro cess is invisible, it may influence the public's understanding of safety risks, fatal injury and death.

AB Despite use of the term dignity in arguments for and against a patient's self-governance in matters pertaining to death, there is little empirical research on how this term has been used by patients who are nearing death. The objective of this study was to determine how dying patients understand and define the term dignity in order to develop a model of dignity in the terminally ill. A semi-structured interview was designed to explore how patients cope with their advanced cancer and to detail their perceptions of dignity. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. A consecutive sample of 50 consenting patients with advanced terminal cancer were recruited over a 15-month period of time from an urban extended care hospital housing a specialized unit for palliative care. This unit provides both inpatient services, and coordinates end-of-life care community based programming. Data were analysed using latent content analysis and constant comparison techniques. Four members of the research team independently coded the transcribed data, to develop conceptually meaningful categories of responses. Operational definitions were written for major categories, themes and sub-themes. Three major categories emerged from the qualitative analysis, including illness-related concerns; dignity conserving repertoire, and social dignity inventory. These broad categories and their carefully defined themes and sub-themes form the foundation for an emerging model of dignity amongst the dying. The concept of dignity and the dignity model offer a way of understanding how patients face advancing terminal illness. This will serve to promote dignity and the quality of life of patients nearing death. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective. In this study we examined firearm storage patterns and their associations in a diverse sample of families who attended pediatric practices from both rural and nonrural areas across the United States.
   Methods. Parents who brought their children who were aged 2 to 11 years (N = 3745) to 96 Pediatric Research in Office Settings practices from 45 states, Canada, and Puerto Rico participated in an office-based survey before a well-child examination. The survey measured demographic variables; family history of guns in the home; and firearm types, storage behaviors, and ownership.
   Results. Twenty-three percent of families reported firearm ownership. The majority (60%) of respondents reported making firearm storage decisions. Only one third of firearm owners reported safe firearm storage. Gun type owned was associated with storage habits, with long-gun owners storing their gun in places other than locked cabinets but with ammunition separate from guns and handgun users more likely to store guns loaded and to use gun locks. In a multivariate analysis, not being raised with a firearm was associated with safe storage behaviors. Families who had children aged 2 to 5 years and owned long guns were more likely to store their guns safely than families with older children.
   Conclusions. Few families reported safe firearm storage. Storage patterns are most influenced by firearm type(s) owned, family socialization with guns, and the age of the child. Primary care providers need to understand better not only whether firearms are in the home but also which types are present and whether parents were raised in homes with guns.

AB This article compares 249 post mortem case reports that were positive for fentanyl/norfentanyl. All the cases were submitted to, and analyzed by, the toxicology department of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. This study highlights the varied distribution of fentanyl in the body after death as a result of misadventure, i.e., these are accidental drug overdose cases as opposed to a study of analytical data resulting from fentanyl use/administration in a clinical environment and/or death as a result of suicide.
   Post mortem samples were collected from more than one anatomical site and analyzed for fentanyl and norfentanyl using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Ante-mortem samples were available in 4 of these cases and were also analyzed.
   Post mortem mean blood fentanyl concentrations were found to be 13.2 ng/mL (femoral), 19.1 ng/mL (iliac) and 42.0 ng/mL (subclavian). For norfentanyl the mean concentrations were 4.6 ng/mL (femoral), 4.6 ng/mL (iliac) and 7.4 ng/mL (subclavian). Mean vitreous fentanyl and norfentanyl concentrations were 10.8 ng/mL and 3.5 ng/mL respectively. Mean liver fentanyl and norfentanyl concentrations were found to be 185.5 ng/g and 18.8 ng/g respectively.
   This study demonstrates the importance of multi-site sample collection and subsequent analysis for a thorough post mortem toxicological investigation. The study also highlights the risks and limitations associated with the interpretation of post mortem analytical results concerning fentanyl. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Increasing provision of treatment should theoretically lead to a decreased burden of major depressive episodes (MDE) in the population. However, there is no evidence yet that this has occurred. Among possible explanations are that: (1) treatment may not be sufficiently accessible, effective or effectively delivered to make a difference at the population level or (2) treatment benefits such as diminished episode duration may be offset by other trends such as increasing episode incidence, or vice versa.
   Methods: MDE prevalence has been assessed in a series of national surveys and in a single national longitudinal study in Canada. These studies included a short form version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview module for major depression. Indicators of incidence and episode duration of MDE were estimated. Meta-regression methods were used to examine trends over time.
   Results: No evidence of increasing incidence nor of diminishing duration of MDE was found. The analysis failed to uncover evidence that the epidemiology of this condition has been changing.
   Limitations: Most studies included in this analysis used an abbreviated interview for MDE which may lack sensitivity and/or specificity. These studies could not address potential benefits of treatment on prevention of suicide. Some potentially offsetting effects could not be assessed, e.g. economic or societal changes.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that more effective efforts to prevent MDE, or to improve the volume or quality of treatment, are necessary to reduced burden of MDE in the population. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this chapter, we explore the issue of assisted dying for individuals with dementia at the nexus of ethics and law. We set out the basic medical realities of dementia and the available data about the desire for the option of assisted dying in the face of dementia. We then describe law and practice with respect to voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide in jurisdictions that permit at least some assisted dying. We conclude that, because of the peculiar ways in which some of the features of dementia interact with specific legislative provisions, less access to assisted dying for persons with dementia can be realized through the legislation than might have been intended or expected. We then describe draft assisted dying legislation that is before the federal Parliament of Canada. We conclude that, because of the peculiar ways in which some of the features of dementia interact with specific legislative provisions, more access to assisted dying for persons with dementia would be realized, if the legislation was passed as drafted, than might be intended or expected. This exercise reveals that very careful attention needs to be paid to the features of dementia if drafting assisted dying legislation in order to actually achieve the desired law reform effect (whatever that might be). The interplay of common ethical rationales for permitting assisted dying (e.g., autonomy and alleviation of suffering) with common features of dementia (e.g., loss of competence before the terminal phase of the illness, loss of the capacity to communicate before the loss of the capacity to suffer) raises challenges for translating one's ethical position on assisted dying for individuals with dementia into law.

AB Background: Depression is a common comorbid condition in patients with Tourette's disorder. While risperidone is not usually known to induce dysphoria or depression in patients treated for other psychiatric disorders, previous short-term 4- to 12-week trials of risperidone for Tourette's disorder have reported a 2.6% to 30.8% incidence of depression.
   Method: A retrospective study was carried out in 58 adult and adolescent patients with Tourette's disorder (Tourette Syndrome Classification Study Group diagnosis) who received risperidone between Jan. 1, 1993, and Dec. 31 2000, at the Allan Memorial Institute, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Charts of all patients were examined for evidence of, and risk factors for, DSM-IV-defined major depressive disorder (MDD) or dysphoria.
   Results: Seventeen (29.3%) of 58 patients developed MDD, including 1 patient who later committed suicide and 13 patients (22.4%) who became dysphoric while taking risperidone. Nine of the 17 patients who developed MDD were relapses, i.e., patients with a history of depression prior to taking risperidone, while the remainder were new cases, i.e., patients with no previous history of depression. A positive personal history of MDD was the only factor to significantly (p < .001) predict the development of depression while taking risperidone. Seventy percent of those who developed MDD or dysphoria and discontinued risperidone did so specifically as a result of this adverse event.
   Conclusion: MDD and dysphoria commonly occurred in this cohort of adult and adolescent Tourette's disorder patients treated with risperidone, particularly in patients with a previous history of depression. Depression and dysphoria were frequent reasons for risperidone discontinuation.

AB Background and ObjectivesAlcohol is a major contributor to premature disability and death among youth, often due to physical trauma, violence, and suicide. The purpose of this study was to longitudinally examine the association between hazardous alcohol use and experiences of violence among a cohort of street-involved youth.
   MethodsData were derived from the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS), a prospective cohort of street-involved youth who use illicit substances in Vancouver, Canada. The outcome of interest was hazardous alcohol use defined by the US National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism as >14 drinks/week or >5 drinks on one occasion for men, and >7 drinks/week or >4 drinks on one occasion for women. We used Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) analyses to examine factors independently associated with hazardous alcohol use.
   ResultsBetween 2005 and 2014, 1,149 drug-using youth were recruited and 423 (36.8%) reported hazardous alcohol use in the previous 6 months at study baseline. In multivariable GEE analyses, intimate partner violence (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]=1.53, 95% Confidence Interval [95%CI]=1.12-2.10), and non-partner physical assault (AOR=1.39, 95%CI=1.21-1.59) were independently associated with hazardous alcohol use after adjusting for multiple potential confounders.
   Discussion and ConclusionsA considerable proportion of youth in this setting reported hazardous alcohol use, which was independently associated with experiencing recent intimate and non-partner violence.
   Scientific SignificanceCombined interventions for violence and hazardous alcohol use should be integrated into service provision programs for street-involved youth. (Am J Addict 2017;26:852-858)

AB Objectives:
   To explore whether chronic pain (CP) patients who report suicidal ideation (SI) present a distinctive profile with regard to their sociodemographic characteristics, physical health, psychological well-being, cognitions, and use of antidepressants, illicit drugs, and alcohol for pain relief.
   Methods:
   Eighty-eight CP patients completed self-administered questionnaires during their intake assessment at 3 pain clinics located in the province of Quebec (Canada). Patients reporting active or passive SI on the Beck Depression Inventory were compared with patients reporting no SI. Between-group univariate analyses were performed using profile variables to compare patients with and without SI. Significant variables were then entered into multiple logistic regression analyses to identify significant independent predictors of SI.
   Results:
   Twenty-four percent of patients reported having had SI. Unemployed/disabled patients were 6 times more likely to report SI. Poor sleep quality was the only predictor of SI among the physical variables. For psychological well-being, depressive symptoms did not significantly predict SI. However, the poorer the patients perceived their mental health to be the more likely they were to report SI. Pain-related helplessness was the only predictor for SI among the cognitive variables. Patients who had used illicit drugs as a form of pain relief at any time since pain onset were 5 times more likely to report SI. Similar results were obtained for those who were on antidepressants.
   Discussion:
   Some factors associated with SI seem pain specific, whereas others are more generally associated with SI. Better identification and understanding of these factors is essential for the development of targeted suicide prevention programs for at-risk CP patients.

TI Dignity therapy: A novel psychotherapeutic intervention for patients
   near the end of life
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID QUALITY-OF-LIFE; PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; TERMINALLY ILL; MODEL;
   EUTHANASIA; CANCER
AB Purpose This study examined a novel intervention, dignity therapy, designed to address psychosocial and existential distress among terminally ill patients. Dignity therapy invites patients to discuss issues that matter most or that they would most want remembered. Sessions are transcribed and edited, with a returned final version that they can bequeath to a friend or family member. The objective of this study was to establish the feasibility of dignity therapy and determine its impact on various measures of psychosocial and existential distress.
   Patients and Methods Terminally ill inpatients and those receiving home-based palliative care services in Winnipeg, Canada, and Perth, Australia, were asked to complete pre- and postintervention measures of sense of dignity, depression, suffering, and hopelessness; sense of purpose, sense of meaning, desire for death, will to live, and suicidality; and a postintervention satisfaction survey.
   Results Ninety-one percent of participants reported being satisfied with dignity therapy; 76% reported a heightened sense of dignity; 68% reported an increased sense of purpose; 67% reported a heightened sense of meaning; 47% reported an increased will to live; and 81 % reported that it had been or would be of help to their family. Postintervention measures of suffering showed significant improvement (P =.023) and reduced depressive symptoms (P =.05). Finding dignity therapy helpful to their family correlated with life feeling more meaningful (r = 0.480; P =.000) and having a sense of purpose (r = 0.562; P =.000), accompanied by a lessened sense of suffering (r = 0.327; P =.001) and increased will to live (r = 0.387; P =.000).
   Conclusion Dignity therapy shows promise as a novel therapeutic intervention for suffering and distress at the end of life.

TI Mobile Health for First Nations Populations: Systematic Review
SO JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH
LA English
DT Review
DE mHealth; mobile health; indigenous; First Nations; aboriginal; humans;
   systematic review
ID FEASIBILITY; RESOURCES
AB Background: The ubiquitous presence and functionality of mobile devices offers the potential for mobile health (mHealth) to create equitable health opportunities. While mHealth is used among First Nations populations to respond to health challenges, the characteristics, uptake, and effectiveness of these interventions are unclear.
   Objective: This review aimed to identify the characteristics of mHealth interventions (eg, study locations, health topic, and modality) evaluated with First Nations populations and to summarize the outcomes reported for intervention use, user perspectives including cultural responsiveness, and clinical effectiveness. In addition, the review sought to identify the presence of First Nations expertise in the design and evaluation of mHealth interventions with First Nations populations.
   Methods: The methods of this systematic review were detailed in a registered protocol with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, CRD42019123276). Systematic searches of peer-reviewed, scientific papers were conducted across 7 databases in October 2018. Eligible studies had a primary focus on mHealth interventions with experimental or quasi-experimental design to respond to a health challenge with First Nations people from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Two authors independently screened records for eligibility and assessed risk of bias using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklists. Data were synthesized narratively owing to the mix of study designs, interventions, and outcomes. The review was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.
   Results: Searches yielded 1053 unique records, after review and screening, 13 studies (5 randomized controlled trials and 8 quasi-experimental designs) were included in the final analysis. Studies were conducted in Australia (n=9), the United States (n=2), and New Zealand (n=2). The most common health challenge addressed was mental health and suicide (n=5). Intervention modalities included text messaging (n=5), apps (n=4), multimedia messaging (n=1), tablet software (n=1), or a combination of short messaging service (SMS) and apps (n=1). Results showed mixed engagement with the intervention (n=3); favorable user perspectives, including acceptability and cultural appropriateness (n=6); and mixed outcomes for clinical effectiveness (n=10). A diverse range of risks of bias were identified, the most common of which included a lack of clarity about allocation and blinding protocols and group treatment for randomized controlled trials and a lack of control group and single outcome measures for quasi-experimental designs. First Nations expertise informed all mHealth studies, through authorship (n=8), affiliation with First Nations bodies (n=3), participatory study design (n=5), First Nations reference groups (n=5), or a combination of these.
   Conclusions: mHealth modalities, including SMS and apps, appear favorable for delivery of health interventions with First Nations populations, particularly in the area of mental health and suicide prevention. Importantly, First Nations expertise was strongly embedded within the studies, augmenting favorable use and user engagement. However, evidence of efficacy is limited.

AB Objective: To compile a comprehensive profile of the participants who had predictive testing from Huntington disease (HD) between 1994 and 2008 in Montreal, Canada.
   Method: This is a retrospective cohort study. The predictive testing protocol consisted of a telephone interview to give information about predictive testing and collect demographic data; a psychological assessment and counseling session; a session focused on medical and family history of HD; a session reserved for genetic counseling; a session where results were given to participants; and a follow-up telephone interview.
   Results: A total of 181 applicants requested presymptomatic testing. 135 applicants (77 women and 58 men) completed the protocol and received test results while 40 withdrew. Of the latter, 3 manifested symptoms of the disease and were referred to a neurologist or psychiatrist, and 3 had previously been tested by linkage analysis. Participants usually mentioned more than one reason for requesting predictive testing but the most frequent was to put an end to uncertainty concerning their risk of illness. The proportion of positive and negatives test results was 40% and 54.1% respectively, significantly different from the expected 50% (p<0.01). Prenatal testing was not frequently requested.
   Conclusion: All the participants expressed satisfaction regarding their decision to be tested. None to our knowledge had a catastrophic reaction (major depressive disorder or psychiatric hospitalization, declared suicide attempt or suicide). Our study highlights that preparation for receiving test results is a psychologically complex process for which appropriate support in a timely fashion is critical. We feel that a cautious and ethical case by case approach remains essential and that high standards of testing should be maintained because of the far reaching impact of test results.

AB Background: Careful characterization of the phenotype and genotype of Huntington disease (HD) can foster better understanding of the condition.
   Methods: We conducted a cohort study in the United States, Canada, and Australia of members of families affected by HD. We collected demographic and clinical data, conducted the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale and Mini-Mental State Examination, and determined Huntingtin trinucleotide CAG repeat length. We report primarily on cross-sectional baseline data from this recently completed prospective, longitudinal, observational study.
   Results: As of December 31, 2009, 2,318 individuals enrolled; of these, 1,985 (85.6%) were classified into six analysis groups. Three groups had expanded CAG alleles (36 repeats or more): individuals with clinically diagnosed HD [n = 930], and clinically unaffected first-degree relatives who had previously pursued [n = 248] or not pursued [n = 112] predictive DNA testing. Three groups lacked expanded alleles: first-degree relatives who had previously pursued [n = 41] or not pursued [n = 224] genetic testing, and spouses and caregivers [n = 430]. Baseline mean performance differed across groups in all motor, behavioral, cognitive, and functional measures (p<0.001). Clinically unaffected individuals with expanded alleles weighed less (76.0 vs. 79.6 kg; p = 0.01) and had lower cognitive scores (28.5 vs. 29.1 on the Mini Mental State Examination; p = 0.008) than individuals without expanded alleles. The frequency of "high normal" repeat lengths (27 to 35) was 2.5% and repeat lengths associated with reduced penetrance (36 to 39) was 2.7%.
   Conclusion: Baseline analysis of COHORT study participants revealed differences that emerge prior to clinical diagnosis. Longitudinal investigation of this cohort will further characterize the natural history of HD and genetic and biological modifiers.

TI Risk of firearm injuries among children and youth of immigrant families
SO CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL

   CANADA; HOMICIDE; SUICIDE; RATES; ADOLESCENTS
AB BACKGROUND: Firearm injuries contribute to substantial morbidity and mortality. The immigrant paradox suggests that, despite being more socially disadvantaged, immigrants are less likely than nonimmigrants to have poor outcomes. We tested the association of immigrant characteristics with firearm injuries among children and youth.
   METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study involving residents of Ontario aged 24 years and younger from 2008-2012 using health and administrative databases. We estimated rate ratios of unintentional and assault-related firearm injuries by immigrant status using Poisson regression models with Generalized Estimating Equations.
   RESULTS: We included 15 866 954 nonimmigrant and 4 551 291 immigrant person-years in our analysis. Nonimmigrant males had 1032 unintentional (12.4 per 100 000, 95% confidence interval [CI] 11.7-13.2) and 304 assault-related (3.6 per 100 000, 95% CI 3.2-4.0) firearm injuries. Immigrant males had 148 unintentional (7.2 per 100 000, 95% CI 6.1-8.5) and 113 assault-related (5.5 per 100 000, 95% CI 4.5-6.6) firearm injuries. Compared with nonimmigrants, immigrants had a lower rate of unintentional firearm injury (adjusted rate ratio 0.5, 95% CI 0.4-0.6) but a similar rate of assault-related firearm injury. Among immigrants, refugees had a 43% higher risk of assault-related firearm injury compared with nonrefugees (adjusted rate ratio 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-2.0). Immigrants from Central America and Africa accounted for 68% of immigrants with assault-related firearm injuries.
   INTERPRETATION: Compared with nonimmigrants, immigrant children and youth had a lower risk of unintentional firearm injury, although the risk of assault-related firearm injury was higher among refugees and immigrants from Central America and Africa. The results suggest that prevention strategies for firearm safety should target nonimmigrant youth as well as these newly identified high-risk immigrant populations.

AB Introduction: Although people who inject drugs (IOU) remain at a high risk of accidental overdose, interventions that address overdose remain limited. Accordingly there is a continuing need to identify psychological and social factors that shape overdose risk. Despite being reported frequently among IDU, childhood trauma has received little attention as a potential risk factor for overdose. This study aims to evaluate relationships between non-fatal overdose and five forms of childhood maltreatment among a cohort of IDU in Vancouver, Canada.
   Methods: Data was obtained from two prospective cohorts of IDU between December 2005 and May 2013. Multivariate generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to explore relationships between five forms of childhood trauma and non-fatal overdose, adjusting for potential confounders.
   Results: During the study period, 1697 IDU, including 552 (32.5%) women, were followed up. At baseline, 1136 (67.0%) participants reported at least one form of childhood trauma, while 4-9% reported a non-fatal overdose at each semi-annual follow-up. In multivariate analyses, physical [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.36, 95% confidence interval (Cl): 1.08-1.71], sexual (AOR: 1.48, Cl: 1.17-1.87), and emotional abuse (AOR: 1.54, Cl: 1.22-1.93) and physical neglect (AOR: 128, Cl: 1.01-1.62) were independently associated with non-fatal overdose (all p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Childhood trauma was common among participants, and reporting an experience of trauma was positively associated with non-fatal overdose. These findings highlight the need to provide intensive overdose prevention to trauma survivors and to incorporate screening for childhood trauma into health and social programs tailored to IOU.

AB Mamow-Sha-way-gi-kay-win: North-South Partnership for Children represents a coalition of individuals and organizations from southern Ontario who have partnered with First Nations Chiefs, community leaders, Elders, youth and community members from 30 remote northern communities. The collective goal of the Partnership is to learn from one another while addressing the needs of First Nations communities. Southern partners are dedicated to following the direction of northern First Nations in identifying issues, priorities and potential solutions. These issues stem from an imposed colonial history and loss of land, culture, and identity; and, from the abuse and trauma suffered by many survivors of the residential school system. First Nations have clear aspirations and plans for the rebuilding of their communities. This deep sense of hope, despite the adversities, motivates the work of Mamow Sha-way-gi-kay-win. The Partnership exemplifies the relationships needed to improve the conditions of First Nations communities. Change will only be effected through relationships that are enduring, trusting and respectful. Mamow Sha-way-gi-kay-win models a healing and enduring connection between First Nations and non-aboriginal peoples one that facilitates resource exchange and development. This paper draws on the experiences of Mamow Sha-way-gi-kay-win in the development of a unique approach to improving the life conditions of Northern First Nations people in Ontario. This community assessment and mobilization process uses the social determinants of health in the context of northern First Nations realities as a framework for understanding community wellness. Children's mental health, and specifically youth suicide, is viewed as a product of various interactions within and among these factors. It is proposed that through Mamow Ki-ken-da-ma-win, meaningful immediate and long-term outcomes to urgent conditions and challenges can be achieved.

AB Background: The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) conducted a revision of the 2009 guidelines by updating the evidence and recommendations. The scope of the 2016 guidelines remains the management of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults, with a target audience of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals.
   Methods: Using the question-answer format, we conducted a systematic literature search focusing on systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Evidence was graded using CANMAT-defined criteria for level of evidence. Recommendations for lines of treatment were based on the quality of evidence and clinical expert consensus. This section is the first of six guidelines articles.
   Results: In Canada, the annual and lifetime prevalence of MDD was 4.7% and 11.3%, respectively. MDD represents the second leading cause of global disability, with high occupational and economic impact mainly attributable to indirect costs. DSM-5 criteria for depressive disorders remain relatively unchanged, but other clinical dimensions (sleep, cognition, physical symptoms) may have implications for depression management. e-Mental health is increasingly used to support clinical and self-management of MDD. In the 2-phase (acute and maintenance) treatment model, specific goals address symptom remission, functional recovery, improved quality of life, and prevention of recurrence.
   Conclusions: The burden attributed to MDD remains high, whether from individual distress, functional and relationship impairment, reduced quality of life, or societal economic cost. Applying core principles of care, including comprehensive assessment, therapeutic alliance, support of self-management, evidence-informed treatment, and measurement-based care, will optimize clinical, quality of life, and functional outcomes in MDD.

AB Objective: The authors sought to document, in adult and pediatric patient populations, the development, descriptive statistics, and test-retest reliability of cross-cutting symptom measures proposed for inclusion in DSM-5.
   Method: Data were collected as part of the multisite DSM-5 Field Trials in large academic settings. There were seven sites focusing on adult patients and four sites focusing on child and adolescent patients. Cross-cutting symptom measures were self-completed by the patient or an informant before the test and the retest interviews, which were conducted from 4 hours to 2 weeks apart. Clinician-report measures were completed during or after the clinical diagnostic interviews. Informants included adult patients, child patients age 11 and older, parents of all child patients age 6 and older, and legal guardians for adult patients unable to self-complete the measures. Study patients were sampled in a stratified design, and sampling weights were used in data analyses. The mean scores and standard deviations were computed and pooled across adult and child sites. Re liabilities were reported as pooled intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) with 95% confidence intervals.
   Results: In adults, test-retest reliabilities of the cross-cutting symptom items generally were good to excellent. At the child and adolescent sites, parents were also reliable reporters of their children's symptoms, with few exceptions. Re liabilities were not as uniformly good for child respondents, and ICCs for several items fell into the questionable range in this age group. Clinicians rated psychosis with good reliability in adult patients but were less reliable in assessing clinical domains related to psychosis in children and to suicide in all age groups.
   Conclusions: These results show promising test-retest reliability results for this group of assessments, many of which are newly developed or have not been previously tested in psychiatric populations. (Am J Psychiatry 2013; 170:71-82)

AB The Assessment Checklist for Adolescents - ACA is a 105-item carer-report mental health rating scale, measuring behaviours, emotional states, traits, and manners of relating to others, as manifested by adolescents (ages 12 to 17) residing in various types of alternate care, as well as those adopted from care. The ACA was designed for population and clinical research with these young people, and for use as a clinical assessment measure. The ACA's content was largely derived from the Assessment Checklist for Children (ACC). Fifteen ACC items were modified to better reflect adolescent difficulties, and 25 additional items were derived using a combination of inductive and deductive strategies. Item and factor analyses were carried out on scores from a 136-item research instrument, obtained for 230 young people residing in long-term care (as part of the NSW Children in Care study). These data were supplemented by ACC scores obtained for 142 adolescents residing in treatment foster care in Ontario, Canada. A robust 7-factor model was identified among a core of 73 clinical item scores, accounting for 51% of score variance. Four of the factors replicate ACC clinical scales (non-reciprocal interpersonal behaviour; sexual behaviour problems; food maintenance behaviour; and suicide discourse), and three are unique to the ACA (social instability/behavioural dysregulation; emotional dysregulation/distorted social cognition; and dissociation/trauma symptoms). The ACA also contains two empirically-derived low self-esteem scales (low confidence; negative self-image) that are shared with the ACC. Initial data indicate that the ACA has good content, construct and criterion-related validity, as well as high internal reliability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose of ReviewPost-traumatic nightmares (PTN) are a common and enduring problem for individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other clinical presentations. PTN cause significant distress, are associated with large costs, and are an independent risk factor for suicide. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options for PTN exist. A previous review in this journal demonstrated that Prazosin, an alpha blocker, was a preferred pharmacological treatment for PTN and imagery rescripting therapy (IRT) was a preferred non-pharmacological treatment. Since that time, new and important research findings create the need for an updated review.
   Recent Findings Based on the results of a recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine, Prazosin has been downgraded by both the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) and the Veterans Health Administration/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) for PTN. In Canada, Nabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid, appears to be promising. Few recent studies have been published on non-pharmacological interventions for PTN; however, recent data is available with regard to using IRT on an inpatient setting, with German combat veterans, and through the use of virtual technology. Recent evidence supports the use of exposure, relaxation, and rescripting therapy (ERRT) with children and individuals with comorbid bipolar disorder and PTN.
   Summary Prazosin is no longer considered a first-line pharmacological intervention for PTN by AASM and VA/DoD. However, in the absence of a suitable alternative, it will likely remain the preferred option of prescribers. IRT and ERRT remain preferred non-pharmacological treatments of PTN. Combining cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) with IRT or ERRT may lead to improved outcomes.

   ADOLESCENTS; SAMPLE; SCHOOL
AB Background
   Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) is defined as the intentional direct injury of the own bodily tissue without suicidal intent. In areas with a Caucasian majority population, such as the USA, Canada and Europe, it is a rapidly increasing phenomenon, especially among young people. However, from a European point of view, little scientific information is found on NSSI in Latin America.
   Method
   A study of English, Spanish and Portuguese literature on NSSI in Latin America was conducted using electronic search engines. During a ten-month period of field work in Belo Horizonte, Brasil, a systematic search was conducted of the international press, the popular local press, television broadcasts, Internet sites and blogs. Semi-structured elite interviews were conducted of academic professionals and practitioners. Spontaneous conversations on NSSI took place with local inhabitants.
   Results
   Three reasons for the authors' prior lack of success in finding publications on NSSI in Latin America could be distinguished: the gap between academic professionals, practitioners and inhabitant population, the language of the publications, and the existing confusion in terminology and research traditions regarding NSSI.
   Conclusion
   NSSI has a high prevalence in Latin America, which can be Compared to that of the northern hemisphere. Although there are some differences in the ways of engaging in NSSI and in its functions, there are also important similarities. Scientific information on,NSSI in Latin America remains difficult to find for researchers in other parts of the world. Therefore we advocate a consensus in terminology and suggest that all publications would provide English key words and would be included in international scientific databases to ensure a world-wide dissemination. An alternative is-the construction of one centralized global Latin American database for Spanish and Portuguese publications.

AB Objective: Our primary objective was to evaluate demographic and causal factors of inhospital mortality for significant firearm-related injuries (i. e., those with an Injury Severity Score [ISS] > 12) in Canadian trauma centres. Methods: We analyzed data submitted to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) in the National Trauma Registry for all firearm-injured patients for fiscal years 1999 -2003. Univariate and bivariate adjusting for ISS and multivariate logistic regression were performed. Results: Men accounted for 94% of the 784 injured. In all patients, the percentages of self-inflicted, intentional, unintentional and unknown injuries were 27.8%, 60.3%, 6.1% and 5.7%, respectively. The inhospital fatality rate was 39.8%, with 83% of fatalities occurring on the first day. Two-thirds of patients were discharged home. Univariate and adjusted analysis found that ISS, first systolic blood pressure (BP), first systolic BP under 100, first Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age over 45 years, self-inflicted injury, intentional injury and injury at home significantly worsened the odds ratio of death in hospital and that police shooting was relatively beneficial. BP under 100, age over 45 years and a low GCS score had an adjusted odds ratio of death of 4.12, 1.99 and 0.64 per point increase, respectively. The multivariate model showed that ISS, BP under 100, first GCS score, sex and self-inflicted injury were significant in predicting inhospital death. Conclusion: A predominance of young men are injured intentionally with handguns in Canada, whereas older patients suffer self-inflicted injuries with long guns. The significant number of firearm deaths, largely in the first day, highlights the importance of preventative strategies and the need for rapid transport of patients to trauma centres for urgent care.

AB Objective This study aimed to longitudinally investigate whether ever having used a psychedelic drug can have a protective effect on incidence of suicidality among marginalised women.
   Design Longitudinal community-based cohort study.
   Setting Data were drawn from a prospective, communitybased cohort of marginalised women in Metro Vancouver, Canada.
   Participants 766 women completed the baseline questionnaire between January 2010 and August 2014. Participants who did not report suicidality at baseline and who completed at least one follow-up visit were included.
   Main outcome measure Extended Cox regression was used to model predictors of new suicidality (suicide ideation or attempts) over 54-month follow-up.
   Results Nearly half (46%; n=355) of participants reported prior suicidality and were thus excluded from the present analyses. Of 290 women eligible at baseline, 11% (n=31) reported recent suicidality during follow-up, with an incidence density of 4.42 per 100 person-years (95% CI 3.10 to 6.30). In multivariable analysis, reported lifetime psychedelic drug use was associated with a 60% reduced hazard for suicidality (adjusted HR (AHR) 0.40; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.94). Crystal methamphetamine use (AHR 3.25; 95% CI 1.47 to 7.21) and childhood abuse (AHR 3.54; 95% CI 1.49 to 8.40) remained independent predictors of suicidality.
   Conclusion The high rate of suicidality identified in this study is of major concern. Alongside emerging evidence on the potential of psychedelic-assisted therapy to treat some mental illness and addiction issues, our findings demonstrate that naturalistic psychedelic drug use is independently associated with reduced suicidality, while other illicit drug use and childhood trauma predispose women to suicidality. While observational, this study supports calls for further investigation of the therapeutic utility of psychedelic drugs in treating poor mental health and promoting mental wellness.

AB Background: Generally, patients with serious mental disorders (SMD) are frequent users of services who generate high care-related costs. Current reforms aim to increase service integration and primary care for improved patient care and health-care efficiency. This article identifies and compares variables associated with the use by patients with SMD of services offered by psychiatrists, case managers, and general practitioners (GPs). It also compares frequent and infrequent service use.
   Method: One hundred forty patients with SMD from five regions in Quebec, Canada, were interviewed on their use of services in the previous year. Patients were also required to complete a questionnaire on needs-assessment. In addition, data were collected from clinical records. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were conducted.
   Results: Most patients used services from psychiatrists and case managers, but no more than half consulted GPs. Most patients were followed at least by two professionals, chiefly psychiatrists and case managers. Care access, continuity of care, and total help received were the most important variables associated with the different types of professional consultation. These variables were also associated with frequent use of professional service, as compared with infrequent service use. In all, enabling factors rather than need factors were the core predictors of frequency of service utilisation by patients with SMD.
   Conclusion: This study reveals that health care system organisation and professional practice - rather than patient need profiles - are the core predictors of professional consultation by patients with SMD. The homogeneity of our study population, i.e. mainly users with schizophrenia, recently discharged from hospital, may partly account for these results. Our findings also underscored the limited involvement of GPs in this patient population's care. As comorbidity is often associated with serious mental disorders, closer follow-up by GPs is needed. Globally, more effort should be directed at increasing shared-care initiatives, which would enhance coordination among psychiatrists, GPs, and psychosocial teams (including case managers). Finally, there is a need to increase awareness among health care providers, especially GPs, of the level of care required by patients with disabling and serious mental disorders.

AB Background: The 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) is a short measure of non-specific psychological distress, which has been shown to be a sensitive screen for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for anxiety and mood disorders. The scale has yet to be validated as a measure of psychological distress for Aboriginal peoples in Canada.
   Data and methods: Using the 2012 Aboriginal Peoples Survey (APS), this study examined the psychometric properties of the K10 for First Nations people living off reserve, Metis, and Inuit aged 15 or older. The factor structure and internal consistency of the K10 were examined via confirmatory factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha, respectively. Descriptive statistics by sex, education, household income, and age group were provided for the scale. K10 construct validity was further assessed by examining associations with mental health variables in the 2012 APS: self-rated mental health, self-reported diagnosed mood and anxiety disorders, and self-reported suicidal ideation in the past 12 months.
   Results: A unidimensional "Distress" model with correlated errors was a good fit to the data. Cronbach's alpha values were satisfactory. K10 mean scores were positively skewed, with most respondents reporting few or no distress symptoms. Females and respondents with lower education and household income levels had significantly higher distress. Respondents aged 55 or older had significantly lower distress than their younger counterparts. K10 mean scores were significantly higher for respondents who reported poor mental health, a diagnosed mood disorder, a diagnosed anxiety disorder, or suicidal ideation in the past 12 months. Results were consistent across all three Aboriginal groups.
   Interpretation: Based on the 2012 APS, the total score of the K10 appears to be psychometrically sound for use as a broad measure of non-specific psychological distress for First Nations people living off reserve, Metis, and Inuit.

TI Prevalence of pathological gambling in the general population around

LA French
DT Article
DE Pathological gambling; Epidemiology; Anxiety; Depression; Impulsivity
ID ALCOHOL; COMORBIDITY; GAMBLERS
AB Introduction. - Pathological gambling is characterized in the DSM IV-TR as one of the disorders of impulse control. Problem gambling is also part of what is considered as behavioural addictions, the criteria of which have been defined by Goodman, with intrusive thoughts about the game, spending more and more to play, unable to control, reduce or stop gambling despite negative consequences, etc.
   Aim of the study. - There is no epidemiological study in France on the prevalence of pathological gambling. We wanted to study the prevalence of pathological gambling in a sample of 529 persons: 368 gamblers of Pari Mutuel Urbain and La Francaise des Jeux, and 161 persons in the general population. The study took place between January 2008 and June 2009.
   Methods. - As instruments, we used: the South Oaks Gambling Scale (SOGS) for screening of pathological gambling and the BIS-10 for impulsiveness' evaluation, the HAD scale to assess anxiety and depression and the ASRS for the evaluation of attention deficit disorder/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
   Results. - The rate of pathological gambling in the general population is 1.24% (this result is similar to those found in other places, such as in Quebec). In the general population, the rate of play at risk is of 5.59%. Among the population of gamblers, the rate for pathological gambling (JP) amounted to 9.23% and risk gambling to 10.86%. Men are overrepresented in the group of pathological gamblers (88.9%), also with consumption of alcohol and tobacco. Suicide attempts are more important than in the general population, but the difference was statistically significant. Depression and anxiety are particularly high, 40% of gamblers with an anxiety score significantly higher.
   Discussion. The results indicate rates close to those of other countries, such as Canada. It would be necessary to establish follow-up studies of populations and patients, as well as specific studies on people who frequent casinos, racetracks and internet gambling. The importance of the phenomenon is obvious, because almost 20% of players have a gambling problem or risk and these people do not consult despite their psychological problems, family, work, debts.

AB Objectives. Societies that foster socially Supportive networks produce healthier populations. Social support is a significant determinant of health among Canada's Inuit population: however, little is known about the characteristics that provide access to social Support among Inuit. This exploratory analysis describes how 4 types of social support (namely, positive social interaction. emotional support, tangible support and affection and intimacy) differ in relation to various determinants of health.
   Study design. Micro-data from the Arctic supplement of the 2001 Aboriginal Peoples Survey (n=26,290) was used.
   Methods. Cross-tabulations and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine levels (high/low) of the 4 types of social Support among the full Inuit sample (n=26,290) as they relate to age, vender, geographic re-ion, marital status. Aboriginal language use and participation in traditional harvesting activities.
   Results. Certain subsegments of the Inuit population were less likely to report high levels of Social Support, including men, the elderly (aged 55+) and the unmarried. Some Inuit-relevant determinants were also found to decrease the odds of reporting high levels of social Support, including being Unable to speak or Understand an Aboriginal language, not participating traditional harvesting activities and living in Nunavik.
   Conclusions. Research that frames Inuit health within the social determinants of health is in its relative infancy; however, evidence from the social epidemiological literature indicates that those with diminished access to social Support also suffer poorer health Outcomes. Future research Should build on the findings of this study to examine how the relationship between various health outcomes (e.g., respiratory disease, suicide attempts, self-rated health) and social support may respond along a social gradient. Such analysis will build Oil the paucity of literature specific to Inuit health and social conditions and set priorities for policy and programming efforts that will improve the social determinants of Inuit health.

AB Accessible SummaryWhat is known on the subject?
   The period between hospital discharge and community reintegration is a vulnerable time for people with mental illness due to a lack of continuity of care. They are at a high risk of undesired outcomes, including return to hospital. Many transitional models have been developed. It is important to continue evaluating models for improvement and adaptability to different contexts. The transitional discharge model (TDM) is an intervention that incorporates both continued support from hospital staff after discharge and peer support to facilitate a smooth transition. Previous studies have reported positive outcomes such as increased discharges, decreased readmissions, reduced inpatient length of stay and improved quality of life. What the paper adds to existing knowledge?
   Health service use outcomes were examined separately for acute and tertiary care psychiatric units. Previous TDM studies in Canada only examined tertiary care units, but many patients also receive care in acute care units. Although recent studies of different interventions generally reported decreased readmissions, the current study found readmissions increased after TDM and then decreased over time for acute care units, whereas no change was observed for tertiary care units. What are the implications for practice?
   Transitional discharge model evidence supports nursing practice based on interpersonal relations and strategies. Nurses need to be aware of peer support resources to facilitate this part of the model. The effectiveness of TDM may be increased by considering the differences in needs of distinct patient groups, such as those discharged from acute versus tertiary care units. Introduction The transitional discharge model (TDM) bridges hospital discharge and community living for people receiving psychiatric services. TDM, based on Peplau's theory of interpersonal relations, ensures continued support from hospital staff until a therapeutic relationship is established with community providers and formal peer support. Aim To compare temporal trends in psychiatric health services use before and after TDM implementation within acute and tertiary care psychiatric units in Ontario, Canada. Method Using health administrative databases, monthly discharges from psychiatric units 3 years prior to 2 years after TDM implementation were identified. Median inpatient length of stay (LOS), psychiatric readmission rates and mental health-related emergency department visit rates were compared using segmented regression analyses. Results Among acute care units, median LOS decreased significantly below the projected historical trend following TDM implementation, while readmissions increased significantly and declined thereafter. No significant changes were found for tertiary care units. Discussion Studies on various interventions have shown decreased readmission rates, whereas the trend differed between acute and tertiary care units in this study. Possible reasons include different patient needs and staff practices. Implications for Practice Needs of people from different unit types should be considered when implementing TDM. Nurses should recognize the development of therapeutic relationships and availability of peer support resources.

AB Objectives PAX-Good Behaviour Game (PAX-GBG) is associated with improved mental health among youth. First Nations community members decided on a whole school approach to facilitate PAX-GBG implementation, by offering intervention training to all staff members in their schools. Our objective is to gain a greater understanding of how this approach was viewed by school personnel, in order to improve implementation in remote and northern First Nations communities.
   Design We conducted a qualitative case study using semi-structured interviews.
   Setting Interviews were conducted in First Nations schools located in northern Manitoba, Canada, in February 2018.
   Participants We used purposive sampling in selecting the 23 school staff from First Nations communities.
   Intervention PAX-GBG is a mental health promotion intervention that teachers deliver in the classroom alongside normal instructional activities. It was implemented school-wide over 4 months from October 2017 to February 2018.
   Outcome measures We inquired about the participants' perception of PAX-GBG and the whole school approach. We applied an iterative coding system, identified recurring ideas and classified the ideas into major categories.
   Results Implementing the PAX-GBG whole school approach improved students' behaviour and created a positive school environment. Students were learning self-regulation, had quieter voices and demonstrated awareness of the PAX-GBG strategies. All teachers interviewed had used the programme. Support from school administrators and having all school personnel use the programme consistently were facilitators to successful implementation. Challenges included the timing of training, lack of clarity in how to implement and implementing among students in older grades and those with special needs.
   Conclusions The whole school approach to implementing PAX-GBG was viewed as an acceptable and feasible way to extend the reach of PAX-GBG in order to promote the mental health of First Nations youth. Recommendations included ensuring school leadership support, changes to the training and cultural and literacy adaptations.

TI Lethal wood pellets. Carbon monoxide poisoning due to inappropriate

AB Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning either accidental or as suicide, is a common cause of death encountered in routine medicolegal autopsies. It is less well known that CO can also be formed from the resin in wood fibers. Wood pellets emit the highest amount of CO in the weeks following production. Insufficient ventilation, particularly during storage of freshly made wood pellets in storage bunkers for heating devices, therefore leads to accumulation of dangerous concentrations of CO.
   This article aims to alert the readership to the dangers of CO poisoning resulting from inappropriate storage of wood pellets.
   The dangers are exemplified by the case of a 43-year-old man who was found dead in a storage room for wood pellets. The cause of death was CO poisoning due to a blood carboxyhemoglobin concentration of 75 %. The findings were compared with 14 further fatal cases of asphyxia involving wood pellets and wood products published in the literature for the time period 2002-2014. The first scientific investigations on this phenomenon were carried out particularly in the USA, Canada, Sweden and China as large-scale producers of wood pellets and were included in the assessment of the literature.
   The evaluation of the currently available literature showed that the dangers associated with the storage of wood pellets as a purportedly harmless source of energy are to a large extent unappreciated and have already led to fatal accidents. Under this aspect it is conspicuous that due to the expansion of the market into private dwellings, private users have also suffered fatal accidents so that an official risk assessment with a clear and uniform identification of hazards appears to be necessary.
   The public awareness of the dangers resulting from the storage of wood pellets must be increased. Official, uniform danger markings and recommendations for handling (e.g. only entering a pellet bunker with a CO detection warning device and/or breathing mask) should be made public in order to avoid fatal accidents by CO poisoning.

AB Objective: Lithium is an important treatment for mood disorders, but concern about its association with renal disease has contributed to its limited use, particularly in older adults. Because high-quality evidence examining renal disease in this population is lacking, this study aims to quantify the prevalence and identify clinical correlates of renal disease in geriatric lithium users. Methods: In a population-based cross-sectional study on 2,480 lithium users aged 70 or more years, the authors searched the provincial administrative health data from Ontario, Canada between April 1, 2005 and March 31, 2011. Prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), acute kidney injury (AKI), and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) was measured using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent correlates of renal disease. Results: The 6-year prevalence rates of CKD, AKI, and NDI were 13.9%, 1.3%, and 3.0%, respectively. Hypertension (odds ratio [OR]: 2.05; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50-2.79), diabetes mellitus (OR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.45-2.38), ischemic heart disease (OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.24-2.20), NDI (OR: 2.54; 95% CI: 1.47-4.40), AKI (OR: 11.7; 95% CI: 5.26-26.1), lithium use for more than 2 years (OR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.05-2.81), loop diuretic use (OR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.26-2.41), hydrochlorothiazide use (OR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.07-2.05), and atypical antipsychotic use (OR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.17-1.89) were all independently associated with CKD. Conclusion: Older lithium users have high rates of CKD. Lithium use duration was independently associated with CKD. Longitudinal studies including individuals without lithium exposure will be necessary to confirm whether lithium is indeed a risk factor for CKD in older adults.

AB Key PointsQuestionAre individuals with major depressive disorder who are not taking medication characterized by lower dopamine transporter levels within the brain reward system compared with psychiatrically healthy control participants? FindingsIn this cross-sectional study that analyzed positron emission tomography in 25 individuals with major depressive disorder and 23 healthy controls and postmortem data in 15 individuals with major depressive disorder and 14 healthy controls, major depressive disorder was linked to lower dopamine transporter levels in the dorsal striatum. In the imaging data, this dysfunction was exacerbated by more episodes of depression. MeaningDecreased dopamine transporter availability might represent a compensatory downregulation because of low dopaminergic signaling within mesolimbic pathways.
   ImportanceMajor depressive disorder (MDD) might involve dopamine (DA) reductions. The DA transporter (DAT) regulates DA clearance and neurotransmission and is sensitive to DA levels, with preclinical studies (including those involving inescapable stressors) showing that DAT density decreases when DA signaling is reduced. Despite preclinical data, evidence of reduced DAT in MDD is inconclusive. ObjectiveUsing a highly selective DAT positron emission tomography (PET) tracer ([C-11] altropane), DAT availability was probed in individuals with MDD who were not taking medication. Levels of DAT expression were also evaluated in postmortem tissues from donors with MDD who died by suicide. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis cross-sectional PET study was conducted at McLean Hospital (Belmont, Massachusetts) and Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston) and enrolled consecutive individuals with MDD who were not taking medication and demographically matched healthy controls between January 2012 and March 2014. Brain tissues were obtained from the Douglas-Bell Canada Brain Bank. For the PET component, 25 individuals with current MDD who were not taking medication and 23 healthy controls recruited from McLean Hospital were included (all provided usable data). For the postmortem component, 15 individuals with depression and 14 healthy controls were considered. InterventionPET scan. Main Outcomes and MeasuresStriatal and midbrain DAT binding potential was assessed. For the postmortem component, tyrosine hydroxylase and DAT levels were evaluated using Western blots. ResultsCompared with 23 healthy controls (13 women [56.5%]; mean [SD] age, 26.49 [7.26] years), 25 individuals with MDD (19 women [76.0%]; mean [SD] age, 26.52 [5.92] years) showed significantly lower in vivo DAT availability in the bilateral putamen and ventral tegmental area (Cohen d range, -0.62 to -0.71), and both reductions were exacerbated with increasing numbers of depressive episodes. Unlike healthy controls, the MDD group failed to show an age-associated reduction in striatal DAT availability, with young individuals with MDD being indistinguishable from older healthy controls. Moreover, DAT availability in the ventral tegmental area was lowest in individuals with MDD who reported feeling trapped in stressful circumstances. Lower DAT levels (and tyrosine hydroxylase) in the putamen of MDD compared with healthy controls were replicated in postmortem analyses (Cohen d range, -0.92 to -1.15). Conclusions and RelevanceMajor depressive disorder, particularly with recurring episodes, is characterized by decreased striatal DAT expression, which might reflect a compensatory downregulation due to low DA signaling within mesolimbic pathways.
   This cross-sectional study explores dopamine transporter availability in individuals with major depressive disorder who were not taking medication and levels of dopamine transporter expression in postmortem tissues from donors with major depressive disorder who died by suicide.

ID OVERDOSE
AB Context. Paliperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that was approved in the U. S. in 2006, and is also available in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and Asia. Information regarding paliperidone overdoses is limited to case reports. Serious toxicity has yet to be reported. Objective. To evaluate the toxicity of paliperidone exposures using a national poison center database. Methods. A retrospective, observational case series of single-substance paliperidone cases reported to the National Poison Data System from 2007 to 2012 was conducted. Cases were evaluated for demographics, reason for exposure, clinical effects, treatments, disposition, and coded medical outcomes. For cases with major effects the text fields in poison center charts were evaluated to verify accuracy of coded outcome. The relationship between dose and severity of medical outcome was analyzed for acute exposure cases. Results. There were 801 paliperidone cases that met inclusion criteria that included 592 persons of 13 years or greater, 67 children of 6-12 years, 140 children of less than 6 years, and 2 unknown ages. Most common reasons for exposure included: suicide attempt (39.6%), unintentional general (21.1%), therapeutic error (15.7%), and adverse drug reaction (11.9%). The most commonly observed clinical effects were drowsiness/lethargy (28.7%), tachycardia (23.3%), and dystonia (14.2%). Most patients were managed in the emergency department (40.3%) or were admitted to a health care facility (HCF) (42.7%). In 564 cases treated in a HCF, treatments included activated charcoal (25.7%), antihistamines (21.1%), and benzodiazepines (9.4%). Medical outcomes were no effect (35.0%), minor (30.8%), moderate (33.7%), and major effect (0.5%). There were no deaths. Of 491 acute exposures, dose was coded for 74.3% of exposures. There was a significant difference in the reported median dose between those with no effect (6 mg) and either minor effect (12 mg; p = 0.047) or moderate effect cases (12 mg; p = 0.020) in 91 children less than 6 years. Conclusions. The majority of patients experienced no or minor toxicity and were not admitted for medical care. Although a higher dose was associated with a more serious outcome in children less than 6 years, the data do not provide clear-cut triage guidelines.

AB Objectives: Mortality rates generally decline during economic recessions in high-income countries, however gaps remain in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. This study estimates the impacts of increases in unemployment rates on both all-cause and cause-specific mortality across U.S. metropolitan regions during the Great Recession.
   Methods: We estimate the effects of economic conditions during the recent and severe recessionary period on mortality, including differences by age and gender subgroups, using fixed effects regression models. We identify a plausibly causal effect by isolating the impacts of within-metropolitan area changes in unemployment rates and controlling for common temporal trends. We aggregated vital statistics, population, and unemployment data at the area-month-year-age-gender-race level, yielding 527,040 observations across 366 metropolitan areas, 2005-2010.
   Results: We estimate that a one percentage point increase in the metropolitan area unemployment rate was associated with a decrease in all-cause mortality of 3.95 deaths per 100,000 person years (95%Ci 6.80 to 1.10), or 0.5%. Estimated reductions in cardiovascular disease mortality contributed 60% of the overall effect and were more pronounced among women. Motor vehicle accident mortality declined with unemployment increases, especially for men and those under age 65, as did legal intervention and homicide mortality, particularly for men and adults ages 25-64. We find suggestive evidence that increases in metropolitan area unemployment increased accidental drug poisoning deaths for both men and women ages 25-64.
   Conclusions: Our finding that all-cause mortality decreased during the Great Recession is consistent with previous studies. Some categories of cause-specific mortality, notably cardiovascular disease, also follow this pattern, and are more pronounced for certain gender and age groups. Our study also suggests that the recent recession contributed to the growth in deaths from overdoses of prescription drugs in working-age adults in metropolitan areas. Additional research investigating the mechanisms underlying the health consequences of macroeconomic conditions is warranted. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In 1978 Italy implemented Law Number 180, the reform law that blocked all new admissions to public mental hospitals. After 40 years without mental hospitals, we aim at understanding the consequences of the Italian reform in terms of mental health care facility and staff availability. We compared the organization of the Italian mental health system with that of countries belonging to the Group of 7 (G7) major advanced economies. Italy has nearly 8 psychiatrists, 20 nurses, 2 social workers and less than 3 psychologists per 100,000 population, while for example in France there were 22 psychiatrists, in Japan 102 nurses, in the United States 18 social workers, and in Canada and France more than 45 psychologists per 100,000 population. In terms of inpatient facilities, no beds in mental hospitals were available in Italy, while in the other G7 countries mental hospital beds ranged from 8 in the United Kingdom to 204 in Japan per 100 000 population. In Italy there were fewer beds for acute care in general hospitals but more beds in community residential facilities than in the other G7 countries. Service use data showed variability in the provision of mental health care throughout the country. Soon after the implementation of the Italian reform the absolute number of compulsory admissions progressively declined, from more than 20,000 in 1978 to less than 9000 in 2015. Alongside the progressive decline of psychiatric beds imposed by Law 180, the age-adjusted suicide rate remained stable, ranging from 7.1/100,000 population in 1978 to 6.3/100,000 population in 2012. The population of psychiatric patients placed in Italian forensic psychiatric hospitals progressively declined. During the last 40 years without mental hospitals, Italy has seen a progressive consolidation of a community-based system of mental health care. We highlighted, however, reasons for concern, including a decreasing staffing level, a potential use of community residential facilities as long-stay residential services, a still too high variability in service provision across the country, and lack of national data on physical restraints. At a national level, the resources allocated to mental health care are lower in Italy than in other high-income countries.

AB The impact of traumatic workplace death on bereaved families, including their mental health and well-being, has rarely been systematically examined. This study aimed to document the rates and key correlates of probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and prolonged grief disorder (PGD) in family members following a workplace injury fatality. The hidden nature of the target population necessitated outreach recruitment techniques, including the use of social media, newspaper articles, radio interviews, and contact with major family support organizations. Data were collected using a cross-sectional design and international online survey. The PCL-C (PTSD), the PHQ-8 (MDD), and PG-13 (PGD) were used to measure mental health disorders. All are well-established self-report measures with strong psychometric qualities. Participants were from Australia (62%), Canada (17%), the USA (16%), and the UK (5%). The majority were females (89.9%), reflecting the gender distribution of traumatic workplace deaths (over 90% of fatalities are male). Most were partners/spouses (38.5%) or parents (35%) and over half (64%) were next of kin to the deceased worker. Most deaths occurred in the industries that regularly account for more than 70 percent of all industrial deaths-construction, manufacturing, transport, and agriculture forestry and fishing. At a mean of 6.40 years (SD = 5.78) post-death, 61 percent of participants had probable PTSD, 44 percent had probable MDD, and 43 percent had probable PGD. Logistic regressions indicated that a longer time since the death reduced the risk of having each disorder. Being next of kin and having a self-reported mental health history increased the risk of having MDD. Of the related information and support variables, having satisfactory support from family, support from a person to help navigate the post-death formalities, and satisfactory information about the death were associated with a decreased risk of probable PTSD, MDD, and PGD, respectively. The findings highlight the potential magnitude of the problem and the need for satisfactory information and support for bereaved families.

AB Objective: This study describes the impact of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and hazardous drinking on mental health and behavioural issues among Ontario adolescents. In particular, we assessed the incremental co-occurrence of hazardous drinking with a history of TBI, in comparison to experiencing just one of these conditions.
   Methods: A cross-sectional subsample of 3130 Ontario adolescents attending grades 9-12, and aged 10-21 were surveyed in 2013 as a part of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health's Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey. Recent (past year) and former (lifetime and excluding the last year) TBI were defined as trauma to the head that resulted in loss of consciousness for at least 5 min or overnight hospitalisation. Current hazardous drinking was derived using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT).
   Results: An estimated 11.8% of Ontario adolescents (95% CI 10.1% to 13.8%) reported a history of former TBI and were not hazardous drinkers; 4.0% (95% CI 2.9% to 5.5%) reported recent TBI and were not hazardous drinkers; 13.7% (95% CI 12.3% to 15.3%) were hazardous drinkers who never had a TBI; 4.1% (95% CI 2.9% to 5.8%) had former TBI with co-occurring hazardous drinking; and 2.2% (95% CI 1.6% to 3.0%) had recent TBI with co-occurring hazardous drinking. Most odds increased significantly and were two to three times higher for reporting compromised mental health, violent and non-violent conduct behaviours, and reported victimisation for classifying as a hazardous drinker at the time of testing with co-occurring either former or recent TBI compared to classifying as not having either of these conditions. Adolescents classified as hazardous drinkers with former TBI had numerous and higher ORs for conduct behaviours than those with recent TBI.
   Conclusions: Results emphasise the strong interplay between TBI and hazardous drinking and point to the need for integrating prevention efforts to reduce these conditions and their co-occurrence among adolescents.

AB Parental hip fracture (HF) is considered a major risk factor for offspring major osteoporotic fracture (MOF), but all studies to date have relied on self-reported information of uncertain accuracy. We tested the association of objectively verified parental HF with offspring MOF and HF. We used a population-based historical cohort study of 261,705 offspring (age 40 years) with at least one linked parent (total 478,792 parents) for the province of Manitoba, Canada. Cox proportional hazards models were developed to test hazard ratio (HR) for offspring MOF and HF for 1997 to 2014 according to prior parental HF dating back to 1970. The median age of offspring at study entry was 40 years (range, 40 to 50 years), and 48.3% were women. During 2.9 million person-years of offspring follow-up (median per offspring, 12 years), we identified 7323 incident MOF (4.4% versus 2.7% for those with and without a parental HF, p<0.001), including 331 HF (0.3% versus 0.1%, p<0.001). Parental HF was independently associated with increased risk of offspring MOF (HR, 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20 to 1.41). The strength of the association decreased with older parental age at HF (p(trend)<0.001), and was no longer significant if parental HF occurred after age 80 years (adjusted HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.19). The relationship between parental HF and offspring HF was even stronger than for MOF (adjusted HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.21 to 2.23). Associations with MOF or HF were not affected by either the gender of the parent with HF or the gender of the offspring. Parental HF increased the risk for offspring MOF and HF but not when parental HF occurred after age 80 years. This suggests a more nuanced approach for clinicians trying to stratify fracture risk, and illustrates the enormous potential of parent-offspring record linkage for other familial disorders.

AB Background: Owing to the fact that firefighters have unique health risks, access to firefighter-specific internet-based health information is a potential mechanism for achieving better health and work outcomes.
   Objective: The objective of our study was to identify the amount and nature of health information resources available on Canadian firefighter-specific websites and the extent to which resources are consistent across websites as a surrogate indicator of diffusion of information.
   Methods: A search of health resources on firefighter websites (union and employer) for all Canadian provinces, major cities and a subset of smaller cities, and the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) website was conducted on Google (July 2017). Content was identified and classified based on the type of resource, health focus, and location. The quantity and nature of the resources were summarized using descriptive statistics.
   Results: Among all (N=313) websites reviewed, 41 websites had health information with a cumulative total of 128 resources that addressed firefighter mental (59/128, 46.1%), physical (43/128, 33.6%), and work health (26/128, 20.3%). The highest density of information was found on international and national websites (13 resources per website) and the least on local websites (1 resource per 7 websites). Three provinces (Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia) hosted 81% (65/80) of the provincial, territorial and local resources. General mental health (20/59, 34%), posttraumatic stress disorder (14/59, 24%), and suicide (14/59, 24%) were the most prevalent topics within the mental health resources, whereas half (21/43, 49%) of all physical health resources were on cancer. No resources from Northern Canada were found. Musculoskeletal health was not mentioned in any of the resources identified. There was minimal cross-linking of resources across sites (only 4 resources were duplicated across sites), and there was no clear indication of how the content was vetted or evaluated for quality.
   Conclusions: There was wide variation in the amount and type of information available on different firefighter websites with limited diffusion of information across jurisdictions. Quality evaluation and coordination of resources should be considered to enhance firefighters' access to quality health information to meet their specific needs. Mental health and cancer information aligned with high rates of these health problems in firefighters, whereas the lack of information on musculoskeletal health was discordant with their high rate of work injury claims for these problems.

AB Issue: Medical assistance in dying (MAID) became legal in Quebec on December 10, 2015, and in the rest of Canada on June 17, 2016. This enabled 6,749 deaths through physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia between December 10, 2015 and October 31, 2018. While the death of a patient is a common experience for medical trainees, those that occur through MAID have unique features related to the methods, the timeline, the intended role of the physician in causing the death, and the request of the patient that initiates the process. These aspects necessitate a distinct approach to MAID medical education. Evidence: Despite the legalization of MAID in a growing number of jurisdictions, there is virtually no literature to guide MAID education in clinical practice. The cumulative evidence regarding the impact of patient death on medical students, residents, and attending physicians suggests a need for supported discussion and debriefing to process and reflect on the emotional experiences that follow patient death. This is especially important with MAID, in which there are unique ethical and psychological issues related to the physician's direct role in causing the death of a patient. There is little published research on the impact such deaths have on physicians who provide MAID, or on others who are indirectly involved. However, there is evidence that learners desire MAID-specific education tailored to their unique needs. Didactic education about the medical and legal domains of MAID alone is insufficient to support learners' needs. Experiential case-based learning with supervisory support has the potential to enhance training in end-of-life care in general, and specifically in MAID. The authors' first clinical experience with a patient requesting MAID on an internal medicine clinical teaching unit (CTU) highlighted gaps in their preparedness to meet the associated professional and personal demands. Reflecting on these perceived gaps, and on the needs of learners identified in the literature on patient death and MAID education, the authors created a framework to guide learning at the point of care of a patient requesting MAID. Represented in a MAID Education Cogwheel and discussion guide, this framework specifies learning objectives and methods in six domains: medical, legal, moral, ethical, cultural, and psychosocial. Implications: Following a MAID request, attending physicians can use the framework to guide learners in ongoing conversations addressing these domains. Inter-professional participation can include such disciplines as psychiatry, palliative care, bioethics, pharmacy, nursing, physical and occupational therapy, social work, and spiritual care. Further research is necessary to test this framework to determine its' feasibility, efficacy, and generalizability.

TI Changing mortality rates and causes of death for HIV-infected
   individuals living in Southern Alberta, Canada from 1984 to 2003

DE causes of death; HIV/AIDS; mortality rates; non-HIV related deaths
ID ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; AIDS; DECLINE; TRENDS
AB Objectives To examine changes over a 2-year period in both the mortality rate and the causes of death in a geographically defined HIV-infected population.
   Methods A database search of primary care information for the dates and causes of death for all patients documented with HIV infection and living in Southern Alberta between 1984 and 2003 was under-taken. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were obtained. Causes of death were then individually confirmed by reviewing the patients' hospital charts, autopsy reports, or death certificates and coded using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revisions. AIDS deaths were reconciled with Public Health Reports. The time span was divided into pre-highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (1984-1996) and current HAART (1997-2003) periods.
   Results Between 1984 and 2003, there were 560 deaths in the 1987 individuals living with HIV infection in Southern Alberta. Of these, 436 deaths (78%) occurred pre-HAART and 124 (22%) in the current HAART period. The crude mortality rate declined from 117 deaths per 1000 patient-years pre-HAART to 24 in the current HAART period. In the pre-HAART era, 90% of all deaths were AIDS related whereas only 67% were AIDS related in the current HAART era. The leading causes of AIDS deaths were AIDS multiple causes (31%), Mycobacterium avium complex (18%), Pneumocystis pneumonia (10%) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (7%). The proportion of non-AIDS related deaths increased from 7% pre-HAART to 32% in the current HAART era. Accidental deaths, including drug overdose (29%), suicide (7%) and violence (3%), hepatic disease (19%), non-AIDS related malignancies (19%), and cardiovascular disease (16%) accounted for the majority of non-AIDS related deaths. No deaths directly caused by drug toxicity were found. Overall, 21% of patients who died were antiretroviral (ARV)-naive. A total of 14% of patients dying from AIDS were ARV-naive in contrast to 35% dying from non-HIV related conditions. Of all those dying from AIDS, 23% died < 3 months after their initial diagnosis, reflecting late presentation. In the current HAART era, 87% of patients who died from AIDS were extensively treated, reflecting HAART treatment failures due mostly to multiclass drug resistance (42%), inexorable disease progression despite ARV (32%), lack of ability or interest to be maintained on a lifelong HAART programme (21%) and, rarely, drug intolerance (< 1%).
   Conclusions Deaths from AIDS-related causes have decreased significantly, but deaths from non-AIDS related conditions have increased, both as an absolute number of deaths and as a proportion of all deaths in W-infected patients. The increasing age of the HIV population, and the increased mean CD4 count, increased proportion of intravenous drug users, increased hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus.

TI Crisis interventions for people with borderline personality disorder
SO COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
LA English
DT Review
ID DIALECTICAL BEHAVIOR-THERAPY; COMPULSORY TREATMENT; PLANS; PROTOCOL;
   SUICIDE; IMPACT
AB Background
   People with borderline personality disorder (BPD) frequently present to health services in crisis, often involving suicidal thoughts or actions. Despite this, little is known about what constitutes effective management of acute crises in this population.
   Objectives
   To review the evidence for the effectiveness of crisis interventions for adults with BPD in any setting. For the purposes of the review, we defined crisis intervention as' an immediate response by one or more individuals to the acute distress experienced by another individual, which is designed to ensure safety and recovery and lasts no longer than one month.'
   Search methods
   We searched the following databases in September 2011: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1948 to August Week 5 2011), MEDLINE In Process & Other Non-indexed Citations (8 September 2011), EMBASE (1980 to Week 36 2011), PsycINFO (1806 to September Week 1 2011), CINAHL (1937 to current), Social Services Abstracts (1979 to current), Social Care Online (12 September 2011), Science Citation Index (1970 to current), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to current), Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (1990 to current), Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science and Humanities (1990 to current) and ZETOC Conference proceedings (12 September 2011). We searched for dissertations in WorldCat (12 September 2011), Australasian Digital Theses Program (ADTP; 12 September 2011), Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD), 12 September 2011 and Theses Canada Portal (12 September 2011). We searched for trials in the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and searched reference lists from relevant literature. We contacted the 10 most published researchers in the field of BPD (as indexed by BioMed Experts), in addition to contacting topic experts, Marsha Linehan, Arnoud Arntz and Paul Links, about ongoing trials and unpublished data.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing crisis interventions with usual care or no intervention or a waiting list control for adults of any age with BPD.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full-text articles and assessed these against the inclusion criteria.
   Main results The search identified 15 studies, 13 of which we excluded. Reasons for exclusion were: lack of randomisation (N = 8); retrospective design (N = 2); or the intervention was a complex psychological therapy lasting longer than one month (N = 3). We identified two ongoing RCTs that met the inclusion criteria, with a combined predicted sample size of 688. These trials are ongoing and the results are therefore not included in the review, although they will be incorporated into future updates.
   Authors' conclusions A comprehensive search of the literature showed that currently there is no RCT-based evidence for the management of acute crises in people with BPD and therefore we could not reach any conclusions about the effectiveness of any single crisis intervention. High-quality, large-scale, adequately powered RCTs in this area are urgently needed.

TI Meaningful work and well-being: a study of the positive side of
   veterinary work
SO VETERINARY RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID PERSONAL RESOURCES; CREATIVE WORK; MENTAL-HEALTH; SUICIDE; BURNOUT;
   INTERVENTIONS; STRESSORS; DEMANDS; RISK; SELF
AB Objectives Mental health is a growing concern in many healthcare professions, including veterinary medicine, as research suggests that veterinarians report higher levels of distress, burnout and suicidal ideation than other healthcare occupations and the general public. A recent literature review found that about twice as many articles published on veterinary wellness refer to the negative aspects of mental health (eg, stress and depression) compared with the positive aspects of well-being. Little attention has been devoted to examining the positive aspects of veterinarians' work, and few models have been developed to explain their well-being. This paper empirically assesses a veterinary model of work-derived well-being based on the theory of eudaimonia. Eudaimonic well-being reflects having fulfilling work that contributes to the greater good. Three core clusters of job characteristics are hypothesised relevant to veterinarian well-being that include: actualising self, helping others (animals or people) and a sense of belonging (to team or profession). In addition, meaningful work is proposed as the mechanism through which situational job characteristics may exert a positive influence on wellbeing.
   Methods Survey data from 376 veterinarians in clinical practice were analysed using path analysis.
   Discussion Meaningful work is important in understanding the well-being of veterinarians. Job characteristics (self-actualising work, helping animals and people and a sense of belonging) contribute to a sense of meaningful work, which in turn is related to eudaimonic well-being. Excessive job demands (work overload, financial demands and physical health risks) appear less relevant in understanding meaningful work but are clearly important in having negative consequences for veterinarians' well-being. While strategies that cultivate meaningful work may be effective in nurturing veterinarians' well being, several limitations of this study should be noted. First, due to the cross-sectional data, definitive statements about the causal ordering of variables cannot be made. Second, the data were derived from a single source such that monomethod bias may be an issue. Third, the data rely on self-report measures and the responses may be influenced by social desirability or response biases. Lastly, while the sample may be representative of the veterinarians throughout a large geographic area in Canada, it may not represent the work arrangements of veterinarians in other countries.
   Conclusions The significance of these findings is that they may shift research attention from focusing on the harmful, demanding aspects of veterinary work to better understanding the deeply meaningful aspects that improve veterinarians' well-being. In addition, the results may stimulate consideration of strategies that move beyond individual-level interventions that focus on veterinarians adopting better coping strategies and becoming more resilient. This may lead to adopting organisational and occupational-level strategies that can involve promoting more positive and supportive workplace cultures and developing more professional resources for promoting wellness and meaning in the profession of veterinary medicine.

AB Background: The health of people who use drugs (PWUD) is characterized by multimorbidity and chronicity of health conditions, necessitating an understanding of their health care utilization. The objective of this study was to evaluate emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions among a cohort of PWUD.
   Methods: We used a retrospective observational design between 2012 and 2013. The population was a marginalized cohort of PWUD (the PROUD study) for whom survey data was linked (n = 663) to provincial health administrative data housed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences. We constructed a 5: 1 comparison group matched by age, sex, income quintile, and region. The main outcomes were defined as having two or more ED visits, or one or more hospital admissions, in the year prior to survey completion. We used multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with these outcomes.
   Results: Compared to the matched cohort, PWUD had higher rates of ED visits (rate ratio [RR] 7.0; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 6.5-7.6) and hospitalization (RR 7.7; 95% CI 5.9-10.0). After adjustment, factors predicting more ED visits were receiving disability (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 3.0; 95% CI 1.7-5.5) or income assistance (AOR 2.7; 95% CI 1.5-5.0), injection drug use (AOR 2.1; 95% CI 1.3-3.4), incarceration within 12 months (AOR 1.6; 95% CI 1.1-2.4), mental health comorbidity (AOR 2.1; 95% CI 1.4-3.1), and a suicide attempt within 12 months (AOR 2.1; 95% CI 1.1-3.4). Receiving methadone (AOR 0.5; 95% CI 0.3-0.9) and having a regular family physician (AOR 0.5; 95% CI 0.2-0.9) were associated with lower odds of having more ED visits. Factors associated with more hospital admissions included Aboriginal identity (AOR 2.4; 95% CI 1.4-4.1), receiving disability (AOR 2.4; 95% CI 1.1-5.4), non-injection drug use (opioids and non-opioids) (AOR 2.2; 95% CI 1.1-4.4), comorbid HIV (AOR 2.4; 95% CI 1.2-5.6), mental health comorbidity (AOR 2.4; 95% CI 1.3-4.2), and unstable housing (AOR 1.9; 95% CI 1.0-3.4); there were no protective factors for hospitalization.
   Conclusions: Improved post-incarceration support, housing services, and access to integrated primary care services including opioid replacement therapy may be effective interventions to decrease acute care use among PWUD, including targeted approaches for people receiving social assistance or with mental health concerns.

AB The third UN High-Level Meeting on Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) on Sept 27,2018, will review national and global progress towards the prevention and control of NCDs, and provide an opportunity to renew, reinforce, and enhance commitments to reduce their burden. NCD Countdown 2030 is an independent collaboration to inform policies that aim to reduce the worldwide burden of NCDs, and to ensure accountability towards this aim. In 2016, an estimated 40.5 million (71%) of the 56.9 million worldwide deaths were from NCDs. Of these, an estimated 1.7 million (4% of NCD deaths) occurred in people younger than 30 years of age, 15.2 million (38%) in people aged between 30 years and 70 years, and 23.6 million (58%) in people aged 70 years and older. An estimated 32.2 million NCD deaths (80%) were due to cancers, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes, and another 8.3 million (20%) were from other NCDs. Women in 164 (88%) and men in 165 (89%) of 186 countries and territories had a higher probability of dying before 70 years of age from an NCD than from communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional conditions combined. Globally, the lowest risks of NCD mortality in 2016 were seen in high-income countries in Asia-Pacific, western Europe, and Australasia, and in Canada. The highest risks of dying from NCDs were observed in low-income and middle-income countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, and, for men, in central Asia and eastern Europe. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 3.4-a one-third reduction, relative to 2015 levels, in the probability of dying between 30 years and 70 years of age from cancers, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes by 2030-will be achieved in 35 countries (19%) for women, and 30 (16%) for men, if these countries maintain or surpass their 2010-2016 rate of decline in NCD mortality. Most of these are high-income countries with already-low NCD mortality, and countries in central and eastern Europe. An additional 50 (27%) countries for women and 35 (19%) for men are projected to achieve such a reduction in the subsequent decade, and thus, with slight acceleration of decline, could meet the 2030 target. 86 (46%) countries for women and 97 (52%) for men need implementation of policies that substantially increase the rates of decline. Mortality from the four NCDs included in SDG target 3.4 has stagnated or increased since 2010 among women in 15 (8%) countries and men in 24 (13%) countries. NCDs and age groups other than those included in the SDG target 3.4 are responsible for a higher risk of death in low-income and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. Substantial reduction of NCD mortality requires policies that considerably reduce tobacco and alcohol use and blood pressure, and equitable access to efficacious and high-quality preventive and curative care for acute and chronic NCDs.

AB Background Previous trials have shown that pridopidine might reduce motor impairment in patients with Huntington's disease. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether higher doses of pridopidine than previously tested reduce motor symptoms in a dose-dependent manner while maintaining acceptable safety and tolerability.
   Methods PRIDE-HD was a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2, dose-ranging study in adults (aged >= 21 years) with Huntington's disease at outpatient clinics in 53 sites across 12 countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA). Eligible patients had clinical onset after age 18 years, 36 or more cytosine-adenine-guanine repeats in the huntingtin gene, motor symptoms (Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score [UHDRS-TMS] >= 25 points), and reduced independence (UHDRS independence score <= 90%). Patients were randomly assigned (1: 1: 1: 1: 1) with centralised interactive-response technology to receive one of four doses of pridopidine (45, 67.5, 90, or 112.5 mg) or placebo orally twice a day for 52 weeks. Randomisation was stratified within centres by neuroleptic drug use. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in the UHDRS-TMS from baseline to 26 weeks, which was assessed in all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment (full analysis set). Participants and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2013-001888-23) and ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT02006472).
   Findings Between Feb 13, 2014, and July 5, 2016, 408 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive placebo (n=82) or pridopidine 45 mg (n=81), 67.5 mg (n=82), 90 mg (n=81), or 112.5 mg (n=82) twice daily for 26 weeks. The full analysis set included 397 patients (81 in the placebo group, 75 in the 45 mg group, 79 in the 67.5 mg group, 81 in the 90 mg group, and 81 in the 112.5 mg group). Pridopidine did not significantly change the UHDRS-TMS at 26 weeks compared with placebo at any dose. The most frequent adverse events across all groups were diarrhoea, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, falls, headache, insomnia, and anxiety. The most common treatment-related adverse events were insomnia, diarrhoea, nausea, and dizziness. Serious adverse events occurred in the pridopidine groups only and were most frequently falls (n=5), suicide attempt (n= 4), suicidal ideation (n=3), head injury (n=3), and aspiration pneumonia (n=3). No new safety or tolerability concerns emerged in this study. One death in the pridopidine 112.5 mg group due to aspiration pneumonia was considered to be possibly related to the study drug.
   Interpretation Pridopidine did not improve the UHDRS-TMS at week 26 compared with placebo and, thus, the results of secondary or tertiary analyses in previous trials were not replicated. A potentially strong placebo effect needs to be ruled out in future studies.

TI Peer Support for the Hardly Reached: A Systematic Review
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Review
ID SUICIDE-PREVENTION; MORTALITY; INUIT; YOUTH; COMMUNITY; CANADA;
   INTERVENTION; NEWFOUNDLAND; ASSOCIATION; AUSTRALIA
AB Background. Health disparities are aggravated when prevention and care initiatives fail to reach those they are intended to help. Groups can be classified as hardly reached according to a variety of circumstances that fall into 3 domains: individual (e.g., psychological factors), demographic (e.g., socioeconomic status), and cultural-environmental (e.g., social network). Several reports have indicated that peer support is an effective means of reaching hardly reached individuals. However, no review has explored peer support effectiveness in relation to the circumstances associated with being hardly reached or across diverse health problems.
   Objectives. To conduct a systematic review assessing the reach and effectiveness of peer support among hardly reached individuals, as well as peer support strategies used.
   Search methods. Three systematic searches conducted in PubMed identified studies that evaluated peer support programs among hardly reached individuals. In aggregate, the searches covered articles published from 2000 to 2015.
   Selection criteria. Eligible interventions provided ongoing support for complex health behaviors, including prioritization of hardly reached populations, assistance in applying behavior change plans, and social-emotional support directed toward disease management or quality of life. Studies were excluded if they addressed temporally isolated behaviors, were limited to protocol group classes, included peer support as the dependent variable, did not include statistical tests of significance, or incorporated comparison conditions that provided appreciable social support.
   Data collection and analysis. We abstracted data regarding the primary health topic, categorizations of hardly reached groups, program reach, outcomes, and strategies employed. We conducted a 2-sample t test to determine whether reported strategies were related to reach.
   Results. Forty-seven studies met our inclusion criteria, and these studies represented each of the 3 domains of circumstances assessed (individual, demographic, and cultural-environmental). Interventions addressed 8 health areas, most commonly maternal and child health (25.5%), diabetes (17.0%), and other chronic diseases (14.9%). Thirty-six studies (76.6%) assessed program reach, which ranged from 24% to 79% of the study population. Forty-four studies (94%) reported significant changes favoring peer support. Eleven strategies emerged for engaging and retaining hardly reached individuals. Among them, programs that reported a strategy of trust and respect had higher participant retention (82.8%) than did programs not reporting such a strategy (48.1%; P = .003). In 5 of the 6 studies examining moderators of the effects of peer support, peer support benefits were greater among individuals characterized by disadvantage (e.g., low health literacy).
   Conclusions. Peer support is a broad and robust strategy for reaching groups that health services too often fail to engage. The wide range of audiences and health concerns among which peer support is successful suggests that a basis for its success may be its flexible response to different contexts, including the intended audience, health problems, and setting.
   Public health implications. The general benefits of peer support and findings suggesting that it may be more effective among those at heightened disadvantage indicate that peer support should be considered in programs intended to reach and benefit those too often hardly reached. Because engendering trust and respect was significantly associated with participant retention, programs should emphasize this strategy.
