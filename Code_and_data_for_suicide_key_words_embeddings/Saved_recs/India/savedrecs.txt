AB The current report reviews the data from the series Accidental Death and Suicide in India published by India's National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) reporting official suicide rates based on police reports over the period of 10 years from 2004 to 2013. A reference to wider literature is made to present a comprehensive picture.
   Suicide in India is more prevalent in young, is likely to involve hanging and ingestion of pesticides and is related to social and economic causes. Reducing alcohol consumption, unemployment, poverty, social inequities, domestic violence and improving social justice are essential to reduce suicide in India.
   NCRB data might underreport suicide. Discrepancy in farmers' suicide rate between reports suggests that this might be overrepresented in NCRB data.
   An integrated suicide prevention programme with a multidimensional approach is needed. Mental health care bill and the recent launch of first national mental health policy are welcome measures. Decriminalization of suicide is likely to positively influence mental health practice and policy in India.
   Nationally representative studies investigating fatal and non-fatal suicidal behaviours, evaluation of models of service delivery for the vulnerable population, investigating suicide following different treatment services and effects of decriminalization of suicide on suicide rates should be the focus of future research.

AB Background: In India, about 130,000 people died by suicide in the year 2015. It is important to understand the variation of suicide across different parts of India and the trend of suicide rates over the years. The objectives of this study were to determine whether suicide rates in India showed temporal variation in the last decade and to determine whether suicide rates in India showed geographical variation across different states and union territories (UTs). Methods: Data on suicide rates for the years 2006-2015 were collected from the official publication of the National Crime Records Bureau. This study looked for time trend in suicide rates over the years. Further, the variation in suicide rates across different states/UTs in India and the factors associated with the variation were also analyzed. Results: The average suicide rate in India for the years 2006-2015 was 10.9/100,000 population. Overall, there was no significant variation in the suicide rate over time in the years studied. The average suicide rate varied widely across the states and UTs, between 0.91 and 43.92 per 100,000 population. The analysis revealed a positive association between suicide rates and accident rates for the above years. In addition, for the year 2011, a positive association between suicide rate and per capita state domestic product was noted. Conclusion: There was no variation in the suicide rate in India over time. However, there were significant regional differences. Reporting differences and economic factors could partially explain the differences.

AB To investigate trends and socio-economic determinants of suicide in India over the period of 2001-2013.
   Suicide rates between 2001 and 2013 were calculated using suicide statistics provided by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) and census data provided by Census of India, stratified by sex, age group, and geographical region, to investigate trends in suicide over the study period. Multilevel negative binomial regression models were specified to investigate associations between state-level indicators of economic development, education, employment and religious factors and sex-specific suicide rates.
   Male suicide rates remained relatively steady (similar to 14 per 100,000) while female suicide rates decreased over the study period (9 to 7 per 100,000). The age group of 45-59 years had the highest suicide rate among males while the age group of 15-29 years had the highest suicide rate among females. On average, higher male and female suicide rates were observed in states with: higher levels of development, higher levels of agricultural employment, higher levels of literacy, and higher proportions of people identifying with Hinduism. Higher male suicide rates were also observed in states with higher levels of unemployment.
   The process of modernization might be contributing towards higher suicide risk in more developed parts of India. Also, increase in farmer suicides since economic liberalization might be contributing towards higher suicide rates among more agricultural regions. Furthermore, ancient sanctions towards religious suicide are possibly still influencing modern Hindu suicides.

AB Introduction: Ingestion of pesticides is the most common method of suicide, particularly in China, Sri Lanka and India. Reported pesticide suicides in India numbered 22,000 in the year 2006.z
   Method: Four villages in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India that had stopped using chemical pesticides in favour of non-pesticide management (NPM) were visited to assess any change in suicide incidence before and after discontinuation of chemical pesticides. Four similar villages in the same region that continued to use chemical pesticides were used as controls for comparison.
   Results: In the pesticide-free villages there were 14 suicides before introduction of NPM and only three suicides thereafter. The percentage of suicides not reported to authorities was 47%.
   Conclusion: Restriction of pesticide availability and accessibility by NPM has the potential to reduce pesticide suicides, in addition to psychosocial and health interventions.

AB Background WHO estimates that about 170 000 deaths by suicide occur in India every year, but few epidemiological studies of suicide have been done in the country. We aimed to quantify suicide mortality in India in 2010.
   Methods The Registrar General of India implemented a nationally representative mortality survey to determine the cause of deaths occurring between 2001 and 2003 in 1.1 million homes in 6671 small areas chosen randomly from all parts of India. As part of this survey, fieldworkers obtained information about cause of death and risk factors for suicide from close associates or relatives of the deceased individual. Two of 140 trained physicians were randomly allocated (stratified only by their ability to read the local language in which each survey was done) to independently and anonymously assign a cause to each death on the basis of electronic field reports. We then applied the age-specific and sex-specific proportion of suicide deaths in this survey to the 2010 UN estimates of absolute numbers of deaths in India to estimate the number of suicide deaths in India in 2010.
   Findings About 3% of the surveyed deaths (2684 of 95 335) in individuals aged 15 years or older were due to suicide, corresponding to about 187 000 suicide deaths in India in 2010 at these ages (115 000 men and 72 000 women; age-standardised rates per 100 000 people aged 15 years or older of 26.3 for men and 17.5 for women). For suicide deaths at ages 15 years or older, 40% of suicide deaths in men (45 100 of 114 800) and 56% of suicide deaths in women (40 500 of 72 100) occurred at ages 15-29 years. A 15-year-old individual in India had a cumulative risk of about 1.3% of dying before the age of 80 years by suicide; men had a higher risk (1.7%) than did women (1.0%), with especially high risks in south India (3.5% in men and 1.8% in women). About half of suicide deaths were due to poisoning (mainly ingestions of pesticides).
   Interpretation Suicide death rates in India are among the highest in the world. A large proportion of adult suicide deaths occur between the ages of 15 years and 29 years, especially in women. Public health interventions such as restrictions in access to pesticides might prevent many suicide deaths in India.

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE
AB More than three quarters of the world's suicides occur in developing countries, yet little is known about the drivers of suicidal behavior in poor populations. I study India, where one fifth of global suicides occur and suicide rates have doubled since 1980. Using nationally comprehensive panel data over 47 y, I demonstrate that fluctuations in climate, particularly temperature, significantly influence suicide rates. For temperatures above 20 degrees C, a 1 degrees C increase in a single day's temperature causes similar to 70 suicides, on average. This effect occurs only during India's agricultural growing season, when heat also lowers crop yields. I find no evidence that acclimatization, rising incomes, or other unobserved drivers of adaptation are occurring. I estimate that warming over the last 30 y is responsible for 59,300 suicides in India, accounting for 6.8% of the total upward trend. These results deliver large-scale quantitative evidence linking climate and agricultural income to selfharm in a developing country.

DE suicide; India; religion; caste; tribe
AB Background: Caste, tribal, and religious associations, which are perhaps the most important aspects of personal and social lives in India, have been neglected in Indian suicide research. Aim: To investigate suicide rates in India by religion, caste, tribe, and other backward classes over the period 2014-2015. Method: This study acquired unpublished suicide data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) for 2014 and 2015 including caste, tribal, and religious associations of suicide cases. National and state-specific suicide rates (2014-2015) were then calculated for Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, and other religious groups and for scheduled caste (SC), scheduled tribe (ST), and other backward classes (OBC). Results: The findings show higher suicide rates among Christian and other religious groups compared with Hindus and higher suicide rates among general populations compared with SC, ST, and OBC populations. However, the results varied among different regions highlighting the substantial geographical heterogeneity of suicide rates across India by caste and religion. Limitations: The suicide rates presented might be an underestimation of the true rates. Conclusion: Given the heterogeneity of minority/majority status by religion, caste, tribes, and OBC in different states, further investigation of the relationship between minority status and suicide is warranted.

AB Knowledge of suicide is made through violent epistemologies that sever self-destruction from space, time, and place. As an inherently incomprehensible issue, efforts to make sense of suicide through abstraction have the paradoxical effect of inhibiting understanding. This paper argues that the incoherences characteristic of suicide are not an obstacle for knowing, but rather a cause to accept knowledge that is partial and indirect. Thinking with assemblage, this paper develops a relational conceptualization of distance to interrogate the knowledge that shapes pesticide suicide in India; 'distancing-through-engagement' brings to light the contradictions and obscured power relations through which understandings of suicide are made.

AB Very high rates of suicide have been reported from India and the developing world. However, much of the debate on suicide prevention focuses on individuals, methods, site-specific solutions, or particular suicide prevention strategies. This article argues for population based approaches that focus on improving the general health of populations (e. g., macroeconomic policies that aim for social justice, schemes to meet basic human needs, organizing local support groups within vulnerable sections of society, developing and implementing an essential pesticide list, addressing gender issues, and increasing public awareness through the mass media) rather than medical, psychiatric, and other strategies that target individuals (e. g., treatment of mental illness, counseling, etc.) in order to reduce high suicide rates in India and developing countries. Individual approaches will help people in distress and prevent individuals from committing suicide, but will not reduce population suicide rates.

AB Suicide is actually the act to hurt oneself in a manner that it may result into death. India is the nation where the rate of suicide is increasing immensely. India comprises of 17.5% of the world population. Also worldwide, there are 800,000 people who entrust suicide every year. Of which 135,000 i.e. 17% are the one that belong to nation India. There are several causes that may result into Suicide. Also the cause of suicide varies from person to person. Terms like Suicide signify as an unsuccessful attempt to kill oneself. The main objective of the analysis is to find out and classify the major cause of Suicide in different states of India so as to provide with preventive measures on the basis of the set of different parameters such as Gender, Age, and Cause. In order to prevent it in the Future.

AB Background: This paper examines the social structures, culture, gendered roles, and their implications for suicidal behavior in South India. Exploring the cultural process within the structures of family and society to understand suicide and attempted suicide from the perspectives of survivors, mental health professionals, and traditional healers has not been achieved in the existing suicide-related research studies conducted in India to date. Aims: This study aimed to explore the cultural implications of attempted suicide by examining the survivors' life stories, their perceptions, and service providers' interpretations of problem situation. Method: A qualitative design was used drawing on constant comparison method and thematic analysis. The analysis was underpinned by the theoretical concepts of Bourdieu's work. In-depth interviews were conducted with 15 survivors of attempted suicide, eight mental health professionals, and eight traditional healers from Southern India. Results: The study found interactions among visible and invisible fields such as faith, power, control, culture, family, religion, and social systems to have strengthened the disparities in gender and role structures within families and societies and to have impacted survivors' dispositions to situations. Conclusion: The role of culture in causing suicide and attempted suicide is explained by unraveling the negative impact of interacting cultural and structural mechanisms.

AB Bt cotton is accused of being responsible for an increase of farmer suicides in India. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of evidence on Bt cotton and farmer suicides. Available data show no evidence of a 'resurgence' of farmer suicides. Moreover, Bt cotton technology has been very effective overall in India. Nevertheless, in specific districts and years, Bt cotton may have indirectly contributed to farmer indebtedness, leading to suicides, but its failure was mainly the result of the context or environment in which it was planted.

TI How Search Engine Data Enhance the Understanding of Determinants of
   Suicide in India and Inform Prevention: Observational Study
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE internet data; India; suicide; mobile phone
ID GOOGLE; DEPRESSION; INTERNET; TRENDS
AB Background: India is home to 20% of the world's suicide deaths. Although statistics regarding suicide in India are distressingly high, data and cultural issues likely contribute to a widespread underreporting of the problem. Social stigma and only recent decriminalization of suicide are among the factors hampering official agencies' collection and reporting of suicide rates.
   Objective: As the product of a data collaborative, this paper leverages private-sector search engine data toward gaining a fuller, more accurate picture of the suicide issue among young people in India. By combining official statistics on suicide with data generated through search queries, this paper seeks to: add an additional layer of information to more accurately represent the magnitude of the problem, determine whether search query data can serve as an effective proxy for factors contributing to suicide that are not represented in traditional datasets, and consider how data collaboratives built on search query data could inform future suicide prevention efforts in India and beyond.
   Methods: We combined official statistics on demographic information with data generated through search queries from Bing to gain insight into suicide rates per state in India as reported by the National Crimes Record Bureau of India. We extracted English language queries on "suicide," "depression," "hanging," "pesticide," and "poison". We also collected data on demographic information at the state level in India, including urbanization, growth rate, sex ratio, internet penetration, and population. We modeled the suicide rate per state as a function of the queries on each of the 5 topics considered as linear independent variables. A second model was built by integrating the demographic information as additional linear independent variables.
   Results: Results of the first model fit (R-2) when modeling the suicide rates from the fraction of queries in each of the 5 topics, as well as the fraction of all suicide methods, show a correlation of about 0.5. This increases significantly with the removal of 3 outliers and improves slightly when 5 outliers are removed. Results for the second model fit using both query and demographic data show that for all categories, if no outliers are removed, demographic data can model suicide rates better than query data. However, when 3 outliers are removed, query data about pesticides or poisons improves the model over using demographic data.
   Conclusions: In this work, we used search data and demographics to model suicide rates. In this way, search data serve as a proxy for unmeasured (hidden) factors corresponding to suicide rates. Moreover, our procedure for outlier rejection serves to single out states where the suicide rates have substantially different correlations with demographic factors and query rates.

TI Psychiatric comorbidity and gender differences among suicide attempters
   in Bangalore, India
SO GENERAL HOSPITAL PSYCHIATRY
LA English

ID PSYCHOPATHOLOGICAL RISK-FACTORS; REPETITION; DISORDERS; IDEATION
AB Background: Suicides are an entirely preventable cause of death, with current suicide rates being 11.4 per 100,000 population in India. The city of Bangalore in India is often called the suicide capital of India because of its high suicide and attempted suicide rate. This study attempted to evaluate the psychiatric comorbidity and gender differences among suicide attempters presenting to a general hospital in the city of Bangalore, India.
   Methods: Using a structured questionnaire [Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)-I and SCID-II], the study gathered data on the psychiatric diagnoses as well as the reasons for and mode of attempted suicides on 100 suicide attempters after taking written informed consent. In addition, the Beck Depression Inventory was also used to evaluate the severity of depression, the most commonly detected psychiatric comorbidity.
   Results: Forty-two percent of the sample had a psychiatric comorbidity, with depression (14%) and dysthymia (12%) being the most common disorders. Among personality disorders (PDs), borderline PD (5%) and dependent PD (3%) were the most commonly detected. Severe depression was detected in 15% of those with a mood disorder. Gender differences were found in both mode and reasons for attempted suicide.
   Conclusion: The presence of any psychiatric comorbidity was observed to confer a high risk of suicide. All attempters should therefore be comprehensively evaluated by a qualified health care professional, and attempts should be made for continuous follow-up. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Suicide is a major public health concern resulting in premature deaths. The six years (2010-2015) retrospective study on suicide cases reported at a tertiary care center of Warangal district, Telangana, India aims to explore the trend and determinant of suicide.
   Results: Suicide was predominant among 35- < 45 years aged males and females aged 18- < 30 years. The suicide method varied, males preferred self-poisoning while female committed suicide by self immolation. Among males a summer peak while spring peak was observed for Non-Violent and violent methods respectively. The suicide in females peaked in autumn for non-violent method while Violent suicide was observed in summer. The Joinpoint regression analysis found no significant change in the suicide rate from time period (2010-2015) in overall population or stratification by gender for Warangal district, Telangana India.
   Discussion: Suicide prevention strategies or interventions in the studied area could be initiated using the baseline data obtained during present study.

TI SUICIDE NOTES FROM INDIA AND THE UNITED STATES: A THEMATIC COMPARISON
SO DEATH STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Suicide is a global concern, hence, cross-cultural research ought to be important; yet, there is a paucity of cross-cultural study in suicidology. This study sought to investigate suicide notes drawn from India and the United States, as these countries have similar suicide rates but markedly different cultures. A thematic or theoretical-conceptual analysis of 72 suicide notes drawn from these countries, matched for age and gender, was undertaken, based on Leenaars' (1996) multidimensional model of suicide. The results suggested that there were more commonalities than differences; yet, not consistent with previous cross-cultural studies of suicide notes, Indian notes expressed more indirect expression including veiled aggression, or aggression turned inward, and unconscious dynamics. It was concluded that the model may be applicable to suicide in both countries, but also much greater study in India is warranted on collectivism and dissembling as a suicide risk factor.

AB This paper studies the impact of female property rights on male and female suicide rates in India. Using state level variation in legal changes to women's property rights, we show that better property rights for women are associated with a decrease in the difference between female and male suicide rates, but an increase in both male and female suicides. We conjecture that increasing female property rights increased conflict within household and this increased conflict resulted in more suicides among both men and women in India. Using individual level data on domestic violence we find evidence that increased property rights for women did increase the incidence of wife beating in India. A model of intra-household bargaining with asymmetric information and costly conflict is consistent with these findings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   INTERVIEW; DEATHS
AB Background
   The relative contributions of psychosocial stress and psychiatric morbidity to suicide are a subject of debate.
   Aims
   To determine major risk factors for suicide in rural south India.
   Method
   We used a matched case-control design and psychological autopsy to assess 100 consecutive suicides and 100 living controls matched for age, gender and neighbourhood.
   Results
   Thirty-seven (37%) of those who died by suicide had a DSM-III-R psychiatric diagnosis. Alcohol dependence (16%) and adjustment disorders (15%) were the most common categories. The prevalence rates for schizophrenia, major depressive episode and dysthymia were 2% each. Ongoing stress and chronic pain heightened the risk of suicide. Living alone and a break in a steady relationship within the past year were also significantly associated with suicide.
   Conclusions
   Psychosocial stress and social isolation, rather than psychiatric morbidity, are risk factors for suicide in rural south India.

Religious commitments toward life-saving value are known to prevent suicide attempts since all world religions promote unity, reducing interpersonal hostilities. Therefore, understanding the basics on what religious scriptures narrate on life and death including suicide is essential. This paper highlights the seldom discussed topic on the concept and consequences of suicide portrayed in the ancient Hindu religious scriptures.

AB We calculated mortality rates and years of life lost because of unintentional injuries and suicides using community based information obtained prospectively over a 7-year period, from 1998 to 2004, among a rural and peri-urban population of 108 000 in South India. Per 100 000 population the total mortality rate for unintentional injuries and suicides combined was 137.1, with 54.9 for unintentional injuries and 82.2 for suicides respectively. Hanging and self-poisoning with pesticides were the preferred means of suicide. Unintentional injuries and suicides resulted in 26.9% of total life years lost over the study period while 18.9% of all deaths in the population were attributable to unintentional injuries and suicides in the same period. The high burden is particularly notable in the 15-29 age group, where up to 70% of years of life lost are due to injury. The burden of injuries reported in this study is significantly higher than the figures reflected in available reports for India and is likely due to the under reporting in routine mortality statistics, particularly of suicides.

AB Suicide continues to be one of the biggest killers in the world, with suicide rates varying between 8.1 and 58.3/100,000 population for different parts of India. Andhra Pradesh, the fourth largest state in India, is responsible for more than 11% of these. Unfortunately, most suicides are under-reported and there is scant data on attempted suicides. This study aimed to comprehensively study the characteristics of attempted suicides in Andhra Pradesh and using the primary data, make secondary projections for the forthcoming years. Using Patient Care Record (PCR) forms of all emergencies serviced by 108, the first comprehensive emergency service in India, an analysis of all cases was done to detect possible suicides during the period January-December 2007. A follow up 48 hours later was then done to confirm status and diagnosis. A total of 1007 cases were recorded as confirmed suicides. Hanging and insecticide poisoning (72%) were the most common methods used. Males preferred hanging and insecticide poisoning while females preferred self-immolation and hanging as common methods. Self-immolation and insecticide poisoning had the highest mortality (41.6%). Estimates of attempted suicides for the year 2008 revealed a mean of 3.2-3.8 per 1000 population for males, 3.3-3.7 per 1000 population for females and 6.4-7.6 per 1000 population combined. A serious epidemic of suicides seems to be in store in the coming years unless preventive steps in the form of policy changes are undertaken. Restricting access to poisonous substances or prescription drugs and taking into consideration the prevailing social, economic and cultural factors could help in reducing numbers. Starting tele-help services or offering brief interventions during hospital stays are other programs which may be considered.

AB Domestic violence homicides and suicides are significant causes of deaths among women in India. This study examined characteristics and motives of various types of domestic violence-related homicides and suicides (n = 100) in India using newspaper reports (2011-2012). The majority of victims were found to be young women, mostly killed by burning or strangulation methods. The most frequently reported motive was dowry demands followed by a history of domestic violence or harassment and family conflict. The findings highlight the need for stronger prevention/intervention programs in India to identify and intervene with women at high risk for being killed or committing suicide.

TI Suicide by hanging is a priority for suicide prevention: method specific

SO JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Suicide; Hanging; Insecticide poisoning; Pesticide poisoning; India
ID MORTALITY; TRENDS; STRATEGIES; IMPACT; RATES
AB Background: India accounts for over a quarter of the global burden of suicide. One of the most effective population level suicide prevention strategies has been restricting access to suicide means.
   Method: Trends in method specific suicide rates (2001-14) were calculated using National Crime Records Bureau data stratified by sex, age-group, and geographical region. Multilevel negative binomial regression models stratified by sex and suicide method were specified to investigate associations between state-level indicators of economic development, education, agricultural pesticide use and religious factors.
   Results: Suicide by hanging increased by 56% (from 3.9 to 6.1 per 100,000) among males and by 24% (from 2.1 to 2.6 per 100,000) among females over the study period while incidence of insecticide poisoning decreased by 44% (from 2.7 to 1.5 per 100,000) among males and by 52% (from 1.7 to 0.8 per 100,000) among females. In general, states with higher levels of development, higher agricultural employment and higher literacy had higher rates of suicide for each suicide method. States with higher levels of agricultural pesticide use had higher rates of insecticide poisoning suicides.
   Limitation: Reported rates might be an underestimation of the true rates as the official data used for the analysis likely underestimates the actual number of suicide deaths in India.
   Conclusion: Responsible reporting of suicide by hanging in the media, and limiting fictional portrayals of this method may be useful areas for prevention. Further restrictions on production and sales of highly hazardous pesticides may also help with further reductions in suicide by pesticide poisoning.

AB Objectives: Suicide rates in India are among the highest in the world, resulting in an estimated 250,000 suicide deaths annually. How the media communicates with the Indian public on the topic of suicide has thus far gone without sufficient scrutiny. The objective of our study was to assess the quality of newspaper reporting of suicide-related news in India against World Health Organization suicide reporting guidelines.
   Methods: We used content analysis to assess the quality of suicide reporting against World Health Organization guidelines in nine of the most highly read daily newspapers in the southern state of Tamil Nadu between June and December 2016. Five of the nine newspapers under review were in the top 20 most circulated daily newspapers in the country.
   Results: A total of 1681 suicide articles were retrieved. The mean number of suicide articles per day per newspaper was 0.9%, and 54.5% of articles were 10 sentences or less. The vast majority (95.9%) of articles primarily focused on reporting specific suicide incidents. Harmful reporting practices were very common (e.g. a detailed suicide method was reported in 43.3% of articles), while helpful reporting practices were rare (e.g. just 2.5% gave contact details for a suicide support service).
   Conclusions: We observed that a daily diet of short and explicit suicide-related news was served up to readers of newspapers. Attempts should be made to understand the perspectives of media professionals in relation to suicide reporting, and to devise strategies to boost the positive contribution that media can make to suicide prevention.

ID VERBAL AUTOPSIES; PEOPLE; RATES
AB Background Inefficient civil registration systems, non-report of deaths, variable standards in certifying death and the legal and social consequences of suicide are major obstacles in investigating suicide in the developing world. Very high rates of suicide have been recorded in the region in the general population and among younger people.
   Objective This paper describes the suicide rate among the elderly in Kaniyambadi block, Tamil Nadu, South India for the years 1994-2002 using verbal autopsies.
   Method The setting for the study was a comprehensive community health program in a development block in rural South India. The main outcome measure was death by suicide diagnosed by a detailed verbal autopsy and census, birth and death data to identify the population base.
   Results The average annual suicide rate was 189 per 100,000 for people over 55 years of age. The ratio of male to female suicides was 1: 0.66. The age-specific suicide rate for men and women increased with age. Hanging (52%) and poisoning with organo-phosphorus compounds (39%) were the commonest methods employed for committing suicide. Significantly more women chose drowning or burning than men who preferred poisoning or hanging (chi(2) 19.75; df 1; p < 0.001).
   Conclusion The suicide rate documented in this study among the elderly is very high. The reasons for the high suicide rate observed in older people are not known. There is a need to develop innovative strategies to reduce deaths by suicide. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

DT Article
ID GENDER; WOMEN; AUSTRALIA; EQUALITY; RATES
AB The traditional view that modernization is likely to increase male vulnerability to suicide while protecting females from such self-destruction was offered by Durkheim (1951). This implies a theory of divergence of suicide rates such that the male-female suicide ratio should increase with modernization. Contemporary researchers have questioned whether modernization has had such an impact. We conducted a time series analysis of male and female suicide data to determine the impact on the suicide ratio for India for the years 1967 to 1997. We developed a modernization index comprised of urbanization, female literacy, and female work participation rates. Moreover, to improve methodological efficacy, we controlled for the passage of time. However, we found that there is no significant relationship between modernization and the male-female suicide ratio. Our conclusion is that using national male-female suicide ratios to determine modernization effects may mask significant regional gender and age differences, particularly in developing countries such as India.

ID DEPRESSION; SCALE
AB There were more than 800000 suicides per year throughout the globe and it is second leading cause of death among the age group of 15-25. National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB, 2014) reported that on an average more than one tenth of a million commit suicides per annum that indicate 15 suicides per hour, pushing India to the top position in the wood. Suicide had emerged as one of the leading causes of deaths in India and around the world (WHO, 2012). Suicide was mainly linked to mental disorders but recent evidence indicates that normal people take their life due to impulsiveness and easy access to means to end life (WHO, 2012). Even though it is one of leading cause of death in India it is not considered as a serious public health (WHO, 2012) issue. The first objective of the study was to find the reasons for stress among working professionals leading to suicide ideation, which can comprehend to factors leading to suicides and second objective was to establish the relation between suicide stresses and ideation. Suicidal behavior proposed similar model whereby suicidal behavior is associated with socio-cultural, developmental, psychiatric, psychological and family factors. Bonner & Rich (1987) also found similar results as the current study which indicates that Social stress, Economical, Health and Family stress have the significant and positive relationship with suicide ideation and the model predicts 83% of the variance.

AB Threats posed by land degradation and desertification continue to destabilize India's agriculture productivity and food security. The enduring negative environmental consequences of the agricultural intensification that started during the 1960s have further contributed to the depletion of soil nutrients in farmlands through heavy input of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. More than half of India's population depends on farming. When crop productivity fails, the economically-depressed farmers are unfortunately pushed toward suicide. The news of farmers committing mass suicide in Maharashtra state of India has lately received world attention. Although suicide may involve various psychological, social and economic factors, access to irrigation water remains a contentious matter in the agriculture business. The groundwater (GW) data from government sources are limited and not displayed in the public domain for verification. Hence, this study used the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data to compare farmer suicide rate in Maharashtra with GW storage estimates at broad spatiotemporal scales. The results show significant correlations (r = -0.85, p < 0.005) between water storage and suicide rate when time lags of 2 years are introduced between them. Based on the new findings, this study recommends that the GW status needs to be monitored scientifically across India's suicide zone. By doing so, the worst case scenarios can be logically predicted well in advance. The government then may have the advantage to mobilize its resources on the ground to implement rapid emergency measures and farmer consultations to minimize future farmer suicide cases.

TI Mass media representation of suicide in a high suicide state in India:
   an epidemiological comparison with suicide deaths in the population
SO BMJ OPEN
LA English
DT Article
ID TAIWAN; TRENDS; ACTS
AB Objectives Suicide rates in India are among the highest in the world, equating to over 200?000 suicides annually. Reports of suicides are a routine feature in major newspapers in India, and reporters may selectively present 'newsworthy' suicide stories. The aim of this paper was to systematically investigate whether mass media reports of suicides reflect the epidemiological data on suicide in a high suicide state in India.
   Design We undertook a content analysis study to extract sociodemographic data on suicides reported among nine of the most highly read daily newspapers in the high suicide southern state of Tamil Nadu between June and December 2016. A total of 1258 newspaper articles were retrieved containing reports on 1631 suicides. Two-tailed binomial tests on aggregate frequencies assessed whether the sociodemographic characteristics of suicides in the newspaper articles were different to the population suicide statistics for Tamil Nadu.
   Results We identified some statistically significant discrepancies between suicide characteristics in the population and the media. Suicides involving females (p<0.001), those aged under 30 years (p<0.001), separated or widowed males (p<0.001), unmarried females (p<0.001), those using methods with a higher case fatality rate (ie, hanging (p<0.001), jumping off high structures (p<0.001) and coming under vehicles (p<0.001) and those who were students (p<0.001) or working in the agricultural sector (p<0.001) were significantly over-reported relative to their occurrence in the broader population. Suicides involving men (p<0.001), those aged over 30 years and above (p<0.001), those who were married and suicides by poisoning (p<0.001) were significantly under-reported relative to their occurrence in the broader population.
   Conclusions The suicide characteristics in the print media were not entirely representative of suicides in the broader Tamil Nadu population, which may lead the general public to develop misunderstandings about suicide in their state. The discrepancies we identified will inform tailored suicide prevention education for media professionals.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE suicide rate; verbal autopsy; Tamil Nadu; India; injuries
ID SRI-LANKA; CHINA
AB Background In India, death registration is not complete, especially in rural areas. Chiefly for other purposes special efforts were made to identify all deaths that occurred during 1997-98 in rural areas of one of the districts in Tamil Nadu, South India, and the verbal autopsy was done.
   Methods Trained non-medical field interviewers interviewed surviving spouses, close associates or neighbours, and wrote the verbal autopsy reports in the local language (Tamil). The reports were reviewed independently by two physicians to arrive at the probable underlying cause of death. About 5% of the data were randomly selected for re-interview.
   Results The verbal autopsy was done for 38 836 deaths. injuries accounted for 18.5% of the total deaths. About half of these were suicides. The average annual suicide rate for men and women were 71 and 53/100 000, respectively. Three-fourths of all suicides were in the socially and economically productive age-group of 15-44 years. At ages 15-24 years the female suicide rate of 109/100 000 exceeded the male rate of 78/100 000; suicide was responsible for 49% of all deaths in women and 38% of all deaths in men at these ages.
   Conclusions This is the second largest study to date that has used verbal autopsy to estimate mortality rates in India. Suicides accounted for 9% of total deaths, and the ratio of male to female suicide was 1: 0.72. The overall (male + female) annual suicide rate was 62/100 000 population. The female suicide rate at ages 15-24 years was higher than the male rate in that age-group and other female age-groups. About 50% of suicides were by self-poisoning, one-third by hanging and one-eighth by self-immolation.

AB The main purpose of the study was to conduct a comprehensive needs assessment of primary healthcare professionals in order to develop a training program aimed at enhancing competencies in suicide risk assessment and management. A total of 144 primary healthcare professionals (physicians = 46; primary care workers = 98) completed the needs assessment questionnaire. The majority of healthcare professionals rated their level of comfort and competence in assessing, treating, and referring suicidal patients as medium or high. However, their knowledge about suicide, risk factors for suicide, asking about suicidal behaviour, and helping a suicidal patient was rated low or medium. Overall, the scarcity of qualified healthcare professionals and the existing gaps in core competencies for suicide risk assessment and management was identified. Development of innovative and effective competencies-based suicide specific training for primary care providers in India is urgently required.

ID GUIDELINES; COVERAGE; RATES
AB Background: Suicide is a grave mental health problem in India, and suicide rates in India have risen over the past decades. Suicide reporting by the media is a common cause for spurts of suicides that may occur from time to time. The aim of the present study was to assess the change in trends in media reporting of suicide after a celebrity suicide.
   Methodology: Suicide by the renowned actor Robin Williams was selected as the reference case. The top three Indian daily newspapers published in English having the highest circulation as per the Registrar of Newspapers, Government of India report were selected to be scanned in the study. These were the Times of India -Mumbai edition, Mumbai Mirror, and the Daily News Analysis -Mumbai edition. The authors screened all news stories in the three newspapers within a 6-month period (3 months prior and 3 months post the date of the reference suicide case), and these news reports were evaluated as per the suicide reporting guidelines for media laid down by the Indian Psychiatric Society. The data were analyzed using Chi-square test and descriptive statistics where appropriate.
   Results: A total of 708 newspaper articles were identified on the basis of the guidelines mentioned above. Nearly 88% (n = 623) of the articles directly covered suicide while 4.09% (n = 29) focused on suicidal threats and 7.91% (n = 56) focused on parasuicide behavior. There was a significantly greater increase in the total number of articles printed after the celebrity suicide (n = 409) for all article types except teasers as compared to that before the celebrity suicide (n = 299). There was a significantly greater increase in front page news on suicide after the celebrity suicide (P = 0.0016), description of the method of suicide (P = 0.0221), and the mention of the suicide notes (P = 0.0002). Most articles after the celebrity suicide placed the blame on someone or the environment for the act (P = 0.0001).
   Conclusions: A change in media trend toward reporting suicide was noted post a celebrity suicide, and it is important that media follow guidelines stringently when reporting a serious problem like suicide.

AB Background: This paper investigates trends in suicide rate, the reasons for and means of suicide and the occupation of deceased, to prioritize suicide prevention activities in India and to highlight the limitations to data quality for surveillance.
   Methods: Data available in the public domain from the National Crimes Record Bureau (NCRB) were analysed from 2001 to 2010 at the national and sub-national levels, split by age groups and sex for ages 15 years and above.
   Results: The reported suicide rate was 14.9 and 15.4 suicides per 100 000 population in 2001 and 2010, respectively. More developed states reported significantly higher suicide rates than the less developed (mean 20.5 versus 8.16), but neither experienced large changes over time. Among males, the reported suicide rate changed slightly (17.8 to 19.5); it remained almost similar for females (11.9 to 11.1). Housewives accounted for the highest proportion of suicide deaths over the decade. Distribution of the reasons for suicide remained almost constant over time; most suicides (33.7%) were due to personal/social reasons, followed by health at 24.3% and unknown reasons at 16.4%; differences were observed between the more and less developed states. Marriage-related suicides were higher for females, and health reasons increased with increasing age. Nationally, poison/overdose with drugs/pesticides was the leading means of suicide through the decade, although the gap between this and hanging decreased over time. The state level data showed considerable heterogeneity in the quality of data across the indicators assessed.
   Conclusions: These data provide a range of information to identify vulnerable groups, to formulate appropriate suicide prevention strategies. Addressing the limitations in data quality would facilitate further utility of surveillance data to prevent suicides.

TI Female equality and suicide in the Indian states
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS

DT Article
ID DEVELOPMENT INDEX; GENDER
AB Indian suicide rates rose by 76% in the 10 years between 1984 and 1994. In this study of the 16 principal states of India, male and female suicide rates in 1994 were associated with measures of equal education for men and women. Male suicide rates were associated with equal life expectancy for men and women. Equal income for women and men was not associated with suicide rates. Unlike earlier studies, no inverse association was found between equal attainment in education and suicide sex ratios. The Indian findings thus do not conform to patterns found in more developed economies. Given increasing human development in India, it seems probable that suicide rates in that country may increase two to three times over coming decades.

ID VERBAL AUTOPSY; ANXIETY DISORDERS; ADULT DEATHS; SOUTH-INDIA; MORTALITY;
   INTERVENTION; RATES
AB ObjectivesTo determine the proportion of deaths attributable to suicides in rural Andhra Pradesh, India over a 4-year period using a verbal autopsy method.
   MethodsDeaths occurring in 45 villages (population 185629) were documented over a 4-year period from 2003 to 2007 by non-physician healthcare workers trained in the use of a verbal autopsy tool. Causes of death were assigned by physicians trained in the International Classification of Diseases, version 10. All data were entered and processed electronically using a secure study website.
   ResultsVerbal autopsies were completed for 98.2% (5786) of the deaths (5895) recorded. The crude death rate was 8.0/1000. 4.8% (95% CI 4.3-5.4) of all deaths were suicides, giving a suicide rate of 37.5/100000 population. Forty-three percent of suicides occurred in the age group 15-29years, and 62% were in men. In the younger age groups (10-29years), suicides by women (56%) were more common than by men (44%). Poisoning (40%) was the most common method of self-harm followed by hanging (12%).
   ConclusionThe suicide rate in this part of rural Andhra Pradesh is three times higher than the national average of 11.2/100000, but is in line with that reported in the Million Death Study. There is an urgent need to develop strategies targeted at young individuals to prevent deaths by suicide in India.

AB Background A systematic understanding of suicide mortality trends over time at the subnational level for India's 1.3 billion people, 18% of the global population, is not readily available. Thus, we aimed to report time trends of suicide deaths, and the heterogeneity in its distribution between the states of India from 1990 to 2016.
   Methods As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016, we estimated suicide death rates (SDRs) for both sexes in each state of India from 1990 to 2016. We used various data sources for estimating cause-specific mortality in India. For suicide mortality in India before 2000, estimates were based largely on GBD covariates. For each state, we calculated the ratio of the observed SDR to the rate expected in geographies globally with similar GBD Socio-demographic Index in 2016 (ie, the observed-to-expected ratio); and assessed the age distribution of suicide deaths, and the men-to-women ratio of SDR over time. Finally, we assessed the probability for India and the states of reaching the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of a one-third reduction in SDR from 2015 to 2030, using location-wise trends of the age-standardised SDR from 1990 to 2016. We calculated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for the point estimates.
   Findings There were 230 314 (95% UI 194 058-250 260) suicide deaths in India in 2016. India's contribution to global suicide deaths increased from 25.3% in 1990 to 36.6% in 2016 among women, and from 18.7% to 24.3% among men. Age-standardised SDR among women in India reduced by 26.7% from 20.0 (95% UI 16.5-23.5) in 1990 to 14.7 (13.1-16.2) per 100 000 in 2016, but the age-standardised SDR among men was the same in 1990 (22.3 [95% UI 14.4-27.4] per 100 000) and 2016 (21.2 [14.6-23.6] per 100 000). SDR in women was 2.1 times higher in India than the global average in 2016, and the observed-to-expected ratio was 2.74, ranging from 0.45 to 4.54 between the states. SDR in men was 1.4 times higher in India than the global average in 2016, with an observed-to-expected ratio of 1.31, ranging from 0.40 to 2.42 between the states. There was a ten-fold variation between the states in the SDR for women and six-fold variation for men in 2016. The men-to-women ratio of SDR for India was 1.34 in 2016, ranging from 0.97 to 4.11 between the states. The highest age-specific SDRs among women in 2016 were for ages 15-29 years and 75 years or older, and among men for ages 75 years or older. Suicide was the leading cause of death in India in 2016 for those aged 15-39 years; 71.2% of the suicide deaths among women and 57.7% among men were in this age group. If the trends observed up to 2016 continue, the probability of India achieving the SDG SDR reduction target in 2030 is zero, and the majority of the states with 81.3% of India's population have less than 10% probability, three states have a probability of 10.3-15.0%, and six have a probability of 25.1-36.7%.
   Interpretation India's proportional contribution to global suicide deaths is high and increasing. SDR in India is higher than expected for its Socio-Demographic Index level, especially for women, with substantial variations in the magnitude and men-to-women ratio between the states. India must develop a suicide prevention strategy that takes into account these variations in order to address this major public health problem. Copyright (c) 2018 The Author(s).

ID VERBAL AUTOPSIES
AB Background: Inefficient civil registration systems, non-report of deaths, variable standards in certifying death and the legal and social consequences of suicide are major obstacles to investigating suicide in the developing world.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to prospectively determine the suicide rate in Kaniyambadi Block, Tamil Nadu, South India, for the years 2000-2002 using verbal autopsies.
   Method: The setting for the study was a comprehensive community health programme in a development block in rural South India. The main outcome measure was death by suicide, diagnosed by a detailed verbal autopsy and census, and birth and death data to identify the population base.
   Results: The average suicide rate was 92.1 per 100,000. The ratio of male to female suicides was 1:0.66. The age-specific suicide rate for men increased with age while that for women showed two peaks: 15-24 years and over 65 years of age. Hanging (49%) and poisoning with organo-phosphorus compounds (40.5%) were the commonest methods of committing suicide. Acute and/or chronic stress was elicited for nearly all subjects. More men suffered from chronic stress while more women had acute precipitating events (chi(2) = 4.58; p < 0.04). People less than 44 years of age had more acute precipitating events before death while older subjects reported more chronic stress (chi(2) = 17.38; p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: The study replicates findings of an earlier study from the area. The suicide rate documented in this study is very high and is a major public health concern. There is a need for sentinel centres in India and in developing countries to monitor trends and to develop innovative strategies to reduce deaths by suicide.

ID RATES
AB Different rates of suicide have been reported in India. In Vellore, southern India, we have noted that the rates of suicides are several fold higher than those reported anywhere in the world, especially in young women. The department of community health at the Christian Medical College, Vellore, has obtained data prospectively on births, deaths, and morbidity in a population of 108000. We used the verbal autopsy method to assign cause of death. The mortality rates were analysed for 10 years, from 1992 to 2001, for the age-group 10-19 years. Suicides accounted for about a quarter of all deaths in young men and between 50% and 75% of all deaths in young women. The average suicide rate for young women was 148 per 100000, and for young men 58 per 100000. We believe that our findings are reliable. The system of surveillance is well established and the verbal autopsy method has been validated. These very high rates of suicide need urgent intervention.

DE Kerala; farmers' suicides; local state; ethnography; party politics;
   agrarian ecology; liberalisation
ID SOUTH-INDIA; COTTON
AB This article reflects on the challenge of making 'farmers' suicides' an object of ethnographic enquiry. This challenge is not just a matter of methods, ethics and access but also a matter of categorical choices involved in studying this over-determined and politicised category of self-killing. Drawing on fieldwork in the Wayanad district of Kerala, the article argues that 'farmers' suicides' are not self-evident types of rural death, but become reified and visible through the state's enumerative practices. This state-defined category, conveyed and scandalised by the media, rests on a connection between suicide and-aan equally reified-'agrarian crisis'. The ethnographic endeavour of 'chasing' the elusive object of farmers' suicides may destabilise this seemingly self-evident link. Despite this, farmers' suicides have taken on a political life of their own. They have become a constructed yet real interface for the reworking of the relationship between state and rural citizens in liberalising India. The Indian state has launched unprecedented relief and rehabilitation measures in response to the suicide crisis. This article makes a strong case for grounding the study of farmers' suicides in ethnographies of agrarian practice and the local developmental state.

An attempt is made to address this subset of suicides during 2001-2014. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data for this study were collected from the Indian National Crime Bureau Record, cancer registry publication in open domain, and published literature. Trends in the number of suicides associated with state, age groups, genders, and years were the only available parameters. Using these data, descriptive statistics of the rate of suicides, linear trend with age groups, gender, and geographical divisions are presented. RESULTS: During the study period of 14 years, 1,721,946 suicides with an average of 122,996 suicides per year were observed. One in five suicides was related to illness. In total, a sum of 10,421 cancer-related suicides were noted accounting a mean of 744 suicides per year. Males were commonly involved than females. The commonly involved age group was 45-59 years. Southern parts of India had more instances of cancer-related suicides. Among Indian states, West Bengal reported the highest of such instances. DISCUSSION: Suicide trends among Indians living with cancer during 2001-2014 are presented. The possible causes behind this phenomenon and implications are presented. The effect of changes in the trends in terms of geographical distribution, age group distribution, and gender dynamics is presented and discussed in this context. CONCLUSION: Suicide among PLWC is a multi-dimensional, complex phenomenon, orchestrated by several factors, including mental health. The nascent field of psycho-oncology in India needs to explore this through large scale validated studies.

AB This paper investigates the impact of socio-economic triggers on mental health outcomes, proxied by male and female suicide rates. For that purpose we estimate a fixed effects panel data model of 15 major Indian states over the years 1992-2009. Our results show that urbanization and crimes against women increase suicide rates, regardless of gender. Literacy and gross enrolment decrease suicide rates for women but have exactly the opposite effect for men while poverty has a general negative effect on both male and female suicide rates. Unemployment is observed to be not affecting the suicide rate. Adequate explanations for these impacts are provided and policy implications drawn. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In the past years, farmers suicide in India has become a major problem and denotes a social ill that could lead to a national tragedy. This article seeks to explain the phenomenon of suicide among Indian farmers. The article focuses only on economic factors to explain suicides. We have constructed a theoretical model, based on the assumptions which show that over-indebtedness, price of inputs, and uncertainty of the return on the technology used by the farmers can cause suicide. Therefore, we assume that over-indebtedness has a negative impact on the livelihood of Indian farmers and on their capacity to repay the debt. Consequently, an assumption is made between suicide and the decrease of utility on one side and suicide and an increase in prices for inputs on the other side. Ultimately, suicide becomes a rational and optimal choice that improves well-being in the sense that farmers are relieved from all burdens of material life.

AB India is a country in which agriculture plays a wide role with around 70% of its population is dependent on agriculture good in direct or indirect way. The agricultural sector contributes about 14% to GDP of India. As the population is increasing, demand for crops is also increasing day by day. About all suicides in India farmer suicide accounts for 11.2%. There are many reasons given for farmer suicides like inadequate monsoon rainfall, interest rate is high, certain government policies are not in welfare, mental health issues, personal and family problems. It is also noticed that even the states are responsible for manipulating certain statistics. this research work uses data mining clustering technique to group attributes that results in low crop production. Case studies are conducted to map and co-relate the low crop production, monsoon factors along with farmer suicidal data. The states are affected most is identified and further analysed.

TI Is Hinduism ambivalent about suicide?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE Hinduism; suicide; religion; India
AB Background: Hinduism is one of the oldest religions in the world and has over 1.1billion adherents comprising about 16% of the global population living mainly in India and Nepal. The stand of Hinduism on suicide has been ambiguous through the ages, on one hand, condemning general suicides, while condoning religious suicides on the other. This ambiguity is reflected in contemporary India and among the Indian diaspora.
   Aims: To examine the stand of Hinduism as a religion in the context of suicide.
   Method: A selected review of literature covering the major Hindu religious texts, cultural practices and suicide.
   Results: People who follow Hinduism have a suicide rate of about 21 per 100,000 population compared to the global average of 11.4. Hindu countries have higher rates of suicide compared to Islamic and Christian countries, but these rates are lower when compared to Atheist and Buddhist countries. This is reflected in the Indian diaspora as well with reports from Fiji, the Caribbean, Malaysia and the United Kingdom, indicating that suicide was disproportionately high among those of Indian origin. However, a strong faith in Hinduism acts as protective factor. The Hindu belief in karma fosters a sense of acceptance of the vicissitudes of life with equanimity, and the belief in the cycle of births and deaths renders suicide meaningless, as one's soul continues after death. Their religious beliefs makes the Hindus tolerate and accept hardships and calamities stoically.
   Conclusion: In certain situations, the Hindu religion acts as a protective factor, whereas at other times, it may increase the risk of suicide. It is important to understand these different nuances in the Hindu religion in formulating a culturally appropriate suicide prevention strategy.

AB Background: Studies conducted in several countries have found an increase in suicide rates in custody than the general population.
   Aims: The aim was to assess the trends of suicide in custody and to identify characteristics.
   Materials and Methods: We examined all available files of the death of people in custody through 2001 to 2010. Information collected included age, sex, type of custody, place of death, presence of any associated disease, history of any psychiatric illness, substance abuse, and cause of death.
   Results: A total 173 autopsies was performed out of which 14 cases were of suicide. The mean age was 31.71 years. 71.42% deaths were noted in police lock-ups while 28.57% were recorded in prison. Hanging was the common method of suicide followed by poisoning.
   Conclusion: Suicide in custodial setting is preventable problem in India. Preventing suicide in custody needs cooperation and coordination from various agencies.

   Maharashtra, India
SO ANNALS OF INDIAN PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE Farmers' suicide; psychological distress; suicide survivor
AB Background: Survivors of suicide experience psychological distress for years after suicide. In India, farmers' suicide survivors are special group, with unique set of stressors. There are very few studies examining this group in India. The objective was to assess psychological distress and its correlates in survivors of farmers' suicides. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study from two districts of Marathwada region of Maharashtra. A predesigned and pretested semi-structured questionnaire to assess sociodemographic variables was used. Self-reporting questionnaire-20 was administered to evaluate psychological distress in 93 survivors of farmers' suicides. Standard descriptive statistics (percentages, means, and Chi-square test) were used. Results: Female-to-male ratio was 2.8:1. Majority (76%) survivors were young adults and 97.8% were from rural area. Most survivors assessed in study were spouse (68.8%) followed by parents (9.6%), siblings (2.2%), progeny, and others (19.35%) of suicide victims. Of all survivors, 75% were doing farming, while rest had other sources of income in addition to farming. Out of 93 survivors, 81.7% of survivors were experiencing significant psychological distress. Twenty-eight percent survivors themselves had thought of ending their life during 1 month prior to assessment. Most commonly, distress was expressed through somatic symptoms and depressed mood. There was no significant correlation of psychological distress with age, sex, occupation, and place of residence of survivors. There was no significant correlation between psychological distress and relationship of survivor with suicide victim. Conclusions: Survivors of farmers' suicides are suffering from significant psychological distress. Suicide ideation was present in significant number of them. The current situation needs urgent psychological intervention to alleviate their suffering.

TI Mahatma Gandhi's view on euthanasia and assisted suicide
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
ID PALLIATIVE CARE; INDIA
AB To many in India and elsewhere, the life and thoughts of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi are a source of inspiration. The idea of non-violence was pivotal in his thinking. In this context, Gandhi reflected upon the possibility of what is now called 'euthanasia' and 'assisted suicide'. So far, his views on these practices have not been properly studied. In his reflections on euthanasia and assisted suicide, Gandhi shows himself to be a contextually flexible thinker. In spite of being a staunch defender of non-violence, Gandhi was aware that violence may sometimes be unavoidable. Under certain conditions, killing a living being could even be an expression of non-violence. He argued that in a few rare cases it may be better to kill people who are suffering unbearably at the end of life. In this way, he seems to support euthanasia and assisted suicide. Yet, Gandhi also thought that as long as care can be extended to a dying patient, his or her suffering could be relieved. Since in most cases relief was thus possible, euthanasia and assisted suicide were in fact redundant. By stressing the importance of care and nursing as an alternative to euthanasia and assisted suicide, Gandhi unconsciously made himself an early advocate of palliative care in India. This observation could be used to strengthen and promote the further development of palliative care in India.

AB This paper appraises the public health burden of mortality in India caused by the practice of dowry and examines the association of some demographic and socio-economic factors with dowry deaths and dowry-related suicides. The paper is based on the data available on the public domains of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), third National Family Health and Survey-2005-06, Planning Commission of India and Census of India 2001. In 2007, the total number of dowry deaths and dowry-related suicides reported in India were 8093 and 3148, respectively. There was a 74% increase in dowry-related deaths from 1995 to 2007, while there was a 31% increase in the reporting of dowry-related suicides. Occurrence of dowry deaths has significant association with some demographic and socio-economic variables. The data reveal that the status of women is undesirable, and the burden of mortality and related morbidity is enormous. There should be a national injury surveillance system and reliable estimates of dowry-related homicides. However, available information can be used to design and implement some counter-measures to prevent dowry-related violence and deaths. The study warrants the undertaking of research to give insights into circumstances and triggers of such violence, the healthcare seeking of these victims, bottlenecks in seeking health care and reporting to the police.

AB A study is presented aimed at discovering the prime factors that affect the number of suicides in certain regions of India in the year 2011 and subsequently using them to predict the number of suicides in the future. This prediction of suicides can help in making governing decisions in the affected regions such as promoting education and reworking existing facilities. The features in the study refer primarily to the part of the population which are affected most by suicides. Measures can be taken to reduce the number of suicides in the regions by setting up suicide preventive centers and targeting the affected population with special suicide preventive measures such as psychiatric counselling. The Indian government maintains a database of the reported suicide cases in each region of India; this is made public for the purpose of data analytics. Along with number of suicides for each of the considered states, the demo-graphical features of that state were used as features for creation of the model.The three categories of the dataset are census data, marital status data and educational status data of the states. Pearson correlation was computed to determine the strength of the features on the number of suicides and then linear regression was used to develop a model for the prediction of number of suicides. The results obtained were remarkable, 9 features were found to have a significant linear relationship with number of suicides. The prediction model developed using these 9 features gave us a linear fit close to 99.8% and prediction accuracy of 99.1%. Hence from this study a more meaningful insight on which section of the Indian population is most affected by suicides was obtained, this is an invaluable statistic for focusing preventive measures and making major governing decisions for different regions of the country. The number of suicides for anytime in the future can be predicted by the linear model developed here, which can serve as a measure for evaluating the effectiveness of different policy decisions and also that of various suicide preventive measures that are undertaken by NGOs or the government.

ID KANIYAMBADI BLOCK; TAMIL-NADU; RATES
AB Background. Studies from India have reported high rates of suicide. We aimed to understand the social and cultural factors that modulate the risks related to suicide.
   Methods. Focus group discussions were conducted with community health workers (I group) and members of the public (6 groups). In-depth interviews were also conducted with 5 people who had attempted suicide and survived. The interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The results were summarized and analysed using standard procedures.
   Results. The most common causes for suicide were interpersonal and family problems, and financial difficulties. Mental illness was also reported as causal. All 5 subjects who had attempted suicide mentioned marital and family discord as the cause. The majority of the general population and all the subjects who had attempted suicide were not aware of any community and support services for the prevention of suicide.
   Conclusion. Our study reveals that people perceived suicide as an option to overcome interpersonal, family and financial stress among normal individuals as well as those with mental illness. Healthcare providers should place greater emphasis on educating the general public regarding the policies and services available for suicide prevention.

   cash-crop farmers with marginal landholdings explain state-level
   variation in suicide rates
SO GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH
LA English

DE Farmers' suicides; Agrarian crisis; India; Marginal farmers; Cash crops;
   Indebtedness

AB Background: A recent Lancet article reported the first reliable estimates of suicide rates in India. National-level suicide rates are among the highest in the world, but suicide rates vary sharply between states and the causes of these differences are disputed. We test whether differences in the structure of agricultural production explain inter-state variation in suicides rates. This hypothesis is supported by a large number of qualitative studies, which argue that the liberalization of the agricultural sector in the early-1990s led to an agrarian crisis and that consequently farmers with certain socioeconomic characteristics-cash crops cultivators, with marginal landholdings, and debts-are at particular risk of committing suicide. The recent Lancet study, however, contends that there is no evidence to support this hypothesis.
   Methods: We report scatter diagrams and linear regression models that combine the new state-level suicide rate estimates and the proportion of marginal farmers, cash crop cultivation, and indebted farmers.
   Results: When we include all variables in the regression equation there is a significant positive relationship between the percentage of marginal farmers, cash crop production, and indebted farmers, and suicide rates. This model accounts for almost 75% of inter-state variation in suicide rates. If the proportion of marginal farmers, cash crops, or indebted farmers were reduced by 1%, the suicide rate-suicides per 100,000 per year-would fall by 0 . 437, 0 . 518 or 0 . 549 respectively, when all other variables are held constant.
   Conclusions: Even if the Indian state is unable to enact land reforms due to the power of local elites, interventions to stabilize the price of cash crops and relieve indebted farmers may be effective at reducing suicide rates.

AB Farmers' suicide in India is a cause of concern and government figures, though conservative, predict an impending epidemic. Various measures to curb this calamity are being made in a piecemeal manner. Considering it as an issue of social and mental health concern, this article attempts to evaluate the situation based on the tenet that health and illness are the result of a complex interplay between biological, psychological, social, environmental, economic and political factors. Thus in India the agrarian crisis, among other causes, has been largely debated as the major reason for the current state of farmers. It is important that (psychiatric) epidemiology and public mental health try to evolve mechanisms to understand and implement measures, and take this into consideration when attempting health promotion and prevention.

   India: A review of definitions and research

DT Review
DE Interpersonal theory of suicide; Self-directed violent behavior;
   Suicidal behavior; Non-suicidal self-injury; Definitions
ID INTERPERSONAL THEORY; SUICIDAL-BEHAVIOR; ADULTS; YOUNG
AB The interpersonal theory of suicide suggests that most forms of self-directed violent behaviors lie on a continuum, with each behavior successively increasing the capability of committing suicide. There is increasing evidence to suggest that the continuum may begin with Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI). This theory can be important in developing interventions for suicide prevention. However, in India, consistent usage of definitions of various forms of self-directed violent behaviors is lacking. In the present study, we reviewed definitions of various forms of self-directed violent behaviors that have been investigated in India. Further, we compared the usage of these definitions with the usage by WHO. Additionally, we reviewed NSSI research in India. Thirty-eight publications were identified by a comprehensive electronic search undertaken in Indian psychiatry, psychology, and mental health-related databases. Inconsistent definitions of eight self-directed violent behaviors were observed in Indian literature. Agreement on consistent definitions of various forms of self-directed behaviors is essential. Based on the findings of the current review, it can be suggested that culturally relevant large-scale research on NSSI in India is required to confirm the limited evidence that suggests high prevalence of NSSI in India.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Background: Suicide is one of the leading causes of preventable deaths. Recent data suggest South India as one of the regions with highest suicide rates in the world. In 2013, 134,799 people committed suicide in India according to the statistics released by the National Crime Records Bureau. Suicide note is one of the most important sources to understand suicide, which may be beneficial in suicide prevention. Studies on suicidal notes from this part of the world are sparse.
   Objective: The aim was to study the themes in suicide notes that might be useful in prevention strategies.
   Materials and Methods: A descriptive study of all suicide notes of those individuals who committed suicide between 2010 and 2013 available with Police Department, Mysore district was obtained and analyzed.
   Results: A total of 22 suicide note were available. A majority of suicide note was in age group of 16-40 years (86%) and most were men (59%). All suicide notes were handwritten, the majority (70%) in regional language Kannada. Length of notes varied from just few words to few pages. Contents of suicide notes included apology/shame/guilt (80%), love for those left behind (55%) and instruction regarding practical affairs (23%). Most have blamed none for the act (50%). 23% mentioned that they are committing suicide to prove their innocence. 32% mentioned a last wish.
   Conclusion: The majority of suicidal note contained "guilt" which is a strong indicator of possible depression in deceased. Creating awareness about suicide among public and ensuring access to professionals trained in suicide prevention is need of the hour in this part of the world.

TI Tales of Decline: Reading Social Pathology into Individual Suicide in
   South India
SO CULTURE MEDICINE AND PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE Suicide; Social pathology; Social suffering; Public health discourse
AB In the south Indian state of Kerala, the nation's so-called suicide capital, suicide can often appear self-evident in meaning and motivation to casual onlookers and experts alike. Drawing on explanatory accounts, rumors, and speculative tales of suicide collected between 2004 and 2007, this article explores the ontological power of certain deaths to assert themselves as always-already known on the basis of perceived and reported demographic patterns of suicide. I demonstrate the ways suicides are commonly read, less through the distinct details of their individual case presentations than "up" to broader scales of social pathology. Shaped by the intertwined histories of public health intervention and state taxonomic knowledge in India, these "epidemic readings" of suicide enact a metonymy between individual suffering and ideas of collective decline that pushes the suicide case to fit-and thus to stand for-aggregate trends at the level of populations. Focusing on how family navigated the generic meanings and motivations ascribed to the deaths of their loved ones, I argue that the ability of kin to resist, collude with, or strategically deploy epidemic readings in their search for truth and closure hinged significantly on their classed fluency in the social, legal, and bureaucratic discourses of suicide.

Suicidal ideation and behavior is known to be influenced by various socio-economic and psychological factors. The method employed for suicide is also influenced by the occupation of the victim. We report a case where a snake charmer had attempted suicide by inflicting a bite by a monocled cobra.

AB Background: Globally, suicide is an important cause of mortality. In low- and middle income settings, it is difficult to find unequivocal data to establish suicide rates. The objective of this review is to synthesize the reporting of suicide incidence in six south Asian countries.
   Methods: We conducted a scoping review combining peer-reviewed studies (PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE) with in-country searches for grey literature in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, India, Nepal and Bangladesh. The review included mapping reported suicide rates, quality appraisals of the studies, use of definitions of suicide and means of committing suicide.
   Results: In total, 114 studies and reports were included in the review, including 50 peer-reviewed publications. Reported suicide rates varied widely from 0.43/100,000 to 331.0/100,000. The average suicide rate across studies was found to be high compared to the world average, however many studies were of poor quality or not representative. The majority of studies failed to explicitly define suicide (84% of the published articles and 92% of the grey literature documents). Poisoning and hanging were consistently the most common methods of committing suicide on the sub-continent.
   Conclusions: The reported suicide rates in South Asia are high compared to the global average, but there is a paucity of reliable data on suicide rates in South Asia. Reports are likely to diminish rather than exaggerate the magnitude of suicide rates. There is an urgent need to establish new, or evaluate existing, national suicide surveillance systems in the South Asian countries.

AB Ritual self-immolation has long been practiced in India. Although in the past the practice has been related to the act of sati, it is currently more commonly associated with dowry disputes. In India, dowries are a continuing series of gifts endowed before and after the marriage. When dowry expectations are not met, the young bride may be killed or compelled to commit suicide, most frequently by burning. In a cohort of 152 burned wives, 32 (21%) were immolation suicides and these cases were analyzed from both epidemiological and medicolegal aspects. Suicide by burning amongst women is a major concern in India as it has become pervasive throughout all social strata and geographical areas. In this series, most women were from joint families (i.e. multigenerational groups of related individuals living under a single roof) and the suicides occurred 2-5 years after marriage. The majority of the affected wives were 21-25 years of age (69%) at the time of the suicide and sustained more than a 50% TBSA burn injury after dousing themselves with kerosene. Most died at the time of the incident or within the subsequent 24 It, most commonly from shock. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide is a global public health problem. Asia accounts for 60% of the world's suicides, so at least 60 million people are affected by suicide or attempted suicide in Asia each year. The burden of female suicidal behavior, in terms of total burden of morbidity and mortality combined, is more in women than in men. Women's greater vulnerability to suicidal behavior is likely to be due to gender related vulnerability to psychopathology and to psychosocial stressors. Suicide prevention programmes should incorporate woman specific strategies. More research on suicidal behavior in women particularly in developing countries is needed.

LA English
DT Article
DE Suicide; Media; Newspapers; Sensationalism; Irresponsible reporting
ID MEDIA
AB Purpose: Media reporting has consistently been shown to influence suicidal behaviour. Irresponsible reporting by the media can lead to imitative suicidal behaviour. The WHO has delineated guidelines for responsible media reporting of suicide. The study aims to examine whether Indian newspapers adhere to the WHO guidelines and whether there are differences in style of reporting between local and national newspapers and between English and Hindi newspapers.
   Methods: The study was conducted on ten newspaper publications that were circulated in Jaipur, India from 1st October 2014 to 31st December 2014. All ten newspapers were screened daily for news items related to suicide. Each news item so obtained was studied in detail and then rated using a scale developed in India by psychiatrists and journalists. This scale is based on the WHO guidelines.
   Results: On an average a newspaper publishes one news item related to suicide every other day. Suicide reporting in Indian newspapers has a strong inclination towards sensationalism. No effort was made to include any educative material the reports. On the positive side most newspapers did not publish the photograph of deceased, or glorify the victims. The newspapers did not try to portray suicide as understandable and were largely neutral in their reporting. The reporting patterns were similar across regional and national newspapers as also across Hindi and English language newspapers.
   Conclusion: Suicide reporting in India is largely irresponsible and efforts should be made to sensitise media personnel in this regard. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Sati; culture; psychiatric; India; Hindus
AB Sati as an act of ritual suicide has been reported from the Indian subcontinent, especially among the Hindus, for several centuries. Although legally proscribed, these acts occur even now in modem India. The principle behind such acts has been put forward as the principle of good wife. There is little evidence to suggest that women who commit this act suffer from a formal mental illness. Cultural factors and gender role expectations play a significant role in the act and its consequences. Using recent examples, this paper illustrates the cultural factors, which may be seen as contributing to the act of suicide. Other factors embedded in the act also emphasize that not all suicides have underlying psychiatric disorders and clinicians must take social causation into account while preparing any prevention strategies.

TI Farmer Suicides and the Function of Death in Neoliberal Biopolitics
SO INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID SECURITY; INDIA; CULTURE; WAYANAD; TERROR; STATE
AB The farmer suicides that have taken place in India since the 1990s constitute the largest wave of recorded suicides in human history. While existing research largely focuses on explaining the causes that lead farmers to take their own lives, this paper examines the biopolitical governing function that the suicides have. The paper argues that the farmer suicides have functioned to legitimate intervention into the lives of those who remain by either treating them as subjects with mental health problems or educating them on how to embrace a neoliberal entrepreneurial mentality. The farmer suicides arguably also function to dispose of a population that has become surplus in the contemporary developmental vision of the Indian state. Furthermore, the paper contests biopolitical theorization that views suicide or death as resistance to biopower, arguing that such theorization fails to recognize both the particularity of biopolitics in a context where the presence of death is ubiquitous and the way in which the death of some may reinforce the biopolitical governing of life of others. The farmer suicides express rather than contest the devaluation of unproductive lives in neoliberal capitalism.

AB Background: Intent in attempted suicide is considered an indicator of subsequent suicide. Few studies in developing countries have examined correlates of suicidal intent among young adults. Aims: This study aimed to assess the intent score among a sample of young suicide attempters from South India and to identify the factors associated with suicide intent among them. Method: The clinical charts of 64 consecutive subjects aged 15-24 years attending emergency services for attempted suicide were reviewed. All participants completed a semistructured proforma, the Presumptive Stressful Life Events Scale, the Beck Hopelessness Scale, the Pierce Suicide Intent Scale, and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale. Psychiatric diagnoses were made according to the ICD-10 clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines. Results: The intent scores were in the moderate-to-high range for most subjects. Suicide intent score significantly varied depending on the presence or absence of psychiatric morbidity. In bivariate analysis, psychiatric morbidity and hopelessness correlated positively with suicide intent, and in linear regression, hopelessness emerged as a predictor of suicide intent. Conclusion: A high intent of suicide in young is associated with psychiatric morbidity and presence of hopelessness. Hopelessness may be a key predictor of suicidal intent. Assessment of suicidal intent and hopelessness among young attempters is important and may help identify high-risk individuals who need intensive interventions.

AB Background. India has witnessed a dramatic increase in suicide rates during the past few decades. The southern state of Kerala has been reporting the highest rates of suicide. Since suicide rates are estimated from death registries, they are likely to be under-reported because the civil registration system is incomplete and suicide deaths are poorly reported.
   Methods. A cohort of 132 000 participants (age 3 5 years and above) in Thiruvananthapuram (erstwhile Trivandrum) district, Kerala was followed up for mortality from 1996 to 2005, after having filled-in a lifestyle questionnaire at baseline. The cause of death was based on verbal autopsy. Suicide methods were recorded and rates were estimated, and suicide risks were calculated according to several socioeconomic factors.
   Results. During the follow up period, a total of 11 608 deaths, of which 385 were suicides (3.3% of total deaths), were registered. The overall suicide rate was 39.3/100 000 person-years among adults 35-90 years of age (men: 78/100 000; women: 16.5/100 000). The predominant methods of suicide were hanging, followed by poisoning and drowning. The suicide determinants were male gender, middle-age (40-60 years), Hindu, alcohol drinkers and secondary education level (<= 7 years). Neither low socioeconomic level, living alone, nor being a married woman was associated with suicide risk.
   Conclusion. Suicide rates were consistent with the official rates of Thiruvananthapuram district (37/100 000). However, our study population did not include the. 14-34-year-old age-group which represents more than 37% of all suicides and hence It is more likely that the official rates are under-reported. Determinants of suicide were In line with previous studies.

AB Suicide is major public health problem in India. The objective of the analyses presented in this paper is to examine depressive and anxiety symptoms and socio-demographic indicators as correlates of suicidal ideation and attempts among people who inject drugs (PWID), a high-risk group for suicide.
   We analysed data collected in April-May of 2012 from a community-based sample of 420 PWID in Delhi using time location sampling. Self-report symptom scales were used to measure the severity of symptoms of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-2) within the preceding 2 weeks. We assessed the presence of suicidal thoughts within the past 12 months.
   Depressive and anxiety symptoms were associated with suicidal ideation, as were a range of social stressors including poor physical health, length of injecting drug use, housing insecurity, and experiences of violence and sexual abuse. However, depressive and anxiety symptoms were not associated with suicide attempts. Factors associated with suicide attempts among ideators were housing insecurity and relational dynamics including a poor relationship with family and, interestingly, being married.
   Suicide prevention interventions among this population should address not only individual mental health and addiction support needs but also the overwhelmingly poor psychosocial circumstances of this group.

TI Do newspaper reports of suicides comply with standard suicide reporting

DE Suicide; media; suicide reporting
ID MEDIA GUIDELINES; HONG-KONG; AUSTRALIA; CELEBRITY; STORIES; RATES; NEWS
AB Background: Several countries have prescribed standard guidelines for media professionals on suicide reporting. However, the implementation of these guidelines has been varied. Suicide rates in South Asia are one of the highest in the world, and it is known that media guidelines for suicide reporting are not followed adequately. However, there are no published reports available from this region.
   Aim: This study aimed at assessing newspaper reports of suicide for quality of reporting based on standard reporting guidelines and to study differences between English and vernacular (Kannada) newspapers in Bangalore, South India.
   Methods: A total of 341 newspaper reports of suicide from 550 newspapers (3 English and 3 Kannada) over 3 months were systematically assessed for compliance with reporting guidelines. Each report was evaluated on 2 domains and 36 parameters. Data were analyzed for frequency of inappropriate reporting and patterns compared between vernacular and English newspapers.
   Results: In all, 87% of the reports were those of completed suicide. Non-compliant reporting - method of suicide was reported in 89% and 32% of reports were in prominent pages of the newspaper, 95% mentioned gender, 90% reported the name, 80% reported age and suicide location, 75% reported life events related to suicide, 70% reported occupation, 69% had headline explicity on suicide and 61% reported monocausality. Only 16% reported mental disorder related to suicide, and less than 3% included information on suicide prevention and helplines. Vernacular papers showed significantly better compliance in 16 of the 20 areas. However, protective characteristics were better reported in English newspapers.
   Conclusion: Majority of reports on suicides in newspapers from Bangalore did not comply with standard guidelines of reporting. There is a strong need to evolve local guidelines and mechanisms for ensuring responsible reporting which have important implications in prevention of suicide.

AB The connection between spirituality and wellbeing, including its benefits for physical and mental health, has been recognized in the Eastern cultures for a very long time, although the sharp division between science and religion has caused, for the most part, its neglect in Western cultures until recently. Nevertheless, limited efforts have been made to explore the impact of spirituality and religion on wellbeing, including the prevention of suicide. We begin with an overview of the literature on religiousness, spirituality, and health and wellbeing. Further, we present a novel study focused on a sample of 160 Indian students from a spiritually oriented university in North India with the aim to understand how spirituality affects their lives and wellbeing and their views about suicide. Our results show that spirituality, generally, has a positive impact on participants' wellbeing with a potential protective effect against suicidal behavior, although more research on spiritual/religious beliefs as a source of difficulties is warranted.

AB Previous research has reported mixed findings on the effect of the menstrual cycle on suicidal behavior. The contribution of menstruation to completed suicide is also controversial, though the studies are very limited and have not been carefully designed. To explore the relationship, 217 autopsies on completed suicides were performed, matched to a control group at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi. The results show that 54.46% of people who died by suicide were menstruating (results excluded pregnancies), compared to 6.75% of the control group. Menstruation in those who completed suicide, compared to a control group, appeared to have an association with suicide. More research is warranted.

AB BACKGROUND
   In India, the number of suicides and attempted suicides have increased significantly. Moreover, the suicide attempt rates are found to be higher than rates for completed suicides. Therefore, present study aimed to investigate the socio-demographic characteristics and suicide data on attempted suicides.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS
   75 cases of attempted suicide individuals admitted to MVJ Medical College and Research Hospital, when declared medically/surgically stable and referred to Psychiatry Department, were recruited for the study. Detailed interview with the patient was conducted and information obtained was compiled in a specially designed proforma.
   RESULTS
   Majority of the subjects were aged less than 30 years (77.3%), females (66.7%), married (56%), educated only up to high school or less (70.7%), were Hindus (90.7%) and from nuclear family (73.3%). Housewives (30.7%) and farmers (21.35%) were the common occupational groups. Significant past and family history of suicidal behaviour, psychiatric and physical illness was present. Most attempts took place at patient's house (78.7%). Organophosphorus compound poisoning was the most common method of attempt (38.7%) with interpersonal problems in the family (38.7%) as the most common precipitating factor.
   CONCLUSION
   In conclusion young adults, females with low socio-economic and educational status, having significant past and family history of suicidal behaviour and psychiatric illnesses were at increased risk of suicide attempt. High intent among suicide attempters was associated with high hopelessness score and presence of current psychiatric illness. Also, high hopelessness score was associated with presence of current psychiatric illness.

AB Sixty one percent of the suicides in the world occur in Asia. The suicide rate of Asia has been calculated as 12.6/100,000. This is an underestimate as data is unavailable for 20.7% of the Asian population. Population-based studies on suicide in Asia reveal that 68-97% had diagnosable psychiatric disorders. Only 35-40% of suicides in India and China received the diagnosis of depression. The association between depression and suicide is less pronounced in Asia. Demographic and socio-cultural risk factors for suicide in Asia are different from Western countries but clinical factors appear to be more similar than different. Suicide is a major public and mental health problem in Asia and there is an urgent need to develop effective national suicide prevention strategy in Asian countries.

ID EMOTIONS
AB Scholars tend to attribute the use of suicide protest and suicide bombing to purely rational considerations. In contrast, I argue that conventional understandings of strategy are too narrow and must be expanded to include emotional motivations for political mobilization. Complex strategy directly engages both the calculative and emotive understandings of political action. I develop this theory through a comparison of suicide protests and suicide bombings in South Asia, focusing on the emotional content of this extreme tactic. Suicide protests illustrate the importance of pride, sympathy, fear, and shame in political mobilization. I explore the emotional character of suicide in protest through an investigation of two cases: the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in Sri Lanka (LTTE) and the Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) in India.

ID CYCLE
AB Background: Previous research, albeit limited, has reported mixed findings on the impact of menstruation cycle on suicidal behavior. The contribution of menstruation to completed suicide is also controversial; the studies are, in fact, very limited and are not carefully designed. Aims: To examine whether the menstruation cycle impacts on suicide. Methods: In order to explore this relationship, 56 autopsies on completed suicides in females were performed and matched to a control group of 44 females who had died from other causes, at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi. Histopathological examination, a method of collecting tissue from the uterus through biopsy, was used to determine the stage of the menstrual cycle. Results: The results show that 25% of women who had died by suicide were menstruating at the time, compared to 4.5% of the control group; this is statistically (chi(2)) significant at the p < .002 level. Conclusions: Menstruation in the women who completed suicide, compared to a control group, appeared to have an association, though more research is warranted. Not only there are serious methodological problems in the study of menstruation and suicide (largely because of problematic tissue storage and examination), but also because of the need to understand the impact within a larger psychological, social, and cultural frame.

AB Suicide, a major problem worldwide, continues to be a criminal offence in most of the developing countries of the world, including India. This paper retrospectively examines the latest trends and the relevant determinants of the suicidal deaths in one of the most important city of central India-Nagpur of Maharashtra state, carried out for a period of 5 years i.e. 2009-2013. Total 2036 cases were analyzed. An alarmingly increasing trend in the rate of suicides has been observed in the region, which increased from 16% to 22.68% during the study period. The male to female suicide ratio was found to be 2.50:1. The rate of suicidal deaths ranged from 15.34 to 21.74 per 100,000 populations. Hanging was found to be the most preferred mean adopted for suicide by males (54.77%) and females (47.65%), while, Family problems was the most common cause of suicide among both male (38.25%) and female (52.65%). The Suicides were concentrated in the age group of 30e44 years for males (35.76%), while in the age group of 15-29 years for females (51.75%). The prevalence was higher among the people who were married, being as high as 1099 (66.73%) males and 372 (56.45%) females. Highest trend has been found among the people with matriculate/secondary education level. The males with job in private sector accounted for 1007 suicides (61.14%) and 434 (65.86%) females in the category of housewives (non-working, homemakers) committed the same.

TI Suicide prevention competencies among urban Indian physicians: A needs
   assessment
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE Needs assessment; suicidal behaviour competencies; suicidal ideation;
   suicide prevention
AB Introduction: India accounts for the highest estimated number of suicides in the World. In 2012, more than 258,000 of the 804,000 suicide deaths worldwide occurred in India. Early identification and effective management of suicidal ideation and behavior are paramount to saving lives. However, mental health resources are often scarce and limited. Throughout India, there is a severe shortage in mental health professions trained, which results in a treatment gap of about 90%. A comprehensive needs assessment was undertaken to identify the nature of the deficits in suicide prevention training for physicians in three Indian cities: Mumbai, Ahmedabad, and Mysore.
   Materials and Methods: The study was carried out in several concurrent phases and used a mixed-method approach of converging quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Data were collected using survey questionnaires, focus groups, consultations, and environmental scans. A total of 46 physicians completed the questionnaire. Focus groups were conducted in Mumbai and Ahmedabad with 40 physicians. Consultations were carried out with psychiatrists and psychiatric residents from hospitals and clinics in Mumbai, Ahmedabad, and Mysore.
   Results: Training gaps in suicide prevention exist across the health care professions. Existing training lacks in both quality and quantity and result in critical deficits in core competencies needed to detect and treat patients presenting with suicidal ideation and behavior. Only 43% of the surveyed physicians felt they were competent to treat suicidal patients. The majority of surveyed physicians believed they would greatly benefit from additional training to enhance their suicide risk assessment and intervention skills.
   Conclusions: There is a dire need for medical schools to incorporate suicide prevention training as a core component in their medical curricula and for continuing medical education training programs for physicians to enhance competencies in early detection and management of suicidal behavior.

AB Studying gender differences in Suicidal behaviour is important in developing specific need-based service provisions. We aimed to identify gender-specific characteristics associated with attempted suicide in a general hospital sample in south India. Two hundred and three patients admitted to medical wards following suicide attempts were assessed using a detailed clinical interview, measures of suicide intent (Suicide Intent Scale), lethality (Risk Rescue Rating), depression (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and recent stress (Presumptive Stressful Life Events Scale). The majority of men attempting suicide were single. Men were more likely to use organophosphate poisons in their attempt to kill themselves and had higher rates of mental illness than women. As compared with men, women were more likely to conic from rural areas, had a lower educational status, and had lower rates of employment outside the home. In women, the most common method of suicide attempt was by using plant poisons. Suicide attempt by self-immolation was significantly higher among women. Men had higher suicidal intent than women, although lethality, depression and stress were comparable between the genders. Rural women were more disadvantaged in education; however, in urban areas. men had higher psychiatric morbidity. Our results emphasise the need for a gender-specific approach among people who have attempted suicide. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The incidence of suicide and homicide is on the increase worldwide, including India. One million people die annually due to suicides and homicides alone. Thus this study had been undertaken to find out the material and social causes of burn and to assess the socio-demographic characteristics between suicide and homicide.
   Methods: This retrospective study was carried out on 1393 fatal burn cases (2008-2012) who were autopsied at the mortuary of King George's Medical University, Lucknow, India. Data retrieved include: age, sex, type of family, marital status, place of incidence, psychological status and burn size (TBSA). The results were presented in Mean +/- SD and percentages and analyzed with SPSS 16.0.
   Results: Out of the total 1369 cases of burns, 536 cases (38.5%) were homicidal deaths in comparison to 857 cases (61.5%) of suicidal deaths. Female predominance was seen in both suicidal and homicidal deaths with peak age 30-39 years in suicides in contrast to 40-49 years in homicides. At younger age <= 19 years, the victims of suicide is almost similar to the victims of homicide; but at extremes of ages below 10 years and above 60 years, homicides were relatively more common than suicides. Married victims were predominant in the homicidal group (66.6%). There is no quite difference at the place where burn occurs. Depression and anxiety disorders were the most frequent psychiatric co-morbidities associated with suicidal behaviours. Patients from suicidal group suffered significantly larger burns than from homicidal group.
   Conclusion: Hence, this study was planned with a purpose to know the magnitude and the socio-cultural factors of the problem of burns to more clearly understand the dynamics surrounding these deaths, so that a sound prevention programme could be suggested, planned and implemented for reducing the incidence of fatal burns.

AB Suicide, assisted suicide and euthanasia are elusive and controversial issues worldwide. To discuss such issues from only one perspective may be limiting. Therefore, this paper was written by authors from various regions, each of whom has been asked to reflect on the issues. The countries/cultures are: Australia, China, Cuba, Ireland, India, Japan, Russia, South Africa, The Netherlands, North America (Turtle Island) and United States. Historically and today, suicide is viewed differently. Assisted suicide and euthanasia are equally seen from multifarious perspectives. Highlighting development in the Netherlands, Australia's Northern Territory and Japan (ie. the famous Yamanouchi Case), the review shows growing re-examination of the right to die. There appear, however, to be no uniform legal and ethical positions. Further debate and discussion globally is needed to avoid myopic perspectives.

ID DISTRESS
AB A significant number of farmers committing suicides in various parts of India are routinely attributed to agrarian crisis. The crisis is further related to the structural transformations induced by globalisation and liberalization and the resulting forms of scarcities or shortages, for example, prices, growth, and resources. I contend in this essay that the framework of economic rationality is insufficient to explain why a disturbingly high number of middle farmers are taking their lives. This essay is an attempt to provide an alternative explanation of the suicides by undertaking a study of the affective histories of scarcities. It argues that for the suicides whether scarcity actually exists is less relevant than how the idea of scarcity is articulated in affective responses. The affective histories explain the way in which suicides and the wider feelings of rural alienation relate to the fear of pauperization. This fear relates to the bounded imagination of the self and the other, glued by a long history of deeply ingrained ideologies of hierarchy. If farmers' suicides point to any crisis, it is the crisis of lack of alternative political and cultural imagination emerging from a rounded critique of all forms of social injustice and violence.

AB Context: Lack of literature on psychological aspects of survivors of farmers' suicides is hurdle in devising effective helping strategies for rising number of survivors across the country.
   Aims and Objectives: To assess the psychological distress and its correlates in survivors of farmers' suicides.
   Settings and Design: Case-control study design was used in Wardha District of Vidarbha region in the central India.
   Materials and Methods: A predesigned and pretested semistructured questionnaire was used to assess sociodemographic variables. Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 was used to evaluate psychological distress in 98 survivors of farmers' suicides and 98 age, sex, and occupation-matched controls.
   Statistical Analysis: Significance of differences between case and control groups were assessed using Chi-square test or Fisher's two-tailed exact test for class variables. For continuous variables, Student's t-test was used P < 0.05 was considered significant.
   Results: Significantly higher proportion of survivors had psychological distress than controls. Female survivors, spouse and parents of suicide victims had a high risk of distress. Psychological distress was commonly expressed by depressive and somatic symptoms.
   Conclusions: Survivors of farmers' suicides are suffering from significant psychological distress.

ID RISK-FACTORS
AB Widespread use of pesticides among farmers in rural India, provides an easy means for suicide. A public health initiative involving storage of pesticides in a central storage facility could be a possible strategy for reducing mortality and morbidity related to pesticide poisoning. This qualitative study explored community perceptions towards a central pesticide storage facility in villages in rural South India. Sixteen focus group discussions held with consenting adults from intervention and control villages were followed by eight more a year after initiation of the storage facility. Analysis revealed four themes, namely, reasons for committing suicide and methods used, exposure to pesticides and first-aid practices, storage and disposal of pesticides, and perceptions towards the storage facility. The facility was appreciated as a means of preventing suicides and for providing a safe haven for pesticide storage. The participatory process that guided its design, construction and location ensured its acceptability. Use of qualitative methods helped provide deep insights into the phenomenon of pesticide suicide and aided the understanding of community perceptions towards the storage facility. The study suggests that communal storage of pesticides could be an important step towards reducing pesticide suicides in rural areas.

AB OBJECTIVE To record cases of suicide and attempted suicide among a population of 108 000 people living in a primarily rural area of southern India, with the aim of guiding policies and strategies to restrict access to poisonous compounds at community level.
   METHOD Community-based surveillance over a period of 2 years.
   RESULTS and CONCLUSION The overall suicide rate was 71.4 per 100 000 population; the highest burden was among men. Most people died through hanging (81, 54%) and self-poisoning (46, 31%). Of the 46 who died from self-poisoning, 78.3% had taken pesticides and 19.7% had eaten poisonous plants. Eighty per cent of the self-poisoning cases obtained the poisonous substance in or in close proximity to the home, highlighting the importance of safe storage in the domestic environment. Of the 110 fatal and non-fatal self-poisoning cases, 87 (57.5%) were taken for treatment; 50 (57.4%) went to government hospitals and 37 (42.5%) to private facilities. This indicates the importance of including the private sector in the efforts to improve case management. Furthermore, the fact that 31 (67%) of the self-poisoning patients, who eventually died, were alive after 4 h provides an incentive to focus on improved case management and access to health services.

AB Background: Suicide is one of the most common causes of death among persons with schizophrenia. Differing risk factors have been identified in published studies. The differences may have arisen because a uniform set of variables was not analyzed. Alternatively, the nature and effect of risk factors may vary in different settings. To test these possibilities, we investigated the same set of variables in two independent cross-national samples ascertained using identical protocols.
   Methods: Patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM IV criteria) were recruited in India (n=460) and the USA (n=424).
   Results: Consistent with earlier publications, a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, history of depression, pattern of symptoms and educational status were significantly associated with suicide attempts in the US sample. None of these variables were significantly associated in the Indian sample.
   Conclusions: The impact of known risk factors for suicide attempts among patients with schizophrenia differs across ethnic groups. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although arguments are a good way of exploring the limitations and complexities of a concept or a theory we may find ourselves faced with a real phenomenon that challenges the existing formulations of a concept or a theory so strongly and reveals its limitations to us so starkly that we are forced to break away from the current discussion and start anew. Such is the challenge posed by the phenomenon of farmer suicides on our existing theories of corporate social responsibility. Contemporary discussions in corporate ethics are replete with many theories of corporate social responsibility which in one way or the other rely on the concept of the social contract. For the most part these theories have gone unchallenged and no fundamental limitations have been revealed. However, the phenomenon of farmer suicides in central India poses a serious challenge to them. This article attempts to show how the phenomenon of farmer suicides in central India starkly exposes some of the fundamental limitations of the contractarian formulations of corporate social responsibility.

AB BACKGROUND
   Adolescent suicide is of burning health concern. It is the third commonest cause of death in India. Neuroanatomical and neurochemical alterations are studied in the brain of suicidees. The study aims to study psychiatric illness in adolescents as well as psychosocial factors in those who attempt suicide.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS
   A cross-sectional survey study with sample size 50. Patients who come to Psychiatry department for suicide prevention counselling are screened for psychiatric illness as well as substance use, family history of suicide, personality, conduct disorders as well as psychosocial factors are studied.
   RESULTS
   The results are formulated in tables with carefully evaluating psychiatric morbidity by using ICD-10 criteria. Suicide rating scales are used to assess the suicide intent and hopelessness is the main factor contributing to adolescent suicide attempt who are psychiatrically ill.
   CONCLUSION
   Adjustment disorder and depression plays a major role in psychiatrically ill suicide attempters. Interpersonal conflicts play a major role in non-morbid adolescents.

AB Background: Cases of suicide documented earlier all over the world reflect the presence of suicide behavior in primitive world at a higher rate compared to general urban population. The cause of such behavior is thought to be different among tribes and mental health was rarely presumed to be associated. In India, several ethnographic narratives described instances of suicides among several tribes, but evaluation of psychological traits were lacking. The present study on Idu Mishmi is an attempt to further validate earlier report of high rate of suicides among them and to evaluate psychological traits.
   Methods: Interview and administration of Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) on 218 individuals comprised the data. Bi-variate analyses and linear multiple regression were done to evaluate psychological traits in suicide behavior.
   Results: In the Idu Mishmi Population suicide attempt (14.22%) was higher than urban population in general (0.4-4.2%) and females were at higher risk. Depression (8.26%) was comparable with earlier reports, whereas anxiety syndrome (6.42%), alcohol abuse (36.24%) and eating disorder like Binge eating (6.42%), Bulimia nervosa (1.38%) were also recorded in the population.
   Limitations: Absence of psychiatry clinic and mechanism of recording suicide occurrences in remote tribal area is the basic limitation of the study.
   Conclusion: Depression and gender turned out to be significant determinants of suicide attempt in the studied population, whereas alcohol abuse was not a significant factor. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Little is known about the prevalence of and factors associated with suicide ideation and suicide attempts among college youth in India.
   Aims: The aims were to estimate the prevalence of suicidal behaviours among Indian college students and identify potential risk factors for suicide ideation and attempts.
   Method: The study surveyed 1,817 undergraduate college students aged 18-24 years in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, with a questionnaire that assessed suicidal behaviours as well as stressful situations and life events. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess risk factors.
   Results: The prevalence of lifetime suicide ideation and lifetime suicide attempts was 11.7% and 4.0%, respectively. Suicide ideation was predicted by female gender, odds ratio (OR) = 1.41, 95% CI 1.01, 1.97, economic stress, OR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.11, 1.24, stress due to life events involving religious violence in the community, OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.15, 1.78, and life events involving caste conflicts or caste discrimination, OR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.13, 1.46. Female gender and caste-related life events were not significantly associated with suicide attempts but economic stress and stressful experience of religious conflict continued to be significantly associated with lifetime suicide attempt, OR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.08, 1.31, and OR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.14, 2.17, respectively.
   Conclusions: In this sample, college students from low socioeconomic classes who faced economic difficulties, and students who experienced distress as a result of caste discrimination or caste conflict, and communal unrest, were at a higher risk for suicidal behaviour.

ID COMPLETED SUICIDE
AB Objective: The present study had been undertaken to investigate the sociodemographic profile of individuals who had committed suicide in Sikkim which may throw light on the vulnerable groups.
   Materials and Methods: Ten-year suicide data (2006-2015) obtained from Police Headquarters, Crime Branch, Gangtok, have been statistically evaluated to study the sociodemographic profile.
   Results: The results showed that out of 1604 suicide cases recorded for the past 10 years, 1051 were males (65.5%) and 553 (34.5%) were females. Suicide was found to be common among the age group of 21-30 years (24.4%), Rai community (15.8%), population of rural areas (82.6%), and among the population of eastern districts (50.6%). Hanging (94.8%) was found to be the most common method adopted for suicide.
   Conclusion: The study provides preliminary information about the vulnerable groups for suicide in the state which may be vital for taking necessary steps for its prevention shortly.

DE Non-terrorist; suicide; explosion; oral cavity; India
AB Suicidal deaths involving explosives are rare. Their occurrence depends on both the availability of materials and the victim's expertise in handling explosive material. We report here a rare case from India of non-terrorist suicidal death involving explosives. The victim was around 25 years old, a blaster by occupation. He committed suicide by detonating dynamite in his mouth. The materials he used to operate this explosion were found near his body at the crime scene. There was characteristic bilateral symmetrical laceration around the oral cavity. Considering all the facts of the case in relation to history, location, nature, distribution and extent of injuries and recovered material at crime scene enables the cause and manner of death to be ascertained.

DE Mental health; nurses attitudes; pesticide poisoning; suicide; self-harm
ID MENTAL-ILLNESS; YOUNG-PEOPLE; MORTALITY; STUDENTS; ABUSE
AB Background: There is growing global interest into the attitudes and clinical management of persons who have attempted suicide.Aims: The principal purpose was to determine senior nursing staff attitudes towards patients who had attempted suicide from a professional and cultural perspective, which might influence care following hospital admission. The focus concerned nursing staff interactions at a psychological level that compete with physical tasks on general hospital wards.Methods: A qualitative methodology was employed with audio-taped interviews utilising four level data coding. This article reports on a group of 15 nursing staff from a large general hospital in Mysore, Southern India.Results: Findings suggested that patient care and treatment is directly influenced by the nurse's religious beliefs within a general hospital setting with physical duties prioritised over psychological support, which was underdeveloped throughout the participant group.Conclusion: The results allow a series of recommendations for educational and skills initiatives before progressing to patient assessment and treatment projects and cross-cultural comparison studies. In addition, interventions must focus on current resources and context to move the evidence-based suicide prevention forward.

AB Background: Agricultural pesticide poisoning is a major contributor to the global burden of suicide. Over the last decade there has been a marked decrease in the incidence of suicide worldwide. It is unclear whether pesticide poisoning still plays a significant role in the global incidence of suicide.
   Methods: WHO method-specific suicide data were supplemented by a systematic review of the literature between 2006 and 2015, including searches of thirteen electronic databases and Google, citation searching and a review of reference lists and personal collections. Our primary outcome was the proportion of total suicides due to pesticide poisoning. Weighted estimates were calculated for seven WHO regional and income strata.
   Results: We identified data from 108 countries (102 from WHO data, 6 from the literature). A conservative estimate based on these data indicates that there were approximately 110,000 pesticide self-poisoning deaths each year from 2010 to 2014, comprising 13.7% of all global suicides. A sensitivity analysis accounting for under-reporting of suicides in India resulted in an increased estimate of 168,000 pesticide self-poisoning deaths annually, that is, 19.7% of global suicides. The proportion of suicides due to pesticide self-poisoning varies considerably between regions, from 0.9% in low-and middle-income countries in the European region to 48.3% in low-and middle-income countries in the Western Pacific region.
   Limitations: High quality method-specific suicide data were unavailable for a number of the most populous countries, particularly in the African and Eastern Mediterranean regions. It is likely we have underestimated incidence in these regions.
   Conclusion: There appears to have been a substantial decline in fatal pesticide self-poisoning in recent years, largely driven by a reduction in overall suicide rates in China. Nonetheless, pesticide self-poisoning remains a major public health challenge, accounting for at least one-in-seven suicides globally.

ID BEHAVIOR; SYSTEMS
AB Purpose: Suicide and trespass are major contributors to risk on the railway, resulting in around 170-180 fatalities per year in Lucknow region, as well as associated major disruption to the rail network. Lucknow is the capital city of the state of Uttar Pradesh in India.
   Methods: The analysis included train-pedestrian fatalities during 2007-2012. The data for 2007-2012 were collected from the autopsy reports of the university, case sheets from the hospital, the general prosecutor's investigations report and the inquest reports from police.
   Results: The results show that the majority of victims were males. Half of the suicide victims were 20-39 years old. Accidents happened most frequently in situations when a person was walking on the tracks/in front of train (22.7%) or were crossing the tracks illegally (20.9%). Among all train-pedestrian fatalities, about half of the victims (42.8%) were intoxicated by alcohol. Female suicide victims suffered from mental health problems more frequently (55.8%) than male suicide victims.
   Conclusion: Overall, there is no reason to believe that train-pedestrian fatalities are unavoidable. By contrast, the effective prevention of railway suicides and accidents should be based on a systems approach involving effective measures introduces by several organisations such as government, railway organisations, various authorities (such as public health, education, enforcement, urban planning) and communities. Same measures can often be used to prevent both trespassing and suicides, even though their effectiveness may depend on the target group. In addition, there are measures specifically targeted to prevent either trespassing or suicides. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide is an important public health hazard worldwide. A 4-year retrospective study from January 2000 to December 2003 was conducted to identify the favored methods in realized suicides among males and females in the west coastal region of India. During the study period, a total of 539 cases of suicidal deaths were autopsied. Males were predominantly affected (male: female-1.9:1). The age of the victims ranged from 13 to 90 years in males (mean = 40.1 years, median = 37.0 years) and 15 to 85 years in females (mean = 36.6 years, median = 32.0 years). Most favored method of suicide amongst males and females was hanging (36.9%, n = 199) followed by poisoning (34.7%, n = 187). Male dominance was apparent for each method of suicide except for self-immolation. Males were relatively more likely to use hanging and poisoning while females were more likely to prefer drowning and self-immolation as methods of suicide. Relatively younger females (mean = 33.0 years, median = 32.0 years) preferred hanging as a method of suicide when compared to males (mean = 42.4 years, median = 40.0 years). Among females, significantly younger females resorted to hanging when compared to older females who preferred drowning. On investigating the various theories proposed for choice of suicide methods in males and females in different regions we conclude that preference of method of suicide in men and women is complexly determined. In this region, availability, accessibility, popularity, and socioacceptability seem to be the major determinants in the choice of methods among males and females rather than violence associated and lethality of the method. Females were as likely to use lethal and violent methods as males in this region.

AB Maternal filicide has occurred throughout history and carries along with it, a host of paradoxical and complex clinical, legal and social dimensions. We present findings from a case series of four women inpatients, who were undergoing trials for filicide. All women reported severe marital discord and poor social support. Three had severe depressive episodes before and during the time of the alleged crime. The motive for the alleged act was 'altruistic' in three of them. Early identification of psychiatric illness and risk assessment may help in early intervention and protect the mother and child.

TI Farmers' Suicides as Public Death: Politics, Agency and Statistics in a
   Suicide-Prone District (South India)
SO MODERN ASIAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper argues that Indian farmers' suicides may fruitfully be described as public deaths. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in the South Indian district of Wayanad (Kerala), it shows that farmers' suicides become public deaths' only via the enumerative and statistical practices of the Indian state and their scandalization in the media. The political nature of suicide as public death thus depends entirely on suicide rates and their production by the state itself. But the power of representations complicates the ethnographic critique of statistical knowledge about suicide. In a context like Wayanad, which had been declared a suicide-prone district by the Indian state, public representations of suicides have taken on a life of their own; statistical categories and the media interpretations of these statistics have had a curious feedbackmediated by development encountersonto the situated meanings of individual suicides. Local interpretations of individual suicides mostly commented on personal failures of the suicide and on the perils of speculative smallholder agriculture. Ethnography of farmers' suicide based on case studies alone, however, would soon encounter limitations equally grave as the limitations of statistical analysis. Not only is the meaning of suicide (intentions, causes, motives) at the actor level off limits for ethnography, but in addition to that the (public) meaning of suicide is co-determined by state practice including statistical accounting.

ID ADOLESCENT SUICIDE; IDEATION; BEHAVIOR; RISK
AB The study aims to determine the psychological profile of suicide ideators, attempters and completers in a tertiary care teaching hospital. A total of 260 suicidal ideators, 58 attempters and 55 completers were studied. The majority of ideators, attempters and completers were 26-35 years of age, males (except attempters who were predominantly females), married, literate up to high school, employed (ideators) or housewives (attempters and completers). The suicide ideators, attempters and completers who had a past history of attempt were 6.9%, 24.1% and 18.2% respectively. Family history of attempted suicide or completed suicide was also common among patients suffering from depression. in suicidal ideators, mixed anxiety and depressive disorder was the most common psychiatric diagnosis followed by major depression and schizophrenia. Among suicide attempters, adjustment disorder with depression was the most common diagnosis. The most common method of suicide attempt was organophosphorus compound intake whereas in suicide completers, the most common method in use was hanging. The patients with suicidal ideation or attempt need careful evaluation, early intervention and long term follow up.

AB In a suicide committed using aluminium phosphide (AlP) the liberated toxic phosphine gas was detected in post-mortem specimens using a headspace gas chromatographic procedure with a nitrogen-phosphorous detector (HS-GC/NPD). At autopsy a direct sampling into airtight headspace vials for a later analysis is recommended. AlP has to be considered a potent pesticide and its use and availability should be restricted as much as possible. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

   plant; Cerbera odollam; cerberm; apocynaceac
AB Cerbera odollam is a tree belonging to the poisonous Apocynaceae family, which includes the yellow and common oleanders. The seeds are excessively toxic, containing cerberin as the main active cardenolide. Cerbera venenifera, a related species found in Madagascar, has a long history as an ordeal poison, and was responsible for the death of 3000 people per year in previous centuries.
   The odollam tree is responsible for about 50% of the plant poisoning cases and 10% of the total poisoning cases in Kerala, India. It is used both for suicide and homicide. The aim of this retrospective study is to call attention to a powerful toxic plant that is currently completely ignored by western physicians, chemists, analysts and even coroners and forensic toxicologists.

AB Background
   It is unclear whether there is a direct link between economic crises and changes in suicide rates.
   Aims
   The Lopez-Ibor Foundation launched an initiative to study the possible impact of the economic crisis on European suicide rates.
   Method Data was gathered and analysed from 29 European countries and included the number of deaths by suicide in men and women, the unemployment rate, the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, the annual economic growth rate and inflation.
   Results
   There was a strong correlation between suicide rates and all economic indices except GPD per capita in men but only a correlation with unemployment in women. However, the increase in suicide rates occurred several months before the economic crisis emerged.
   Conclusions
   Overall, this study confirms a general relationship between the economic environment and suicide rates; however, it does not support there being a clear causal relationship between the current economic crisis and an increase in the suicide rate.

AB This paper examines the reasons for farmer suicides in India. Inability to get the right price, crop failures, and insurmountable debt are the factors that may drive the farmers to take this extreme step. A key factor for farmers being unable to get market prices is inefficient agriculture supply chain management. We find that the reasons for inefficient supply chain management include lack of reforms in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act, low bargaining power due to small farm size, and lack of warehousing facilities. Crop failures happen because of poor irrigation facilities. Considering agricultural output and rainfall data from four different states in India we find evidence in favor of association between the cyclical component of agricultural output and rainfall data. Understanding this linkage is important from the perspective of formulating demand management policies (read, intervention by the government and central bank). (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB This article centers the voices of the widows of farmers from Yavatmal, Maharashtra, who give meaning to the patriarchal structures that unfold amid neoliberal agriculture in India. The theoretical framework of the culture-centered approach presented in the article works in solidarity with transnational feminist scholarship to interrupt the dominant discourse of development that reproduces the disempowerment experienced by these widows. Based on in-depth interviews conducted across villages, this article foregrounds the meanings and explanations of India?s agrarian crisis through the voices of widows of farmers. Their narratives position the suicides of their husbands amid the high-investment Bt cotton farming that incurred debts from which it became impossible to recover. By deploying voices of the gendered subaltern to interrogate the agrarian crisis, the article highlights the multiple structures that make widows? lives precarious. Their reflective journeys address the communicative erasures faced by the widows within households and the larger discourse of neoliberal development of agriculture.

ID SUFFOCATION
AB Suicide patterns and rates differ in various populations and cultures. It has been reported that developing countries have lower suicide rates, possibly because of a lower level of environmental stress but the Indians have a very high suicide rate (Elfawal, 1999). The choice of method used to commit suicide depends on availability of means, knowledge about lethal effectiveness, and the victim's motivation and intent. The present work was designed to investigate the different methods of self-destruction, the age and gender susceptibility to suicide, the groups particularly affected and the underlying motivating factor for such an extreme step among the North Indians. Various suggestions relating to decreasing the tensions of the modern mechanical life-style, educating the public in general and the availability, use and storage of agrochemicals have been put forward. Marriage counselling and the concept of family planning are also advocated.

AB Suicide is a serious public health problem worldwide. The suicide rate, i.e. the number of suicides per 100,000 of population, is considered to be an important indicator of national mental health and general well-being of society. The prevalence of suicide is often underestimated due to cultural, political and economic circumstances. The number of suicides in the world was estimated to be 804,000 in 2012, according to the WHO global suicide report. The age-standardized global suicide mortality rate was 11.4 per 100,000, accounting for 1.4% of all deaths. The highest crude suicide rate was in South Korea (36.6). In developed countries, male suicides have traditionally outnumbered female suicides. In 2012, the highest male-to-female suicide rate ratios (over 5.0) were found in Eastern Europe and the lowest in China (under 1.0). The risk to die by suicide increases with age. Notably, however, females in the age group 15-29 years had the highest suicide rate of all age groups in India and Latin America. The WHO estimates that for each adult suicide there may have been more than 20 others attempting suicide. Suicide risk is much higher in individuals who previously made a suicide attempt and research shows that suicide attempt is the single most important predictor of death by suicide. In suicide prevention work, strategies can be directed to the health care services or at the general population. A great need for preventive strategies for young people has been identified by the WHO. Therefore, an evidence school-based preventive method called Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) directed towards the entire classroom was developed in the EU-funded project 'Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe'.

AB National Suicide rates differ to a high extent. Tentative explanations for this finding reach from macro-social to population-genetic models. Still Unexplored is the influence of cultural values, i.e. the association between the acceptance of suicide motives in a Population and the national suicide rates. The goal of this study was the development and evaluation of a questionnaire on the acceptance of suicide motives (ASM), an instrument which will be used for transcultural psychiatric research in a multi-centre study. Additionally the first results of a trial with 153 healthy Austrians are presented. Test-Retest reliability of the five scales ranged from r=0.74 after to r=0.89 for 3 months interval. The internal consistency of scales was very good (Cronbachs Alpha 0.71 arter to 0.88). The Austrians especially accept motives associated with physical frailty or guilt feelings and less those associated with shame. The acceptance Of Suicide motives relatively stable in terms of age and gender. Thus, the ASM seems to be suited as an instrument for Cultural comparative studies on the detection of reasons of national Suicide rates.

AB Recently, there have been calls for the decriminalization (or depenalization) of nonfatal suicidal behavior (attempted suicide) in Ghana, India, Uganda, and other societies that currently criminalize nonfatal suicidal behavior. Despite this, there is a dearth of systematic studies that examine the extent, nature, and characteristics of attempted suicide prosecutions in countries that currently criminalize nonfatal suicidal behavior. The current study, therefore, explores the phenomenon of criminal prosecution and punishment for suicide attempters in Ghana, one among several countries where nonfatal suicidal behavior is a crime. Drawing from data extracted from local Ghanaian print and electronic news media articles, the study examines the sociodemographic characteristics of suicide attempt survivors, the patterns of nonfatal suicidal behavior, as well as the criminal justice outcomes of the criminal prosecutions. The findings indicate that the majority of defendants pled guilty to or were found guilty of the charge and sentenced to penalties ranging from monetary fines to incarceration. The results are discussed with regard to their implications for reducing nonfatal suicidal behavior in Ghana.

AB Background: To investigate the prevalence of depression, suicidal ideations, alcohol and nicotine consumption in adults in an agrarian society mostly unchanged by the effects of urbanization.
   Methods: The Central India Eye and Medical Study is a population-based study in rural Central India close to the tribal belt and included 4711 subjects (aged 30+ years). Depression was assessed by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD), suicidal ideation by six standardized questions, nicotine use by the Fagerstroem Nicotine Tolerance Questionnaire (FTNQ), and alcohol consumption by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT).
   Results: Mild to moderate depression (CESD sum score: 15-21) was detected in 1862 (39.6%) individuals (33.5% of men, 44.8 of women), and major depression (CESD sum score >21) in 613 (13.0%) individuals (8.1 of men, 17.3% of women). Suicide attempt was reported by 199 (4.2%) participants and suicidal thoughts during the last 6 months by 238 (5.1%) individuals. There were 887 (18.9%) smokers and smokeless tobacco was consumed by 1968 (41.8%) subjects. Alcohol consumption was reported by 1081 (23.0%) participants; 283 (6.0%) subjects had an AUDIT score >= 8 (hazardous drinking), and 108 (4.63%) subjects a score >= 13 (women) or >= 15 (men) (alcohol dependence).
   Conclusions: In rural Central India, prevalence of major depression was comparable to figures reported from other developing countries. Prevalence of smoking and hazardous alcohol consumption was higher than as reported from urban regions. Measures should be taken to address the relatively high prevalence of suicide attempts and thoughts on suicide in rural Central India.

ID RISK
AB Suicide is the act of a human being intentionally causing his. or her own death. More than 1 million people commit suicide every year. It is the 13th leading cause of death worldwide, with China, India, and Japan accounting for almost half of all suicides. In less than 50 years, the rate of suicide among Sri Lankans has risen from a modest level to one of the highest in the world (118 per 100000). Suicide is a major preventable cause of premature death. It is influenced by psychosocial, cultural, and environmental risk factors. The impact of suicide can be devastating for all concerned. It is common in people who are living with chronic mental illness. Individuals with severe clinical depression and alcohol use disorders are at highest risk if untreated. On an interpersonal level, friends and families of suicide victims require social support: On a national level, governments need to recognize the causes of suicide and protect those most vulnerable. If governments commit to defining national responses to prevent suicide, significant progress can be made. On a global scale, research and health organizations can identify global trends and encourage the sharing of information in effective prevention activities. In September 2010, World Suicide Prevention Day, with a theme of "Many Faces, Many Places: Suicide Prevention across the World," encouraged public awareness worldwide to unite in commitment and action to promote understanding about suicide and removal of stigmatization.(1) There is compelling evidence that adequate prevention and awareness can reduce suicide rates.

AB This article examines suicide prevention among children in India's "suicide capital" of Kerala to interrogate the ways temporalization practices inform the cultivation of ethical, life-avowing subjects in late capitalism. As economic liberalization and migration expand consumer aspiration in Kerala, mental health experts link the quickening of material gratification in middle-class parenting to the production of insatiable, maladjusted, and impulsively suicidal children. Experiences of accelerated time through consumption in "modern" Kerala parenting practice reflect ideas about the threats of globalization that are informed both by national economic shifts and by nostalgia for the state's communist and developmentalist histories, suggesting that late capitalism's time-space compression is not a universalist phenomenon so much as one that is unevenly experienced through regionally specific renderings of the past. I demonstrate how experts position the Malayali child as uniquely vulnerable to the fatal dangers of immediate gratification, and thus exhort parents to retemporalize children through didactic games built around the deferral of desires for everyday consumer items. Teaching children how to wait as a pleasurable and explicitly antisuicidal way of being reveals anxieties, contestations, and contradictions concerning what ought to constitute "quality" investment in children as temporal subjects of late capitalism. The article concludes by bringing efforts to save elite lives into conversation with suicide prevention among migrants to draw out the ways distinct vulnerabilities and conditions of precarity situate waiting subjects in radically different ways against the prospect of self-destruction.

AB Rates, demographics and diagnostics, which are the focus of many studies of suicide, may provide an insufficient account without adequate consideration of psychological, social and cultural contexts and motives. Furthermore, reported explanations of suicide are shaped not only by events but also the relationship of survivor respondents explaining the suicide. An explanatory model interview for sociocultural autopsy has been used to assess underlying problems and perceived causes. This study in a low-income community of Mumbai in 2003-2004 compared accounts of the closest family survivors and more distant relationships. Our study design distinguished series-level agreement (i.e., consistency of accounts within a group) and case-level agreement for particular cases. Serious mental illness was the perceived cause reported by a respondent in either group for 22.0% of index suicides, but case-level agreement was only 6.0%. Regarding financial stressors, more closely related family respondents focused on acute stressors instead of enduring effects of poverty. Case-level agreement was high for marital problems, but low for other sources of family conflict. Tension was a feature of suicide reported in both groups, but case-level agreement on tension as a perceived cause was low (kappa = 0.14). The role of alcohol as a perceived cause of suicide had high series level agreement (46.0% in both groups) and case-level agreement (kappa = 0.60), suggesting comparable community and professional views of its significance. The study shows that it is relevant and feasible to consider general community patterns and particular survivor interests. Findings from this study recommend an approach to sociocultural autopsy to assess reasons for suicide in community studies. Findings clarify diverse views of underlying problems motivating suicide that should be considered to make mental health care more effective in assessing risk and preventing suicide.

AB Background Suicide among young people has emerged as a major public health issue in many low- and middle-income (LAMI) countries. Suicidal behaviour including ideation and attempt are the most important predictors of completed suicide and offer critical points for intervention. The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence and risk factors for suicidal behaviour in young people in India.
   Method and findings Cross-sectional study of 3662 youth (1624 years) from rural and urban communities in Goa, India. Suicidal behaviour during the recent 3 months and associated factors were assessed using a structured interview. Overall 144; 3.9 [95 confidence interval (CI) 3.34.6] youth reported any suicidal behaviour in the previous 3 months. Suicidal behaviour was found to be associated with female gender Odds ratio (OR) 6.5 (95 CI 3.910.8), not attending school or college OR 1.6 (95 CI, 1.012.6), independent decision making OR 2.5 (95 CI 1.54.3), premarital sex OR 3.2 (95 CI 1.66.3), physical abuse at home OR 3.3 (95 CI 1.86.1), life time experience of sexual abuse OR 3.3 (95 CI 1.8-6.0) and probable common mental disorders (CMD) OR 9.5 (95 CI 6.314.5). Gender segregated analysis found independent decision making (P 0.68 for interaction), rural residence (P 0.01 for interaction) and premarital sex (P 0.41 for interaction) retained association with suicidal behaviour only among females (P 0.05). The population attributable fraction estimates were largest for CMD (42.8 for females; 35.9 for males); physical abuse in ones home (12.5 for females; 12.4 for males); sexual abuse (12.1 in females; 22.3 in males); and making independent decisions (22.9 for females). Analyses of the risk factors for the relatively less common outcome of suicide attempts found a similar set of factors as for suicidal behaviour; in addition, alcohol use was also an independent risk factor.
   Conclusion Violence and psychological distress are independently associated with suicidal behaviour; factors associated with gender disadvantagein particular for rural women, may increase their vulnerabilities. Prevention programs for youth suicide in India need to address both the structural determinants of gender disadvantage, and the individual experiences of violence and poor mental health.

AB Suicide is a complex phenomenon, often linked to environment. Despite the identification of many social, cultural, economic and political correlates and risk factors, psychiatry continues to argue for curative solutions based on the reductionistic biomedical model, rather than support public health measures to manage the larger sociocultural, economic and political context. While psychiatry and curative medicine help many people, survival of the human body is best explained by the materialist explanation that locates the variation in health and longevity to tangible resources. There is no single, simple or straightforward solution to reducing population suicide rates; specific mental health interventions are unlikely to impact secular trends in the rates of suicide.

   HARM; PATTERNS; TRAGEDY; PROFILE
AB Background: Evidence is accumulating that pesticide self-poisoning is one of the most commonly used methods of suicide worldwide, but the magnitude of the problem and the global distribution of these deaths is unknown.
   Methods: We have systematically reviewed the worldwide literature to estimate the number of pesticide suicides in each of the World Health Organisation's six regions and the global burden of fatal self-poisoning with pesticides. We used the following data sources: Medline, EMBASE and psycINFO (1990-2007), papers cited in publications retrieved, the worldwide web (using Google) and our personal collections of papers and books. Our aim was to identify papers enabling us to estimate the proportion of a country's suicides due to pesticide self-poisoning.
   Results: We conservatively estimate that there are 258,234 (plausible range 233,997 to 325,907) deaths from pesticide self-poisoning worldwide each year, accounting for 30% (range 27% to 37%) of suicides globally. Official data from India probably underestimate the incidence of suicides; applying evidence-based corrections to India's official data, our estimate for world suicides using pesticides increases to 371,594 (range 347,357 to 439,267). The proportion of all suicides using pesticides varies from 4% in the European Region to over 50% in the Western Pacific Region but this proportion is not concordant with the volume of pesticides sold in each region; it is the pattern of pesticide use and the toxicity of the products, not the quantity used, that influences the likelihood they will be used in acts of fatal self-harm.
   Conclusion: Pesticide self-poisoning accounts for about one-third of the world's suicides. Epidemiological and toxicological data suggest that many of these deaths might be prevented if (a) the use of pesticides most toxic to humans was restricted, (b) pesticides could be safely stored in rural communities, and (c) the accessibility and quality of care for poisoning could be improved.

AB Objective. Suicide is a global public health problem, but relatively little epidemiological investigation of the phenomenon has occurred in developing countries. This paper aims to (1) examine the availability of rate data in developing countries, (2) provide a description of the frequency and distribution of suicide in those countries for which data are available, and (3) explore the relationship between country-level socioeconomic factors and suicide rates. It is accompanied by two companion papers that consider risk factors and preventive efforts associated with suicide in developing countries, respectively.
   Method. Using World Health Organization data, we calculated the average annual male, female, and total suicide rates during the 1990s for individual countries and regions (classified according to the Human Development Index [HDI]), and examined the association between a range of socioeconomic indicators and suicide rates.
   Results. For reasons of data availability, we concentrated on medium HDI countries. Suicide rates in these countries were variable. They were generally comparable with those in high HDI countries from the same region, with some exceptions. High education levels, high telephone density, and high per capita levels of cigarette consumption were associated with high suicide rates; high levels of inequality were associated with low suicide rates.
   Conclusion. Epidemiological investigations of this kind have the potential to inform suicide prevention efforts in developing countries, and should be encouraged.

AB Aims: To describe socio-demographic characteristics, psycho-social factors, psychiatric co-morbidity in hundred completed suicide victims.
   Materials and Methods: A detailed interview was carried out with family members of suicide victims using psychological autopsy questionnaire.
   Results: Males committed suicide significantly more often than females. The most common age group was 30-44 years, followed by 15-29 years. Most of them were married (68%) and majority (78%) had education less than 10th standard. Psychiatric morbidity was found in 94%, depression being the most common diagnosis (54%), followed by alcohol use disorders (42%). 40% of the victims had contact with mental health services and 50% with general health services in the 3 months preceding suicide.
   Conclusions: The rate of suicide is high in middle age and a very significant proportion of these suffer from diagnosable psychiatric disorders. Many of the suicide completers visit health services in the preceding few months of the event. In prevention of suicides, health professionals, both mental and general, can play a major role.

SO JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Findings presented here about farmer suicides in Amravati and Yavatmal districts, Maharashtra, are evaluated in relation to Durkheimian theory, which attributes such acts to an historically specific combination of social and economic causes. Lower and middle caste peasant smallholders found themselves trapped between enhanced aspirations generated by land reform and other post-1947 measures, and the reality of neoliberalism (rising debt, declining income). Suicides among large and medium farmers belonging to the higher castes in Maharashtra were occasioned by failures in business, trade and politics. Such cases are consistent,with the argument put forward by Durkheini, that suicide is an effect of individualization, a process of socio-economic 'estrangernent' from agrarian communities experienced by rural producers ill the context of rapid economic growth.

AB Death due to burns is an important public health problem. Suicide by burning is uncommon in the Western world compared with Asian countries. This study presents retrospective research carried out in the tertiary care teaching hospital of Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, Southern India, between January 1993 to December 2003 (11years). Out of a total of 343 burns deaths during the above-mentioned period, 39 were victims of suicide. The majority of deaths (46.1%) occurred in the 21-30 years age group, with a preponderance of the female sex (79.5%). Most of the victims belonged to the Hindu religion and the incident occurred mostly during the daytime. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the incident occurred at home (97.4%). In all cases kerosene was the accelerant and flame was the causative agent. In more than fifty per cent of cases, the total body surface area (TBSA) involved was more than 80%. Dowry demands and harassment were the reasons for committng suicide in 12 cases. More stringent laws and empowering female independence, both mentally and economically, will reduce suicidal burns in young women.

AB Purpose: The relative contributions of psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial stress to suicide, and the efficacy of mental health systems in reducing population suicide rates, are currently unclear. This study, therefore, aimed to investigate whether national suicide rates are associated with their corresponding mental health system indicators.
   Methods: Relevant data were retrieved from the following sources: the World Health Organization, the United Nations Statistics Division and the Central Intelligence Agency World Fact book. Suicide rates of 191 countries were compared with their mental health system indicators using an ecological study design and multivariate non-parametric robust regression models.
   Results: Significant positive correlations between suicide rates and mental health system indicators (p < 0.001) were documented. After adjusting for the effects of major macroeconomic indices using multivariate analyses, numbers of psychiatrists (p = 0.006) and mental health beds (p < 0.001) were significantly positively associated with population suicide rates.
   Conclusions: Countries with better psychiatric services experience higher suicide rates. Although these associations should be interpreted with caution, as the issues are complex, we suggest that population-based public health strategies may have greater impact on national suicide rates than curative mental health services for individuals.

AB Background.- Suicide intent is a strong predictor of repetition of attempts and subsequent suicide. This study aimed to compare socio-demographics, clinical factors and method of attempt in high and low intent suicide attempters.
   Method: All patients admitted following attempted suicide to a teaching hospital were interviewed. Socio-demographic information, details of the attempt and psychiatric diagnosis were recorded. Scales for assessing suicide intent, lethality, recent life-events and depression were administered. Comparison between high intent and low intent groups were done to identify the characteristics of patients who had high suicidal intent.
   Results: The sample comprised 203 patients, 84 of whom were classified as high intent attempters using the Suicide Intent Scale. The high intent group were significantly more likely to be male (p=0.01), of single marital status (p=0.04), have a psychiatric diagnosis, especially depression (p=0.001) and use self immolation to attempt suicide (p=0.001). Patients with high intent had significantly higher lethality (p=0.001) and recent stressful life-event scores (P=0.001).
   Conclusions: High intent Suicide attempts are associated with distinct socio-demographic profiles and psychiatric morbidity. Routine assessment of intent may help to identify individuals with high risk, who can be offered targeted interventions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Yearly, 600,000 people complete suicide in low- and middle-income countries, accounting for 75% of the world's burden of suicide mortality. The highest regional rates are in South and East Asia. Nepal has one of the highest suicide rates in the world; however, few investigations exploring patterns surrounding both male and female suicides exist. This study used psychological autopsies to identify common factors, precipitating events, and warning signs in a diverse sample.
   Randomly sampled from 302 police case reports over 24 months, psychological autopsies were conducted for 39 completed suicide cases in one urban and one rural region of Nepal.
   In the total police sample (n = 302), 57.0% of deaths were male. Over 40% of deaths were 25 years or younger, including 65% of rural and 50.8% of female suicide deaths. We estimate the crude urban and rural suicide rates to be 16.1 and 22.8 per 100,000, respectively. Within our psychological autopsy sample, 38.5% met criteria for depression and only 23.1% informants believed that the deceased had thoughts of self-harm or suicide before death. Important warning signs include recent geographic migration, alcohol abuse, and family history of suicide.
   Suicide prevention strategies in Nepal should account for the lack of awareness about suicide risk among family members and early age of suicide completion, especially in rural and female populations. Given the low rates of ideation disclosure to friends and family, educating the general public about other signs of suicide may help prevention efforts in Nepal.

AB Ingestion of pesticides is the most common suicide method worldwide, accounting for one third of all suicides, predominantly in Asia, Africa, Central and South America. Case fatalities are high, particularly in rural areas. This high case fatality may explain the similar numbers of male and female suicides in Asia, since more women die from their attempts. In Asia, pesticide suicides are mostly impulsive acts with little advance planning and they are less often associated with mental illness than in Western countries. Pesticides are generally chosen for their easy access. Prevention strategies include treating the problems leading to suicidal behaviors involving pesticides; changing attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs about pesticides; controlling access to dangerous pesticides, including developing secure storage practices (which are currently being evaluated); and improving the medical treatment of poisonings. More research is needed to better understand suicides involving pesticides in their cultural contexts and to evaluate the effectiveness of intervention programs, including assessment of possible substitution of methods. Also, more knowledge about protective factors may help suggest innovative prevention strategies.

AB Objective To determine whether brief intervention and contact is effective in reducing subsequent suicide mortality among suicide attempters in low and middle-income countries.
   Methods Suicide attempters (n = 1867) identified by medical staff in the emergency units of eight collaborating hospitals in five culturally different sites (Campinas, Brazil; Chennai, India; Colombo, Sri Lanka; Karaj, Islamic Republic of Iran; and Yuncheng, China) participated, from January 2002 to October 2005, in a randomized controlled trial to receive either treatment as usual, or treatment as usual plus brief intervention and contact (BIC), which included patient education and follow-up. Overall, 91 % completed the study. The primary study outcome measurement was death from suicide at 18-month follow-up.
   Findings Significantly fewer deaths from suicide occurred in the BIC than in the treatment-as-usual group (0.2% versus 2.2%, respectively; chi(2) = 13.83, P<0.001).
   Conclusion This low-cost brief intervention may be an important part of suicide prevention programmes for underresourced low-and middle-income countries.

SO ANTIPODE
LA English
DT Article
DE suicide; preemption; risk; slow death; India
ID POLITICS; GEOGRAPHIES; GENDER; TIME; WAR
AB This paper draws on ethnographic research in Chennai to unpack the pre-emptive logic that shapes anti-suicide interventions at hostels-dormitories-for college-going women in this city. Its central contention is that a concern for the production of a presumed future becomes, in hostels, a governmental technology that is used to limit young women's lifeworlds in the present. These regimes of intervention reinforce the unliveability of attachments, intimacies and affects that popular discourse and scaled-up demographic narrative associate with the potential for suicide. Building from this, the paper also shows that such regimes engender feelings of suffocation and attrition among the young women who live in hostels. "Being slowly killed", as they call it, draws attention to suicide not as a spectacular event but as a site where the terms of everyday life are remade.

The present study is aimed at evaluating psychiatric and genetic traits among primary relatives of suicide completer families in an urban Indian population. Bi-variate analysis shows significant increase in major depression (PHQ and Hamilton), stress, panic disorder, somatoform disorder and suicide attemptamong primary compared to other relatives. Sib pair correlations also reveal significant results for major depression (Hamilton), stress, suicide attempt, intensity of suicide ideation and other anxiety syndrome. 5-HTTLPR, 5-HTT (Stin2) and COMT risk alleles are higher among primary relatives, though statistically insignificant. Backward conditional logistic regression analysis show only independent variable, Depression (Hamilton) made a unique statistically significant contribution to the model in primary relatives.

DT Article
DE Assets-years of presumed life lost; suicide-cost-short-term; total years

AB Background: There is an increasing need for cost computation of every aspect of human behavior for planning. Objective: This objective of the study was to compute the cost of suicide in India in 2015. Materials and Methods: Official data on suicides and life expectancy in 2015 formed the basis for computation of years of presumed life lost and total years of life lived (TYLL). Market rate and official estimates of various expenditures - pre- and post-suicide -formed the basis for loss and gain computation. The difference between income and expenditure formed the total cost. Results: A total of 133,623 persons committed suicide in 2015. They lost 4,349,158 years in total while living for slightly more period of 4,777,293 years. Postsuicide, the expenses were 152,233.8 trillion with a saving of 29,200 trillion. During the lifetime they lived, these people generated an income of 1,672,198 trillion and cost 320739.3 trillion. The net cost of suicide was ' 149,313.9 trillion. Conclusions: Although suicide cannot be prevented completely, much monetary loss can be minimized with adequate preventive tailor-made strategies.

   UNITED-STATES; DISORDERS; HEALTH; PREVALENCE; GENDER; RATES; COMORBIDITY
AB Context: The relative importance of illness (physical and mental) and social disadvantage as risk factors for suicide is controversial.
   Objectives: To describe the risk for attempted suicide in women when it is associated with social disadvantage and physical and mental illness.
   Methods: Data were analysed from a population-based cohort study of women aged 18-50, in Goa, India (n = 2494). Baseline information was collected on socioeconomic factors, gender disadvantage and physical and mental illness. The main outcome was self-report attempted suicide (AS) over a 12-month study period. ORs were calculated using exact logistic regression.
   Results: One-year incidence of AS was 0.8% (n = 18+1 completed suicide) and seven of these women had baseline common mental disorders (CMDs) (37%). In unadjusted models, CMDs (OR 8.71, 95% CI 2.86 to 24.43), exposure to violence (OR 7.70, 95% CI 2.80 to 22.21) and recent hunger (OR 6.59, 95% CI 1.83 to 19.77) were the strongest predictors of incident AS cases. However, in a multivariate model, exposure to violence (OR 5.18, 95% CI 1.55 to 18.75) and physical illness (OR 3.77, 95% CI 1.05 to 12.37) emerged as independent predictors of AS.
   Conclusions: Multi-pronged strategies to reduce domestic violence, provide poverty relief and improve treatment of mental and physical disorders are needed to reduce the population burden of attempted suicide.

AB Background: Suicide is an important social tragic phenomenon which occurs by different tools or methods in different communities. Considering deliberate poisoning as a common and important method in Ilam province for suicide, the present study was launched to epidemiologically assess committing suicide in Ilam province, Iran, based on intentional poisoning.
   Methods: By a retrospective study, all the recorded data associated with intentional poisoning suicide in Ilam Province during 1993-2013 were analyzed. All the demographic variables and the suicides' outcomes were analyzed using the Chi-Square test, and the univariate and multivariate logistic regression models.
   Results: Totally, 6794 cases of suicide (annual incidence rate of 87.28/100, 000) associated with poisoning were evaluated. The incidence rate of suicide attempts was 84.63/100, 000 (94.51 in female and 74.98 in male) and the incidence rate of completed suicide was 2.17/100, 000 (1.94 in female and 2.40 in male). Also, the highest rates of attempted and completed suicide (annual incidence rate of 172.42 and 4.14, respectively) were attributed to the age group of 15-24 year.
   Conclusion: Females had a greater tendency to commit suicide by poisoning, and the lower level of education, the age group of 15-24 years and single individuals were more associated with suicide using poisonings. The incidence of attempted suicide in females and completed suicide in males was higher in this method. Considering the high rate of suicide by poisoning, further attention and supervision on the sale and reserve of drugs and poisons is necessary.
   Meanwhile, it seems that due to momentary emotions during the pubertal stage, the risk of committing suicide is increased especially among unemployed individuals; therefore, performing an extensive psychotherapy intervention is needed in the societies with younger populations.

TI Prevention of suicide with regulations aimed at restricting access to
   highly hazardous pesticides: a systematic review of the international
   evidence

AB Background Pesticide self-poisoning accounts for 14-20% of suicides worldwide. Regulation aimed at restricting access to pesticides or banning highly hazardous pesticides is one approach to reducing these deaths. We systematically reviewed the evidence of the effectiveness of pesticide regulation in reducing the incidence of pesticide suicides and overall suicides.
   Methods We did a systematic review of the international evidence. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase for studies published between Jan 1, 1960, and Dec 31, 2016, which investigated the effect of national or regional bans, and sales or import restrictions, on the availability of one or more pesticides and the incidence of suicide in different countries. We excluded other interventions aimed at limiting community access to pesticides. We extracted data from studies presenting pesticide suicide data and overall suicide data from before and after national sales restrictions. Two reviewers independently assessed papers for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We undertook a narrative synthesis of the data in each report, and where data were available for the years before and after a ban, we pooled data for the 3 years before and the 3 years after to obtain a crude estimate of the effect of the ban. This study is registered through PROSPERO, number CRD42017053329.
   Findings We identified 27 studies undertaken in 16 countries-five low-income or middle-income countries (Bangladesh, Colombia, India, Jordan and Sri Lanka), and 11 high-income countries (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, UK, and USA). Assessments largely focused on national bans of specific pesticides (12 studies of bans in six countries-Jordan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Greece [ Crete], South Korea, and Taiwan) or sales restrictions (eight studies of restrictions in five countries-India, Denmark, Ireland, the UK and the USA). Only five studies used optimum analytical methods. National bans on commonly ingested pesticides in five of the six countries studied, including four studies using optimum analytical methods, were followed by reductions in pesticide suicides and, in three of these countries, falls in overall suicide mortality. Greece was the only country studied that did not show a decrease in pesticide suicide following a ban. There were no high-quality studies of restricting sales to people for occupational uses; four of the seven studies (in three of the five countries studied-India, Denmark, and the USA) showed sales restrictions were followed by decreases in pesticide suicides; one of the two studies investigating trends in overall suicide mortality reported a fall in deaths in Denmark, but there were also decreases in suicide deaths from other methods.
   Interpretation National bans on highly hazardous pesticides, which are commonly ingested in acts of self-poisoning, seem to be effective in reducing pesticide-specific and overall suicide rates. Evidence is less consistent for sales restrictions. A worldwide ban on the use of highly hazardous pesticides is likely to prevent tens of thousands of deaths every year. Copyright (C) The Author(s).

AB Background: It is known that persons who die by suicide commonly visit a primary care physician (PCP) shortly before the fatal act. There is little information on history of suicide attempt in depressed patients who consult PCPs for non-mental health indications. This information is important because past history of suicide attempt is a known predictor of future suicide risk.
   Objective: To estimate the prevalence of depression among outpatients in primary care and to determine the prevalence and determinants of past suicide attempt among them.
   Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted in six primary care settings, both public and private, in Kerala, India. A psychiatrist evaluated adult outpatients (n = 827), diagnosed depression using ICD-10 Diagnostic Criteria for Research, and elicited history of suicide attempt.
   Results: Overall depression prevalence was 27.2% and was higher in women. Past suicide attempt was identified in 6.9% (95% CI, 5.17-8.63%) of all outpatients; higher in women (9.2%) than men (3.6%). Among the depressed, 21.3% had previously attempted suicide; while this figure was 1.5% in the non-depressed. The prevalence of current depression was 81% (severe depression, 61%) in patients reporting past suicide attempts. In univariate analyses, female gender, perceived financial stress, and being depressed were significantly associated with past suicide attempts. In multivariate analysis, current depression was the largest predictor of past suicide attempt (adjusted odds ratio, 14.3; 95% CI, 6.60-31.07).
   Conclusion: Depression and suicide attempt are both common in primary care. Depression is the single most important predictor of suicide attempt. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID FATALITIES
AB Firearm (FA) injuries pose great health burden and presents enormous challenge for health and national economies. This study was undertaken to analyze the characteristics of fatal gunshot injuries, their pattern, associated factors, and postmortem findings in central India, to provide data for such fatalities in this region, which has not been reported earlier. This is a descriptive, retrospective cross-sectional study carried out on the victims of FA injuries referred to the mortuary. Of the autopsies conducted during study, 2.09% were firearm-related deaths. Of the cases, males (92.42%) notably outnumbered females in a ratio of 12.2:1. Homicidal attacks were maximum, and unlicensed, illegal country-made weapons were the preferred choice. Suicides were least. Result signifies that illegal country-made weapons should be strictly limited to save the precious lives. A holistic approach encompassing public awareness, behavioral modification, and stringent management of law and order is the need of the hour.

AB Background:
   While numerous past reviews of psychological autopsy (PA) studies have examined the relationship between mental disorder and suicide, there has been little systematic investigation of suicide occurring in the absence of any identifiable psychiatric condition.
   Aim:
   This article reviews available literature on the topic by considering Axis I, sub-threshold, mild disorders and personality disorders.
   Method:
   We conducted a systematic review of PA studies from 2000 onwards. Studies included in the review had to clearly describe the proportion of suicide cases without a classifiable mental disorder or sub-threshold condition.
   Results:
   Up to 66.7% of suicide cases remained without diagnosis in those studies that only examined Axis I disorders (n = 14). Approximately 37.1% of suicide cases had no psychiatric condition in research papers that assessed personality and Axis I disorders (n = 9), and 37% of suicides had no Axis I, sub-threshold/mild conditions (n = 6). In general, areas in China and India had a higher proportion of suicides without a diagnosis than studies based in Europe, North America or Canada.
   Conclusion:
   Variation in the proportion of suicide cases without a psychiatric condition may reflect cultural specificities in the conceptualization and diagnosis of mental disorder, as well as methodological and design-related differences between studies.

AB Factors and stressful life situations associated with suicidal hanging in a sample from India were studied with a view to explore preventability. Information was collected on consecutive suicidal hanging victims in a 2-year period from various sources including family members through psychological autopsy method. Out of 662 autopsies involving suicide during the study period, 104 had used hanging as the method. Age group of 21-30 years, married females, unmarried males, dowry related stress, unemployment, prolonged illness, failure in examinations, relationship and financial problems were associated more frequently with suicidal hanging. Stresses stemming from social practices and perceptions are linked with considerable number of suicidal hanging, which suggest priority areas for intervention.

TI Human capital attainment and gender empowerment: The Kerala paradox
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB Objectives. The State of Kerala in southwestern India shows the highest gender development index in the country. Despite having the highest literacy rate and educational achievements of women, the suicide rate among females is very high, and domestic violence committed against women is increasing every year in Kerala. This article attempts to analyze the demographic, social, and cultural changes that are occurring in order to understand this apparent paradox of high human capital attainment and high violence and suicides experienced by women in Kerala. Methods. The study uses data from the Census of India (1991, 2001), National Crime Records Bureau (1998-2000), and Reproductive and Child Health (District Level House Hold Survey-2001) to analyze trends in crime, violence, and suicide rates, and demographic profiles of the different districts in Kerala. Results. High educational attainment has fostered new aspirations and attitudes among women in Kerala. Yet, societal and cultural norms still dictate that women should be subservient to men both at home and in the labor market. This imbalance often contributes to family violence and suicides in Kerala. Thus, beneath the veil of development lie some disturbing social, cultural, and economic issues that may be contributing to high rates of suicide and family violence in Kerala. Conclusions. This study demonstrates that high educational attainment alone will not promote gender empowerment unless the social and cultural fabric of a country or state ensures equality of women in all areas of life.

AB This article analyses the circumstances under which attempted suicide became an increasingly common possibility of thought and action among the young, healthy generation of people who had grown up in the South Indian leprosy community where I conducted long-term fieldwork, despite suicide remaining relatively uncommon amongst their leprosy-affected, and often physically disabled, parents and grandparents. Alert to the pitfalls of analytical approaches that either privilege over-arching structural explanations-like those favoured by Durkheim-or, conversely, give too much credence to individual agency and psychology, my analysis here attempts to chart a course through these polarities. It does so by drawing both on Ian Hacking's 'ecological niche' metaphor-to explore how particular configurations of events and circumstances, at different times, might render suicide related behaviour more or less likely among different groups; and on Pierre Bourdieu's notion of the 'habitus'a"to consider how particular sets of bodily dispositions might generate certain styles of attempted suicide and self-harm.

AB Objectives: To investigate the trends and correlations of gross domestic product (GDP) adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita on suicide rates in 10 WHO regions during the past 30 years.
   Design: Analyses of databases of PPP-adjusted GDP per capita and suicide rates. Countries were grouped according to the Global Burden of Disease regional classification system.
   Data sources: World Bank's official website and WHO's mortality database.
   Statistical analyses: After graphically displaying PPP-adjusted GDP per capita and suicide rates, mixed effect models were used for representing and analysing clustered data.
   Results: Three different groups of countries, based on the correlation between the PPP-adjusted GDP per capita and suicide rates, are reported: (1) positive correlation: developing (lower middle and upper middle income) Latin-American and Caribbean countries, developing countries in the South East Asian Region including India, some countries in the Western Pacific Region (such as China and South Korea) and high-income Asian countries, including Japan; (2) negative correlation: high-income and developing European countries, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and (3) no correlation was found in an African country.
   Conclusions: PPP-adjusted GDP per capita may offer a simple measure for designing the type of preventive interventions aimed at lowering suicide rates that can be used across countries. Public health interventions might be more suitable for developing countries. In high-income countries, however, preventive measures based on the medical model might prove more useful.

ID RATES; RISK; INTERVIEW; MORTALITY; SPANISH
AB Background and Aims: Suicidality research in developing countries, including India, faces logistical and cultural challenges. Technology may help address these challenges and offer data to providers treating a diverse clientele. Method: The relationship between perceived stress and suicide-related beliefs was examined in two populations: Indians in India (n = 374) and Caucasians in English-speaking countries (n = 326); the influence of depression on that relationship was also explored. The study was conducted via an Internet-based survey. Results: Three-way interactions (Ethnicity x Perceived stress x Depression status) were observed, predicting strength of the belief that suicide is a solution to problems, F(1,679) = 4.18, p < .05, and that suicide is a good option if quality of life worsens, F(1,675) = 9.53, p < .01. For both beliefs, Caucasians screening positive for depression exhibited the strongest relationship between stress and suicide-related beliefs; for Indians, that relationship was not moderated by depression status. Caucasians also exhibited a stronger association between higher stress and greater belief strength that suicide is a good option assuming a steady quality of life than did Indians, F(1,680) = 6.05, p < .05. Limitations: Participants were recruited through a depression screening website; results may not generalize to those who are uninterested in depression screening or to those who are unwilling or unable to use the internet for that purpose. Conclusion: Our findings may help to better target interventions to reduce suicidality, for example, employ stress reduction techniques for Caucasians who are depressed, and monitor suicidality for Indians reporting high stress regardless of depression.

AB This descriptive study examined gender differences related to attitudes toward suicide among randomly selected urban residents. Data was collected using a standardized questionnaire through face-to-face interview. Our findings revealed that men hold more pro preventive attitudes to help persons with suicidal thoughts (80.3 %, p = 0.05) and agreed that suicidal attempts are impulsive (78.6 %, p = 0.01). However, they hold permissive attitude to help persons with incurable diseases and expressing death wishes to die (66 %, p = 0.05). A majority of men (78.6 %) than women agreed that "suicidal attempt is essentially a cry for help" (chi (2) = 11.798, p = 0.05). These gender differences need to be taken into consideration when developing appropriate programs to prevent suicide. Further, decriminalizing the law, high-quality research and raising awareness about suicide prevention among the general population is crucial in developing countries like India.

AB Introduction: Given the impact of suicide on individuals, families and communities, particularly for rural, remote and Indigenous populations, the current study was undertaken to enhance understanding on this topic. Coroners' reports were identified as a rich data source, amenable to thematic summary to reveal key factors associated with suicide.
   Methods: Thematic analysis was undertaken of 411 coroners' reports of completed suicides across a 10 year period, occurring in the Northern Territory, Australia. Data were extracted numerically and qualitatively, categorised and tallied.
   Results: Key factors associated with suicide in order of frequency of identification by coroners were (i) alcohol and other drug abuse, (ii) conflict and relationship breakdown and (iii) mental illness and mental health concerns. Considerable differences were noted between Indigenous and non-Indigenous cases. In addition to numerical summaries, examples of coroners' comments are provided that underscore the relevance of these factors.
   Conclusion: An array of factors was associated with suicide and considerable variation was found between Indigenous and non-Indigenous cases. The relative importance of social and contextual factors is confirmed for people at risk of suicide in rural, remote and Indigenous populations. These findings suggest relative priorities for suicide prevention and postvention.

AB This study set out to explore the epidemiology of suicide in Bangladesh. A cross-sectional study was carried out during 2003 (January to December). This encompassed a population of 819,429 of all age-groups and sexes. Data was collected by face-to-face interviews at a household level. Suicide was found to be the leading cause of death by injury in the age group of 10-19 years. Adolescent females (10-19 year age group) were found to be the most vulnerable. Overall, the suicide rate was 7.3 (95% CI 5.6-9.5) per 100,000 per year and the highest rate was found in the age group of 60+ years. The rate of suicide was found to be 17-fold higher (95% CI 5.36-54.64) in the rural population, compared to urban rates. Adolescent suicide rate in rural areas was 20.1 (95% CI 12.6-31.7) per 100,000. The rate was 17.7 (95% CI 8.6-34.9) and 22.7(95% CI 12-42) among males and females respectively. Poisoning was found as the most frequent method of suicide. The majority of the suicide victims were found to be very poor and illiterate. Suicide is a major public health problem in Bangladesh. Age, place of residence, economic status and literacy were the major associating factors related to suicide. Adolescents, elderly and those residing in rural regions were the most vulnerable groups.

AB Objectives: To identify the prevalence and correlates of bipolar I patients with a lifetime history of suicide attempt.
   Methods: Bipolar I disorder was diagnosed in 150 patients as per DSM-IV-TR criteria. Their lifetime suicide risk was assessed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. NIMH retrospective Life Chart Methodology was used to chart the illness course. Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to assess the recent adherence and subjective sleep quality, respectively. The suicide attempters were compared with non-attempters on individual variables.
   Results: Around 23% had a positive lifetime history of suicide attempt. They were predominantly female, had an index (first ever) episode of depression, spent more proportion of time being ill, especially in depressive or mixed episode phase. Comorbid substance use disorder along with suicidal attempts was seen only in males. Suicide attempters displayed poor medication adherence attitudes for medications taken during the past week and reported impaired sleep quality for the previous month.
   Conclusions: A positive history of lifetime suicide attempt was significantly associated with a worse course of bipolar I disorder. Effective treatment of depressive episodes, addressing non-adherence, substance use and sleep problems can reduce the suicide risk in such patients. Retrospective design of the study and recall bias are some of the limitations.

AB Background: Pesticide suicides are considered the single most important means of suicide worldwide. Centralized pesticide storage facilities have the possible advantage of delaying access to pesticides thereby reducing suicides. We undertook this study to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a centralized pesticide storage facility as a preventive intervention strategy in reducing pesticide suicides.
   Methods: A community randomized controlled feasibility study using a mixed methods approach involving a household survey; focus group discussions (FGDs) and surveillance were undertaken. The study was carried out in a district in southern India. Eight villages that engaged in floriculture were identified. Using the lottery method two were randomized to be the intervention sites and two villages constituted the control site. Two centralized storage facilities were constructed with local involvement and lockable storage boxes were constructed. The household survey conducted at baseline and one and a half years later documented information on sociodemographic data, pesticide usage, storage and suicides.
   Results: At baseline 4446 individuals (1097 households) in the intervention and 3307 individuals (782 households) in the control sites were recruited while at follow up there were 4308 individuals (1063 households) in the intervention and 2673 individuals (632 households) in the control sites. There were differences in baseline characteristics and imbalances in the prevalence of suicides between intervention and control sites as this was a small feasibility study.
   The results from the FGDs revealed that most participants found the storage facility to be both useful and acceptable. In addition to protecting against wastage, they felt that it had also helped prevent pesticide suicides as the pesticides stored here were not as easily and readily accessible. The primary analyses were done on an Intention to Treat basis. Following the intervention, the differences between sites in changes in combined, completed and attempted suicide rates per 100,000 person-years were 295 (95% CI: 154.7, 434.8; p < 0.001) for pesticide suicide and 339 (95% CI: 165.3, 513.2, p < 0.001) for suicide of all methods.
   Conclusions: Suicide by pesticides poisoning is a major public health problem and needs innovative interventions to address it. This study, the first of its kind in the world, examined the feasibility of a central storage facility as a means of limiting access to pesticides and, has provided preliminary results on its usefulness. These results need to be interpreted with caution in view of the imbalances between sites. The facility was found to be acceptable, thereby underscoring the need for larger studies for a longer duration.

AB Background: Data on mental health among injecting drug users in South Asia is scarce yet poor mental health among users has significant implications for the success of HIV prevention and treatment programmes. A cohort of 449 injecting drug users in Delhi was examined on the following issues (1) examine trends in suicidal ideation, suicide plan and suicidal attempts over a 12-month period, (2) examine association between injecting practices (receive and give used syringes) and suicidal ideation over a 12 month study period.
   Methods: An observational study was conducted providing phased interventions with follow up interviews every 3 months to 449 injecting drug users (IDUs), from August 2004 to November 2005. The study was conducted in Yamuna Bazaar, a known hub of drug peddling in Delhi. Interventions included nutrition, basic medical services, needle exchange, health education, HIV voluntary counseling and testing, STI diagnosis and treatment, oral buprenorphine substitution, and detoxification, each introduced sequentially.
   Results: Suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, did not significantly change over 12 months of observation, while suicide plans actually increased over the time period. Keeping other factors constant, IDUs with suicidal ideation reported more giving and receiving of used syringes in the recent past. Conclusions: Mental health services are warranted within harm reduction programmes. Special attention must be paid to suicidal IDUs given their higher risk behaviours for acquiring HIV and other blood borne infections. IDU intervention programmes should assess and address suicide risk through brief screening and enhanced counseling.

AB Background: Attempted suicide is a strong risk factor for subsequent suicidal behaviors. Innovative strategies to deal with people who have attempted suicide are needed, particularly in resource-poor settings. Aims: To evaluate a brief educational intervention and periodic follow-up contacts (BIC) for suicide attempters in five culturally different sites (Campinas, Brazil; Chennai, India; Colombo, Sri Lanka; Karaj, Islamic Republic of Iran; and Yuncheng, People's Republic of China) as part of the WHO Multisite Intervention Study on Suicidal Behaviors (SUPRE-MISS). Methods: Among the 1,867 suicide attempters enrolled in the emergency departments of the participating sites, 922 (49.4%) were randomly assigned to a brief intervention and contact (BIC) group and 945 (50.6%) to a treatment as usual (TAU) group. Repeated suicide attempts over the 18 months following the index attempt - the secondary outcome measure presented in this paper - were identified by follow-up calls or visits. Subsequent completed suicide - the primary outcome measure has been reported in a previous paper. Results: Overall, the proportion of subjects with repeated suicide attempts was similar in the BIC and TAU groups (7.6% vs. 7.5%, chi(2) = 0.013; p = .909), but there were differences in rates across the five sites. Conclusions: This study from five low-and middle-income countries does not confirm the effectiveness of brief educational intervention and follow-up contacts for suicide attempters in reducing subsequent repetition of suicide attempts up to 18 months after discharge from emergency departments.

AB Background: The risk of suicide among persons with schizophrenia (SZ) is higher than in general population, with multiple contributory factors. We assessed the prevalence of risk of deliberate self-harm and suicide attempts, along with associated socio-demographic and clinical factors in a group of SZ outpatients (n = 61) as part of a larger study on overall schizophrenia-associated risks. Aims: To investigate factors associated with risk of deliberate self-harm and suicide among persons with schizophrenia.
   Method: Out of 270 SZ participants evaluated for various risks using Ram Manohar Lohia Risk Assessment Interview (RML-RAI), 61 reported risk of self-harm including suicide attempt/s. The factors associated with this risk were further evaluated on clinical details and Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies.
   Results: Risk of reported self-harm was 22.59%. Among them, 10% had attempted suicide at least once. Current age and past month Global Assessment of Functioning score from DIGS (GAF) were significantly correlated with suicide attempt. Attempters had significantly lower current GAF score, indicating poorer functioning. Among 27 attempters, 9 attempted at the onset of illness while 6 others attempted suicide within one year. Most common method of attempt was ingestion of insecticides or overdose of medication, followed by hanging or jumping from height.
   Conclusion: In our hospital-based sample of suicide attempters, 10% had attempted suicide, among them over 55% within first year of illness. Attempters were significantly older than non-attempters and suffered from significantly more severe illness than non-attempters. Positive symptoms were significantly associated with attempt, irrespective of time at which suicide was attempted.

AB This cross-cultural study investigates whether religiosity assessed in three dimensions has a protective effect against attempted suicide. Community controls (n = 5484) were more likely than suicide attempters (n = 2819) to report religious denomination in Estonia (OR = 0.5) and subjective religiosity in four countries: Brazil (OR = 0.2), Estonia (OR = 0.5), Islamic Republic of Iran (OR = 0.6), and Sri Lanka (OR = 0.4). In South Africa, the effect was exceptional both for religious denomination (OR = 5.9) and subjective religiosity (OR = 2.7). No effects were found in India and Vietnam. Organizational religiosity gave controversial results. In particular, subjective religiosity (considering him/herself as religious person) may serve as a protective factor against non-fatal suicidal behavior in some cultures.

AB Objective. Trends in suicide death rates among migrants to England and Wales 1979-2003 were examined.
   Methods. Age-standardised rates derived for eight country of birth groups.
   Results. For men born in Jamaica, suicide death rates increased in 1999-2003. There were declines in rates for men and women from India and from Scotland, men from East Africa and Northern Ireland and women from the Republic of Ireland. For both men and women born in Scotland or the Irish Republic, despite declines for some, rates remained higher than for England and Wales born. Rates among men from Pakistan were consistently lower than men born in England and Wales.
   Conclusion. These analyses indicate declining trends for most migrant groups and for England and Wales-born women, but adverse trends in death rates for some country of birth groups.

AB Introduction: Over the past 20 years the WHO has considerably improved world mortality data. There are still shortcomings but more countries now report data and world-wide estimates are regularly made. Methods: Data about mortality have been retrieved from the WHO world database. Worldwide injury mortality estimates for 2008 as well as trends of the suicide rate from 1950 to 2009 were analysed. Results: Suicides in the world amount to 782 thousand in 2008 according to the WHO estimate, which is 1.4% of total mortality and 15% of injury mortality. The suicide rate for the world as a whole is estimated at 11.6 per 100,000 inhabitants. The male-female rate ratio of suicide is estimated to be highest in the European Region (4.0) and the lowest in the Eastern Mediterranean region (1.1). Among males the highest suicide rate in the 15-29 age group is in the SE Asian region, in the 45-59 age group in European males and for ages above 60 in the Western Pacific region. Females from SE Asia have a remarkably high suicide rate among 15-29-year-olds and from age 45 in the Western Pacific region. The leading country is currently Lithuania, with a suicide rate of 34.1 per 100,000 inhabitants. Also among males the suicide rate is the highest in Lithuania at 61.2. Among females South Korea with 22.1 is at the top of world suicide rates. Conclusions: During the past six decades, according to the WHO Japan, Hungary, and Lithuania have topped the list of world countries by suicide rate, but if the current trends continue South Korea will overtake all others in a few years. The heart of the problem of suicide mortality has shifted from Western Europe to Eastern Europe and now seems to be shifting to Asia. China and India are the biggest contributors to the absolute number of suicides in the world.

AB Suicide attempt is a significant risk factor for suicide, as approximately 10% of the suicide attempters succumb to suicide within one year of their last attempt. The present study aims to investigate the association of psychological variables, environmental stressors and genetic risk factors with suicide attempt. In the present study 258 individuals;129 suicide attempters (cases) and 129 individuals (controls) from general population matched for age, gender, ethnicity and neighborhood and without family or self-history of suicidal behaviour were recruited. The personal information and sociodemographic data were collected using interview schedules. Psychological variables; somatoform disorder, anxiety, depression and hopelessness and environmental stressors; childhood trauma and stressful life events were measured using standard tools. Blood samples were collected for the genotypic analysis of 5HTTLPR and Stin (2) VNTR gene polymorphisms. Binary logistic models using SPSS ver. 20 were used to compute allelic or genetic risk and gene-environment interactions. The haplotypic analysis was computed using SHESIS online tool. In the present study, psychological variables such as stressful life events, anxiety and hopelessness were found to be significantly associated with increased risk for suicide attempt. The haplotypic analysis illustrated higher frequency of s10 haplotype among suicide attempters as compared to that of controls. Further, Gene-Environment interaction between the mutant allele of selected loci of serotonin gene and stressful life events was observed.

AB Agriculture is the main sources of income for humans. Likewise, agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy. In India, Tamil Nadu regional state has a wide range of possibilities to produce all varieties of organic products due to its diverse agro-climatic condition. This research aimed to identify the economics and efficiency of organic farming, and the possibilities to reduce farmers' suicides in the Tamil Nadu region through the organic agriculture concept. The emphasis was on farmers, producers, researchers, and marketers entering the sustainable economy through organic farming by reducing input cost and high profit in cultivation. A survey was conducted to gather data. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) has been used to test the hypothesis regards the cost and profit of rice production. The results showed that there was a significant difference in profitability between organic and conventional farming methods. It is very transparent that organic farming is the leading concept of sustainable agricultural development with better organic manures that can improve soil fertility, better yield, less input cost and better return than conventional farming. The study suggests that by reducing the cost of cultivation and get a marginal return through organic farming method to poor and small scale farmers will reduce socio-economic problems such as farmers' suicides in the future of Indian agriculture.

AB Background: Health demographic mortality studies use verbal autopsies to identify suicide as a cause of death. Psychological autopsies focus almost exclusively on associated high-risk psychiatric disorders. New approaches considering contextual factors are needed for preventing suicide and promoting mental health. Aims: This study examined explanations of suicide reported by surviving family members or close friends with reference to social, cultural, and environmental conditions as well as the challenges of life in the Malavani slum of Mumbai. Methods: An EMIC (Explanatory Model Interview Catalog) interview based on a cultural epidemiological framework considered underlying problems, perceived causes, and sociocultural contexts. It was administered to survivors of 76 people who had died by suicide (56.6% women). Results: Accounts of underlying problems typically referred to various aspects of tension (73.7%). Perceived causes often identified multiple factors. The sociocultural contexts of suicide included the victimization of women, the personal and social impact of problem drinking, marital problems, physical health problems, mental tension, possession and sorcery. Women were particularly vulnerable to the impact of problem drinking by a spouse or father. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the value of an approach to sociocultural autopsy examining local contexts and explanations of suicide. Findings highlight needs for both mental health services and culturally sensitive social interventions.

AB IQs were correlated with the z score of suicide rate minus z score of homicide rate using nine regions of the world-established market economies, formerly socialized Europe, India, China, other Asian nations, Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America/Caribbean, Middle East Crescent, and the USA. Correlations were .85 and .83 with crude rates and age-adjusted rates, respectively. The homicide findings are consistent with previous research in individual countries showing that less intelligent persons commit homicide more often. However, the present findings of a positive correlation between IQ and suicide rates are the opposite of what has been found in the more definitive studies within countries. Explanations for the apparent paradox and for the findings more generally were offered.

AB With the overwhelming suicide rate among men over women, and family problems and illness being the major causes of suicide in India, it is important that we have a better understanding of how men struggle with depression in the context of family. The aim of this study is to understand the subjective experiences of depression and family's role in gender socialization among Indian men. A non-clinical sample of nine men was selected using convenience sampling from a human service organization. Theoretical sampling of biographical accounts of a clinical group (one male client with a history of clinical depression) was used for the triangulation of data. A consensual qualitative research methodology was adopted. The findings contribute to new insights into the understanding of depression in the light of early family influences among Indian men. Implications suggest that further studies of male depression in the family context, the challenge of family life education in India, and the importance of gender sensitivity in counseling with men are required.

AB Asia is the world's largest continent, occupying approximately half the earth's land mass and containing half the world's population. Although ethnically, culturally, economically, and religiously diverse, there are a number of factors common to all Asian countries, as well as some important differences. It is estimated that suicides in Asia contribute 60% to the global one million suicides annually, with three Asian countries (viz. China, India, and Japan) accounting for more than 40% of this figure. Other Asian countries with high suicide rates include Kazakhstan, Sri Lanka, and South Korea. The majority of people dying by suicide in Asia are young, and pesticides are one of the most common methods used. In many Asian countries, the male to female ratio is much narrower and in China it is reversed. Given that there are 10-20 attempts for every completed suicide and at least six people are directly affected by a suicide or a serious attempt, there may be as many as 60 million people in Asia suffering from the consequences of a suicidal act every year, but postvention remains a neglected area in Asia. Due to a variety of legal, socio-cultural, and religious factors suicide rates in many Asian countries are grossly underestimated and there are huge research and knowledge gaps. A fifth of Asian countries either do not collect national mortality statistics on suicide or even if they do, they do not report them to the World Health Organization (WHO). To reduce the enormous burden of suicide in Asia, there is a need for more and better research to inform policy and establish culturally relevant suicide prevention programmes.

DE burns; mortality; sociocultural determinants; rural India
AB In 1998, India was the only country in the world where fire (burns) was classified among the 15 leading causes of death. High mortality in young married women from burns has already become an alarming and contentious medical problem in rural India. The incidences of burn mortality by age, sex, residence, marital status; manner and reasons have been reported only infrequently from the rural parts of India. From a total of 4042 medicolegal deaths reported at an Apex medical centre of a rural health district, over a period of 5 years 1997-2001, 942 deaths (23.3%) were due to burns; with mortality rate of 15.1 per year per 100,000 population. Of all burn death cases, 80.8% were females, 82.4% married ones, 71.9% belonged to the young age group of 21-40 years and 75.0% came from the rural parts of the district. Out of all burn deaths, 50.7% were accidental, 47.8% suicidal and 1.5% were homicidal in manner. In all female suicides, burns was the commonest method adopted by over 60% females. Torture by in-laws (32.1%) was the commonest reason for committing suicide by burns in married women. The present study has tried to identify the high-risk group and reasons for high burn mortality in this rural area. Religious and sociocultural reasons prevalent in the area are discussed, which play the determinant role in such a high mortality rate in burns in rural India. Further studies in India into psychodynamics of sociocultural, religious and family life are advised. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

AB The current study aims to illustrate male to female suicide rate ratios in the world and explore the correlations between female labour force participation rates (FLPR) and suicide rates of both genders. Further, whether the relationship of FLPR and suicide rates vary according to the human capabilities of a given country are examined.
   Using suicide data obtained from the World Health Organization Statistical Information System, suicide gender ratios of 70 countries are illustrated. Based on the level of Human Development Index (HDI) and FLPR, the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) was used to determine the optimal number of clusters of those countries. Graphic illustrations of FLPR and gender-specific suicide rates, stratified by each cluster were presented, and Pearson's correlation coefficients calculated.
   Three clusters are identified, there was no correlation between FLPR and suicide rates in the first cluster where both the HDI and FLPR were the highest (Male: r = 0.29, P = 0.45; Female: r = 0.01, P = 0.97); whereas in Cluster 2, higher level of FLPR corresponded to lower suicide rates in both genders, although the statistical significance was only found in females (Male: r = 0.32, P = 0.15; Female: r = 0.48, P = 0.03). In Cluster 3 countries where HDI/FLPR were relatively lower, increased FLPR was associated with higher suicide rates for both genders (Male: r = 0.32, P = 0.04; Female: r = 0.32, P = 0.05).
   The relationship between egalitarian gender norms and suicide rates varies according to national context. A greater egalitarian gender norms may benefit both genders, but more so for women in countries equipped with better human capabilities. Although the beneficial effect may reach a plateau in countries with the highest HDI/FLPR; whereas in countries with relatively lower HDI/FLPR, increased FLPR were associated with higher suicide rates.

TI Political Economy of Farm Loan Waivers in India
SO FIIB BUSINESS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE Debt trap; farm loan waivers; political economy; India
AB Political leadership of various states in India is under tremendous pressure to provide instant relief to the farmers reeling under debt trap, resulting in suicides in several cases. Often, suicides by peasants are widely covered in the media which in turn sway the people's perception about apparent indifference of the government towards the farming communities of the country. This certainly brings in concerns related to political economy revolving around judicious distribution of wealth and national income of the country. State governments of India are generally reluctant to waive off the farm loans as a matter of routine due to concomitant burden on exchequer that might adversely affect their fiscal balances. However, political parties tend to use farm loan waiver as tactics to come to power in spite of the fact that such populist measures are not good for the economy, nor do they offer a long-term solution to the age-old problem of higher degree of incidence of indebtedness among the farming communities.

TI Explaining suicide attempt with personality traits of aggression and

SO PLOS ONE

   TEMPERAMENT; ADOLESCENTS; VIOLENCE
AB Introduction
   Suicide is a spectrum of behavior including suicide ideation and suicidal attempt and is undoubtedly the outcome of the interaction of several factors. The role of two main constructs of human nature, aggression and impulsivity, has been discussed broadly in relation to suicide, as endophenotypes or traits of personality, in research and in clinical practice across diagnoses. The objective of our study was to assess impulsive and aggressive behaviors among primitive people of the Idu Mishmi tribe, who are known for high suicide completer and attempter rates.
   Methods
   The study group was comprised of 177 unrelated Idu Mishmi participants divided into two sets: 39 suicide attempters and 138 non-attempters. Data on demographic factors and details of suicide attempts were collected. Participants completed a set of instruments for assessment of aggression and impulsivity traits.
   Results
   In the Idu Mishimi population we screened (n = 177), 22.03% of the individuals had attempted suicide, a high percentage. The suicide attempters also showed a significant sex difference: 35.9% were male and 64.10% were female (p = .002*). The suicide attempters (A) scored significantly higher than non-attempters (NA) on aggression (A = 23.93, NA = 18.46) and impulsivity (A = 75.53, NA = 71.59, with p value = 0.05). The trait impulsiveness showed a significantly higher difference (F (1, 117) = 7.274) in comparison to aggression (F (1, 117) = 2.647), suggesting a profound role of impulsiveness in suicide attempts in the Idu Mishmi population. Analysis of sub-traits of aggression and impulsivity revealed significant correlations between them. Using different models, multivariate logistic regression implied roles of gender (OR = 1.079 (0.05)) and impulsiveness (OR = 3.355 (0.013)) in suicide attempts.
   Conclusion
   Results demonstrate that gender and impulsivity are strong risk factors for suicide attempts in the Idu Mishmi population.

AB Objectives. We sought to study suicidal behavior prevalence and its association with social and gender disadvantage, sex work, and health factors among female sex workers in Goa, India.
   Methods. Using respondent-driven sampling, we recruited 326 sex workers in Goa for an interviewer-administered questionnaire regarding self-harming behaviors, sociodemographics, sex work, gender disadvantage, and health. Participants were tested for sexually transmitted infections. We used multivariate analysis to define suicide attempt determinants.
   Results. Nineteen percent of sex workers in the sample reported attempted suicide in the past 3 months. Attempts were independently associated with intimate partner violence (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=2.70; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.38, 5.28), violence from others (AOR=2.26; 95% CI=1.15, 4.45), entrapment (AOR=2.76; 95% CI=1.11, 6.83), regular customers (AOR=3.20; 95% CI=1.61, 6.35), and worsening mental health (AOR=1.05; 95% CI=1.01, 1.11). Lower suicide attempt likelihood was associated with Kannad ethnicity, HIV prevention services, and having a child.
   Conclusions. Suicidal behaviors among sex workers were common and associated with gender disadvantage and poor mental health. India's widespread HIV-prevention programs for sex workers provide an opportunity for community-based interventions against gender-based violence and for mental health services delivery.

SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SPECIALITIES

DT Review
AB It is well known that both accidental and intentional poisoning is a public health problem especially in developing countries like India. Deliberate self poisoning is one of the most common methods of suicide in India. Understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms behind different toxic agents has important implications for the classification of toxic agents, determining the safe exposure levels and identification of antidote treatments. Toxic agents act through a common pathway leading from exposure to its metabolism and changes at the cellular and molecular level. This review attempts to elucidate simply the pathophysiology of common toxic agents. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier, a division of RELX India, Pvt.

Data or the study was gathered from autopsy reports and hospital records. The cases represented approximately 1.98% of all autopsy cases received from South Delhi at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi (India). Data was analysed with regard to the age and sex of the victim, season of the year, site of the body, time of day, place of occurrence and presence of entry and exit wounds on the body. Death occurred at the scene of the fatal event in 150 cases and three cases died in hospital. Three cases showed no electric burn marks on the body; the cause of death in one of these cases was polytrauma due to a fall from a height and one case had committed suicide.

AB Drawing on multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork in Hyderabad, South India, this article explores the relationship between charity and disability. Despite a stereotype of philanthropic aid as reproductive of existing power structures or symptomatic of state failures to eliminate poverty, closer investigation exposes a more multi-layered picture. Disjunctures in donor and recipient perspectives on charity are shown to create spaces in which recipients might challenge the very characterisations that allow them access to aid in the first place, revealing both the potential and the limitations of charitable aid to bring about social change for disabled people.

AB A case study was conducted for Yavatmal district of Maharashtra state of India where dryland agriculture dominates and where a significant number of farmers have committed suicides in recent years due to the lack of support systems necessary to manage an agrarian crisis. Using monthly temperature and the precipitation data during 2001-2013 period, a weather-based index was developed for the main crops of the district (sorghum, soybean, and pigeon pea; cotton was excluded) to assess the agrarian crisis due to low crops yields, in a more objective and less disputable way that could be preferred by a crop insurance company. While the mean value of WI was 1.0, its range was 0.64 to 1.32 for pigeon pea, from 0.94 to 1.12 for sorghum, and from 0.31 to 1.72 for soybean. These ranges could be further divided appropriately into qualitative categories of to define agrarian crisis for the purpose of designing crop insurance plans to support farmers at their hard times thus making agricultural profession more sustainable.

AB Introduction The reliable identification, by emergency physicians, of those with intentional self-poisoning at risk of repeating attempts is crucial, particularly in countries with a shortfall of mental health professionals.
   Methods This cross-sectional study of intentional self-poisoning in India compared an emergency physician's assessment for the need for psychiatric referral, using the modified SAD PERSONS Scale (MSPS) as an interview guide, with a standard psychiatric interview.
   Results In 67 consecutive adults with intentional self-poisoning, MSPS cut-off scores of 5 or more best approximated psychiatric assessments for the need for psychiatric referral (positive likelihood ratio 2.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8-10.2; negative likelihood ratio 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.8).
   Conclusions MSPS-guided emergency physicians' assessments after self-poisoning showed modest concordance with psychiatric assessments of suicide-risk. Concordance with psychiatric assessments may improve if risk factors prevalent in different settings are identified and incorporated in the MSPS.

   Policy Examined

ID FOOD SECURITY; WTO; GROWTH; TRADE; DOHA; INVESTMENT; AGREEMENT;
   POLITICS; ECONOMY; BRAZIL
AB India has actively tried to shape the WTO agricultural negotiations by submitting detailed proposals, building coalitions, and even taking hard stands (veto) at critical junctures. However, this aggressive posturing presents a sharp contrast with India's domestic agricultural space, where the situation highlights policy neglect, manifesting in agrarian distress and farmer suicides. This paper analyzes contradictions between India's internationally espoused negotiating positions and its domestic policy goals. It argues that India's core focus has been to preserve status quo in the domestic food markets, driven by the political need to provide food-based consumption subsidies and manage an assured price and supply protection to its vulnerable consumers. As a result, India's interests are divergent from most of its developing country coalition partners in the G-20 as well as the G-33 groups. Our discussion has significant implications for both the domestic policy, as well as the sustainability of India's strategy in global agricultural trade negotiations.

AB Background Although suicide is one of the leading causes of deaths in young women in low-income and middle-income countries, the contribution of suicide and injuries to pregnancy-related mortality remains unknown.
   Methods We did a systematic review to identify studies reporting the proportion of pregnancy-related deaths attributable to suicide or injuries, or both, in low-income and middle-income countries. We used a random-effects meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence of pregnancy-related deaths attributable to suicide, stratified by WHO region. To account for the possible misclassification of suicide deaths as injuries, we calculated the pooled prevalence of deaths attributable to injuries, and undertook a sensitivity analysis reclassifying the leading methods of suicides among women in low-income and middle-income countries (burns, poisoning, falling, or drowning) as suicide.
   Findings We identified 36 studies from 21 countries. The pooled total prevalence across the regions was 1.00% for suicide (95% CI 0.54-1.57) and 5.06% for injuries (3.72-6.58). Reclassifying the leading suicide methods from injuries to suicide increased the pooled prevalence of pregnancy-related deaths attributed to suicide to 1.68% (1.09-2.37). Americas (3.03%, 1.20-5.49), the eastern Mediterranean region (3.55%, 0.37-9.37), and the southeast Asia region (2.19%, 1.04-3.68) had the highest prevalence for suicide, with the western Pacific (1.16%, 0.00-4.67) and Africa (0.65%, 0.45-0.88) regions having the lowest.
   Interpretation The available data suggest a modest contribution of injuries and suicide to pregnancy-related mortality in low-income and middle-income countries with wide regional variations. However, this study might have underestimated suicide deaths because of the absence of recognition and inclusion of these causes in eligible studies. We recommend that injury-related and other co-incidental causes of death are included in the WHO definition of maternal mortality to promote measurement and effective intervention for reduction of maternal mortality in low-income and middle-income countries.

TI Suicide attempts, plans, and ideation in culturally diverse sites:: the

AB Background. The objectives were to assess thoughts about suicide, plans to commit suicide and suicide attempts in the community, to investigate the use of health services following a suicide attempt, and to describe basic socio-cultural indices of the community.
   Method. The community survey was one component of the larger WHO multisite intervention study on suicidal behaviours (SUPRE-MISS). In each site, it aimed at randomly selecting and interviewing at least 500 subjects of the general population living in the catchment area of the emergency department where the intervention component of the study was conducted. Communities of eight SUPRE-MISS sites (in Brazil, China, Estonia, India, Iran, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam) participated plus two additional sites from Australia and Sweden conducting similar surveys.
   Results. Suicide attempts (0(.)4-4(.)2%), plans (1(.)1-15(.)6%), and ideation (2(.)6-25(.)4%) varied by a factor of 10-14 across sites, but remained mostly within the ranges of previously published data. Depending on the site, the ratios between attempts, plans, and thoughts Of Suicide differed substantially. Medical attention following a suicide attempt varied between 22% and 88% of the attempts.
   Conclusions. The idea of the suicidal process as a continuous and smooth evolution from thoughts to plans and attempts of suicide needs to be further investigated as it seems to be dependent on the cultural setting. There are indications, that the burden of undetected attempted suicide is high in different cultures; an improved response from the health sector on how to identify and support these individuals is needed.

TI Prescription drug suicide in non-abusers: A 6-year forensic survey
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE Prescription; Drugs; Suicide; Overdose; Opiates; Antispasmodics
AB Background: Prescription drug suicide merits study to guide the development of strategies to reduce suicide risk. We examined prescription drug suicide specifically in non-abusers of prescription drugs; this is a relatively unexplored subject.
   Methods: Six-year data on prescription drug suicide in non-abusers were extracted from the records of the Department of Forensic Medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. These records contained information obtained from the scene of the suicide, from interviews with relatives of the deceased, and from forensic toxicological analyses at two laboratories.
   Results: There were 27 (8%) cases of prescription drug suicide in non-abusers out of 338 cases of suicidal poisoning. The mean age of this sample was 26 years. The sample was 74% male. Nearly half of the cases (44%) were students. A combination of dextropropoxyphene with dicyclomine, with or without paracetamol, was used by 41% of cases. Overdose was achieved through the ingestion of 10-40 (median, 30) tablets or by the injection of 2-3 (median, 2) vials of medication. In 52% of cases, it appeared that the drugs had been procured over the counter.
   Conclusions: It is reassuring that the absolute number of prescription drug suicides in non-abusers was small; the findings, however, are important because they could serve as a baseline for assessing time trends in future studies. For the present, we suggest that prescription drugs of potential abuse, especially those containing opioids and antispasmodics, should be prescribed and dispensed judiciously, especially to youth.

TI Global trends in teenage suicide: 2003-2014

ID MENTAL-HEALTH 2; ADOLESCENT SUICIDE; YOUNG-PEOPLE; RISK-FACTORS;
   SELF-HARM; PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSES; COMPLETED SUICIDE; UNITED-STATES;
   HIGH-SCHOOL; YOUTH
AB The object of this article is to review the past decade of research on teenage suicide, with a particular emphasis on epidemiologic trends by age, gender and indigenous ethnicity. As such, a review of research literature from 2003 to 2014 was conducted via a comprehensive search of relevant psychological and medical databases. Wide gaps in our knowledge base exist concerning the true extent of teenage suicide due to lack of data, particularly in developing countries, resulting in a Western bias. The gender paradox of elevated suicidality in females with higher completed suicide rates in males is observed in teenage populations worldwide, with the notable exceptions of China and India. Native and indigenous ethnic minority teens are at significantly increased risk of suicide in comparison to general population peers. Often those with the highest need for mental health care (such as the suicidal adolescent) have least access to therapeutic support.
   Globally, suicide in teenagers remains a major public health concern. Further focused research concerning completed suicides of youth below the age of 18 is required across countries and cultures to understand more about risk as children progress through adolescence. Gender and ethnic variations in suicidality are embedded within cultural, historical, psychological, relational and socio-economic domains. Worldwide, the absence of child/adolescent-specific mental health policies may delay the development of care and suicide prevention. Overall, it is vital that clinicians adopt a holistic approach that incorporates an awareness of age and gender influences, and that cultural competency informs tailored and evaluated intervention programmes.

AB This article reviews research into suicide in women during the last 25 years. National rates vary between the extremes of 19/10(5) per year in Sri Lanka and < 1/10(5) per year in the Philippines and Egypt, but almost everywhere rates for women are much lower than male retest with a median ratio of 2.8/1. The exceptions are in India and China, which report higher rates in young married women. The reproductive process has some influence. While menstruation, hormonal treatment, pregnancy and the puerperium have no major effect, unwanted pregnancy may still lead to suicide under certain circumstances, and severe labour can occasionally do so. Having children protects, but the relative risk is no more than 2.0 in nulliparous women. Social factors also have a limited effect. There are higher rates of suicide in divorced women, but the evidence on widowhood is equivocal. Prosperity and employment have no effect. Sexual abuse, rape and domestic violence undoubtedly lead to suicide attempts, but the evidence on completed suicide is lacking. There are many unanswered questions, especially why rates of completed suicide for women (with a greater prevalence of overt depression) are lower than for men, and why Chinese and Indian women have higher rates. More research is required, especially from developing nations.

AB Background: Euthanasia requests have increased as the number of debilitated patients rises in both developed and developing countries such as India due to medical, psychosocial-emotional, socioenvironmental, and existential issues amid fears of potential misuse. World's position: Albania, Colombia, the Netherlands, and Switzerland permit euthanasia conditionally. Australia's legalization of euthanasia has been withdrawn. The United States permits withdrawal of life support. Mexico and Norway permit active euthanasia. India's position: Following the Aruna Shanbaug case the Supreme Court granted legal sanction to passive, but not active, euthanasia that is valid till the Parliament legislates on euthanasia. Handling euthanasia requests: Acknowledging the complexity of the problem; individualizing the palliative approach; and accepting the There is no alternative' or There is no answer' (TINA) factor.

ID DRUG-USE; PREVALENCE; IDEATION; ALCOHOL; INDIA
AB Background: Substance use is a well-established, and potentially modifiable, risk factor for suicide. Suicide prevention interventions are typically framed within the biomedical paradigm and focus on addressing individual risk factors, improving access to psychiatric care, and improving the skills of medical personnel to recognise at-risk individuals. Few studies have focused on contextual factors that hinder suicide prevention in people with substance use disorders, particularly in low-resource settings. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore mental health care providers' perceptions of barriers to suicide prevention in people with substance use disorders in South Africa.
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 mental health care providers who worked with suicidal people with substance use disorders in Cape Town, South Africa. Data were analysed using thematic analysis and Atlas. ti software was used to code the data inductively.
   Results: Two superordinate themes were identified: structural issues in service provision and broad contextual issues that pose barriers to suicide prevention. Participants thought that inadequate resources and insufficient training hindered them from preventing suicide. Fragmented service provision was perceived to lead to patients not receiving the psychiatric, psychological, and social care that they needed. Contextual problems such as poverty and inequality, the breakdown of family, and stigma made participants think that preventing suicide in people with substance use disorders was almost impossible.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that structural, social, and economic issues serve as barriers to suicide prevention. This challenges individual risk-factor models of suicide prevention and highlights the need to consider a broad range of contextual and socio-cultural factors when planning suicide prevention interventions. Findings suggest that the responsibility for suicide prevention may need to be distributed between multiple stakeholders, necessitating intersectoral collaboration, more integrated health services, cautious use of task shifting, and addressing contextual factors in order to effectively prevent suicide in people with substance use disorders.

AB Background: A number of Delphi expert consensus studies have been carried out with different countries and cultural groups to develop guidelines on how a member of the public should provide assistance to a person who is suicidal. The present study aimed to determine whether cross-culturally generalizable suicide first aid actions are possible by comparing agreement across these Delphi studies.
   Methods: Data on endorsement rates for items were compared across six Delphi studies. These studies involved panels of professionals and consumer advocates from English-speaking countries, professionals from Sri Lanka, professionals from Japan, professionals from India, professionals from the Philippines, and professionals and consumer advocates in refugee and immigrant mental health. Correlations were calculated between item endorsement rates across panels.
   Results: There were 18 items that were highly endorsed across all eight of the Delphi panels and an additional 15 items highly endorsed across the panels from the three lower middle-income countries (India, Philippines and Sri Lanka). Correlations across panels in item endorsement rates were all 0.60 or above, but were higher between panels from countries that are socioeconomically similar.
   Conclusions: There is broad agreement across the diverse expert panels about what are appropriate suicide first aid actions for members of the public, indicating that cross-cultural generalizability is possible. However, there is also some cultural specificity, indicating the need for local tailoring.

AB A prospective study was conducted to analyse the spectrum of suicide attempters and completers at Kasturba Hospital, Manipal, India, over a period of three years (January 2001 to December 2004). The present study comprised a total sample population of 246 cases, of whom 90 died and 156 survived the attempt (1:1.73). Men outnumbered women in the deceased group and women surpassed men in the survivor group. The mean age for the deceased group was 42 years compared with 30 years for the survivor group. Prior attempted suicide in the deceased group was 6.6%. Eighty-three percent of the total population studied opted for 'chemical methods', where insecticides topped the list (64.6%) in both the deceased and the survivor group. Among those who preferred 'physical methods', 50% died and 50% survived. In the current study, 17% of the subjects had received a psychiatric consultation, of whom 91.3% were diagnosed in the spectrum of 'depressive disorders.' Knowledge about the legalities of suicide was lacking in 65% of victims and their kin.

AB The young people in the age group of 10-24 yr in India constitutes one of the precious resources of India characterized by growth and development and is a phase of vulnerability often influenced by several intrinsic and extrinsic factors that affect their health and safety. Nearly 10-30 per cent of young people suffer from health impacting behaviours and conditions that need urgent attention of policy makers and public health professionals. Nutritional disorders (both malnutrition and over-nutrition), tobacco use, harmful alcohol use, other substance use, high risk sexual behaviours, stress, common mental disorders, and injuries (road traffic injuries, suicides, violence of different types) specifically affect this population and have long lasting impact. Multiple behaviours and conditions often coexist in the same individual adding a cumulative risk for their poor health. Many of these being precursors and determinants of non communicable diseases (NCDs) including mental and neurological disorders and injuries place a heavy burden on Indian society in terms of mortality, morbidity, disability and socio-economic losses. Many health policies and programmes have focused on prioritized individual health problems and integrated (both vertical and horizontal) coordinated approaches are found lacking. Healthy life-style and health promotion policies and programmes that are central for health of youth, driven by robust population-based studies are required in India which will also address the growing tide of NCDs and injuries.

AB We use an ethical analysis framework to explain the tensions that microfinance institutions (MFIs) face in following ethical practices when faced with the competing objectives of financial sustainability and social outreach. The extant view is that these institutions have to resort to unethical practices such as usury interest rates and forced loan collections to survive. After a case study of five MFIs, we find that this is not the case, and competing objectives can very well be achieved following ethical practices. This article is set against the background of suicides by microfinance borrowers in India.

SO FEMINIST REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE same-sex marriage; lesbian; gay; suicide; Hindu; India
AB This article examines the phenomenon of same-sex unions, both joint suicides and weddings, mostly among young, low-income, non-English speaking women, that have been reported from many parts of India over the last three decades. Most of the women were Hindus and many of the weddings took place by Hindu rites. None of these women had contact with any LGBT or women's movement or activists before their weddings. Ancient as well as modern texts show that people can and do draw on traditional Hindu ideas about love (as the product of attachments formed in former lives), rebirth (attachments persist from one birth to another) and marriage (which is supposed to outlast one lifetime) to legitimize socially disapproved unions, both cross-sex and same- sex. Right-wing Hindu forces today mistakenly argue that the idea of same- sex love and marriage, and indeed of marriage based on love itself, are Western imports. In fact, same- sex marriages were reported from rural areas and small towns long before the Indian LGBT movement took cognizance of the issue. When families accept them, female couples are generally able to stay together but when families violently oppose them, often with the collusion of local police, couples may be forced to separate or driven to suicide, even though law courts have uniformly upheld the right of consenting adults to live together. Modern Hindu teachers and priests are divided on the question of the validity and desirability of same- sex marriage; a doctrinal debate is now developing.

AB Youth suicide is a public health problem in India, and young people in school, particularly adolescents, experience heavy psychological burden. Prevention programs, involving peer educators (PEs), have proved useful strategies to address this problem, but their impact on the PEs is less understood, particularly in India. This qualitative study aims to explore the changes observed in PE students who were involved in a mindfulness' and Support-Appreciate-Listen-Team' (SALT)-based peer education program to address suicidal behavior in Indian school students. One hundred and fourteen students were trained as PEs in six high schools in Pune to identify and respond to the needs of students in distress. By listening to the narratives of the PEs, their parents, school authorities, and the associated NGO team, we reflect on perceived social, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive changes in PEs. The PEs demonstrated enhanced caring for those in distress both inside and outside school by improved listening skills, self-awareness, care, and empathy. Furthermore, the program had a positive impact on their broad emotional intelligence and PEs expressed increased ownership of life, taking action, and seeking support where needed. The study concludes that mindfulness and SALT-based peer education (PE) programs are valuable for the PEs. This could be used to motivate PEs to volunteer in such programs. Other results are discussed and further research areas are suggested.

SO RESPONSIVE JUDGE: INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES
SE Ius Gentium-Comparative Perspectives on Law and Justice
LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
AB Since July 2017, shocking reports of suicides of teenagers and young adults started surfacing in Indian news media. These were unique because of their possible links with the notorious BlueWhale challenge, an online game, offering a 50 step challenge including suicide. The Madras High Court was the first High Court in India to take cognizance of the matter suo motu. Immediately after it, other High Courts in India were also approached by social cause lawyers through public interest litigations with similar prayers to direct the government and public stakeholders, including the intermediaries and website companies, to take preventive steps against the BlueWhale game. The multiplicity of the public interest litigations motivated the Supreme Court of India to take up the matter as one single matter, and it directed other High Courts not to deal with it to avoid a multiplicity of judicial responses. The case covered a tussle between the emotional intelligence of young people and the artificial intelligence used by the administrators and group members of the game to reach the teenagers and young adults and "trap" them in this dangerous game. This chapter analyses how the judges have responded to the issue and concludes with suggestions for sensitising the higher judiciary regarding the legal-technological issues involved in online games which may prove extremely dangerous for women and children. Finally, the chapter outlines the need for stricter judicial decision-making attitudes towards the liability of foreign hosted Internet service providers.

AB This paper reviews the literature on deliberate self-burning (DSB) and compares patterns in various countries. Fifty-five studies of deliberate self-harm or suicide by fire published in the last 20 years were reviewed. They reported on 3351 cases of DSB, including 2296 deaths. India had the highest absolute number of cases, the highest fatality rate, and the highest contribution of self-harm to burns admissions. The highest reported incidence was from Sri Lanka. Male victims generally predominated in Western countries, and females in the Middle East and the Indian sub-continent. Patients were grossly 10 years older in Europe than in Asia. The use and nature of fire accelerants, the possible roles of ethnicity, religion/faith and imitation are discussed. Three broad groups of victims were identified: psychiatric patients (Western and Middle-Eastern countries); those committing DSB for personal reasons (India, Sri Lanka, Papua-New Guinea, Zimbabwe); and those who are politically motivated (India, South Korea). Self-mutilators and self-immolators seem to be fairly distinct groups of people. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Stress, anxiety and various neurobiological changes have been postulated to be associated with increased suicidal ideation. Hence, this study was undertaken to evaluate the serum concentrations of neurotrophins, inflammatory markers and stress concentrations as predictors of suicidal risk among young adults.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary care referral center in South India from March 2014 to February 2015. We recruited 42 suicide attempters and 42 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. The serum concentrations of neurotrophins (BDNF and NT-3), inflammatory markers (hs-CRP and IL-6) were assessed. Stress severity was assessed by Presumptive Stressful Life Events scale (PSLE) and Daily Hassles and Uplifts Scale-revised (DHUS-R). Psychological distress and Suicide risk was assessed using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) respectively.
   Results: Suicide attempters tend to show significantly lower concentrations of neurotrophins and significantly higher concentrations of inflammatory markers. We observed significant negative correlation of neurotrophins with inflammatory markers, stress, and suicide risk. In multivariate linear regression model, hs-CRP [adjusted beta = 0.333, p < 0.0001], PSLE [adjusted beta = 0.133, p = 0.029], DHUS-R [adjusted beta = 0.159, p = 0.018] emerged as independent predictors of suicide risk (R-2 = 0.76).
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that inflammation and stress scores have a moderate association with suicidal ideation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recognizing the complementary effects of social contexts and psychiatric disorders, this study clarifies the role of gender in suicidal behavior in urban Mumbai by considering psychiatric diagnoses and patient-identified sociocultural features. The cultural epidemiological approach suggests the critical impact of situational sociocultural factors that complement the customary psychopathological accounts for those who harm or kill themselves. The cultural epidemiology of deliberate self-harm (DSH), it is argued, is critical to planning for suicide prevention, community mental health and psychiatric practice. This study, based on a cultural epidemiological framework, compares male and female admissions for DSH, evaluating conditions with SCID-I and EMIC interviews. We assessed features and narratives of suicidal behavior, patient-identified underlying problems, their perceived causes and triggers. The study included 92 women and 104 men. A diagnosis of depressive disorder was made for 48.9 percent of women and 39.4 percent of men. Many patients (50.0 percent of women and 41.3 percent of men) did not fulfill the criteria for any diagnosis, or did so only for an adjustment disorder or a V-code. Men typically explained DSH with reference to work problems, financial problems and problem drinking. Women typically discussed domestic problems, in-law relations and victimization. Problem drinking affected women living with men who drank. Social and situational factors appear to play a relatively greater role than psychiatric illness in self-harm and suicide in Mumbai, as in other Asian studies, compared with Europe and North America.

AB A 22-year-old unmarried, male painter was found by neighbouring shopkeepers to be rolling on the ground inside his shop due to severe abdominal pain. The man had tried to commit suicide by intravenously injecting a solution of copper sulphate, used as an antifouling agent in paints. He was taken to the local hospital with severe epigastric pain, vomiting and diarrhoea.

AB With the developing trends of commercialization of agriculture, the magnitude of loss due to unfavorable eventualities is increasing and the farmers committed suicides. Burdwan district of West Bengal, India, becomes news headline because of farmer suicide. This study tries to underscore the elements which impact marginal farmers' decision to accept Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojona (PMFBY). We collect primary data from 701 farmers in the study over period of from February 2017 to October 2017. Seven estimators, namely education, age, cultivating land area, self-help groups (SHGs), marital condition, gender, and income, are considered, and multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze the data. Results show that gender coefficient is negative which indicates female farmer are prone to agro insurance (access to PMFBY) than male farmers. Results indicate that farmers' PMFBY and income are significant to the situation that one applies if others apply and get benefit.

AB Background. Deliberate self-poisoning by ingesting pesticides is a serious health problem among farmers, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Preventing these suicides is a priority for a public mental health agenda.
   Objective. To examine the role of pesticide poisoning in suicide and nonfatal deliberate self-harm, and clarify awareness of risks, safe practices concerning storage and use of pesticides, and associated self-injury, both unintentional and intentional, within farmer households of the Sundarban region, India.
   Methods. Retrospective record review of adult cases of deliberate self-poisoning at the Block Primary Health Centres of 13 Sundarban Blocks was performed to analyze the relative roles of various methods of self-harm and their lethality. Focus group discussions, questionnaires, and in-depth interviews were undertaken in a community study of farmer households to examine pesticide-related views and practices, with particular attention to storage, use, and health impact.
   Results. Pesticide poisoning was the most common method of deliberate self-harm in both men and women. Pesticide storage in most households was unsafe and knowledge was inadequate concerning adverse effects of pesticides on health, crops, and the environment.
   Conclusions. An intersectoral approach linking the interests of public health, mental health, and agriculture is well suited to serve the collective interests of all three agendas better than each in isolation. Such an approach is needed to reduce morbidity and mortality from unintentional and intentional self-injury in low-income agricultural communities like those of the Sundarban region.

TI Snehalata's death: Dowry and women's agency in colonial Bengal
SO INDIAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL HISTORY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB The death of Snehalata Mukhopadhyay in January 1914 remains one of the earliest and most widely discussed cases of dowry related suicides in colonial India. While the fact file on this Young woman has until recently remained slim, her name appears in most scholarly accounts of dowry related crimes against women. The first aim of this article is to fill in the details of the Snehalata case. It then attempts to understand why her name acquired an iconic status in early twentieth-century Bengali society. While it is impossible to establish beyond doubt why Snehalata killed herself on that fateful January afternoon, her suicide unarguably incited a discourse about women's agency in contemporary society. In mapping that discourse, this article shows how people read the act of Snehalata's suicide to talk about women's roles in public life in new and often contradictory ways.

AB The literature on suicide reveals that this phenomenon has been frequently investigated in several specific groups such as the elderly, adolescents, substance abusers, the terminally ill, and other clinical populations. While literature on suicidology has been forthcoming in the international media, sufficient exploration has not occurred in the Indian context, The present study was conducted with a group of 50 suicide attempters admitted to a private psychiatric facility in India following a failed suicide attempt. Instruments to assess their family interaction pattern as well as the extent of dysfunction experienced in several domains were administered, besides studying their suicidal intent and the stressful life events faced. Poor family interaction pattern, particularly with regard to cohesion and leadership were observed. Dysfunction was high across all domains. The analysis was also based on gender and comparison of marital status. It was observed that while female respondents reported better family interaction, their dysfunction levels were higher than that for men. Unmarried respondents reported better family interaction, while the married respondents experienced greater dysfunction. The implications for therapeutic intervention have also been discussed.

AB The legal and moral validity of euthanasia has been questioned in different situations. In India, the status of euthanasia is no different. It was the Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug case that got significant public attention and led the Supreme Court of India to initiate detailed deliberations on the long ignored issue of euthanasia. Realising the importance of this issue and considering the ongoing and pending litigation before the different courts in this regard, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India issued a public notice on May 2016 that invited opinions from the citizens and the concerned stakeholders on the proposed draft bill entitled The Medical Treatment of Terminally Ill Patients (Protection of Patients and Medical Practitioners) Bill. Globally, only a few countries have legislation with discreet and unambiguous guidelines on euthanasia. The ongoing developments have raised a hope of India getting a discreet law on euthanasia in the future.

AB Objectives There is significant paucity of studies on the impairment associated with Anxiety Disorders (AD) among adolescents. This study focuses on the prevalence and pattern of impairment as well as impairment in the context of severity of AD, co-morbidities, suicide, age and gender in this population.
   Methods In a prospective community survey of 500 adolescents, independent raters administered the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) and Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children/Present and Lifetime to collect the required data. Descriptive statistics and Chi-square tests were done to evaluate the prevalence and profile of impairment, compare the impairment among different types of AD, severity of AD, number of co-morbidities, age and gender on impairment, effect of impairment on the need for suicide prevention.
   Results Impairment in adolescents with AD was a rule, noted in 94.4 %. Irrespective of the type of AD diagnosed, impairment at home was significant in adolescents with AD. The presentation of impairment among different Anxiety Disorders was different with different functional settings. Severity of AD and the number of co-morbidities was related to the impairment. Need for suicide related interventions were not different in those with and without impairment. Age and gender did not influence the presence of impairment.
   Conclusions Anxiety Disorders among adolescents in India result in significant functional impairment. Clinically, in this population assessment of impairment is required. Community policies and plans should have special management strategy to address impairment in adolescents with Anxiety Disorders.

AB This study assessed the prevalence and predictors of suicidality among 462 pregnant women in South India. Women in early pregnancy (< 20 weeks) attending an urban public hospital antenatal center were assessed for suicidality using a modified version of the Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQR) and a single-item (item 10) from the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Severity of depressive symptoms, family violence, and perceived social support were also measured. The prevalence of suicidality in pregnancy was 7.6 % (35/462). Eleven women (2.4 %) reported having had suicidal plans, and 8 (1.7 %) had made a suicidal attempt during the current pregnancy. Younger age, belonging to a middle socioeconomic status, poor perceived support, domestic violence, depressive symptoms, and having a past history of suicidality predicted suicidal ideation during the current pregnancy. Multivariate analysis revealed depression severity and a life time history of suicidal ideation as being the strongest predictors. The findings underscore the need for assessment of psychiatric and psychosocial factors that confer risk among women in this vulnerable period. The results of the study however may be specific to low-income urban women from this geographical location limiting the external validity of our findings.

DE Coping; deliberate self harm; life events; quality of life; social
   support
AB Background: Though deliberate self-harm encompasses a wide variety of medical and social disciplines some of the important psychosocial variable such as life events, social support, coping strategies, and quality of life have not yet been explored in depth in India.
   Aims: The aim was to analyze and compare the type and severity of life events, coping strategies, social support, and quality of life of suicide attempters versus matched normal controls, and to identify the risk factors leading to suicide.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 50 consecutive suicide attempters were compared with same number of age, sex, and martial status matched healthy controls using Presumptive Stressful Life Events Scale, Social Support Questionnaire, AECOM Coping Style Scale, and WHO QOL-Bref.
   Results: Attempters experienced significantly more life events especially untoward events whereas the control group experienced more desirable and impersonal life events. Social support, positive coping, and of QOL were significantly lower in attempters. Among all risk factors desirable life events, good education, and good social support were protective against suicide.
   Conclusion: Suicide attempters were differentiated from healthy controls based on more stressful life events, lower social support, less healthy coping, and poor QOL. Positive life events, good education, and good social support were protective factors against suicide. However, it is difficult to pinpoint a single factor responsible for suicidal behavior. It is the complex interplay of various interrelated factors and the resultant buffering effect, which is protecting the individual against deliberate self-harm.

AB The nature of rurality varies considerably across the world, and there is no single pattern of suicide in rural areas. However, some common themes are evident from countries as diverse as India, the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, and China. Suicide rates tend to be higher in rural populations compared with urban, with relatively higher female rates in some areas. North American and Australian data suggest that indigenous people may be at particularly high risk. Specific rural occupations, such as farming, often seem to be associated with higher risk. Although mental illness plays an important role in suicide in rural areas, as it does elsewhere, it is unclear whether higher rural suicide rates are linked to a correspondingly higher prevalence of mental illness in such populations. Instead, other factors may be important including: adverse socio-economic conditions; higher rates of alcohol or substance misuse; greater access to potentially lethal methods, such as pesticides or firearms; cultural attitudes which promote independence and discourage help-seeking behaviour; poor access to services providing help at times of psychological crisis; and cultural discontinuity in traditional societies. Not all factors apply in all areas, hence, the literature on rural suicide prevention initiatives varies considerably. Strategies have involved: the restriction of access to lethal methods; improving attitudes to, and knowledge of, mental illness in high-risk populations; improving the accessibility of conventional mental health services; making the use of such supports more culturally acceptable; and the development of context-specific supports, such as programmes addressing specific cultural issues.

AB Background: Little is known about the burden or causes of injury in rural villages in India. Objective: To examine injury-related mortality and morbidity in villages in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India.
   Methods: A verbal-autopsy-based mortality surveillance study was used to collect mortality data on all ages from residents in 45 villages in 2003-2004. In early 2005, a morbidity survey in adults was carried out using stratified random sampling in 20 villages. Participants were asked about injuries sustained in the preceding 12 months. Both fatal and non-fatal injuries were coded using classification methods derived from ICD-10.
   Results: Response rates for the mortality surveillance and morbidity survey were 98% and 81%, respectively. Injury was the second leading cause of death for all ages, responsible for 13% (95% CI 11% to 15%) of all deaths. The leading causes of fatal injury were self-harm (36%), falls (20%), and road traffic crashes (13%). Non-fatal injury was reported by 6.7% of survey participants, with the leading causes of injury being falls (38%), road traffic crashes (25%), and mechanical forces (16.1%). Falls were more common in women, with most (72.3%) attributable to slipping and tripping. Road traffic injuries were sustained mainly by men and were primarily the result of motorcycle crashes (48.8%).
   Discussion: Injury is an important contributor to disease burden in rural India. The leading causes of injury-falls, road traffic crashes, and suicides-are all preventable. It is important that effective interventions are developed and implemented to minimize the impact of injury in this region.

AB The toxicological impact and intentional ingestion of pesticides are major public health concerns globally. This study aimed to estimate the extent of deliberate self-harm(DSH) and suicides (suicidal behaviour) and document pesticide practices in Namkhana block of the Sundarban region, India. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 1680 households (21 villages) following a mixed random and cluster design sampling. The survey questionnaire (Household Information on Pesticide Use and DSH) was developed by the research team to elicit qualitative and quantitative information. The Kappa statistic and McNemar's test were used to assess the level of agreement and association between respondents' and investigators' opinions about safe storage of pesticides. Over five years, 1680 households reported 181 incidents of suicidal behaviour. Conflict with family members was the most frequently reported reason for suicidal behaviour (53.6%). The Kappa statistic indicated poor agreement between respondents and investigators about safe storage of pesticides. The pesticide-related annual DSH rate was 158.1 (95% CI 126.2-195.5), and for suicide it was 73.4 (95% CI 52.2-100.3) per 100,000. Unsafe pesticide practice and psychosocial stressors are related to the high rates of suicidal behaviour. An intersectoral approach involving the local governments, agricultural department and the health sector would help to reduce the magnitude of this public health problem.

AB Community stigma studies may neglect clinically relevant experience and views of stigma that are important features of mental health problems. After attempting suicide, patients in a hospital emergency ward in Mumbai, India, were assessed for stigma referring to underlying prior problems motivating their deliberate self-harm (DSH) event, the DSH event itself and serious mental illness generally based on both anticipated community views and distinctive personal views. In this cultural epidemiological study of 196 patients, assessment items and four corresponding indexes were analysed and compared on a four-point scale, 0 to 3, for prominence of indicated stigma. Narratives from patients with high, low and discordant levels of stigma for prior problems and DSH events were analysed and compared. Disclosure, critical opinions of others and problems to marry were greater concerns for DSH events than prior problems. Problem drinking, unemployment, and sexual or financial victimization were common features of prior problems. Impulsivity of the DSH event and externalizing blame were features of lower levels of stigma. Ideas about most people's views of serious mental illness were regarded as more stigmatizing than patients' prior problems and DSH event; patients' personal views of serious mental illness were least stigmatizing. Findings suggest linking suicidality and stigmatized mental illness may discourage help seeking. Suicide prevention strategies should therefore emphasize available help needed for severe stress instead of equating suicidality and mental illness. Findings also indicate the relevance of assessing clinical stigma in a cultural formulation and the value of integrated qualitative and quantitative stigma research methods.

ID HOSPITALIZATION; PROFILE
AB Context: There is sparse Indian literature on consultation-liaison psychiatric (CLP) service utilization by suicide attempters who generally present first to the accident and emergency departments and are seen by the psychiatrist only after the initial stabilization. Aims: The aim of the study is to study the psychiatric referral, review, and psychopharmacological intervention rates among suicide attempters and to study factors associated with psychiatric referral. Settings and Design: Retrospective, medicolegal case register-based, explorative analysis of suicide attempters presents to a rural tertiary care hospital in south India. Subjects and Methods: Eight hundred and twenty-nine medicolegal case files of individuals whose diagnosis was recorded as either suicidal attempt, deliberate or intentional self-harm, and poisoning or hanging were analyzed for different variables. Statistical Analysis Used: Descriptive frequencies, Pearson's Chi-square and logistic regression analysis to know the association of psychiatric referral with different variables, were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 16. Results: A little more than half of the suspected suicide attempters (51.4%) were referred for psychiatric review, and majority of those referred (93.7%) were reviewed by the psychiatrist. Psychiatric referral was significantly associated with a relatively younger age, positive past and family history of suicidal behavior, mode of attempt (pesticide poisoning and attempted hanging were more likely to be referred), and a longer duration of hospitalization. Conclusions: The low referral rate but an overwhelming review rate among those referred shows that probably referrer factors are responsible for this and so CLP for suicide attempters needs to be strengthened by sensitizing the referring doctors on the importance of the psychiatric referral and the need to avoid discharge within the first 24 h.

DE Suicide risk; Self harm; Adolescents; Translation and validation
ID SELF-HARM; INDIA
AB Purpose: Youth suicide rates are rising worldwide, including Sri Lanka, where 46.5/100,000 among 15-19yrs was reported in 1986. Identifying high risk adolescents is vital. Dearth of trained professionals, demands an instrument utilizable by non-psychiatrists. Such was not available in Sinhalese. Adolescent Suicide Assessment Protocol (ASAP-20) and its' manual was translated and validated to Sri Lankan adolescents.
   Method: A validation study. Forward/back translations followed by cultural adaptation. Face validity, operational equivalence were assessed. Panel of Psychiatrists assessed semantics, conceptual, content/construct validity using external criticism. Final Sinhalese version was applied to 100 Sinhalese speaking 10-19yr olds referred to Psychiatry units of two Teaching Hospitals following a suicide attempt or with suicidal ideation (cases) excluding psychotic disorder, acute emergencies or special needs and compared with same aged adolescents on treatment for respiratory problems as controls. Discriminant ability was calculated using area under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC). Reliability was calculated using Cronbach's alpha.
   Results: Sinhalese version showed satisfactory face/contents/construct validity and operational equivalence. Median suicide risk score was 18 and mean 17.99 (SD=7.56) for cases, median=4 and mean=4.86 (SD=2.41) for controls. AUC was 0.969 (SE=0.11), indicating a high ability to discriminate moderate/high from low suicidal risk. Cut off value, 8.5 was lower than original tool at a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 91%. Cronbach's alpha was 0.811 indicating high reliability and consistency.
   Conclusion: Sinhalese version of ASAP-20 is a successful screening instrument to detect high suicide risk among adolescents in clinical and non clinical settings.

AB Objective: The aims of the present study were twofold: first, to determine the prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among women inpatients with post-partum-onset psychosis; and second, to describe the clinical, childbirth-related and demographic correlates of suicidal ideation in this group.
   Method: A total of 82 post-partum women consecutively admitted to the psychiatric unit of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, India during 18 months were assessed using the Comprehensive Psychopathology Rating Scale (CPRS) for psychopathology and suicidality.
   Results: Thirty-one women (38%) reported suicidal ideation, of whom 15 (18%) had attempted suicide in the current episode. Suicidal ideation and suicide attempts were more frequent in women with depression, an insidious onset of the current illness and those with higher scores on the depressive dimension. On logistic regression analysis, however, only higher scores on the depressive symptom dimension of CPRS, irrespective of diagnosis, emerged as significant (p<0.001). Suicidal ideation was also significantly associated with ideas of harm to the infant (p<0.05).
   Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in this group of patients. Depressive symptoms in post-partum psychosis appear to be the most important risk factor predicting suicidal ideation and attempts.

AB Cultivation of long season hybrid and GMO Bt-hybrid cottons is unique to India. The hybrid technology prevents seed saving, requires annual purchases of high cost seed that leads to sub optimal planting densities. These factors contribute to stagnant low yields and to increases in insecticide use that induce new pests that are increasingly resistant to insecticide and Bt toxins. Subsistence farmers growing rainfed Bt cotton in south and central India have been particularly affected by this hybrid technology.
   Pure line high-density short-season (HD-SS) rainfed cotton varieties are available or in development that would greatly increase yields, reduce yield variability, decrease costs of seed and insecticides and increase profits. The high costs of Bt hybrid seed make the technology incompatible with the HD-SS applications. The article questions why pure line HD-SS technology has not been implemented in India.

AB Critical to sustainable agriculture, agrobiodiversity conservation provides immediate benefits and retains options for climate change adaptation. Reframing conservation as sustainable seed innovation allows for a dynamic view of farmer contributions. Sustainable seed innovation entails in situ conservation and the innovation of new plant varieties through traditional practices. Farmer interviews from regions throughout India form the empirical basis, while the concept intellectual property-broad, integrated with evolutionary economics, informs theory. Sustainable seed innovation within India receives support primarily from nonprofit groups favoring open-source systems. Conserving natural and financial capital motivated farmers to adopt sustainable techniques, but farmers believed attracting additional innovators required development of new markets. India's Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act recognizes farmers as plant breeders but does not provide incentive to innovate sustainably. Moreover, agricultural policies reinforced by an underlying discourse where "progressive" farmers follow unsustainable practices incentivizes formal innovations, at the expense of sustainable innovations of farmers.

TI How many premature deaths from pesticide suicide have occurred since the
   agricultural Green Revolution?
SO CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
LA English
DT Review
DE Pesticide poisoning; suicide; mortality; Green Revolution
ID POISONING DEATHS; CHINA; RATES; INDIA; MORTALITY; TRAGEDY; TRENDS;
   IMPACT
AB Introduction: The agricultural Green Revolution in the 1950s and 60s is thought to have averted many deaths from famine. However, it also introduced highly hazardous pesticides such as parathion and endrin into poor rural communities that were totally unequipped to store or use them safely. Pesticide self-poisoning rapidly became one of the two most common global means of suicide. Thus far, no attempt has been made to enumerate the total number of deaths that have occurred subsequent to the Green Revolution. Objective: To calculate plausible estimates for the total global number of pesticide suicides that have occurred since 1960. Methods: We performed a literature review on Medline and Embase databases to July 2019 to find papers that reported national or global numbers of pesticide suicides. We restricted our search to papers published in English. We used the search terms: pesticide) OR insecticide) OR paraquat) OR organophosphate) OR organophosphorus) OR agrochemical) AND suicide) OR "") OR deliberate) AND poison in all fields. These searches identified 2,144 papers; a further 8 citations were added through the searching of reference lists and our own paper collections. 2,136 papers were excluded as they contained no data on pesticide suicide, or were case reports, case series, or related to specific socio-demographic groups, or were non-human studies. This left 16 papers giving country specific or global pesticide suicide data. Long-term national trend in pesticide suicides: We found studies from one low- and middle-income country (Sri Lanka) that recorded long-term trends in suicide throughout the Green Revolution. These data showed a steady increase in suicides from 1960 to the early 1970s, with a more rapid increase from 1979 to 1984. The number of suicides plateaued until 1995, when they started a steady almost linear decrease that has continued at least until 2015. We used the Sri Lankan epidemiology as a model of the incidence of pesticide suicides in other low- and middle-income countries. Data from Bangladesh suggested that the decrease might have started in 2002. Estimating global numbers since 1960: Starting from a conservative estimate of zero deaths in 1960, the best estimate of the total global burden of pesticide suicides from 1960 to 2018 is 14,272,105 or 14,936,000 (depending on whether a fall in incidence began in 1995 or 2002), with a plausible range of 9,859,667 to 17,303,333 deaths. These are likely underestimates because suicide is illegal in many countries, and most pesticide suicides occur in poor rural areas without effective death registration systems. Conclusions: Pesticide self-poisoning has been a major clinical and public health problem in rural Asia for decades, while being long ignored. Most pesticide suicides are relatively impulsive with little planning: in the absence of highly hazardous pesticides, many people would have survived their suicidal impulse, gone on to find support amongst family, community, and health services, and lived a full life. Pesticide suicides must therefore be considered a category 4 occupation condition following Schilling's classification - if they had not been brought into rural communities for agricultural use, pesticide suicides would not have occurred. Preventing these deaths should be a global public health priority.

AB Maharashtra is one of the states in India that has witnessed one of the highest rates of farmer suicides as proportion of total number of suicides. Most of the farmer suicides in Maharashtra are from semi-arid divisions such as Marathwada where cotton has been historically grown. Other dominant crops produced include cereals, pulses, oilseeds and sugarcane. Cotton (fibers), oilseeds and sugarcane providing highest value addition per unit cultivated area and cereals and pulses the least. Hence it is not surprising that smallholders take risks growing high value crops without "visualising" the risks it entails such as those corresponding to price and weather shocks.
   We deploy recently developed smallholder socio-hydrology modelling framework to understand the underlying dynamics of the crisis. It couples the dynamics of six main variables that are most relevant at the scale of a smallholder: water storage capacity (root zone storage and other ways of water storage), capital, livestock, soil fertility and fodder biomass. The hydroclimatic variability is accounted for at sub-annual scale and influences the socio-hydrology at annual scale.
   The model incorporates rule-based adaptation mechanisms (e.g., adjusting expenditures on food and fertilizers, selling livestocks) of smallholders when they face adverse conditions, such as high variability in rainfall or in agricultural prices. The model is applied to two adjoining divisions of Maharashtra: Marathwada and Desh. The former is the division with relatively higher farmer suicide rates than the latter. Diverse spatial data sets of precipitation, potential evaporation, soil, agricultural census based farm inputs, cropping pattern and prices are used to understand the dynamics of small farmers in these divisions, and to attribute farmer distress rates to soil types, hydroclimatic variability and crops grown.
   Comparative socio-hydrologic assessment across the two regions confirms existing narratives: low (soil) water storage capacities, no irrigation and poor access to alternative sources of incomes are to blame for the crisis, suggesting that smart indigenous solutions such as rain-water harvesting and better integration of smallholder systems to efficient agricultural supply chains are needed to tackle this development challenge.

AB The paper deals with various thematic parameters such as agriculture crop scenario (2000, 2010), water stress, precipitation trend and deficit, climate-induced risk towards crops, drought-prone area, suicide attributes of farmers, agro-ecological regions, prediction of future (2050) precipitation and temperature variation during kharif and rabi seasons of India and their spatial pattern were analyzed in GIS for better understanding of climate change. The analysis revealed about the need of synergic approach/strategies to address the impact of climate change. Few of the Climate-smart villages (CSVs) projects of India were discussed here based on their approach, achievement, and limitation. The CSV conceptual strategies are fully based on climate smart agriculture potentiality to achieve sustainability in food security, enhancing the livelihood, eradication of poverty and magnifying the farm household resilience. The climate-induced high and very high risk to the crops areas were found dominated in the arid and semi-arid regions which will be challenged in future due to water stress, inadequate irrigation facility, increasing trend of temperature and variation in precipitation pattern. The hotspot districts of farmer's suicide were very significant in climate-induced very high risk zone and majority of them falls in the drought-prone areas/extremely high to high water-stressed areas which leads to crop failure. There is a need to formulate a concrete policy, legal, and institutional actions addressing the farmers problem significantly at country, state, district and village levels which will support investment/technology/guideline in and adoption of Climate-smart village (CSV) practices after seeing the socio-economic background (poverty/tribes/backward class) of them.

AB Introduction: Studies have consistently reported that a considerable proportion of suicide attempts are impulsive and unplanned. However, data on the characteristics of these impulsive attempters is still limited. The relationship between impulsive behaviour and suicide attempts can be thought of having two dimensions: a suicide attempt can be impulsive or not and the suicide attempter can have impulsive traits or not. The impulsiveness of many attempts and the fluctuating nature of suicidal thinking are of concern, as many prevention strategies rely on the early identification of either suicidal thoughts and/or plans.
   Aim: The present study was attempted to measure the intensity of the suicide attempt, and to assess the relationship of the suicide intent score with the three second order factors (Attention impulsiveness, motor impulsiveness, non planning impulsiveness) of impulsivity in Barratt Impulsiveness Scale to identify the pattern (if any) of suicidal intent before an impulsive attempt.
   Materials and Methods: This was a hospital based cross sectional study. Socio-demographic and clinical profile sheet which included different variables was completed on 72 attempters. Beck's Suicide Intent Scale (SIS) was used to assess the severity of the intent in the patient and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) was used to measure the personality construct of impulsiveness. Data entry and analysis was done using SPSS 20 statistical software and descriptive statistics, chi-square test, t-test were used to find significance across groups. Statistical significance was assumed at p<0.05.
   Results: Among the 72 attempters 38 (52.8%) were male and 34 (47.2%) were females. Majority of the sample were illiterate 30 (42%) from a rural background 61 (84.7%) whose primary method of attempt was by ingestion of poison 51 (70.8%) due to family/inter personal problems 43 (59.7%). The sample was divided based on their scores of suicide intent scale and the three second order factor scores of BIS. high suicide intent score was present in majority of the patients 35 (48.6%), and 14 (19.5%) patients had low suicide intent score. The mean scores of impulsivity were highest among the low suicide intent group, and were gradually decreasing as the intent of the attempt was increasing (from low to high) in the sub scales of attention impulsiveness (15.6 +/- 1.94) and non-planning impulsiveness (31.5 +/- 2.65) which suggests that low intent attempts may be impulsive acts. When individual suicidal intent groups were compared, a significant difference found between motor impulsiveness and non-planning impulsiveness within medium intent (p=0.043) and between attention impulsiveness and non-planning impulsiveness within high intent (p=0.012).
   Conclusion: There is a significant association between impulsivity and intent, and it is an important factor of suicide behaviour in suicide attempters.

There are no established protocols for early management of near-hanging patients who present to the emergency department (ED). The use of early intubation. strict blood pressure control and targeted temperature management has shown promise in small studies.
   Objective: To detect changes in mortality and neurological deficits in near-hanging patients before and after implementation of a novel early management protocol in a tertiary care hospital in India.
   Methods: Prospective cohort study conducted at a tertiary-care hospital in Tamil Nadu, India from August 2014-July 2016. For first year of study (pre-implementation), near-hanging patients were treated without a structured protocol. For second year of study (post-implementation), near-hanging patients were treated per a protocol including early intubation, strict blood pressure control and targeted temperature management Primary outcomes included: (1) in-hospital mortality and (2) hospital discharge without neurological deficit.
   Results: 65 patients were included (27 in the pre-implementation phase and 38 in the post-implementation phase.) At presentation, there was no difference between the two groups in mean heart rate, mean arterial pressure, mean oxygen saturation, Glasgow coma score, or mean respiratory rate. Protocol implementation decreased mortality (10/27 (37%) versus 2/38 (5%), P< 0.05) and increased the number of patients discharged without neurological deficit (10/27 (37%) versus 35/38 (92%), P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: This novel early management protocol reduced mortality and increased the number discharged without neurological deficit in near-hanging patients in a single tertiary care center in India. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Patients' accounts complement psychiatric assessment of deliberate selfharm (DSH). In this study we examined psychiatric disorders, and sociocultural and cross-cultural features of DSH. SCID diagnostic interviews and a locally adapted EMIC interview were used to study 196 patients after DSH at a general hospital in Mumbai, India. Major depression was the most common diagnosis (38.8%), followed by substance use disorders (16.8%), but 44.4% of patients did not meet criteria for an enduring Axis-I disorder (no diagnosis, V-code, or adjustment disorder). Psychache arising from patient-identified sociocultural contexts,and stressors complements, but does not necessarily fulfill, criteria for explanatory psychiatric disorders.

AB Research from the United Kingdom has suggested differential risk factors for suicide among South Asians when compared with the general population. Studies in the United Kingdom have found higher risk related to gender, marital status, and religion. It has been unknown how such demographic variables, acculturative stress, and lower rates of help-seeking influence rates of suicide among South Asians in the United States. In this study, a community sample of South Asians in the United States (n = 524) were asked to complete a demographic questionnaire and validated measures for levels of acculturation, help-seeking, and beliefs about reasons for living via web-based survey. South Asians' scores on the Reasons for Living Inventory (RFL) were significantly higher than the normative population across all subscales except the Survival and Coping Beliefs subscales. Demographic variables significantly related to RFL scores included gender (men with higher RFL scores), age (younger individuals with lower RFL scores), country of origin (those from India with lower RFL scores), education level (lower RFL scores in those with higher education levels), and income (those with lower incomes having lower RFL scores). Help-seeking attitudes were also significantly related to RFL scores. As a whole, the findings are consistent with U.K.-based studies and provide valuable comparative data on a U.S.-based sample.

AB Background: Low-income urban working mothers face many challenges in their domestic, environmental, and working conditions that may affect their mental health. In India, a high prevalence of mental health disorders has been recorded in young women, but there has been little research to examine the factors that affect their mental health at home and work.
   Methods: Through a primarily qualitative approach, we studied the relationship between work, caring for family, spousal support, stress relief strategies and mental health amongst forty eight low-income working mothers residing in urban slums across Bangalore, India. Participants were construction workers, domestic workers, factory workers and fruit and vegetable street vendors. Qualitative data analysis themes included state of mental health, factors that affected mental health positively or negatively, manifestations and consequences of stress and depression, and stress mitigators.
   Results: Even in our small sample of women, we found evidence of extreme depression, including suicidal ideation and attempted suicide. Women who have an alcoholic and/or abusive husband, experience intimate partner violence, are raising children with special needs, and lack adequate support for child care appear to be more susceptible to severe and prolonged periods of depression and suicide attempts. Factors that pointed towards reduced anxiety and depression were social support from family, friends and colleagues and fulfilment from work.
   Conclusion: This qualitative study raises concerns that low-income working mothers in urban areas in India are at high risk for depression, and identifies common factors that create and mitigate stress in this population group. We discuss implications of the findings for supporting the mental health of urban working women in the Indian context. The development of the national mental health policy in India and its subsequent implementation should draw on existing research documenting factors associated with negative mental health amongst specific population groups in order to ensure greater impact.

AB Background
   About 10% Indians suffer from stress, depression or substance use disorders. Few receive care for these problems, especially in rural areas.
   Aims
   As part of a broader initiative to deliver technology-enabled mental health services for rural communities (adults >= 18 years), information was collected about the prevalence of depression, anxiety and suicide risk.
   Method
   The study was conducted in 12 villages in the West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh. Depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, respectively. Additionally, data were collected about sociodemographic factors and stressful events, among others.
   Results
   Anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation affected 10.8, 14.4 and 3.5% of participants, respectively (N = 22 377). These were more common among women, and among those who were aged 30-59 years, uneducated, or divorced/separated/widowed. Stress due to financial loss was significant.
   Conclusions
   The study identified a significant number of people at risk of depression, anxiety and suicide, and needing care.

AB India has high rates of mental health issues among its youth and low-income communities experience a disproportionate amount of depression and suicide. Positive psychology, the act of promoting well-being, could be used as a tool to promote wellness and help improve the mental health of youth living in slum areas of India. A pilot positively psychology program, "The Hero Lab", was conducted in a migratory slum in Worli, Mumbai, with trained Hindu community leaders implementing the interventions toward at-risk Hindu youth. The curriculum's impact showed statistical improvement (p < 0.001) in happiness (General Happiness Scale from 11.24 +/- 1.56 to 19.08 +/- 3.32), grit (Grit Survey from 2.23 +/- 0.34 to 3.24 +/- 0.67), empathy (Toronto Empathy Questionnaire from 24.92 +/- 3.27 to 41.96 +/- 8.41), and gratitude (Gratitude Survey from 16.88 +/- 3.47 to 27.98 +/- 6.59). While a pilot study, the Hero Lab curriculum demonstrates that positive psychology interventions may be an important tool in improving mental health in at-risk children.

AB There are an estimated 7 million burn injuries in India annually, of which 700,000 require hospital admission and 140,000 are fatal. According to the National Burns Programme, 91,000 of these deaths are women; a figure higher than that for maternal mortality. Women of child bearing age are on average three times more likely than men to die of burn injuries. This paper reviews the existing literature on burn injuries in India and raises pertinent issues about prevalence, causes and gaps in recognising the gendered factors leading to a high number of women dying due to burns. The work of various women's groups and health researchers with burns victims raises several questions about the categorisation of burn deaths as accident, suicide and homicide and the failure of the health system to recognise underlying violence. Despite compelling evidence, the health system has not recognised this as a priority. Considering the substantial cost of burns care, prevention is the key which requires health systems to recognise the linkages between burn injuries and domestic violence. Health systems need to integrate awareness programmes about domestic violence and train health professionals to identify signs and symptoms of violence. This would contribute to early identification of abuse so that survivors are able to access support services at an early stage. (C) 2016 Reproductive Health Matters. Published by Elsevier BV.

AB Despite its use to exemplify how the world is "flat," India is in many ways "spiky." Hyderabad is a prosperous hub of information-communication technology (ICT) while its impoverished agricultural hinterland is best known for dysfunctional agriculture and farmer suicide. Based on the belief that a lack of knowledge and skill lay at the root of agrarian distress, the "e-Sagu" project aimed to leverage the city's scientific expertise and ICT capability to aid cotton farmers. The project fit with a national surge of "last mile" projects bringing ICT to the village, but it was unique in using ICT to connect farmers directly with agricultural scientists acting as advisors. Such projects fit the interests of many actors, which has led to an unrealistic national enthusiasm about their impacts. This article uses the first five years of the project as a lens to view the cultural nature of both indigenous agricultural knowledge and "scientific" agricultural advising. Unlike lay publics whose uptake of science is better known, with farmers the invention and adoption of agro-scientific knowledge is deeply embedded in daily productive activities and sociocultural interactions. E-Sagu eventually had to abandon its construction of agricultural science as objective and acultural, resorting to rural methods of persuasion. It also found that it could only survive by joining forces with companies promoting commodification of agricultural inputs, which was a cause of the agrarian distress it sought to alleviate.

ID MENTAL-HEALTH; QUEENSLAND; MORTALITY; ENGLAND; WALES; INDIA
AB Numerous studies have found agricultural workers, including farmers, at elevated risk of suicide, and socioeconomic conditions have been suggested as one of the important determinants of this mortality cause. The real agricultural income per worker in Europe increased steadily from 2005 to 2007 and then fell by 1.8% in 2008 and by 11.6% in 2009. This drop was particularly pronounced in France. Repeated cross-sectional studies were conducted to investigate suicide mortality rates among French farmers in 2007-2009. The study population included all French farmers enrolled yearly in the compulsory Agricultural Social Security and Health Insurance (CCMSA). Most of the mean of 500,164 subjects per year were men (68%). National cause-specific mortality rates were used to calculate standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for both genders and for each of the 3 years. During the 3-year study period, 2,769 men and 997 women died. Suicide accounted for 417 of the men's (15%) and 68 of the women's (6.8%) deaths. Hanging was the most frequent method of suicide for both. Compared with the general population, the increased rate of suicide deaths among male farmers was 28% in 2008 and 22% in 2009. This increased rate was particularly high among those aged 45-54 years (31%) and 55-64 years (47%) in 2008 (and in the 55-64-year-old group in 2009 (64%). Two specific types of farming activity were associated with increased suicide mortality rates in both 2008 and 2009: dairy cattle farming (SMR = 1.56 [95% CI: 1.09-2.15] and SMR=1.47 [95% CI: 1.01-2.04]) and beef cattle farming (SMR = 2.27 [95% CI: 1.59-3.10] and SMR = 1.57 [95% CI: 1.01-2.27]). These results may be useful for a better understanding of the situation from an epidemiological standpoint and for improving suicide prevention policies in this particular population.

AB Objectives Homeless and unclaimed dead bodies are a social as well as legal stigma on a country's development index. In addition, homeless people are exposed to increased incidence of diseases, accidents and mortality. Lucknow city, a city situated in the heart of the great Gangetic plain in the northern region of India, is surrounded by rural towns and villages and has seen tremendous growth in the past few years; with this the problem of migrants and homelessness has also increased. This has resulted in a spectrum of problems relating to law and order, including frequent incidences of unclaimed dead bodies, both due to natural and unnatural causes. Few studies on this subject have been published in India.
   Study design Observational retrospective study.
   Methods Data was collected from the files of the Department of Forensic Medicine & Toxicology between 2008 and 2012.
   Results A total of 20877 autopsy cases were registered, out of which 3169 (15.17%) were unclaimed bodies. The majority of cases belonged to males (2218, 69.99%) as compared to females (951, 30.01%). Most unclaimed bodies were in the age group of 41-60 years (47.24%) and the least affected age group was 1-20 years (265, 8.36%). The most common manner of death was accident (1098, 34.64%), followed by suicide (1062, 33.51%), natural (927, 29.25%) and homicides (82, 2.59%). The most common cause of natural death in both males and females was chronic lung disease. Railway and road traffic accidents accounted for 516 (68.25%) accidental deaths in males, whereas in females they accounted for 301(88.01%). The most common mode of suicide among males was by poisoning (391, 48.81%), while poisoning (149, 57.08), hanging (78, 29.88%) and drowning (23, 8.81%) were the main modes of suicide in females reported in our study. Majority of the cases of deaths were reported during rainy season (2209, 69.70%).
   Conclusions This autopsy-based study tries to highlight the picture of homeless deaths in Lucknow and the problems faced by the law enforcing authorities. More research is needed to identify the health-related problems of such people and possible contributory factors to mortality.

AB The Primary source of agriculture in India is rainfall. Even though India has its own surplus fertile land, agriculture struggles a lot due to lack of efficient predictable rainfall technique which in turn leads to uncountable farmer's suicide activities. Nowadays, it becomes a back-breaking problem giving way to scarcity of food storage. Even Chennai faces a massive hit in 2015 december and 2016 december and flattens many residential areas and people started moving from their natives and starve for food with their small kids and old age people. So In this paper, cognitive computing prediction model methodologies, their outcomes and limitations are studied for the development of new hybrid cognitive model that supports the accuracy of prediction rate.

AB Background: Suicide is a major problem in schizophrenia, estimated to affect 9%-13% of patients. About 25% of schizophrenic patients make at least one suicide attempt in their lifetime. Current outcome measures do not address this problem, even though it affects quality of life and patient safety. The aim of this study was to assess suicidality in long-term clinically improved schizophrenia patients who were treated in a nongovernmental psychiatric treatment centre in Mumbai, India.
   Method: Participants were 61 patients out of 200 consecutive hospitalized first-episode patients with schizophrenia diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders who were much improved on the Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement (CGI-I) scale at the endpoint of a 10-year follow-up. Clinical assessment tools included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia, CGI-I, Global Assessment of Functioning, and suicidality.
   Results: Many of the patients, although clinically improved, experienced emerging suicidality during the 10-year follow-up period. All of the patients reported significant suicidality (ie, suicide attempts, suicidal crises, or suicidal ideation) at the end of the study, whereas only 83% had reported previous significant suicidality at baseline. No sociodemographic and clinical variables at baseline were predictive of suicidal status at the end of the 10-year follow-up.
   Conclusion: Schizophrenia is a complex neurobehavioral disorder that appears to be closely associated with suicidal behavior. Adequate assessment and management of suicidality needs to be a continual process, even in patients who respond well to treatment.

AB An autopsy based retrospective study was conducted from January 2000 to December 2006 at Manipal in Southern India, and a profile of the victims of poisoning was prepared. The study was done to understand the magnitude and pattern of all poisoning fatalities in relation to the manner of death in Manipal region of Southern India. The study included a total of 198 cases of fatal poisoning. Self-poisoning was reported in 92.9% cases. Fatal accidental poisoning was seen in 6.1% cases. Homicide by poisoning was not reported during the study period. Uncertainty regarding the manner of death due to poisoning was observed only in two cases. Males were predominantly affected (71.2%). The majority of the victims were in the 3rd decade (28.3%) of life. The age of the victims ranged from 2 to 82 years with a mean age of 38.4 years. While majority of the victims consumed poison during daytime, most of the poisoning fatalities were reported during summer months. Organophosphate compounds were implicated in 68.7% of the total poisoning related fatalities. Males in the 3rd to 5th decades were prone to self-poisoning with organophosphate compounds. Accidental poisoning deaths were uncommon and poisoning was not a preferred method of homicide in this region. Our approach to the study reveals that quantitative chemical (toxicological) analysis is required to further strengthen and improve the databases of epidemiology of poisoning in our region.

DE Nonorganophosphate; poisoning; suicide
AB Background: People who deliberately ingest poisons commonly present to emergency departments of hospitals in India. However, there is a dearth of information on poisoning using nonorganophosphorus pesticides. Methods: This prospective, hospital-based study attempted to examine the nonorganophosphorus poisons used to attempt suicide. Data on sociodemographic characteristics of patients, site and source of poisons, co-ingested substances, premeditation, and reason for poisoning were collected. A multinomial logistic regression was performed to determine association between poison class and these exposure characteristics. Results: Three hundred and forty-one cases of attempted suicide presented during the 6-month period (1.7% of all emergency room admissions). The majority was predominantly male and was young adults. Poisoning was the most common mode (91.7%), followed by hanging (7.3%) and self-injury (3, 0.9%). Pesticides (44.3%) including organophosphates (25.5%) were the predominant poisons, followed by pharmaceuticals (27.9%), caustics/chemicals (12.0%), and plant poisons (7.0%). One hundred and nine were available for prospective interview as the others who presented were not detained for prolonged observation the emergency department. Most patients who ingested such poisons were women, from rural backgrounds and were educated. The majority sourced the poisons from home, consumed poison at home, and mixed the poison with water; these attempts were impulsive and seemed to be in response to relationship conflicts. In the multivariate analysis, education (P = 0.08) and poison source (outside the home) were significant predictors of pesticide ingestion. Conclusions: Suicidal poisoning results from a complex synthesis of socioeconomic and psychological factors; certain patterns of poisoning are likely to be more prevalent in demographic niche groups.

It shows how and why this form of self-killing is a highly regarded and publicly celebrated positive aspiration in Jainism. Through comparisons with some other forms of self-killing found in South Asia, it highlights the moral complexities of issues around volition and agency. And it illustrates how the practice embodies positions on some universal ethical issues.

However, a few cases have been reported in literature in which death has occurred after a certain period of time or the patient has survived after prolonged resuscitative measures. A case of a 20-year-old female is described who survived for nine days after hanging, remaining unconscious throughout in the hospital. She died due to cerebral damage caused by cerebral anoxia.

AB This study uses secondary data from 2006 to assess the physical and mental health of rural, home-based sex workers and their young children in rural Andhra Pradesh state of India. The analyses of survey and clinical data show a high level of morbidity amongst sex worker women and their children. Women show high levels of nutritional deficiencies, anaemia, weight loss and hospitalisation. Women's mental health is particularly serious, with 92 per cent being depressed and 57 per cent having attempted suicide. The majority have experienced domestic and work-related violence, including rape. Clinical assessments of sex workers' children show that most have received vaccinations, but almost half have parasites, dental problems and nutritional deficiencies. Both the physical and mental health of sex worker mothers are associated with the health of their children. Therefore, health interventions focusing on sex worker mothers have the potential to improve the health of their children.

AB Objectives: There is scarce data on the prevalence of OCD among adolescents in India. This study reports point prevalence of OCD among school students (age 12-18 years) in the Kerala state of India and examines its association with ADHD, psychological distress, tobacco/alcohol abuse, suicide risk and history of sexual abuse.
   Method: 7560 students of 73 schools were self-administered the OCD subsection of Clinical Interview Schedule Revised, the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) for obsessive compulsive symptoms and other relevant instruments to identify OCD and related clinical measures. A diagnosis of ICD-10 OCD was derived through the CIS-R algorithm which required duration of at least 2 weeks and at least a thought/behavior to be resisted along with a cut-off score for severity and impairment.
   Results: In the sample, 50.3% were males with a mean age of 15.2 years (range of 12-18 years). The response rate was 97.3% (7380 valid responses). 0.8% (n = 61) fulfilled criteria for OCD with a male predominance (1.1 vs. 0.5%, p = 0.005). Prevalence was higher among Muslims and increased with age. Taboo thoughts (62.3%) and mental rituals (45.9%) were the commonest symptoms. Those with OCD had significantly higher suicidal thoughts (59 vs. 16.3%, p < 0.01) suicide attempts (24.6 vs. 3.8%, p < 0.01), ADHD (28 vs. 4%, p < 0.001), sexual abuse (24.6 vs. 4.2%, p < 0.01), and tobacco use (23 vs. 6.8%, p = 0.01). They also reported greater psychological distress and poorer academic performance.
   Conclusions: OCD is common among adolescents in India. Its associations with ADHD, sexual abuse, psychological distress, poorer academic performance and suicidal behavior are additional reasons for it to be recognized and treated early. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: There are limited data on suicidal behavior in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This study examines suicidal behavior and its clinical correlates in OCD subjects.
   Method: One hundred consecutive DSM-IV OCD subjects attending the specialty OCD clinic and the inpatient services of a major psychiatric hospital in India from November 1, 2003, to October 31, 2004, formed the sample of this study. Subjects were assessed systematically by using structured interviews and various rating scales. The Scale for Suicide Ideation-worst ever (lifetime) and -current measured suicidal ideation. The 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) measured severity of depression, and the Beek Hopelessness Scale (BHS) measured hopelessness. We performed assessments at study entry. We employed binary logistic regression (Wald) forward stepwise analysis for prediction of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, and we used structural equation modeling for identifying the potential factors contributing to suicidal ideation.
   Results: The rates of suicidal ideation, worst ever and current, were 59% and 28%, respectively. History of suicide attempt was reported in 27% of the subjects. For past suicide attempt, worst ever suicidal ideation (p < .001) was the only significant predictor, with an overall prediction of 89%, and accounted for 60% of the variance. For worst ever suicidal ideation, major depression (p = .043), HAM-D score (p = .013), BHS score (p = .011), and history of attempt (p = .009) were significant predictors, with an overall prediction of 82% and variance of 56%. Somewhat similar predictors emerged as significant for current suicidal ideators, with an overall prediction of 85% and variance of 50%. In the structural equation model, too, presence of depression and high BHS score contributed to suicidal ideation.
   Conclusions: OCD is associated with a high risk for suicidal behavior. Depression and hopelessness are the major correlates of suicidal behavior. It is vital that patients with OCD undergo detailed assessment for suicide risk and associated depression. Aggressive treatment of depression may be warranted to modify the risk for suicide. Future studies should examine suicidal behavior in a prospective design in larger samples to examine if severity of OCD and treatment nonresponse contribute to suicide risk.

TI Empowerment of women and mental health promotion: a qualitative study in
   rural Maharashtra, India

AB Background: The global burden of mental illness is high and opportunities for promoting mental health are neglected in most parts of the world. Many people affected by mental illness live in developing countries, where treatment and care options are limited. In this context, primary health care (PHC) programs can indirectly promote mental health by addressing its determinants i. e. by enhancing social unity, minimising discrimination and generating income opportunities. The objectives of this study were to: 1. Describe concepts of mental health and beliefs about determinants of mental health and illness among women involved with a PHC project in rural Maharashtra, India; 2. Identify perceived mental health problems in this community, specifically depression, suicide and violence, their perceived causes, and existing and potential community strategies to respond to them and; 3. Investigate the impact of the PHC program on individual and community factors associated with mental health.
   Method: We undertook qualitative in-depth interviews with 32 women associated with the PHC project regarding: their concepts of mental health and its determinants; suicide, depression and violence; and the perceived impact of the PHC project on the determinants of mental health. The interviews were taped, transcribed, translated and thematically analysed.
   Results: Mental health and illness were understood by these women to be the product of cultural and socio-economic factors. Mental health was commonly conceptualised as an absence of stress and the commonest stressors were conflict with husbands and mother-in-laws, domestic violence and poverty. Links between empowerment of women through income generation and education, reduction of discrimination based on caste and sex, and promotion of individual and community mental health were recognised. However, mental health problems such as suicide and violence were well-described by participants.
   Conclusion: While it is essential that affordable, accessible, appropriate treatments and systems of referral and care are available for people with mental illness in developing country settings, the promotion of mental health by addressing its determinants is another potential strategy for reducing the burden of mental illness for individuals and communities in these settings.

DE Great agrarian crisis; Traditional agricultural knowledge;
   Sustainability; Farmers' attitude; Agricultural technology
AB The world is really feeling the heat, not only in the form of climate change, but because of fuming farmers' unrest. Farmers' suicides have become a common way of expressing their anger and anxiety as no one is there to take heed to their problems. This research paper tries to examine the in-depth analysis of the great agrarian crisis in India and how it was completely mistaken in understanding the real cause. With the comparative studies of the two villages of India, with a completely different technological, economical and cultural background, a deep observation was made possible in finding out that, it is the growing alienation of farmers with new agricultural technologies and the collapsing local natural resource base, which will further uproot the farmers and aggravate the great Indian agrarian crisis. Traditional agricultural knowledge and practices immensely contribute in preserving the identity of farm community and gives them a feeling of pride, which is vital for the reviving and resurrection of farmers' dignity in India. Agriculture preserves the Indianness of India, and uprooting of farmers is analogous to uprooting our own identity.

AB This chapter examines existing research literature on sleep difficulties, primarily insomnia and the various dimensions of suicidality among adolescents and young adults as compared to adults. Studies have been grouped into epidemiological studies, clinical studies and reviews. Findings on gender have been given special importance. The literature overview has been complemented by case vignettes from a major corporate hospital in New Delhi (India). The chapter concludes by stating that a relationship appears to exist between insomnia and suicidality, especially with completed suicide, regardless of age. However, far too little is known about the relationship for clinicians to be able to use it as research evidence, as almost all the findings on suicidal behaviour came from cross-sectional studies, whether epidemiological or clinical. Therefore, the conclusion calls for research studies with a prospective design.

AB Every year a substantial proportion of deaths in India occur due to burn injuries. Prolonged morbidity as well as temporary and permanent disability due to burns results in a heavy economic loss. The etiological factors of burn injuries vary considerably in different communities and regions and hence the need for detailed epidemiological studies to understand the problem status in different regions. This study was aimed to study the sociodemographic profile of burn patients and to evaluate the causes, manner, and place of occurrence of burns injuries along with its outcome. A registry-based retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in coastal South India, and the medical records of all the patients admitted to the burns centre during the year 2009 were reviewed. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 11.5. A total of 101 burn patients were admitted during the study period. The burn patients were aged between 4 months and 80 years with a mean age of 32.11 (+/- 3.46) years. The overall male to female ratio was 0.83:1. Majority of the patients were Hindus and were married. Flame burns were the most common etiology for sustaining burns (82.2%). Most of the burn injuries were sustained at home (n = 81, 80.2%), and the manner was designated as accidental in 79.2% of the cases. The TBSA involvement in burns ranged from 5 to 100% and the mean TBSA was found to be 45.8 +/- 24.7%. A higher TBSA involvement is associated with an increased risk of mortality and this association between TBSA and mortality was found to be statistically significant (P < .05). Mortality rate in our study was 40.9%. Septicemia (n = 24, 63.2%) was the most common cause of death followed by shock (n = 12, 31.6%). Higher mortality is found to be associated with female sex, suicides, and flame burns. This study identifies the epidemiological and clinical features associated with burn injuries in coastal South India. Majority of the burn victims in our study were married females of younger age group. Although the manner of sustaining burns was mostly accidental, females were proportionately more commonly the victims of suicides and homicides than males. Injuries and deaths due to burns are preventable, provided a community-specific preventive program is implemented with a strong educational component. (J Burn Care Res 2012;33:660-667)

DE Adolescent; Anxiety Disorder; Suicide; India
ID RISK-FACTORS; YOUNG ADULTHOOD; COMORBIDITY; ASSOCIATION; DEPRESSION
AB Objective The risk of suicidal behavior associated with Anxiety Disorders (AD) among adolescents is known. However, concurrent mood disorders complicate these findings, and no data is available from India as well as from the community. This study aimed to address the suicidal risk associated with AD from different perspectives.
   Methods The authors prospectively collected data for 500 adolescents in a community with independent, trained raters. Risk for suicidal behavior was measured with SADPERSONS scale, socio-economic status with Modified Kuppuswamy Scale, depression and anxiety disorders with Beck Depression Inventory and Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders respectively. The relationship between predictors and need for preventive action was analyzed with univariate and multivariate regression analyses and a predictive model was built.
   Results Suicidal behavior was increased by the presence of AD (adjusted OR=6.28), the number of co-morbid AD (adjusted OR=2.04), severity of the AD (adjusted OR=4.98). Being a boy increased the risk of suicidal behavior associated with AD (adjusted OR=9.37), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (adjusted OR=5.65), Separation Anxiety Disorder (unadjusted OR=3.28), Social Anxiety Disorder (unadjusted OR=5.91) while controlling for the confounding effect of Depressive Disorder. Gender did not have an influence on Panic Disorder. Presence of AD and co-morbid Depressive Disorder significantly contributed to a risk model for suicidal behavior.
   Conclusions Anxiety Disorder is associated with the risk for potential suicidal behavior. Adolescent boys with AD and Depressive Disorder need to be identified as the high risk group for suicide prevention in the community.

SO LANCET
LA English
DT Article
ID BURN MORTALITY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; SUICIDE; AUTOPSY; RATES
AB Background Hospital-based studies have suggested that fire-related deaths might be a neglected public-health issue in India. However, no national estimates of these deaths exist and the only numbers reported in published literature come from the Indian police. We combined multiple health datasets to assess the extent of the problem.
   Methods We computed age-sex-specific fire-related mortality fractions nationally using a death registration system based on medically certified causes of death in urban areas and a verbal autopsy based sample survey for rural populations. We combined these data with all-cause mortality estimates based on the sample registration system and the population census. We adjusted for ill-defined injury categories that might contain misclassified fire-related deaths, and estimated the proportion of suicides due to self-immolation when deaths were reported by external causes.
   Findings We estimated over 163 000 fire-related deaths in 2001 in India, which is about 2% of all deaths. This number was six times that reported by police. About 106 000 of these deaths occurred in women, mostly between 15 and 34 years of age. This age-sex pattern was consistent across multiple local studies, and the average ratio of fire-related deaths of young women to young men was 3:1.
   Interpretation The high frequency of fire-related deaths in young women suggests that these deaths share common causes, including kitchen accidents, self-immolation, and different forms of domestic violence. Identification of populations at risk and description of structural determinants from existing data sources are urgently needed so that interventions can be rapidly implemented.

AB This paper analyzes how peasant movements scale up agroecology. It specifically examines Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF), a grassroots peasant agroecology movement in Karnataka, India. ZBNF ends reliance on purchased inputs and loans for farming, positioning itself as a solution to extreme indebtedness and suicides among Indian farmers. The ZBNF movement has achieved massive scale not only because of effective farming practices, but because of a social movement dynamic - motivating members through discourse, mobilizing resources from allies, self-organized pedagogical activities, charismatic and local leadership, and generating a spirit of volunteerism among its members. This paper was produced as part of a self-study process in La Via Campesina, the global peasant movement.

AB To examine the clinical epidemiology, including case fatality and determinants of self-harm in six island blocks of the Sundarban region of West Bengal, India.
   We examined the clinical records of 1277 patients admitted for deliberate self-harm (DSH) to the six island hospitals from 1999 to 2001.
   77.7% of the patients survived their attempt, 11.9% died and for 10.4% the outcome was not recorded. Women accounted for 65.2% of the DSH admissions and 67.1% of the deaths. Pesticides were the most commonly used means (88.7%). The case fatality of self-harm reported in these hospitals ranged from 6.0% to 50.0% (mean 13.3%; CI, 11.3-15.3). The age group 55-64 years was at highest risk of death, the age group 15-24 years at lowest risk. Higher lethality of pesticide ingestion compared to other methods was suggestive but not significant. Case fatality within the region varied but was high compared to industrialized nations. Case records and management of DSH were poor.
   Effective DSH prevention in the Sundarban region would require better surveillance at clinical facilities and an intersectoral approach, linking the agricultural interests of pesticide safety and mental health interests for preventing DSH.

AB Farmers are called as back bones of India because when backbone is damaged we are unable to stand. Farmers are compared as backbones because Indian economy only based on fanners without fanners Indian Economy will be in critical stage. Indians will proudly say India is famous for agriculture but at the same time farmers are facing many challenges during growing of crops in their land. It's an apt metaphor indeed. Farmers basically depend on the rain. Sometimes rainfall will occur according to the season but sometimes no rainfall or very less rainfall and sometimes floods may occur. Due to floods and all the crops may be damaged there will he a great loss for farmers. The farmers who borrowed the amount from others or taken loan from hank due to damage of crops or loss of crops many times committed for suicides.
   The main objective of this application is develop a site especially for farmers to provide interaction with the government. The application is designed with asp.net Here in this website before starting the crop the farmers should enter the details of land, the crops to be grown and expected cost for that crop. If any damage occurs then farmer should upload the corresponding videos or images in the site so that he will get the loss amount immediately from government.

AB Climate variability has been shown to have adverse effects on morbidity and mortality. Less is known about its effects on psychological well-being, especially in developing countries with agriculture-based economies. In this paper, we test whether extreme temperature and precipitation in India have an effect on self-reported depression symptoms, cognitive and sleep difficulties, and ability to cope with and control life. We use time and geographic variation in weather and show that hot weather in the previous year worsens psychological well-being among rural, but not urban, Indian adults. We examine potential mechanisms and show that the effect is largely driven by hot temperatures during the agricultural season and could be partly attributed to a reduction in agricultural production. We further provide suggestive evidence that the effects of weather shocks could be mitigated with poverty reduction programs such as India's National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. Poor mental health has been associated with low productivity and high healthcare expenditures and is a serious concern in India and many developing countries. The adverse impacts of climate change on rural, agriculture-based economies such as India are likely to increase over time. Given that nearly half of the global population lives in rural areas and is vulnerable to climate variability, understanding the effects of climate on psychological well-being and identifying potential resolutions is critical for insuring vulnerable populations and breaking the poverty cycle.

   Photography; Food Industry; Photojournalism; Visual Stereotyping
AB Lacunae in media images and reports of death and agrarian based suffering, experienced by India's debt prone farmers, have only begun to be addressed in the Indian news media. While the agrarian crisis is spectacularized through 24 hour news cycle images, analysis of underlying causes is less common in print and digital media. Kheti Badi, a photo-series produced from screenshots of FarmVille (an Adobe Flash gaming application on Facebook), interrogates this media impasse. It critiques homogenized images of food and farming, which rise to the top of web search results, and photojournalistic images showing the dignified suffering of Indian agricultural workers. Kheti Badi's computer made images are an alternative to visual stereotyping of rural India in photojournalism. Its technological inventiveness neither spectacularizes farmer protests or suicides nor aestheticizes pastoral qualities associated with the land. To make visible the changing nature of food production and need to reform farming in India, and its media coverage, Kheti Badi supplants the Indian pastoral with a new pictorial.

AB Promoting disclosure about one?s suicidal thoughts is promising for risk management and recovery; however, almost nothing is known about it in India. In a sample of 25 adults with serious mental illness (Level 2) who nominated 333 social network members (Level 1), we adopted a multilevel perspective to assess patterns and correlates of disclosure. Most people had disclosed (72%; n?=?18) or were intent on doing so (92%; n?=?23). However, only 17% (n?=?58) of network members were identified as prior confidants and 20% (n?=?64) as intended confidants. Multilevel modeling results showed that relational factors and not individual factors were linked to disclosure intent. Network members who were prior confidants, emotionally close, and sources of social support were appealing as future confidants. This highlights the potential utility of network-based safety planning wherein these discerning attributes are used to efficiently recruit would-be confidants for training.

ID ASSISTED SUICIDE; LIFE CARE; END; PERSPECTIVE
AB Euthanasia and assisted dying are illegal in India according to Sections 306 and 309 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and Article 21 of the Constitution of India. There have been a number of cases where the Indian High Courts and Indian Supreme Court issued differing verdicts concerning the right to life and the right to die. Nevertheless, on 7 March 2011, a paradigm shift happened as a result of the Indian Supreme Court's judgment on involuntary passive euthanasia in the case of Aruna Shanbaug. In its judgment, the Supreme Court requested the government to prepare a law on euthanasia. Accordingly, the 241st Report of the Law Commission of India proposed a bill to permit passive euthanasia. In May 2016 the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) issued the draft bill for public comment in order to create an informed decision. The Indian people are divided on the issue of euthanasia. The majority of the scientific community welcome it, while some religious groups oppose it. Hindus, in general, express both supporting and opposing views on euthanasia, whereas, Christians and Muslims have hardened their opposition against it. The Supreme Court judgment and the Report of the Law Commission pave the way for the development of new policies pertaining to passive euthanasia by the central government of India. Once such legislation is passed, passive euthanasia may, and probably will, have an enormous impact on the cultural, political, public and medical spheres of India in the near future.

AB In India men who have sex with men (MSM) are a stigmatized and hidden population, vulnerable to a variety of psychosocial and societal stressors. This population is also much more likely to be HIV-infected compared to the general population. However, little research exists about how psychosocial and societal stressors result in mental health problems. A confidential, quantitative mentalhealth interview was conducted among 150 MSM in Mumbai, India at The Humsafar Trust, the largest non-governmental organization serving MSM in India. The interview collected information on sociodemographics and assessed self-esteem, social support and DSM-IV psychiatric disorders using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Participants' mean age was 25.1 years (SD 5.1); 21% were married to women. Forty-five percent reported current suicidal ideation, with 66% low risk, 19% moderate risk, and 15% high risk for suicide per MINI guidelines. Twenty-nine percent screened in for current major depression and 24% for any anxiety disorder. None of the respondents reported current treatment for any psychiatric disorder. In multivariable models controlling for age, education, income, and sexual identity, participants reporting higher levels of self-esteem and greater levels of satisfaction with the social support they receive from family and friends were at lower risk of suicidality (selfesteem AOR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.78-0.93; social support AOR 0.76, 95% CI: 0.62-0.93) and major depression (self-esteem AOR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.71-0.89; social support AOR 0.68, 95% CI: 0.54-0.85). Those who reported greater social support satisfaction were also at lower risk of a clinical diagnosis of an anxiety disorder (AOR = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.65-0.99). MSM in Mumbai have high rates of suicidal ideation, depression, and anxiety. Programs to improve selfesteem and perceived social support may improve these mental health outcomes. Because they are also a high-risk group for HIV, MSM HIV prevention and treatment services may benefit from incorporating mental health services and referrals into their programs.

AB Agriculture plays a major role in the nation's economic contribution. The source of income and livelihood of around 70% of Indian population depends on agriculture. Harvest and post-harvest losses due to many reasons lead to heavy financial burden to farmers as well as Government. Though many agriculture security measures, like crop insurance, are provided to farmers by Government, still the farmers' suicide is a common phenomenon. To minimize the crop loss during harvest or post-harvest, this paper proposes the smart agriculture system with the help of Internet of Things (IoT). With the use of several sensors and Raspberry Pi, different models are proposed for supervision of soil moisture and pests, building intelligent seeds' corporation and efficient food corporation of India.

AB Cleistanthus collinus, also known as Oduvanthalai in Tamil, is the most commonly encountered plant poison in southern India. The leaves are used for poisoning humans (suicide or homicide) and animals (cattle and fish) and as an abortifacient, especially in rural south India. Although this poisoning is commonly reported in adults, data regarding the use of N-acetylcysteine in pediatric poisoning is lacking. We report two previously healthy male siblings of pediatric age group who ingested the liquid extracted from crushed leaves of this plant given to them by their mother as a means of deliberate harm. Both patients developed distal renal tubular acidosis, with hypokalemia. The younger sibling also developed myocardial toxicity. Other significant findings noted include hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia and elevated liver enzymes. Both patients received supportive care along with N-acetylcysteine infusion, and showed complete recovery within 10 days.

AB Background: Spousal violence has wide-ranging effects on the physical, reproductive, sexual and psychological health of women. There are few longitudinal studies that describe this association in developing countries. Aim: To test the hypothesis that spousal violence is an independent risk factor for a broad range of adverse health outcomes in women. Setting and Design: A population-based cohort study of women living in the catchment area of a primary health center in north Goa. Two thousand four hundred and ninety-four of 3000 randomly selected women were recruited of whom 1750 married women were included for this paper. Materials and Methods: Each participant was assessed at baseline with a structured interview for the assessment of exposure to spousal violence (verbal, physical, sexual) over two time periods (lifetime; recent in the past three months). The interview collected data on gynecological complaints and the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule was used for the diagnosis of depressive disorder. Laboratory tests for anemia and sexually transmitted infections (STI) were carried out. Longitudinal data was collected after six and 12 months on these outcomes. In addition, baseline measures for nutritional status and menstrual health were also obtained. Statistical Analysis: Univariate analyses were carried out on the cross-sectional and longitudinal data to assess the association between each type of spousal violence and each health outcome. Multivariate analyses adjusted for age, literacy, household per capita income. Logistic regression was used for all analyses in Stata (Version 10). Results: Lifetime spousal violence was reported by 290 (16.6, 95CI=14.9-18.4) women; recent violence was reported by 230 (13.0, 95CI=11.6-14.8). The cross-sectional data showed an association between violence and a range of self-reported gynecological complaints, low Body Mass Index, depressive disorder and attempted suicide. The longitudinal analyses confirmed these associations only for STI and attempted suicide. Conclusion: Spousal violence is specifically associated as an independent risk factor for two adverse womens health outcomes, viz., STI and attempted suicide. Public health and clinical programs targeting these outcomes must specifically address spousal violence.

ID SUICIDE
AB This is a case report of suicidal ingestion of chlorfenapyr, presenting with neurological complications after a latent period of more than a week, and rapidly progressing to death within days of symptoms. Chlorfenapyr is a moderately hazardous pesticide according to World Health Organization toxicity classification, and kills target organism by depriving it of energy through interference with oxidative phosphorylation at mitochondrial level. A pro-pesticide, chlorfenapyr takes time to convert to its active form and either this active form or a toxic metabolite causes delayed neurological symptoms. It causes significant neurotoxicity in rat models. This case report provides for the first time from India (second worldwide), clinical and "radiological evidence" (magnetic resonance imaging showing demyelinating/oedematous changes) of "chlorfenapyr neurotoxicity in humans." It also highlights the "latent period" between ingestion and onset of fatal manifestations. Earlier, similar case reports of human deaths with delayed onset neurological symptoms, due to chlorfenapyr poisoning have been reported, from Japan, Columbia, and Korea.

DE Environmental accounting; Green GDP; The green GDP accounting
AB Environment is a rich heritage handed over by previous generations. However the nature's straggling behind the economic development creates a chaotic atmosphere. Accountants are justifiably among those who might be criticized for this chaos because accounting which is the language business has never spoken for nature and environment except for the recent decades. The author tries to make the tragedy of environmental degradation More palpable through the numbers and accounting for senior managers and other participants to have a better understanding of the issues. Green economy means an economy that has the ability to rebuild itself as a stable one. The present economy of China and India are moving too rapidly in recent years and kills the environment that nourishes it which is a sort of suicide like a cancer that eventually led to its death with the elimination of host cells.

AB Injuries affect the lives of thousands of young people and their families each year in India. With the gradual decline of communicable and nutritional diseases, injuries will be a leading cause of mortality, morbidity and disabilities and the success achieved so far in child health and survival is in jeopardy. Available data indicate that among children less than 18 y, 10-15% of deaths, 20-30 % of hospital registrations and 20% of disabilities are due to injuries. Based on available data, it is estimated that injuries result in death of nearly 1, 00,000 children every year in India and hospitalisations among 2 million children. Road Traffic Injuries (RTI's), drowning, falls, burns and poisoning are leading injury causes in India. Drowning and burns are major causes of mortality in less than 5 y, while RTIs, falls and poisoning are leading causes in 5-18 y. A shift in the occurrence of suicides to younger age groups of 15-20 y is a matter of serious concern in recent years. More number of males, those in rural areas, and majority of poor income households are affected due to injuries.
   Child injuries are predictable and preventable. Children have limitations of size, development, vision, hearing and risk perceptions as compared to adults and hence are more susceptible and vulnerable to injuries. Thus, it is important to make products and home - road and school environments safer along with greater supervision by parents and care givers. The key approaches include vehicle and product safety, environmental modification, legislation and enforcement, education and skills development along with availability of quality trauma care. Child injury prevention and care requires good quality data, building human and financial resources, strengthening policies and programmes based on evidence and integrated implementation of countermeasures along with monitoring and evaluation. Child injury prevention and control is crucial and should be an integral part of child health and survival.

AB Background: Refugees are at risk of psychiatric morbidity because of forced migration, traumatic events and resettlement in unfamiliar environments. Many live in low- and middle-income countries (LAMIC) under stressful conditions contributing to increased suicide risk.
   Aims: This study assessed the feasibility of regular contact and use of safety planning cards (CASP) by community volunteers (CVs) in reducing suicidal behaviour among Sri Lankan refugees residing in camps in Tamil Nadu, South India.
   Methods: A household survey was carried out on consenting adults in two refugee camps - one intervention and one control - randomly selected using lottery method. The primary outcome was reduction in suicidal behaviour. Experience of trauma during war and migration, depression, post-traumatic stress and alcohol use were documented. Individuals scoring >16 on Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CESD) or >30 on Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or with active/passive suicidal ideation or a history of previous suicidal attempts were considered as high risk. CVs were trained to deliver CASP intervention to high-risk individuals. Change from baseline to follow-up was computed for intervention and control groups, and the difference between changes in suicide rates was compared using proportion test.
   Results: In total, 639 refugees from intervention and 664 from control camps participated. Of the 288 high-risk refugees in intervention camp, 139 completed the intervention. In the control camp, 187 were categorised as high risk. Prevalence of suicide attempts was 6.1%. Following intervention, differences between sites in changes in combined suicide (attempted suicides and suicides) rates per 100,000 per year were 519 (95% confidence interval (CI): 136-902; p<.01).
   Conclusion: CASP, an intervention involving contact by CVs and use of safety planning cards, is feasible to implement and can reduce suicidal behaviour among refugees. Its replication in more settings will enhance validity.

ID SOCIAL MEDIA; INFORMATION
AB Twitter is a free social networking site where registered individuals or organizations (i.e., users) can share 280-characters or letters as messages called Tweets. Similarly "Retweets" are the process/options where anyone can send the existing tweet to the third person or to a number of persons simultaneously and instantly. "Retweet with Comment" also exists where any person can give their comments and simultaneously share with anyone or with a number of persons simultaneously. #signs are used to mention the important messages which one wants to draw the attention of other Suicide and other Mental Health Issues are neglected preventable which needs to be addressed. According to NCRB 2015, India 133,623 people had committed suicide with the Incidence of 10.6/100,000 while the burden of Suicide in the state of Odisha were 4,087 with an incidence rate of 9.7/100,000. Advocacy is an activity by an individual or group which aims to influence decisions within the political, economy, social systems, and institutions. Objective: Use of Twitter as a public health tool to raise the mental health issues among policy makers, administrators of both state and central government level and also to create awareness among community through media. Methodology: After creating Twitter accounts we have used a systematic approach to address the issues. Various stakeholders (health ministers, secretaries, Govt. officials of the health department, Psychiatrists, Psychologists, NGOs, Public Health Specialists, Electronic Media, Printed Media, etc.) were identified and discussed suicide and other mental health issues in the form of tweets, retweets, replies. The issues related to Suicide and other Mental Health was tweeted, retweeted to policy makers. The process was repeated for one month since 30th July 2018. Observations: Out of 98 tweets during one month of duration the majority of them were of the first week (38.7%) followed by the second week (33.6%). Similarly, retweets were more in the first week 46.8% followed by 73 (32.5%). Replies were more in the 2nd week. Out of a total of 352 likes on our tweets, retweets and most of the replies observed during the 2nd week. State level-Signing of Memorandum of Understanding between NIMHANS, Bangalore, AIIMS New Delhi and AIIMS Bhubaneswar, Odisha through Central and State Governments. a) A NIMHANS like institute will be set up near Bhubaneswar having a budget of Rs 3000 million. b) Telemedicine project in AIIMS Bhubaneswar which will be connected to NIMHANS Bangalore-to improve the capacity building. The helpline number was started from Department of Psychiatry SCB Medical College, Cuttack, along with other 20 district Headquarters of Health and welfare department, Odisha. Odisha Govt. has started giving frequent advertisements in various printed Media to create awareness. Several new posts for clinical Psychologists were advertised by the National Health Mission Odisha, for better Management of #MHI. With the interventions at the center level, IRDA ordered insurance firms/companies to include "mental illness" in their medical insurance policies adhering to provision of Mental Health Care Act 2017. Conclusion: Twitter can be used as an important cost-effective tool to address the public health issues like suicide and other mental health illness, to raise the issues with policy makers to bring a change in policy.

AB The Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 (MHCA) was a step that was essential, once the Government of India ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007. The MHCA looks to protect, promote, and fulfill the rights of persons with mental illness (PMI) as stated in the preamble of the Act. Further, there is an onus on the state to provide affordable mental health care to its citizens. In India, mental health has always been a lesser priority for lawmakers and citizens alike. The rights-based MHCA looks to overhaul the existing system by giving prominence to autonomy, protecting the rights of the mentally ill individuals, and making the State responsible for the care. The decision to make all this happen is commendable. The annual health expenditure of India is 1.15% of the gross domestic product, and the mental health budget is <1% of India's total health budget. This article systematically analyses and describes the cost estimation of the implementation of MHCA 2017, and it is not an estimation of mental health economics. The conservative annual estimated cost on the government to implement MHCA, 2017 would be 94,073 crore rupees. The present study estimation depicts that investing in the implementation of MHCA, 2017 by the government will yield 6.5 times the return on investment analysis benefit. If the State is not proactive in taking measures to implement the MHCA, the rights promised under this legislation will remain aspirational.

AB Gender is a critical determinant of mental health and mental illness. The patterns of psychological distress and psychiatric disorder among women are different from those seen among men. Women have a higher mean level of internalizing disorders while men show a higher mean level of externalizing disorders. Gender differences occur particularly in the rates of common mental disorders wherein women predominate. Differences between genders have been reported in the age of onset of symptoms, clinical features, frequency of psychotic symptoms, course, social adjustment, and long-term outcome of severe mental disorders. Women who abuse alcohol or drugs are more likely to attribute their drinking to a traumatic event or a stressor and are more likely to have been sexually or physically abused than other women. Girls from nuclear families and women married at a very young age are at a higher risk for attempted suicide and self-harm. Social factors and gender specific factors determine the prevalence and course of mental disorders in female sufferers. Low attendance in hospital settings is partly explained by the lack of availability of resources for women. Around two-thirds of married women in India were victims of domestic violence. Concerted efforts at social, political, economic, and legal levels can bring change in the lives of Indian women and contribute to the improvement of the mental health of these women.

TI Epidemiology of suicide in the state of Guanajuato.
SO SALUD MENTAL
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE Suicide; epidemiology; Guanajuato; migration; social-demograph
ID MEXICO
AB From the epidemic perspective, suicide appears as an international public health problem due to the remarkable increase of its incidence. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in the year 2000, suicide had the greater percentage (49%) in the statistics of "deaths by intentional injuries"; followed by violence (32%) and war (19%).
   This source also notifies that in countries with population over 100 millions, Mexico is the country that shows the higher increase of "changes in age-standardized groups in specific intervals of time" (+61, 9% in period 81-83/93-95). Followed in descendent order by: India (+54%, period 80-93), Brazil (+13.2%, period 79-81/93-93), and the Russian Federation (+5.3%, period 80-82/96-98). The United States of America (-5.3%, period 80-82/93-97) and Japan (-14.3%, period 80-82/95-97) have shown decreasing rates.
   The increase in the rates of suicide in Mexico has been registered by various studies, which also have proved that the States where those rates were the highest are: Veracruz, Mexico City and, in third place, Guanajuato.
   Some specific sectors of Guanajuato State show an association of two phenomena: suicide and migration, basically migrants travelling to the United States of America and Canada, both countries with a high frequency of suicides. The information on suicide in Mexico come from sources such as local or international studies, and also from reports obtained through public institutions, the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica, Geografia e Informatica (INEGI), the Secreteria de Salud (SS) and the Procuraduria General de Justicia (PGJ). Nevertheless, the data given by these institutions show discrepancies in statistics, a fact due perhaps to differences in the classification criteria for deaths, and to registration and filing mistakes.
   The aim of the present research was to collect and report epidemiological data on suicides and the characteristics of the suicidal events, in the State of Guanajuato, during the period between 1995 and 2001. To this purpose the files of the PGJ in Guanajuato State were analyzed; these files contain detailed information about suicides and the suicidal act, as well as the transcription of suicidal notes, in case they be left. They also contain declarations and testimonies from people who are close (relatives, friends, acquaintances) to the suicidal victim.
   The data gathered included socio-demographical information, migrant condition, variables related to the Suicidal act, alcohol and drug use at the moment of the event, and the transcription of the suicidal note. The declarations and testimonies from the suicide acquaintances were kept for further studies.
   The data-gathering lasted six months and was made by last semester students of the Faculty of Psychology.
   Data were analyzed according to the State distribution Of the PGJ that divides it into 4 zones: Leon, Irapuato, Celaya and San Miguel de Allende. Frequency analysis were made and for some variables, chi square statistical tests.
   Of the 747 cases of death caused by suicide registered by the PGJ in Guanajuato, during the 1995 - 2001 period, 733 were analyzed because the lacking 13 files Could not be located. From the total of cases 80.1% were men and 19.9%, women. The rank of age goes from 8 to 9 1 years. The average for men was 30 years and the mode 20 years; for women the average was 28 wars and the mode 18 years old. This shows that Suicide was committed at,an earlier age by women than by men.
   Only 10% of the whole had no schooling; almost half of the total had completed elementary Studies and 21% had attained high school level. Besides, 30% of the people who committed suicide were employees and only 1.6% were professionals.
   Regarding the characteristics of the suicidal act, the place more used to committ it, was the suicide's house (78%), mainly in the case of women (with significant difference) (p=.001). The suicide method used in most cases was different for both sexes: men preferred hanging (p=.001), and women poisoning (p=.001).
   Forty one per cent of the men had ingested alcohol before committing suicide and only 7.8% of the women. In addition, alcohol use was more frequent in the group of 35 to 44 years of age, and by those who were married. The use of other drugs was present in 13% of the total (no significant differences between sexes).
   As to the migration phenomenon, most of migrant suicides were between 20 and 34 years old. The rate of non-migrant suicides was 4:1 (4 men committed suicide for every suicidal women) and it changed in the migrant group to 3:2. This migration phenomenon is data included: returning migrants, people who were going to leave Mexico in the near future (one day or week later) and also people who had one or more close relatives living as migrant laborers in the northern countries.
   Finally, other differences found when comparing the migrant group with the non-migrants Suicidal group are: the greater use of firearms registered as suicidal method (p=.001) and the higher percentage of psychiatric medication.
   On the other hand, the higher frequency Of Suicides was registered in the month of May (13%), and the lower percentage in October (5.7%).
   State regionalization, showed the higher percentage of suicides in Celaya (254 cases), and the lower corresponded to San Miguel de Allende (103 cases).
   It may be concluded that in the State Of Guanajuato the phenomenon of suicide presents alarming peculiarities: more risked groups include children, adolescents and Young people (this sample found 42 suicidal children under 14 years old).
   Also, considering that migration is the most important social phenomenon in Guanajuato State, we may observe that it has contributed to modify the patterns Of Suicide of some population groups. This is shown by the increasing suicidal women percentage and the most frequent use of firearms, drug and alcohol usage, and psychiatric medication; a possible explanation to this has to do with the Cultural shock of the migration process.
   Although it is difficult to consider the suicidal phenomenon as a consequence of drug abuse and vice versa, from the current frequency of suicide cases involved with drugs, at least at the moment of death, we may observe that this circumstance increases the complexity and difficulty, of the suicide problem.
   Finally, we may stress that obtaining information through the files of the PGJ demonstrated to be fruitful, because they have important elements to consider in the suicide research. Data as the transcription Of suicide notes, the declaration of relatives or close friends of the suicide, and the detailed description of the suicidal event, aren't registered by Other instances. Nevertheless, it is urgent to combine the efforts of the institutions related to the study of the suicidal behaviors, in order to systematize and to unify, the official statistics. This will optimize the registration forms and add some variables aimed to favor research purposes.

   TRIAL
AB Background: Cotton with coevolving pests has been grown in India more than 5000 years. Hybrid cotton was introduced in the 1970s with increases in fertilizer and in insecticide use against pink bollworm that caused outbreaks of bollworm. Hybrid Bt cotton, introduced in 2002 to control bollworm and other lepidopteran pests, is grown on more than 90 % of the cotton area. Despite initial declines, year 2013 insecticide use is at 2000 levels, yields plateaued nationally, and farmer suicides increased in some areas. Biological modeling of the pre-1970s cotton/pink bollworm system was used to examine the need for Bt cotton, conditions for its economic viability, and linkage to farmer suicides.
   Results: Yields in rainfed cotton depend on timing, distribution, and quantity of monsoon rains. Pink bollworm causes damage in irrigated cotton, but not in rainfed cotton unless infested from irrigated fields. Use of Bt cotton seed and insecticide in rainfed cotton is questionable.
   Conclusions: Bt cotton may be economic in irrigated cotton, whereas costs of Bt seed and insecticide increase the risk of farmer bankruptcy in low-yield rainfed cotton. Inability to use saved seed and inadequate agronomic information trap cotton farmers on biotechnology and insecticide treadmills. Annual suicide rates in rainfed areas are inversely related to farm size and yield, and directly related to increases in Bt cotton adoption (i.e., costs). High-density short-season cottons could increase yields and reduce input costs in irrigated and rainfed cotton. Policy makers need holistic analysis before new technologies are implemented in agricultural development.

ID MEDICAL EXAMINER; SYSTEM; TRUTH
AB In India, when a body is reported to the police, an officer is designated to conduct an investigation, the death inquest, whose purpose is to shed light on the circumstances of death. This investigation must make it possible to establish the manner of death, i.e. to determine whether it is the result of homicide, suicide, accident or a so-called "natural" death. The police officer in charge, whenever he considers that there is any doubt as to the cause of death, i.e. the event or series of pathophysiological events which led to death, must have the body examined by a medical doctor. The latter must determine this cause without overlapping on the question of the manner of death. Based on an ethnographic survey conducted in three morgues in Northern India, the article analyses how written forensic productions actually address the manner of death (insisting on certain lesions or referring to "compatibility" with a "supposed manner", etc.). The article also shows that, on the contrary, the causes of death expressed in the reports in strictly pathological terms do not reflect a lack of thought on the part of doctors as to the manner of death, but may be part of a writing strategy specifically aimed at undermining the importance placed on this manner.

AB Due to weak logistics, the price of potato has been observed volatile since 2011, at Burdwan, West Bengal, India. Burdwan becomes news headlines for the farmer suicide rate in 2015. The Hon'ble Prime Minister has called for doubling of farmers' income by 2022. In Bengal, it is known as Bengal Fasal Bima Yojona (BFBY). BFBY is free to farmers and the Government of West Bengal pays the premium. Insurance premiums price moves from a government account to account of insurance companies but farmers are remaining cashless and fall into a debt trap due to the low selling price. To bridge the gap and to find the result, data was collected from 701 farmers of 16 Blocks of Purba Burdwan. Eight estimators are considered. The authors continue the study on the basis of analysis done by Mukhopadhyay et al.. Using multinomial logistic regression to analyse the data they observe income, marital status, age, and education which are significant to the loan 'defaulter' group.

ID EPIDEMIOLOGY; MORTALITY; FIRE
AB The death of married females nowadays is very common in India, usually being associated with dowry disputes. In India, dowries are a continuing series of gifts endowed before and after the marriage. When dowry expectations are not met, the young bride may be killed or compelled to commit suicide, most frequently by burning. In a cohort of 152 burned wives, 47 (31%) were homicidal burns and these cases were analyzed in view of epidemiological and medicolegal aspects.
   Homicide by burning amongst women is a major concern in India as it has become pervasive throughout all social strata and geographical areas. In this series, most women were from extended families (i.e. multigenerational groups of related individuals living under a single roof) and the homicides occurred within the first few years of their marriages. The majority of the affected wives were 16-25 years of age (77%) at the time of the incident and sustained more than 70% total body surface area (TBSA) burn injuries. Many of them were doused with kerosene and set alight. Most died at the time of the incident or within the subsequent 24 hours, most commonly from shock.

   We can find the answers to these two questions by studying local newspapers.
   The country written about the most is China followed by Indonesia; with Japan and India far behind them.
   The image given of these countries is rather contradictory: on the one hand they were portrayed as the land of plenty with an abundance of wealth of all kinds, but on the other hand they were described as lands of death and catastrophe. They were also ruthless societies where torture and ritual suicides were said to be commonplace and where Hindu and Chinese women were physically and morally abused Chinese people are viewed with both despise and admiration. Japan was entering the Meiji era and was highly praised, mostly for her military victories over China and then Russia. Even if Asian objects were rarely to be seen in the home of Sarthe inhabitants, the Catholics from La Sarthe supported them vigorously.

DE Suicide by hanging; Retrospective; Dammam, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
ID SUICIDE; INDIA
AB A retrospective study was carried out on 133 suicidal hanging cases autopsied at Forensic Medicine Center in Dammam, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (from 2003 to 2007). Of these cases, 115 (86.46%) were males and 18 females (13.54%), with an average male:female ratio of 6.38. There was an increasing trend of hanging among ages between 21 and 50 years (88.7%), and the fourth decade had the highest number of victims (about 36%) between all age groups.
   Local Saudi nationals comprised a small proportion of cases (21 persons, 15.8%), while the others were foreigners working in the Kingdom with an Indian precedence (63 persons, 47.4%), followed by other 11 different nationalities representing 36.8% of the cases. The peak of these suicidal acts was in June and the least was in February and December. Postmortem blood alcohol was found in 6.76% of cases, amphetamine in 3% (4 cases), and cannabinoids in 2.25% (3 cases). About 75% of the deceased persons were male laborers (100 cases), 11.27% were female housemaids (15 cases), and only 13 persons were unemployed (9.77%). Previous history of psychological illnesses was documented in 19 cases (14.28%) and stressful family problems in 6% of cases. There were previous suicidal attempts in only one case. Suicidal note was found in only seven cases.
   In conclusion, there was a decreasing trend of suicide by hanging in Dammam from 39 cases in 2003 to 17 cases in 2007, with a rate of 0.85/100,000 population in the last year. This was inconsistent with the overall increase in suicide rate in Dammam when compared to the previous decade. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine. All rights reserved.

DT Article
ID PERFORMANCE; SYMPTOMS; STRESS; GENDER
AB The latest report by the National Crime Records Bureau has positioned Tamil Nadu as the Indian state with highest suicide rate. At least in part, this is happening due to exam pressure among adolescents, emphasizing the imperative need to understand the pattern of anxiety and various factors contributing to it among students. The present study was conducted to analyze the level of state anxiety among board exam attending school students in Tamil Nadu, India. A group of 100 students containing 50 boys and 50 girls from 10th and 12th grades participated in the study and their state anxiety before board exams was measured by Westside Test Anxiety Scale. We found that all board exam going students had increased level of anxiety, which was particularly higher among boys and 12th standard board exam going students. Analysis of various demographic variables showed that students from nuclear families presented higher anxiety levels compared to their desired competitive group. Overall, our results showing the prevalence of state anxiety among board exam going students in Tamil Nadu, India, support the recent attempt taken by Tamil Nadu government to improve student's academic performance in a healthier manner by appointing psychologists in all government schools.

DT Article
DE Maternal deaths; non maternal deaths; reproductivity age group women;
   verbal autopsy
AB Background & objectives: Reliable data on mortality and morbidity among women of reproductive age group are scarce in India. The present study is the Maharashtra component of a large multicentric task force study on the cause of death by verbal autopsy conducted in five States of India. The data pertaining to deaths among reproductive age group women are presented along with the factors contributing to these deaths.
   Methods: House-to-house surveys of a representative population from rural and urban areas in six districts of Maharashtra were undertaken by probability of proportion to size (PPS) sampling. Information on death was obtained from the relatives of the deceased and cause of death was assigned using the standardized algorithm prepared. International Classification of Diseases - ICD-10 was used to code the assigned cause of death.
   Results: A total of 103 deaths in reproductive age group women were investigated, of which 7(5.6%) were maternal while 96 (93.2%) were due to non maternal causes. Six out of seven maternal deaths were in rural area. Among the non maternal deaths, 46.8 per cent women had symptoms suggestive of anaemia and the leading cause of death was infectious and parasitic diseases (25%), tuberculosis being the top killer in this group. This was followed by injury. and poisoning (20.8%), suicides being the leading cause in this category. Among non-communicable diseases, cancers contributed to 10.6 per cent deaths among which cancer esophagus and cancer cervix took a major toll.
   Interpretation & conclusion: Communicable diseases, injury and poisoning and cancers are the major killers among reproductive age group women. Several factors responsible for accidents and suicides also contributed substantially to the mortality load among these women. Majority of the maternal deaths were seen in rural areas indicating the need to strengthen the maternal health care.

TI Dowry - A deep-rooted cause of violence against women in India
SO MEDICINE SCIENCE AND THE LAW
LA English
DT Article
ID NORTHERN INDIA; CHANGING TRENDS; PREVENTION
AB The world has entered the new millenium but it is a harsh reality that the woman in India has long been ill-treated in our male-dominated society. She is deprived of her independent identity and is looked upon as a commodity. She is not only robbed of her dignity and pride by way of seduction by the men outside, but also may become a victim of cruelty by her saviours, within the four walls of her own house. However, her trauma does not end here, it may even go to the extent of forcing her to commit suicide or she may be burnt to death for various reasons including that of dowry. This type of violence transgresses the boundaries of caste, class, region or religion and is prevalent in almost all societies in India.
   The system of dowry is a social practice which on its own has claimed the lives of scores of women - both young and old, and has made life a virtual hell for many more. Unfortunately, education among women has not produced a reformative effect on their social outlook, nor encouraged any change in them conducive to social upliftment. Those parents who prefer not to take dowry for their well-qualified and settled male children, are in fact considered 'strange' by the society and doubts about 'the respectability of the groom's family' are usually raised. The present study makes an in-depth review of the dowry system in India and analyses the reasons which have demonized dowry into its present commercialized and institutionalized form.

   ESTERASES
AB Pyrethroid resistance was found in 54 field strains of Helicoverpa armigera collected between 1995 and 1999 from 23 districts in seven states of India. LD50 values of the field strains ranged from 0.06 to 72.2 mug/larva with slopes of 0.5-3.1. Resistance was highest in regions where pyrethroid use was frequent (four to eight applications per season). Resistance to deltamethrin was exceptionally high with resistance ratios of 13,570 and 27,160 in two strains collected during February 1998 in central India. Resistance to cypermethrin, fenvalerate and cyhalothrin also was high with resistance ratios of <1,000 in four strains collected from central and southern India. Resistance ratios were below 100 in >50% of the strains tested. Pyrethroid resistance was high in strains collected from the districts in Andhra Pradesh where a majority of the cotton farmer suicide cases in India were reported. Resistance to pyrethroids appeared to have increased over 1995-1998 in most of the areas surveyed. Studies carried out through estimation of detoxification enzyme activity and synergists indicated that enhanced cytochrome p450 and esterase activities were probably important mechanisms for pyrethroid resistance in field strains. Pyrethroid nerve insensitivity also was found to be a major mechanism in some parts of the country where the use of pyrethroids was high. The information presented illustrates the importance of proper insect management programs to avoid the consequences associated with improper insecticide use.

AB Background: Suicide is a growing health concern and causes significant health burden. Patients with substance use disorders represent an especially vulnerable population in terms of self-harm. Data on risk factors for self-harm in substance-using population in the Indian context are limited. We aimed to determine the patterns and sociodemographic/clinical predictors of self-harm in patients with substance use disorders.
   Materials and Methods: We assessed 300 male patients on Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory to assess the patterns of self-harm. We performed mediation analysis to determine whether clinical variables acted via sociodemographic variables in their effect on self-harm.
   Results: The occurrence rate of self-harm was 32.7%. It was significantly associated with a younger age, being unmarried/separated, unemployed, history of injecting drug use, high-risk sexual behavior, and cannabis use disorders.
   Conclusion: Self-harm is an important consideration among patients with substance use disorders, and needs to be addressed by the clinicians involved in the care of such patients.

DE Absconding; guidelines; India; inpatients; psychiatry
ID PERCEIVED COERCION; ELOPEMENT; ADMISSION; UNIT
AB Background: Patients absconding from psychiatric hospitals pose a serious concern for the safety of patients and public alike. Absconding is associated with an increased risk of suicide, self-harm, homicide, and becoming "missing" from society. There are only scarce data on profile and outcome of the absconding patients in India. Aims: To study the prevalence and describe the clinical and coercion characteristics of patients who abscond during inpatient care from an open ward. Methodology: "Absconding" was defined as patients being absent from the hospital for a period of more than 24 h. This is an analysis of absconding patients out of the 200 admitted patients at a tertiary psychiatric hospital. Descriptive statistic was used to analyze the demographic, clinical, and perceived coercion profile and outcome. Results: The absconding rate was 4.5 incidents per 100 admissions. Most of these patients were males, from a nuclear family, admitted involuntarily, belonging to lower socio-economic status, diagnosed with schizophrenia or mood disorder with comorbid substance use disorder and had absent insight. The MacArthur Perceived Coercion Scale score was 4.58 (+/- 1.44), and 80% of the absconded patients felt subjective coercive experiences in most domains at admission. Out of the 9 absconded patients, 2 patients had completed suicides and one continued to remain untraceable. Conclusion: The absconded patients were males; admitted involuntarily; diagnosed with schizophrenia, mood disorder, and comorbid substance use disorder; and had absent insight and high perceived coercion. Absconding patients had the tendency to harm themselves and wander away from home.

AB Cerbera odollam is a plant species of the Apocynaceae family. It is often dubbed the 'suicide tree' due to its strong cardiotoxic effects, which make it a suitable means to attempt suicide. The plant grows in wet areas in South India, Madagascar, and Southeast Asia; and its common names include Pong-Pong and Othalanga. The poison rich part of the plant is the kernel which is present at the core of its fruit. The bioactive toxin in the plant is cerberin, which is a cardiac glycoside of the cardenolide class. Cerberin has a mechanism of action similar to digoxin; hence, Cerbera odollam toxicity manifests similar to acute digoxin poisoning. Ingestion of its kernel causes nausea, vomiting, hyperkalemia, thrombocytopenia, and ECG abnormalities. Exposure to high doses of Cerbera odollam carries the highest risk of mortality. Initial management includes supportive therapy and administration of atropine followed by temporary pacemaker insertion. Administration of digoxin immune Fab may be considered in severe cases, although efficacy is variable and data limited to isolated case reports.

ID CENTERED APPROACH; FOOD; POLICY
AB This study draws on a culturally centered collaboration with a community of dalit women farmers in South India who were organized in a cooperative in their collective resistance against the corporatization of agriculture. Situated in the backdrop of the epidemic of farmer suicides in the region, this manuscript examines how those at the margins of global neoliberal transformations symbolically and materially make sense of and resist these transformations. The voices of the women farmers disrupt the underlying neoliberal assumptions that undergird the importation of cash crop agriculture into a subsistence and community-centered farming culture. They depict the ways in which Western cash crop agriculture disrupts community, food security, local health care systems, and the unique gender relations. Moreover, the communication advocacy work carried out by the women seeks to transform agricultural policy through material interventions as alternative practices of agriculture that challenge the hegemony of cash-based individualized agriculture.

AB The Vidarbha region in Maharashtra, India, home to 3.4 million smallholder farmers, is a major cotton-producing region in one of the wealthiest Indian states. However, between 1995 and 2013, more than 60,000 farmers took their own lives. Many of these suicides have been linked to extreme debt created by the expensive mono-cropping of Bt cotton. Some farming households have responded to these pressures by abandoning Bt cotton growing and turning to sustainable agriculture using traditional mixed-cropping methods. Yet the question remains: have the changes produced better livelihoods in Vidarbha? Using a food sovereignty framework, we assess the impact of these changes through an analysis of a 200-household survey across six districts in Vidarbha. We also explore the meaning of food sovereignty for those who practise it, seeking to better understand some of the complexities and experiences associated with the term.

AB Interest in focus group discussions has grown recently, and so has the recognition of them as a valuable method for qualitative data collection. Despite increasing popularity, they are not an easy option, and moderators must find appropriate ways to approach participants to achieve good-quality data. A path to reach this aim is the inclusion in the focus group agenda of some "exercises" (or activity-oriented questions) that are enjoyable and productive supplements to questions. Exercises provide a different way of gathering information and are beneficial, for instance, for more reflective participants. They can help focus the group's attention on the core study topic and also make subsequent comparative analysis more straightforward. They can also be helpful with young people and to discuss sensitive topics. The author describes and provides suggestions for use and examples of several exercises, illustrating their application in a research project investigating the cultural meaning of youth suicide in university students in Italy, India, and Australia.

AB This is a retrospective study of 1689 consecutive admissions of burn deaths to the mortuary over a period of 5 years. The socio-demographic data was collected using special Performa and interviewing the family members, relatives, neighbours and from police reports. Depending on the presence or absence of intentional intent, cases were divided into two groups and compared with regard to their socio-demographic profile. Both groups did not differ significantly with regard to age, sex and educational status. The cases with intentional deaths came from nuclear family, unmarried, student, low socio-economic status, had more stressful life events and suffered larger bums injuries compared with those who experienced non-intentional deaths. The majority of the cases were below the age of 35, unemployed and females outnumbered males in both the groups. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

AB The estimate of the global burden of disease predicts that depression will be the second-leading cause of disability worldwide by 2020. Depression is widely prevalent in women in all age groups especially in India where 1.2 billion population lives. In the current scenario of underdiagnosed, untreated cases of females suffering from depression, the hurdles faced by Indian women include inadequate number of mental health professionals, lack of awareness, stigma, disadvantaged position of women, multiple roles, increased levels of stress, and domestic violence. The literature search included an electronic database, published materials, and standard textbooks. The authors have provided a brief overview of different types of depression in females. Epidemiology, etiology, clinical presentation, and management linked to the reproductive cycle of women have been covered. Awareness through public education, early detection, organized national mental health programs, comprehensive management, with judicious utilization of the limited resources would tackle the rising number of cases of female depression, in a cost effective manner, thereby preventing suicide.

ID GROWTH
AB India's agricultural sector is at a crossroads, facing challenges of stagnation in crop yields, non-remunerative prices, falling crop incomes and tardy responses from public service systems. There are reports of peasant suicides due to non-profitability of farming. However, scant empirical evidence is available on changes in real income and wages in the Indian agricultural sector. The present study uses data from the National Accounts Statistics and Cost of Cultivation Surveys to analyse the changes in real income and discusses the underlying reasons. The study reveals that the purchasing power of farmers has remained low and has worsened over recent years. The value of crop output has increased, but a disproportionate rise in input costs has resulted in a fall in crop incomes in several states, with the agriculturally developed Punjab being an exception. Interestingly, real wage rates for agricultural labour have shown an increasing trend, indicating improvement in the welfare of labour.

AB Of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB), <50% complete treatment. Most treatment failures for patients with MDR TB are due to death during TB treatment. We sought to determine the proportion of deaths during MDR TB treatment attributable to TB itself. We used a structured verbal autopsy tool to interview family members of patients who died during MDR TB treatment in India during January-December 2016. A committee triangulated information from verbal autopsy, death certificate, or other medical records available with the family members to ascertain the underlying cause of death. For 66% of patient deaths (47/71), TB was the underlying cause of death. We assigned TB as the underlying cause of death for an additonal 6 patients who died of suicide and 2 of pulmonary embolism. Deaths during TB treatment signify program failure; accurately determining the cause of death is the first step to designing appropriate, timely interventions to prevent premature deaths.

AB Background: Sharing of needles and syringes and unprotected sex remain a common practice among people who inject drugs (PWID) in India and are important drivers of new HIV infections. Whether engagement in risk behaviors among PWID is associated with symptoms of common mental disorders in India is unknown.
   Methods: We analyzed the data collected in April and May of 2012 from a community-based sample of 420 PWID in Delhi using time location sampling. Self-report symptom scales were used to measure the severity of symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 9) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale 2) within the preceding 2 weeks. We assessed the presence of suicidal thoughts within the past 12 months.
   Results: PWID with severe depressive symptoms and those with suicidal thoughts were 4 and 2 times more likely to share needles/ syringes, respectively. PWID experiencing suicidal thoughts had 82% more female sexual partners and were 5 times more likely to have had unprotected sex at last sex with a paid female partner. Conversely, symptoms of anxiety were associated with a 30% decrease in the likelihood of needle/syringe sharing and a 70% decrease in the likelihood of unprotected sex at last sex with a paid female partner.
   Conclusions: We found a high prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation among men who inject drugs in Delhi and that depression and suicidal ideation are independently positively associated with HIV risk behaviors, whereas anxiety is associated with a reduction in such behaviors. Ameliorating mental health problems among PWID in India may aid in reducing HIV infections.

TI Mortality in schizophrenia: A study of verbal autopsy from cohorts of
   two rural communities of South India
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY

DE Cause of death; community cohorts; India; schizophrenia
ID FOLLOW-UP; DEATH; VALIDATION
AB Background: Schizophrenia is a life-shortening disease. Although the rate of mortality of persons with schizophrenia in India is established to be more compared to that in the general population, there is a little exploration of the causes for the same.
   Aim: The aim of this study is to explore the causes of death in two rural cohorts of schizophrenia.
   Materials and Methods: In-person interviews of primary caregivers of 53 deceased persons with schizophrenia were conducted using the World Health Organization's verbal autopsy 2014 instrument. Physician-based method was used to determine the causes of death.
   Results: Average age of 53 deceased schizophrenia patients was 50.45 +/- 13.65 years with almost equal gender ratio. Just more than two-thirds of patients were married, just more than one-third are educated up to primary school and also had no formal education each. Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) were the most common causes of death (30, 56.6%) in this sample, followed by communicable disease (7, 13.2%), and then unnatural deaths (suicide - 8, 15%, and road traffic accidents - 3, 5.6%).
   Conclusions: It is the first study in India to explore the causes of death in schizophrenia. NCDs being the most common cause of death in schizophrenia suggests to the need of integration of schizophrenia care into general health care.

DE Adolescent; Mental health; Policy; Review; India
ID DISORDERS
AB PurposeMental health problems and suicide are the leading cause of mortality in young people globally. India is home to the largest number of adolescents in the world. This study was undertaken to assess the policy environment for addressing adolescent mental health in India.MethodsWe conducted a review of 6 policies and programs and 11 in-depth interviews with key stakeholders. The findings were analyzed using the policy triangle analysis framework (i.e., context, content, actors and process).ResultsThere is no conformity of the age ranges addressed by these documents nor are vulnerable groups explicitly recognized. Stress, anxiety and depression were commonly identified as mental health concerns and diverse platforms such as community, family, school, digital and health facility were recommended to deliver preventive and treatment interventions. Some interventions specifically targeted some social determinants (like safe and supportive schools) but many others (like social norms) were not addressed. Preventive interventions were recommended for delivery through peers and other non-specialist providers while treatment interventions were recommended for delivery in healthcare facilities by specialist health professionals. There was very little engagement of young people in the development of these policies or in their implementation, except for peer educators mentioned in one policy. Stakeholders identified several major challenges in implementing these policies, notably the lack of inter-sectoral coordination and fragmentation of governance; budgetary constraints; and scanty human resources.ConclusionsAlthough there are now several policy instruments testifying to a comprehensive approach on adolescent mental health, there are gaps in the extent of engagement of young people and how these will be operationalized that may limit their impact on addressing the burden of mental health problems in young people in India.

TI Risk in Commercial Microfinancing - A Social Perspective from India

DT Article
DE Debt-distress; Indebtedness; microcredit; microfinance; financial
   literacy
ID CREDIT
AB The positive role of Microfinance in Rural Development is applaudablewhen backed with a Social mission. However, mass-commercialization of the sector is a concern! Recent agitations of the Tamil farmers, protesting for the announcement of a drought relief package and loan waiver before the JantarMantar, and the recurring episodes of farmer's suicide in India are evidences to what debt-distress is! It has both qualitative and quantitative implications. Propensity to debt and "indebtedness" is a growing risk in Microfinance. Post demonetization recoil in commercial lending and the boom in financing activities backed by digitization may further dampen the situation, especially in Rural India. MFI sector showed resilience to change even in demonetization. It managed to close the year with an outstanding loan portfolio of ? 46,842 crores (approx.. $7.2 bn) with a fair CAGR of 16.15% over last four years. Today MFIs serve around 29 million clients with an average loan of 12,751 (approx. $196). Though the average loan is low and insignificant in figure; it has to be analysed from the perspectives of multiple borrowings, unproductive utilization, limited earning opportunities, slump in Agriculture, Industry and Manual Labor, and the ease of financing in the rising era of digitization.

AB Research in GM crops is of pressing importance to biotechnologists, development economists, farmers, government officials, and concerned citizens. Each of these stakeholders carries preconceived notions of success and failure that not only influence how data regarding GM crops is shared but also reify the objective reality of GM seeds as a technology that might exist outside the idiosyncrasies of a farmer's field. In this essay, I draw on ethnographic fieldwork conducted among GM cotton planting farmers in Telangana, India to deconstruct the process by which scientific facts surrounding yields and GM seeds are created, leveraged, and then divorced from their subjective contexts in agricultural research. Calling attention to the methods and assumptions involved in constructing scientific facts, Science and Technology Studies (STS) reveals underlying complexities that explain why purportedly objective science, and the seed as its supposedly universal product, produce such ambiguous outcomes for Indian farmers. Specifically, Isabelle Stengers' and Bruno Latour's notion of the factish, the process by which autonomous facts are created and live beyond their experimental and laboratory confines, can help to explore the neocolonial dynamics underlying the construction of success and failure in GM crops.

TI Estimates of the years-of-life-lost due to the top nine causes of death
   in rural areas of major states in India in 1995
SO NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
LA English
DT Article
ID GLOBAL BURDEN; DISABILITY; MORTALITY; DISEASE; PATTERNS; AFRICA
AB Background. Years-of-life-lost (YLL) contribute nearly two-thirds of the disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) worldwide and are especially Important for India where Infant and child mortality Is still high. These were estimated for India under the Global Burden of Disease study for the year 1990. No estimates are available for the different states of India. We aimed to prepare state-wise estimates of YLL for different causes of death in rural areas and to determine the causes responsible for a higher burden In different states.
   Methods. Percentage deaths of the top 9 causes reported In the Registrar-General's Survey of Causes of Deaths (Rural)-1995 in 13 major states of India and different age groups was applied to the expected number of total deaths. The life lost according to the standard life-table was age-weighted and discounted using the methodology of the Global Burden of Disease 1990 study. The causes of death were based on lay reporting which otherwise seem reliable.
   Results. The all-cause YLL in rural India In 1995 were 207 per 1000 population. The minimum was 74 In Kerala and maximum 276 in Madhya Pradesh. Pneumonia was the top cause responsible for 15 YLL. The Inter-state variation was high as Tamil Nadu had only 1.6 and Uttar Pradesh 30.5 YLL from this cause. Cancers were a uniform burden across the states. Heart attack, and bronchitis and asthma cut across the more and less developed states. Suicides were a heavy burden in Andhra Pradesh and vehicular accidents In Haryana and Rajasthan. Bihar, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh had communicable and nutritional conditions as predominant causes while Kerala and Punjab had non-communicable diseases as the predominant cause of YLL due to premature mortality.
   Conclusion. These results provide a new perspective about the causes of death that need more attention In rural areas of different states of India. These will also help prioritize areas which require more Inputs at the state-level and hence will be useful for health pollcymakers.

AB Background Psychiatric disorders are reported to be present in 80% to 90% of suicide deaths in high-income countries (HIC), but this association is less clear in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). There has been no previous systematic review of this issue in LMIC. The current study aims to estimate the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in individuals with suicidal behaviour in LMIC. Methods and findings PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE searches were conducted to identify quantitative research papers (any language) between 1990 and 2018 from LMIC that reported on the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in suicidal behaviour. We used meta-analytic techniques to generate pooled estimates for any psychiatric disorder and specific diagnosis based on International classification of disease (ICD-10) criteria. A total of 112 studies (154 papers) from 26 LMIC (India: 25%, China: 15%, and other LMIC: 60%) were identified, including 18 non-English articles. They included 30,030 individuals with nonfatal suicidal behaviour and 4,996 individuals who had died by suicide. Of the 15 studies (5 LMIC) that scored highly on our quality assessment, prevalence estimates for psychiatric disorders ranged between 30% and 80% in suicide deaths and between 3% and 86% in those who engaged in nonfatal suicidal behaviour. There was substantial heterogeneity between study estimates. Fifty-eight percent (95% CI 46%-71%) of those who died by suicide and 45% (95% CI 30%-61%) of those who engaged in nonfatal suicidal behaviour had a psychiatric disorder. The most prevalent disorder in both fatal and nonfatal suicidal behaviour was mood disorder (25% and 21%, respectively). Schizophrenia and related disorders were identified in 8% (4%-12%) of those who died by suicide and 7% (3%-11%) of those who engaged in nonfatal suicidal behaviour. In nonfatal suicidal behaviour, anxiety disorders, and substance misuse were identified in 19% (1%-36%) and 11% (7%-16%) of individuals, respectively. This systematic review was limited by the low number of high-quality studies and restricting our searches to databases that mainly indexed English language journals. Conclusions Our findings suggest a possible lower prevalence of psychiatric disorders in suicidal behaviour in LMIC. We found very few high-quality studies and high levels of heterogeneity in pooled estimates of psychiatric disorder, which could reflect differing study methods or real differences. There is a clear need for more robust evidence in order for LMIC to strike the right balance between community-based and mental health focussed interventions.
   Author summaryWhy was the study done? Approximately 800,000 people die by suicide each year, with 75% of these deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Psychiatric disorder is thought to be associated with 80% to 90% of those who engage in suicidal behaviour in high-income countries (HIC), but this association is less clear in LMIC. A better understanding is needed of this association in LMIC to ensure effective and appropriate allocation of limited resources. What did the researchers do and find? We searched the existing literature for studies conducted in LMIC that estimated the proportion of individuals who engaged in suicidal behaviour with psychiatric disorders and found 112 studies from 26 countries (mainly from China and India). Even in the higher quality studies, there was wide variability in the proportion of psychiatric disorders in fatal (30%-80%) and nonfatal (3%-86%) suicidal behaviour, but on average, 58% of those who died by suicide and 45% of those who engaged in nonfatal suicidal behaviour had a psychiatric disorder. Mood disorders were the most prevalent disorder identified in both fatal and nonfatal suicidal behaviour. What do these findings mean? There were considerable differences in the estimates of psychiatric disorder between studies. This may reflect differences in the way studies were carried out or real differences, but there were too few high-quality studies to estimate the prevalence by individual country. More high-quality research is needed. Psychiatric disorders may be less common in suicidal behaviour in LMIC than in HIC. Although treating psychiatric illness is important, the treatment and prevention of suicidal behaviour should include a wider range of activities.

The present case is a rare case where the iatrogenic injuries produced by a medical practitioner during the course of treatment of a case of suicidal hanging resulted in a suspicion being raised as to the nature of death. The suspicion was further strengthened by the lack of proper documentation and inappropriate/improper use of terminology of medicolegal significance. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd and FFLM.

TI A qualitative study of the background and in-hospital medicolegal
   response to female burn injuries in India

AB Background: Most burns happen in low- and middle income countries. In India, deaths related to burns are more common in women than in men and occur against a complex background in which the cause - accidental or non accidental, suicidal or homicidal - is often unclear. Our study aimed to understand the antecedents to burns and the problem of ascribing cause, the sequence of medicolegal events after a woman was admitted to hospital, and potential opportunities for improvement
   Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 33 women admitted to two major burns units, their families, and 26 key informant doctors, nurses, and police officers. We used framework analysis to examine the context in which burns occurred and the sequence of medicolegal action after admission to hospital.
   Results: Interviewees described accidents, attempted suicide, and attempted homicide. Distinguishing between these was difficult because the underlying combination of poverty and cultural precedent was common to all and action was contingent on potentially conflicting narratives. Space constraint, problems with cooking equipment, and inflammable clod ling increased the risk of accidental burns, but coexisted with household conflict, gender based violence, and alcohol use. Most burns were initially ascribed to accidents. Clinicians adhered to medicolegal procedures, the police carried out their investigative requirements relatively rapidly, but both groups felt vulnerable in the face of the legal process. Women's understandable reticence to describe burns as non accidental, the contested nature of statements, their perceived history of changeability, the limited quality and validity of forensic evidence, and the requirement for resilience on the part of clients underlay a general pessimism.
   Conclusions: The similarities between accident and intention cluster so tightly as to make them challenging to distinguish, especially given women's understandable reticence to describe burns as non accidental The contested status of forensic evidence and a reliance on testimony means that only a minority of cases lead to conviction. The emphasis should be on improving documentation, communication between service providers, and public understanding of the risks of burns.

AB BackgroundMental health disorders among adolescents have emerged as a major public health issue in many low and middle-income countries, including India. There is a paucity of research on the determinants of psychological distress, particularly among the poorest girls in the poorest communities. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and correlates of different indicators of psychological distress among 13-14year old low caste girls in rural, south India.MethodsCross-sectional survey of 1191 low caste girls in two districts in north Karnataka, conducted as part of a cluster randomised-control trial. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis assessed correlates of different indicators of psychological distress.ResultsMore than one third of girls (35.1%) reported having no hope for the future. 6.9% reported feeling down, depressed or hopeless in the past 2weeks. 2.1% reported thinking they would be better off dead or of hurting themselves in some way in the past 2weeks. 1.6% reported sexual abuse, 8.0% rrecent eve teasing and 6.3% having no parental emotional support. Suicidal ideation was independently associated with sexual abuse (AOR 11.9 (3.0-47.0)) and a lack of parental emotional support (AOR 0.2 (0.1-0.5)). Feeling down, depressed or hopeless was independently associated with recent eve-teasing (AOR 2.9 (1.6-5.4)), a harassing or abusive school environment (AOR 3.9 (1.8-8.2)), being frequently absent (AOR 2.8 (1.5-5.5)) or having dropped out of school (AOR 2.1 (1.0-4.3)), and living in Vijayapura district (AOR 2.5 (1.6-4.1)). Having no hope for the future was independently associated with a range of factors, including recent eve-teasing (AOR 1.5 (1.0-2.4)), being engaged (AOR 2.9 (0.9-9.7)), not participating in groups (AOR 0.5 (0.4-0.6)) and a lack of emotional support (AOR 0.6 (0.4-0.7)).ConclusionsRather than being a time of optimism, a third of low caste girls in rural north, Karnataka have limited hope for the future, with some contemplating suicide. As well as having important development benefits, interventions that address the upstream structural and gender-norms based determinants of poor mental health, and provide adolescent services for girls who require treatment and support, should have important benefits for girls' psychological wellbeing.Trial registrationProspectively registered at ClinicalTrials.GovNCT01996241.

AB This article investigates the ways in which the Dutch colonial state dealt with a phenomenon known as the Atjeh-moorden ('Aceh murders'), the persistent suicide-attacks directed at the lives of Dutch residents, committed by Acehnese hoping to become syahid (martyrs to the Islamic faith). Concentrating on the development of colonial psychiatry, and its influence on colonial discourses and practices, I show how Dutch dealings with the Atjeh-moorden were, simultaneously, part and parcel of the construction of an Acehnese subject, and indicative of the administrative ambivalence found in the approach of the colonial state toward violence and criminality.

AB A case of self-injected insulin intoxication with an oral hypoglycaemic agent glipizide overdose in a type-II/non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) individual, a physician by profession, is presented with a review of the literature. The case demonstrates the need for thorough scene investigation, perusal of clinical details and complete autopsy to certify the death caused by combined insulin and glipizide overdose, and the manner of death. A meticulous search in the English literature reveals that hardly any fatal cases of combined insulin and glipizide overdose have been reported, with almost no cases from India, thus making this case report relevant and unique.

AB Purpose: With injuries becoming a leading cause of mortality, morbidity, disability, and socioeconomic losses in India and other low- and middle-income countries, its impact on the female population is significant, affecting their multiple roles and functions. The objectives of the present study were to identify the burden, causes, characteristics, and outcomes of injury among females in Bengaluru city.
   Methods: Information on fatal and nonfatal injuries was collected from the Bangalore city police and the emergency rooms of 22 partner hospitals, respectively, under the Bengaluru Injury Surveillance Program in 2007 and 2008. Data were collected in an uniform manner by trained personnel using standardized methods.
   Findings: Females across all age groups accounted for 26% of fatal and 23% of nonfatal injuries and the highest numbers were among those 16 to 45 years old. Burns and hanging were the leading causes of death; road crashes and poisonings were the major causes of nonfatal injuries. Nearly half of the fatal and one third of the nonfatal injuries were suicides. Pedestrians and two-wheeler riders/pillions were mainly involved in road crashes. Very few received first aid at the injury site and the commonest modes of transportation were a private vehicle or taxi and the local three-wheeler vehicle. More than half of the injured were admitted in the hospitals for medical or surgical management.
   Conclusion: Injuries are a major, preventable public health problem. There is a need to strengthen injury prevention and control programs, as well as increased research to understand risk factors and injury mechanisms.

   legislation
AB Purpose - Indias Mental Healthcare Act 2017 provides a right to mental healthcare, revises admission and review procedures, effectively decriminalises suicide and has strong non-discrimination measures, among other provisions. The purpose of this paper is to examine Indian mental health professionals views of these changes as they relate to stigma and inclusion of the mentally ill.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors held nine focus groups in three Indian states, involving 61 mental health professionals including 56 psychiatrists.
   Findings - Several themes relating to stigma and inclusion emerged: stigma is ubiquitous and results in social exclusion; stigma might be increased rather than remedied by certain regulations in the 2017 Act; stigma is not adequately dealt with in the legislation; stigma might discourage people from making "advance directives"; and there is a crucial relationship between stigma and education.
   Practical implications - Implementation of India's 2017 Act needs to be accompanied by adequate service resourcing and extensive education, including public education. This has commenced but needs substantial resources in order to fulfil the Act's potential.
   Social implications - Indias mental health legislation governs the mental healthcare of 1.3bn people, one sixth of the planet's population; seeking to use law to diminish stigma and enhance inclusion in such a large country sets a strong example for other nations.
   Originality/value - This is the first study of stigma and inclusion since India's 2017 Act was commenced and it highlights both the potential and the challenges of such ambitious rights-based legislation.

AB Study design: A hospital-based clinical, radiological and neurophysiological study. Objectives: Hanging is a common mode of suicide in India, but there is paucity of MRI and neurophysiological findings in the context of clinical and neurological changes. We report the clinical, neurophysiological and MRI studies of three females who attempted suicide by hanging. Methods: All three patients who attempted hanging underwent detailed clinical, electroencephalographic, motor, somatosensory and brainstem-evoked potential and magnetic resonance imaging studies. Patients were clinically followed up for 6 months. Results: Their ages were 21, 26 and 35 years. They developed altered sensorium, decorticate posturing and had a wide variety of movement disorders. Patient no. 1 had the most severe illness and recovered by the seventh month while the others recovered earlier. MRI revealed hyperintense signal changes in the globus pallidus, caudate nucleus and thalamus in all patients and in the midbrain in one patient. Electroencephalography showed nonspecific slowing, Somatosensory, motor and brainstem-evoked potential studies were normal. Conclusion: Hanging leads to hypoxic brain damage resulting in signal changes mainly in the basal ganglia and thalamus and may be associated with transient movement disorders.

AB Objective: Bipolar disorder (BD) is considered to be a common comorbid condition in subjects with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but there is limited literature on the prevalence of BD and its clinical correlates in those with a primary diagnosis of OCD.Methods: We studied the prevalence of BD in a sample of consecutively registered outpatients attending a specialty OCD clinic in India over a period of 13 months. One hundred and seventy-one patients with a primary diagnosis of OCD were assessed systematically using structured and semi-structured instruments.Results: The prevalence of lifetime BD in OCD was 4%. The OCD+BD group had an episodic course of OCD and higher rate of lifetime suicide attempts.Conclusions: BD may not be as highly prevalent in OCD as reported in literature. Those with OCD seem to have only a marginally higher risk for developing BD than the general population. A diagnosis of BD seems to have a pathoplastic effect on the course of OCD. Patients with OCD-BD comorbidity have to be specifically assessed for suicide risk.

AB The objective of the research work is to propose a trigger-action-reaction (TAR) based impact analysis model with the outcome due to Artificial Energy Drinks (AED) on Indian youth. The AED causes a drastic behavioural changes leading to potential health risks in India and the studies suggest that young people or college students are therefore vulnerable to increased problems from ingesting these products. The young community is more likely to take risks than adults and to suffer high rates of alcohol problems, including alcohol-related traffic accidents, violence, sexual assault, and suicide as per the studies. The reaction induces faster metabolism in youth by AEDs resulting to uncontrollable emotional outbursts leading to different health and legal problems. A parallel action reaction based impact analysis with number of AEDs sold out in India that results in criminal activities due to massive consumption of AEDs by the society. A formal model of trigger-action-reaction is applied and validated by multi-core programming using CUDA.

AB This article examines the argument that people in India are strongly oriented towards litigation in court as against other forms of negotiation or advising. In spite of the centrality of the court system to Indian public life, the flow of cases arriving at court does not reflect any such fixed preference. Going to court may simply be a choice which the parties make in the first instance, but which will eventually be abandoned in favour of private forms of compromise. By drawing on the ethnography of a court case followed in a district court of Himachal Pradesh, this contribution will show how even in serious criminal cases where no private compromise is allowed, it often happens that all the prosecution witnesses deny before the judge what they are supposed to have previously stated to the police. The analysis of court interactions and out-of-court narratives will show how nonofficial forms of conciliation may internally unsettle the rules of evidence followed in criminal proceedings.

TI The future of food: countering globalisation and recolonisation of

SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB India, with a billion plus population, has put agriculture at the heart of its economy and food security at the centre of its agriculture policy. However, all the decisions and policies of a free and independent India which replaced colonial policies of land alienation, and concentration on ownership of land, super exploitation of the peasantry, the creation of famines are being undone through globalisation. These policies are bringing back "zamindari" and land monopolies of colonial times. The public distribution system (PDS) is being dismantled. Farmers are committing suicides, reports of starvation deaths have become common, foreboding a return of famines last experienced under British rule. Biodiversity is being rapidly eroded, and food, the very source of health and nutrition has become a major source of health hazards caused by toxic chemicals in factory farming and new genetically engineered foods and crops. This paper examines these developments in detail and proposes an agenda for creating an alternative future of food and highlights the current practices that are working towards this alternative.

AB The purpose of this paper is to evaluate sustainable effectiveness of agri-financing. An attempt has been made to evaluate individual through risk propensity domains and agri-financing through effectiveness domains. The study identifies prominent predictor of agri-financing effectiveness. The data have been collected through stratified random sampling from 220 beneficiaries who have availed agri-financing in the state of Jammu and Kashmir (India). Structural Equation Modelling approach was employed for instrument developments (i.e. confirmatory factor analysis) and hypothesis testing. It has been found that agri entrepreneurs are risk averse with lower risk propensity in career and finance domains. The results provide evidence that risk propensity dimensions have positive impact on agri-financing effectiveness. The study helps in evaluation, prediction and prevention of probable consequences of agri-financing. The research has significant implications in preventing the economic loss resulted through the failure of agri business schemes. Little research has been conducted on the area of agricultural credit in India which is inevitably revealed from the increasing agri farmer suicides.

TI Frames of Mental Illness in an Indian Daily Newspaper

AB A qualitative framing analysis of a sample of stories on mental illness (N = 177) in The Times of India, India?s largest-selling English language broadsheet newspaper, was conducted. Specifically, frames were examined for whether, and if so, how they challenged or perpetuated mental illness stigma. Two predominant frames were identified: people with mental illness are a danger to themselves and others and mental illness can be caused and treated in various ways. Frames had a mix of positive and negative aspects-some that challenged stigma and others that perpetuated it. For example, stories typically attributed mental illness to socioenvironmental, not biological determinants, reflecting a tension between traditional cultural and neurobiological conceptions of mental illness. Such framing could reduce stigma by placing responsibility for recovering from mental illness on the community, not on the individual. However, it could increase stigma by suggesting that mental disorders are not legitimate medical disorders. Also, people with mental illness were rarely quoted, thereby perpetuating stigma by implying, for example, that they are not capable of being interviewed. This study contributes to understanding of how stigma and anti-stigma frames about mental illness are constructed by media in a non-Western sociocultural context. The findings have implications for news coverage of mental illness as well as for the design of anti-stigma interventions in India.

AB India has 1.4 million square-kilometers of land under cultivation and only about 39 percent is irrigated and other 61 percent is fully dependent on rain and if rain fails or gets delayed, crops fail driving debt ridden farmers to suicide. Agricultural output of India is the second largest in the world and India is second largest producer of cotton and one of the largest exporters of cotton in the world. An average farmer family owns 5 acres of agricultural land. Applications of state of art technologies may increase the productivity/hectors. Expert system is a computer based programs. Expert systems have been successfully used in various scientific and business applications. Expert system is also available in agricultural operations to assists the farmers to identify the suitable crops for their farmland. Expert system helps to carry out crop management incredibly effective, efficient way and offers a lot of accurate results to the farmer production systems now-a-days. Authors have carried out a review on applications of expert system for or Disease Diagnoses of Crops around the world to make assessment of the ground realities on utilization of expert system by the farmers and benefits they realized. Authors are conducting a research on the design of Expert Systems for diagnosis of diseases for Paddy crop.

AB This article highlights the efforts of the Community Health and Development (CHAD) Programme of Christian Medical College to address the issues of gender discrimination and improve the status of women in the Kaniyambadi Block, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India. The many schemes that are specifically for women and general projects for the community from which women can also benefit represent a multi-pronged approach whose aim is the improvement of women's health, education and employment in the context of community development. However, despite five decades of work with a clear bias in favour of women, the improvement in health and the empowerment of women has lagged behind that achieved by men. We believe this is because the community, with its strong mole bias, utilises the health facilities and education and employment programmes more for the benefit of men and boys than women and girls. The article argues for a change of approach, in which gender and women's issues are openly discussed and debated with the community. It would appear that nothing short of social change will bring about an improvement in the health of women and a semblance of gender equality in the region. (c) 2006 Reproductive Health Matters.

AB Background Depression and anxiety disorders are common mental disorders worldwide. The MANAS trial aimed to test the effectiveness of an intervention led by lay health counsellors in primary care settings to improve outcomes of people with these disorders.
   Methods In this cluster randomised trial, primary care facilities in Goa, India, were assigned (1:1) by computer-generated randomised sequence to intervention or control (enhanced usual care) groups. All adults who screened positive for common mental disorders were eligible. The collaborative stepped-care intervention offered case management and psychosocial interventions, provided by a trained lay health counsellor, supplemented by antidepressant drugs by the primary care physician and supervision by a mental health specialist. The research assessor was masked. The primary outcome was recovery from common mental disorders as defined by the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems-10th revision (ICD-10) at 6 months. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00446407.
   Findings 24 study clusters, with an equal proportion of public and private facilities, were randomised equally between groups. 1160 of 1360 (85%) patients in the intervention group and 1269 of 1436 (88%) in the control group completed the outcome assessment. Patients with ICD-10-confirmed common mental disorders in the intervention group were more likely to have recovered at 6 months than were those in the control group (n=620 [65.0%] vs 553 [52.9%]; risk ratio 1.22, 95% CI 1.00-1.47; risk difference=12.1%, 95% CI 1.6%-22.5%). The intervention had strong evidence of an effect in public facility attenders (369 [65.9%] vs 267 [42.5%], risk ratio 1.55, 95% CI 1.02-2.35) but no evidence for an effect in private facility attenders (251 [64.1%] vs 286 [65.9%], risk ratio 0.95, 0.74-1.22). There were three deaths and four suicide attempts in the collaborative stepped-care group and six deaths and six suicide attempts in the enhanced usual care group. None of the deaths were from suicide.
   Interpretation A trained lay counsellor-led collaborative care intervention can lead to an improvement in recovery from CMD among patients attending public primary care facilities.

AB Background: Clinical depression is a major leading cause of morbidity and mortality but it is oftentimes overlooked and undertreated. The negative perception and lack of understanding of this condition prevents millions of people from seeking appropriate and on-time medical help, leading to distress and increased burden for affected people and their families. The implementation of public education campaigns and training of non-psychiatric health professionals on mental health and clinical depression has been neglected in several countries, including India, which is the second most populous country in the world with a population of more than 1.2 billion people, almost one-fifth of the world's population.
   Objective: This study sought to explore the knowledge and attitudes toward the diagnosis and treatment of clinical depression in nonpsychiatric health care providers in Vadodara, Gujarat, India.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted over a 4-week period In Gujarat, India among resident physicians and community health workers about their knowledge and views on clinical depression.
   Findings: We found considerable stigma and misinformation about depression especially among health care workers in India. Most of the community health workers had a great deal of difficulty when defining clinical depression, and a large majority said that they never heard about depression or its definition and although the overwhelming majority of respondents did not believe that clinical depression results from a punishment from God (82% disagreed or strongly disagreed with this belief) or evil spirits (77.5%), a much smaller proportion disagreed with the assertions that depression was either solely due to difficult circumstances (38.2%) or that sufferers only had themselves to blame (47.2%). Meanwhile, only 32.6% disagreed with the position that clinical depression is a sign of weakness and 39.4% disagreed with the statement that suicide was a sign of weakness.
   Conclusions: Our findings underscore the considerable public health priority facing India's policymakers and planners to better educate more non-psychiatric physicians and community health workers to identify, understand, and respond to early signs of mental illnesses, especially clinical depression.

TI Widening economic & social disparities: Implications for India
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Review
DE economic disparities; economic reforms; gender gap; poverty; social
   disparities
AB India is often characterized as an emerging economic super power. The huge demographic dividend, the high quality engineering and management talent, the powerful Indian diaspora and the emerging Indian transnational - knelling the optimism. In contrast, there is another profile of India which is rather gloomy. This is the country with the largest number of the poor, illiterates and unemployed in the world. High infant mortality, morbidity and widespread anaemia among women and children continue.
   India suffers from acute economic and social disparities. This article addresses four dimensions of such disparities, viz. regional, rural-urban, social, and gender. There is empirical evidence to indicate that during the last two decades all these disparities have been increasing.
   As a result of economic reforms, the southern and western States experienced accelerated economic and social development as compared to northern and eastern States. This has led to widening gap in income, poverty and other indicators of development between the two regions. Rural-urban divide also widened in the wake of reforms. While large and medium cities experience unprecedented economic prosperity, the rural areas experience economic stagnation. As a result, there is widespread agrarian distress which results in farmers' suicide and rural unrest.
   Socially backward sections, especially scheduled castes and tribes (SCs and STs) have gained little from the new prosperity which rewards disproportionately those with assets, skills and higher education. STs have often been victims of development as a result of displacement. The gender gap in social and economic status, traditionally more in India as compared to other societies; has further widened by the economic reforms and globalization.
   The approach paper to the Eleventh Plan stresses the importance of more inclusive economic growth. It emphasizes the need for bridging the divides discussed in this article. Unless these are achieved in a time-bound manner, there could be serious adverse implications for the Indian economy, society and polity.

AB Through an examination of recent events and controversies Indian universities, this article reflects on the neoliberal creep taking over academia. The narrative connects the suicide note of a Dalit caste doctoral student, a student festival of political dissent, missives from the education minister, the financialization of higher education, and a market-oriented performance management system to discipline the professoriate. The latter element in the narrative is illustrated through my own teaching and research practice whose intellectual foundations draw on Professor Frank Fischer's scholarship. This personal reflection draws on my experiences in seeking to inhabit the role of a facilitator of participatory learning, engaging directly with policy actors and their cultural modes of communication.

AB Background Stigma related to mental health and lack of trained mental health professionals is a major cause for an increased treatment gap, particularly in rural India. The Systematic Medical Appraisal, Referral and Treatment (SMART) Mental Health project delivered a complex intervention involving task sharing, an anti-stigma campaign and use of technology-based, decision-support tools to empower primary care workers to identify and manage depression, anxiety, stress and suicide risk. Aims The aim of this article is to report changes in stigma perceptions over three time points in the rural communities where the anti-stigma campaign was conducted. Method A multimedia-based anti-stigma campaign was conducted over a 3-month period in the West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh, India. Following that, the primary care-based mental health service was delivered for 1 year. The anti-stigma campaign was evaluated in two villages and data were captured at three time points over a 24-month period (N = 1417): before and after delivery of the campaign and after completion of the health services delivery intervention. Standardised tools captured data on knowledge, attitude and behaviour towards mental health as well as perceptions related to help seeking for mental illnesses. Results Most knowledge, attitude and behaviour scores improved over the three time points. Overall mean scores on stigma perceptions related to help seeking improved by -0.375 (minimum/maximum of -2.7/2.4, s.d. 0.519, P < 0.001) during this time. Loss to follow-up was 10%. Conclusions The data highlight the positive effects of an anti-stigma campaign over a 2-year period.

AB A significant number of burns and deaths from fire are intentionally wrought. Rates of intentional burns are unevenly distributed throughout the world; India has a particularly high rate in young women whereas in Europe rates are higher in men in mid-life. Data from hospitalized burn patients worldwide reveal incidence rates for assault by fire and scalds ranging from 3% to 10%. The average proportion of the body surface area burned in an assault by fire or scalds is approximately 20%. In different parts of the world, attempted burning of others or oneself can be attributed to different motives. Circumstances under which assaults occur fall largely into the categories of interpersonal conflict, including spousal abuse, elder abuse, or interactions over contentious business transactions. Contributing social factors to assaults by burning include drug and alcohol abuse, non-constructive use of leisure time, non-participation in religious and community activities, unstable relationships, and extramarital affairs. Although the incidence of self-mutilation and suicide attempts by burning are relatively low, deliberate self-harm carries a significant risk of death, with an overall mortality rate of 65% worldwide. In those who resort to self-immolation, circumstantial themes reflect domestic discord, family dysfunction, and the social ramifications of unemployment. Preventing injurious burn-related violence requires a multifaceted approach, including legislation and enforcement, education, and advocacy. Better standardized assessment tools are needed to screen for risks of abuse and for psychiatric disorders in perpetrators. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

DE Psychiatric morbidities; HIV/AIDS; India; Gujarat and depression
AB Despite all the medical advances we have made in treatment of HIV infection the psychiatric care of the patients of persons' with HIV and AIDS remained one of the most challenging aspects of medical care. The review of antecedent literature showed a paucity of information and evidence of psychiatric morbidities amongst PLWHAS. Nevertheless, such studies were confined to South India only. Considering this as a pivot the researcher decided to undertake one such piece of research in Gujarat. The main objectives of the research undertaken were, to study the presence of psychiatric morbidities like anxiety, depression and suicide ideation in People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAS), to study their self esteem and to explore the association between HIV positive status and psychiatric morbidities with reference to age, gender, occupation, habitat and religion. The dependent variables in the study were presence of anxiety, depression, suicide ideation, quality of life and self-esteem in PLWHAS. The dependent variables were HIV positive status, age, sex, caste, rule of residence and education.
   Sample of the study was collected from four major districts of Gujarat namely Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Surat and Vadodara. The methodology consisted of both quantitative and qualitative methods. Data was collected using standardized tools like Interview Schedule, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Positive and Negative Suicide Ideation Scale (PANSI), Clinical Anxiety Scale (CAS) and World Health Organisation Quality of Life instrument (WHOQOL). Data was analysed using Frequency, Percentage Tables, Chi square and Correlation.
   Important findings revealed that anxiety score of the respondents was comparatively high according to which 69.9% fell in the category of severe anxiety. Similarly with regards to depression 52.2% i.e. 153 respondents fell in the category of severe depression while 14.7% of the respondents' i.e. 43 of them were in need of medication. This finding was alarming. Above 50% of the respondents had suicide ideation which also calls for suitable interventions. The analysis suggested that the overall Quality of Life revealed that only 2.4% of respondents had a high score, while the rest were either in moderate or low categories. With regards to medical care almost all worried about their health conditions and medical care. Among the four districts which were taken as sample by the researcher it is observed that Ahmedabad has the highest number of HIV positive patients. Majority of the respondents belonged to the age group of 30 to 39 years. This age is the most productive age in an individual's life time. Being infected at this age makes it difficult to be socially, economically as well as reproductively successful. Belonging to a Social Work profession the researcher developed intervention modalities which could be used at different stages of infection and thereby help HIV infected people to lead a normal and purposeful life.

ID SAFE STORAGE; INDIA; DEVICES; CHOICE
AB Pesticide self-poisoning is now considered one of the two most common methods of suicide worldwide. Encouraging safe storage of pesticides is one particular approach aimed at reducing pesticide self-poisoning. CropLife Sri Lanka (the local association of pesticide manufacturers), with the aid of the Department of Agriculture, distributed lockable in-house pesticide storage boxes free of charge to a farming community in a rural district of Sri Lanka. Padlocks were not provided with the boxes. These storage boxes were distributed to the farmers without prior education. The authors carried out a cross-sectional follow-up survey to assess the usage of boxes at 7 months after distribution. In an inspection of a sample of 239 box recipients' households, 142 households stored pesticides in the provided box at the time of survey. Among them, only 42 (42/142, 29.65%) households had locked the box; the remaining households (100/142, 70.4%) had not locked the box. A simple hand over of in-house pesticide storage boxes without awareness/education results in poor use of boxes. Additionally, providing in-house storage boxes may encourage farmers to store pesticides in and around houses and, if they are not locked, may lead to unplanned adverse effects.

DE Poisoning; Aluminum phosphide (AIP); Pesticides; Mortality; Phostoxin
ID SUICIDE; PESTICIDES; COUNTRIES; DEATHS; WORLD; INDIA
AB Background: Acute poisonings particularly through pesticides have become a major public health concern in Albania during the last decade.
   Findings: The number of fatalities due to aluminum phosphide intoxications was more than doubled during a five year-period from 2009 to 2013, and a cluster of suicides perpetrated with Phostoxin was registered. Several factors are accountable for such a phenomenon, including the fact that aluminum phosphide agents are freely available in the Albanian market, their price is extremely low and they are sold without any legal restriction. The mass media unfortunately warranted an emulating effect to dramatic intoxications, which gained by such means the notoriety of a secure lethal weapon.
   Conclusions: Our experience with more than three hundred intoxications with aluminum phosphide agents in the last five years, showed that a considerable delay from the moment of exposure (mainly through ingestion) to specialized medical help seeking, created a considerable obstacle for a successful treatment of cases, and eventually for the survival of patients. The lack of a specific antidote adds further challenges to all these exposures. The need for public health policies aiming at prevention, awareness, and possibly the substitution of Phostoxin or other aluminum phosphide pesticides with less dangerous agents is formulated.

AB To explore whether the 'hikikomori' syndrome (social withdrawal) described in Japan exists in other countries, and if so, how patients with the syndrome are diagnosed and treated.
   Two hikikomori case vignettes were sent to psychiatrists in Australia, Bangladesh, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the USA. Participants rated the syndrome's prevalence in their country, etiology, diagnosis, suicide risk, and treatment.
   Out of 247 responses to the questionnaire (123 from Japan and 124 from other countries), 239 were enrolled in the analysis. Respondents' felt the hikikomori syndrome is seen in all countries examined and especially in urban areas. Biopsychosocial, cultural, and environmental factors were all listed as probable causes of hikikomori, and differences among countries were not significant. Japanese psychiatrists suggested treatment in outpatient wards and some did not think that psychiatric treatment is necessary. Psychiatrists in other countries opted for more active treatment such as hospitalization.
   Patients with the hikikomori syndrome are perceived as occurring across a variety of cultures by psychiatrists in multiple countries. Our results provide a rational basis for study of the existence and epidemiology of hikikomori in clinical or community populations in international settings.

AB India enacted the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 (MHCA 2017) on April 7, 2017 to align and harmonize with United Nations Convention on Persons with Disabilities and the principles of prioritizing human rights protection. While MHCA 2017 is oriented toward the rights of the patients, the rights of the family members and professionals delivering treatment, care, and support to persons with severe mental disorder (SMD) often suffer. MHCA 2017 mandates discharge planning in consultation with the patients for admitted patients and makes the service providers responsible for ensuring continuity of care in the community. The concerns surrounding the chances of relapse and recurrence when a person with a SMD stops medications continue to remain largely unaddressed. The rights-based MHCA 2017 makes it difficult for the prevailing practices of surreptitious treatment by the family/caregiver and proxy consultations on behalf of the patients. This will, in turn, lead to increased chances of relapse, risk of violence, homelessness, stigma, and suicide in persons with SMDs in the community, largely due to noncompliance to treatment. This will also result in increased caregiver burden and burnouts and may also cause disruptions in the family and the community. To strike a balance over the current MHCA 2017, there is a need to amend or bring-forth a new law rooted in the principles of community treatment order.

   Women victims
ID SUICIDE; CLASSIFICATION; BURNS
AB The classification of cause of death is real in its consequences: for the reputation of the deceased, for her family, for those who may be implicated, and for epidemiological and social research and policies and practices that may follow from it. The study reported here refers specifically to the processes involved in classifying deaths of women from burns in India. In particular, it examines the determination of 'dowry death', a class used in India, but not in other jurisdictions. Classification of death is situated within a framework of special legal provisions intended to protect vulnerable women from dowry-related violence and abuse. The findings are based on 33 case studies tracked in hospital in real time, and interviews with 14 physicians and 14 police officers with experience of dealing with burns cases. The formal class into which any given death is allocated is shown to result from motivated accounting processes representing the interests and resources available to the doctors, victims, victim families, the victim's husband and his family, and ultimately, the police. These processes may lead to biases in research and to injustice in the treatment of victims and alleged offenders. Suggestions are made for methods of ameliorating the risks. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB OBJECTIVE Warangal district in Andhra Pradesh, southern India, records > 1000 pesticide poisoning cases each year and hundreds of deaths. We aimed to describe their frequency and distribution, and to assess quality of management and subsequent outcomes from pesticide poisoning in one large hospital in the district.
   METHODS We reviewed data on all patients admitted with pesticide poisoning to a district government hospital for the years 1997 to 2002. For 2002, details of the particular pesticide ingested and management were abstracted from the medical files.
   FINDINGS During these 6 years, 8040 patients were admitted to the hospital with pesticide poisoning. The overall case fatality ratio was 22.6%. More detailed data from 2002 revealed that two-thirds of the patients were < 30 years old, 57% were male and 96% had intentionally poisoned themselves. Two compounds, monocrotophos and endosulfan, accounted for the majority of deaths with known pesticides in 2002. Low fixed-dose regimens were used in the majority of cases for the most commonly used antidotes (atropine and pralidoxime). Inappropriate antidotes were also used in some patients.
   CONCLUSIONS It is likely that these findings reflect the situation in many rural hospitals of the Asia Pacific region. Even without an increase in resources, there appear to be significant opportunities for reducing mortality by better medical management and further restrictions on the most toxic pesticides.

AB This article evaluates the effects of terrorism on interventions into civil wars. Considering civil wars from 1970-1999, this study analyzes how the use of terrorism as a tactic affects external interventions on behalf of opposition groups, interventions on behalf of governments, and diplomatic interventions. While some authors would suggest that groups might utilize terrorism as a tactic to gain external support, this study finds little evidence that groups are actually successful in gaining such support. In fact, terrorism that targets civilians appears to actually decrease the likelihood of military interventions on behalf of opposition groups. Furthermore, in civil wars with high numbers of terrorist attacks there is a greater likelihood of economic intervention on behalf of governments, further weakening the potential benefit for groups in utilizing terrorism as a tactic. While this is certainly a welcome finding, a consideration of five case studies of suicide terrorism (Lebanon, Sri Lanka, Iraq, India, and Turkey) provides evidence that the use of suicide terrorism within civil wars may have decreased the likelihood of external interventions on behalf of the government and of diplomatic interventions. These results are more troubling and suggest potentially grave consequences for mediating many of these conflicts.

AB Objective: To describe the epidemiology and trends of traumatic deaths among children and adolescents in Manipal, Southern India.
   Methods: Analysis of all trauma deaths in children and adolescents aged between 1 and 19 years, autopsied between January 1994 and December 2005. The study is based on autopsy records, information furnished by the police, and chemical analysis report.
   Results: There has been a substantial decline in the incidence of traumatic deaths among children and adolescents during 1994 to 2005. Road traffic injuries were responsible for maximum mortalities (38.4%), followed by those because of burns (24.9%) and poisoning (15.9%). Males comprised 59.6% of cases. Male-to-female ratio was 1.5:1. Males predominantly died of traffic injuries (45.2%), whereas females as a result of burns (37.4%). There was more than two-fold increase in injury-related mortalities from childhood to adolescence (1:2.3).
   Conclusion: Among children and adolescents, traffic injuries and burns are responsible for maximum injury-related mortalities in males and females, respectively. More injury reducing measures are required for effective reduction in traumatic deaths.

AB The global problem of acute poisoning has steadily increased over the past few years. It is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Better preventive and management strategies can be developed if the incidence and pattern of acute poisoning is known. The study aims at analyzing the pattern, cause and mortality rate of poisoning.
   The study was conducted in a rural area in South India. This retrospective study was conducted from January 2003-December 2003. The data was analysed using descriptive statistics.
   Out of the 225 cases 139 were males and 86 females. Poisoning was common in the age group of 2130 years which was 84 cases and 11-20 years was 73 cases. The poisons consumed were as follows: Organophosphorous 135 cases, aluminum and zinc phosphide 50 cases, phenobarbitone 18 cases, benzodiazepines 7 cases, paracetamol 2 cases, miscellaneous 13 cases. 94% were suicides and 6% accidental. Mortality rate was 12.8%.
   Establishment of strict policies against the sale and availability of pesticides and over the counter drugs is an effective way to control organophosphorous and drug poisoning. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study compares the effectiveness of audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (Audio-CASI) with face-to-face interviews and self-administered questionnaires in collecting sensitive information on risky sexual and other behaviors among young men in urban India. A randomized study design compared data collected from 900 male college students using the three data-collection approaches and from 600 young men residing in slums using Audio-CASI and face-to-face interviews. Among the college students, the reported prevalence of risky behaviors was generally higher for young men interviewed through the Audio-CASI approach than with face-to-face interviews; self-administered questionnaires failed to yield significantly higher estimates than face-to-face interviews. Among the slum residents, the results were more mixed, the Audio-CASI approach failed to yield consistently higher responses for many risky behaviors compared with the face-to-face interview mode. The results demonstrate that although Audio-CASI appears to yield higher estimates of risky behavior among college-educated, computer-literate populations of young men, the efficacy of this approach among less-educated and less computer-literate populations appears more doubtful.

DE Food; sovereignty; security; policy; India
AB In July 2013, India passed a Food Security Ordinance designed to guarantee cheap grain for the poor - about two-thirds of the population. This was largely in belated recognition of levels of child malnutrition exceeding that of the whole of Africa. This massive food insecurity has been the flip-side of spectacular economic growth, largely in urban areas, which has created one of the largest middle-classes in the world. The policies which enabled this growth reversed decades of previous policy prioritising national food production and rural development. Other consequences have included corporatisation and neoliberalisation' of agriculture and widespread agrarian distress' manifesting most dramatically in epidemic levels of farmer suicides. One of the few exceptions to this pattern has been the foothills of the Himalayas, where agriculture has been relatively insulated from these changes and food sovereignty has remained largely in the hands of local communities. But this has not been without challenges of economic under-development, outmigration, environmental degradation and most recently the floods of June 2013. This article argues that the cultural ecologies of the hills provide a model and foundation for rural development based on traditional agriculture and local food sovereignty.

TI Poisoning: An unnatural cause of morbidity and mortality in rural India
SO JOURNAL OF ASSOCIATION OF PHYSICIANS OF INDIA

DT Article
AB Background : Ninety-nine percent of fatal poisonings occur in developing countries, particularly among agricultural workers. In a particular area, it is important to known the magnitude and pattern of acute poisonings, as it is important for early diagnosis and treatment and also for preventive measures.
   Methods : Hospital records of all unnatural causes of deaths were reviewed at Shri Vasantrao Naik Government Medical College, Yavatmal, Maharashtra during the five years period, 1997-2001. Autopsy records in fatal poisonings were studied for age, sex, residence, marital status, type of poison and manner of poisoning (accidental, suicidal or homicidal). Admission and, death rates of acute poisonings were compared with those from other unnatural causes.
   Results : Acute poisoning is the leading most cause of unnatural deaths and third common cause of emergency hospitalizations in this rural part of India. Of all fatal cases, 67% were males, 63% married, 83% with rural residence and 63.4% suicides. Responsible, poison could not be ascertained in 16% of clinical and 9.9% of fatal cases. Insecticides were responsible for 35% of clinical and 55.4% of fatal cases.
   Conclusions : Young married males of rural background with agricultural occupation and failure of monsoon are the risk factors associated with poisoning cases.

AB This article analyses the impact of agricultural liberalisation on different farming classes in the region of Telangana in South India. The region has been witnessing significant growth in real agricultural output over the last 15 years. At the same time, as NSS (National Sample Survey) household survey data indicate, there have been significant welfare declines not only for marginal farmers and landless labour, but for other groups as well. There have also been more than a thousand farmer suicides between 1998 and 2002. I argue in this article that during the liberalisation period, that is, post 1990, agricultural growth and increased distress have become mutually intertwined. I use the terms, growth-inducing distress and distress-inducing growth to explain this apparent paradox.

Out of 1917 cases autopsied, 21.2% were deaths due to deliberate self harm (I)SH). The male sex (66.1%) and victims in the third decade of life (35.9%) predominated. More than two-thirds of the decedents were married. More fatalities were observed during the winter season (35.8%) and in the day time (62.2%). Dispair with life (61.9%) was the most common motive for FDSH. The majority of fatalities were due to poisoning (73.5%), where organophosphorous compounds topped the list (71.9%). About one-third of the victims survived for 18 to 24 hours after DSH.

We report two cases of Abrus precatorius poisoning with raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and papilledema that have not been described earlier in literature. One patient recovered completely with conservative management to lower raised ICP while the other patient expired before effective treatment could be institutedd. The cases are being reported to propose the need for routine fundus examination and brain imaging in severe abrus poisoning with CNS toxicity, as early institution of treatment for cerebral edema measures may be life saving.

AB Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), Chandigarh undertakes the examination of the crime cases of some northern states of India. The shooting cases of last two decades (1980-1999) involving shotguns were analysed in this laboratory. This paper consists of the study of 360 actual cases of shotguns for evaluation of various parameters, such as type of firearm, number of firearm and firing, location of wound, age, occupation, sex and caste of accused and victim, etc. Out of 360 cases, 253 (70%) were classified as homicidal, 68 (19%) accidental, 11 (3%) suicidal, 9 (2.5%) hunting and 19 (5.5%) cases of insufficient information including the cases of illegal possession of firearm. Single Barrel Breech Loading (SBBL) gun 144 (40%) was preferred over Single Barrel Muzzle Loading (SBML) 109 (30.3%), Double Barrel Breech Loading (DBBL) 72 (20%) and Double Barrel Muzzle Loading (DBML) gun 35 (9.7%). All the breechloader guns were of 12 bore. Muzzleloader gun were recovered only from the remote rural areas. Three hundred and thirty-one (92%) cases involved single, 22 (6%) double and 7 (2%) more than two shotgun. Majority of cases were found of single firing 288 (80%), followed by double 29 (8%) and multifiring 18 (5%). Eleven (3%) cases were of misfiring and in 14 (4%) cases information was not available. Accidental and suicidal cases had only one firing. The mean age for male and female victim was 31 and 24 years, respectively. Occupationally, agriculture is predominating over business, service and security guards for accused and for victim agriculture followed by service, business, student and security guards are in the descending order. Caste wise the most aggressive community of Kshatriyas is predominating as accused and victim over lower cast people. Head (64%) being a vital part was chosen most frequently for committing suicide followed by body (36%). Service personnel committed maximum number of suicide. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Citrus reticulate Blanco is most common among Citrus fruits grown in India. It occupies nearly 40% of the total area under Citrus cultivation in India. Citrus industry in India is the third largest fruit industry of the ranking ninth among top orange producing countries contributing 3% of the world's total orange production of the world. Vidarbha region from the Maharashtra state of India is known to the entire world for its awesome quality of Mandarin oranges. This wealth of Central India is now turning to the weakness; entire economy based on orange produce is slowly declining over the past few decades. Owing to the crisis, the suffering farmers are committing suicides. The present investigation is an attempt to find out the root cause of the decline in cultivation and production in terms of quality as well as quantity and as also of devising suitable strategy to increase the yield. For the purpose of the study ten sites have been identified. The most important reasons threatening the orchard production is the irrigation practice that is conventionally adopted by the farmers. The study tries to probe the objectives to determine the soil quality by analysing the water chemistry, the daily water requirement of the soil and planning for the requisite irrigation on the basis of soil condition. An investigation has revealed that, the off beat irrigation leads to the deterioration of the soil quality, as a long term effect. The soil analysis therein showed signs of salt accumulation in the effective root zone and the pH of the soil became basic. Other Physico-chemical parameters analysed were EC, WHC, Infiltration Rate, Soil Texture, Na, K, Ca, Mg, and Organic Matter. Ideally the Citrus crop requires acidic or neutral soil for the optimum performance of the plant. Daily Water Requirement (DWR) depending on the soil features, effective root zone, Readily Available Water (RAW) and rate of evaporation have been determined. The soil with available chemistry, RAW (50-60 mm), DWR (131.32-84.00 lt), the evaporation rate (10-14 mm) was recorded and reported to schedule irrigation. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Mental disorders such as depression, anxiety and suicide represent an important public health problem in India. Elsewhere in the world a high prevalence of symptoms of common mental disorders have been found among people who inject drugs (PWID). Research in India has largely overlooked symptoms of common mental disorders among this high risk group. This paper reports on the results of a survey examining quality of life, depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation among adult males who inject drugs living in Delhi.
   Methods: Participants (n = 420) were recruited from needle and syringe programs using time location sampling and were interviewed using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Self-report symptom scales were used to measure the severity of symptoms of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-2) within the preceding 2 weeks. We assessed the presence of suicidal thoughts and attempts within the past 12 months.
   Results: The mean length of injecting career was 20.9 years indicating a sample of chronic injecting drug users, of whom only one-third (38%) were born in Delhi. The level of illiteracy was very high (62%), and just 2% had completed class 12. Scavenging / rag picking was the main form of income for 48%, and many were homeless (69%). One-third (33%) had been beaten up at least twice during the preceding 6 months, and many either never (45%) or rarely (27%) attended family events. We found a high prevalence of depressive (84%, cut-off >= 10) and anxiety (71%, cut-off score of >= 3) symptoms. Fifty-three percent thought about killing themselves in the past 12 months, and 36% had attempted to kill themselves.
   Conclusions: Our findings revealed a socially excluded population of PWID in Delhi who have minimal education and are often homeless, leaving them vulnerable to physical violence, poverty, poor health, imprisonment and disconnection from family. The high prevalence of psychological distress found in this study has implications for programmes seeking to engage, treat and rehabilitate PWID in India.

ID COUNTRIES
AB Background: Mental Health is an emerging problem in the world, particularly in the developing countries like India, which is a big challenge for the sustainable human development. Health is a vital requirement for sustainable human development, and there can be no health without mental health. The role of mental health is very important in accomplishing social inclusion and equity. It also plays a vital role in acquiring Universal Health Coverage (UHC), access to justice and human rights, and sustainable economic development. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health is not only the absence of disease but it implicates the physical, social, spiritual and mental health. (1) Since primordial eras, India, has emphasized on the health of its citizens and has underlined the need for a physically and mentally healthy society. In the new SDGs, the UN has lastly demarcated that mental health is one of the most universal development precedence, and set the scene for an ambitious plan to tackle the world's challenges in the coming 15 years. WHO has also projected two indicators to strengthen mental health in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are fully aligned with the WHO Global Mental Health Action plan, both within the health goal: suicide rate; and service coverage (proportion treated) of persons with severe mental illness.(2) Aims & Objectives The main thrust of this paper was to explore the frequency and pattern of mental disorder and its impact on families or household. This paper also analyzed the mental morbidity rate and its cause in India. Material & Methods: Paper is based on secondary data. Results: The findings demonstrated that 13.7 per cent of India's general population has various mental disorders; 10.6 per cent of them need instant mediations. Whereas, almost 10 per cent of the population has common mental disorders, 1.9 per cent of the masses suffer from severe mental disorders. The result shows that the frequency of schizophrenia is more in urban metros then rural counterparts.

AB Background: Injuries are considered as an emerging public health problem in India. Globally every year, injuries kill more than 5 million people, and by 2020, injuries will be the third-leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The study aimed to assess the prevalence and characteristics of nonfatal home injuries among the elderly in Tamil Nadu. Methodology: A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted among 1139 elderly (60 years and above), sampled from three districts of Tamil Nadu, India. Probability proportional to size sampling technique was used for sampling; a pretested questionnaire was used to collect the data. Results: Prevalence of nonfatal home injuries among elderly within the past 1 year was 14.6% (12.5-16.7 at 95% confidence interval), (n = 1003), among those injured, 94.5% were unintentionally injured and 5.5% were of intentional nature. When classified according to the types of injuries, majority of them had fall injuries (6.7%) followed by minor domestic injuries (5.4%), animal-related injury (0.2%), burn injuries (1.1%), road traffic injury (0.4%), and suicide attempt (0.8%). Majority of the respondents were in the age group of young-old, 60-69 years of age (84%), and there was more number of males (55%) in the study. Conclusion: The study reveals that nonfatal home injuries among elderly are an emerging public health problem, unintentional injuries contribute to the majority of the injuries, fall was the single largest contributor for all injuries among elderly.

DE Mountain agriculture; Agrarian crisis; Lopsided growth; Hybrid economy
AB Over the past quarter century Indian economy and society have been transformed, qualitatively as well as quantitatively. On one hand there has been sustained economic growth, but on the other growing inequality (D'Costa, Ray in this volume). Redressing these inequalities is the key development challenge now facing India. A key dimension of this transformation has been a shift of the centre of gravity of the economy to the manufacturing and especially services sectors, creating a huge and growing urban middle class, increasingly cut off from the agrarian traditions of their forebears. Nevertheless, agriculture remains the main livelihood of over half the population, and India is still a major agricultural producer. The challenge of redressing this specific imbalance is the focus of this chapter. Since the 1960s, agriculture has itself been transformed technologically and economically. The results have ranged from the growth of successful multinational corporations to multi-suicides of small farmers, from new commercial crops to environmental degradation. Indian agriculture is now poised between two futures-one of increasing technology-driven intensification and integration into national and global markets-the other a neo-Gandhian vision of local communities renewed by ecologically based forms of small-fanning producing for more local consumption. This chapter reflects on the development challenge posed by this critical moment, through the lens of a point where these alternative visions meet and interact-the dynamic border-zone between the irrigated plains and the foothills and valleys of the Himalayas, where old varieties and practices meet global export markets.

AB Background: The complex intersections between non-suicidal self-injurious (NSSI) behaviours; like cutting, burning or self-hitting, and suicide attempts, are an important domain of enquiry among vulnerable adolescents and young adults. A cross-sectional survey in urban schools and colleges assessed the rates of self-injurious behaviour among Indian adolescents and young adults. Predictors of NSSI and of self-injurious behaviours with associated suicidal intent, were also examined.
   Participants and methods: The sample comprised 1571 male and female students, from 19 private and government aided high schools, pre-university colleges and undergraduate colleges in an urban city in South India. Participants completed the Functional Assessment of Self-Mutilation which assesses the methods, characteristics and functions of self-injurious acts in the past 12 months. The measures of psychopathology included the Youth Self-Report and the Young-Adult Self-Report.
   Results and conclusion: The results indicated that rate of NSSI was 33.8%, with minor forms of self-injury reported more often (19.4%) than the moderate/severe forms (14.6%). A smaller proportion (6.8%) reported self-injurious acts with associated suicidal intent. Certain self-injury characteristics and levels of internalizing and externalizing problems differentiated self-injuring youth with and without suicidal intent. Logistic regression analyses identified predictors of any self-injurious behaviour and of self-injury associated with suicidal intent. The implications for assessment and intervention frameworks for self-injuring youth are discussed.

AB India's new mental health legislation, the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, was commenced on 29 May 2018 and seeks explicitly to comply with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It grants a legally binding right to mental healthcare to over 1.3 billion people, one sixth of the planet's population. Key measures include (a) new definitions of 'mental illness' and 'mental health establishment'; (b) revised consideration of 'capacity' in relation to mental healthcare (c) 'advance directives' to permit persons with mental illness to direct future care; (d) 'nominated representatives', who need not be family members; (e) the right to mental healthcare and broad social rights for the mentally ill; (f) establishment of governmental authorities to oversee services; (g) Mental Health Review Boards to review admissions and other matters; (h) revised procedures for 'independent admission' (voluntary admission), 'supported admission' (admission and treatment without patient consent), and 'admission of minor'; (i) revised rules governing treatment, restraint and research; and (j) de facto decriminalization of suicide. Key challenges relate to resourcing both mental health services and the new structures proposed in the legislation, the appropriateness of apparently increasingly legalized approaches to care (especially the implications of potentially lengthy judicial proceedings), and possible paradoxical effects resulting in barriers to care (e.g. revised licensing requirements for general hospital psychiatry units). There is ongoing controversy about specific measures (e.g. the ban on electro-convulsive therapy without muscle relaxants and anaesthesia), reflecting a need for continued engagement with stakeholders including patients, families, the Indian Psychiatric Society and non-governmental organisations. Despite these challenges, the new legislation offers substantial potential benefits not only to India but, by example, to other countries that seek to align their laws with the United Nations' Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and improve the position of the mentally ill.

DE Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; death wish; Wish-to-Die Questionnaire
ID END-OF-LIFE; ALS; HOPELESSNESS; DETERMINANTS; ATTITUDES; SUICIDE; IMPACT
AB Aims: In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), death wish is expressed in a varying proportion of patients in different countries. In this first study from India, influence of belief system of religion/spirituality and attitude towards death, widely prevalent in the country, in decision making, was evaluated.
   Material and Methods: Twenty ALS patients were assessed using 'Wish-to-Die Questionnaire' (WDQ) developed to reflect seven domains, namely religion/spirituality, belief in karma, meaning of life, hope, family support, financial support and death wish. Functional impairment, depression, hopelessness and suicidal ideation were assessed by ALS Functional Rating Scale, Beck's Depression Inventory, Beck Hopelessness Scale and The Scale of Suicidal Ideation, respectively.
   Results: On WDQ, all the 20 patients had belief in religion/spirituality, had hope and family support. Nineteen patients (95%) believed in karma, 16 (80%) still found life meaningful and 15 (75%) had financial support. Six patients (30%) had mild to moderate depression; hopelessness was present in 6 (30%) and suicidal ideation was present in one (5%). The 5 (25%) patients who expressed death wish did not significantly differ from others in 6 domains (religion/spirituality, belief in karma, meaning of life, hope, family support, financial support) of WDQ. The main reason in 3 patients who expressed death wish was lack of financial support. The fourth patient could not find meaning of life after the onset of illness, and the fifth wished to end his life since he had satisfactorily fulfilled all his responsibilities.
   Conclusion: Smaller proportion of patients of ALS expressed death wish in India compared to the Western countries. This may be attributed to belief in religion/spirituality and karma, having meaning of life and family support. As this is the first report from India, useful information may be obtained if similar studies are done on a larger sample.

AB VISHRAM is a community-based mental health program to address psycho-social distress and risk factors for suicide in a predominantly rural population in Central India, through targeted interventions for the prevention and management of Depression and Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD). The evaluation was designed to assess the impact of program on the contact coverage of evidence-based treatments for depression and AUD through a repeated survey design. This paper describes the baseline prevalence of depression among adults in rural community, association of various demographic and socio-economic factors with depression and estimates contact coverage and costs of care for depression.
   Population-based cross-sectional survey of adults in 30 villages of Amravati district in Vidarbha region of Central India. The outcome of interest was a probable diagnosis of depression which was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Data were analyzed using simple and multiple logistic regression.
   The outcome of current depression (PHQ-9 a parts per thousand yen 10) was observed in 14.6 % of the sample (95 % CI 12.8-16.4 %). The contact coverage for current depression was only 4.3 % (95 % CI 1.5-7.1 %). Prevalence of depression varied greatly between the two sites of the study; higher age, female gender, lower education, economic status below poverty line and indebtedness were associated with depression; and while a contact coverage with formal health care was very low, a large proportion of affected persons had consulted family members.
   Our findings clearly indicate that psycho-social distress in rural communities in Maharashtra is strongly associated with social determinants such as gender, poverty and indebtedness and affects the entire population and not just farmers.

AB Women's mental health is closely linked to their status in society. This paper outlines the clinical features of women with schizophrenia and highlights the interpersonal and social ramifications on their lives. There is no significant gender difference in the incidence and prevalence of schizophrenia. There is no clear trend in mortality, although suicides seem to be more in women with schizophrenia. In India, women face a lot of problems, especially in relation to marriage, pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause. Most studies have shown better premorbid functioning, and social adjustment for women compared with men. There is a great need to plan for gender-sensitive mental health services targeting the special needs of these women. Women caregivers also deserve due attention.

TI Evaluation of acceptability and use of lockable storage devices for
   pesticides in Sri Lanka that might assist in prevention of
   self-poisoning
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID UNINTENTIONAL INJURY; SAFE STORAGE; SUICIDE; INDIA
AB Background: Self-poisoning with pesticides is a major reason for high suicide rates in rural areas of many developing countries. Safer storage of pesticides may be one means of prevention. We have conducted a study to assess the acceptability and use of lockable boxes for storing pesticides in rural Sri Lanka.
   Methods: Four hundred lockable metal storage boxes were given to farming households, 100 in each of four villages. Assessment interviews were conducted by Sumithrayo (NGO) field workers immediately after boxes were supplied (T1), 11-14 weeks later (T2), 30 weeks later (T3), and 18 months later (T4). Data on suicide and self-harm were collected from local police and hospitals.
   Results: At T1 only 1.8% (7/396) of households reported locking up pesticides, 72.5% (279/385) easy access to pesticides for adults and 50.4% (195/387) easy access for children. At T3 most informants in households using pesticides reported using the box all (82.3%, 298/362) or most of the time (7.2%, 26/362). Informants usually reported always locking the box (92.8%, 336/362) and most boxes were locked on inspection (93.6%, 339/362). By T4 there was some reduction in reporting that the box was kept locked all of the time (75.2%, 267/355) and the box being locked on inspection (73.8%, 262/355). Easy child access to the key was reported in relatively few households (10.7% at T4), although interviewers judged that this was possible in rather more (20.6%). Most informants regarded the box as useful (100% at T3 and 99.4% at T4), with convenience for storage, security, avoiding wastage, and protection of children being major factors. A message on the box about how to deal with bad feelings and the importance of safer storage was well received. The locks had been broken or the key lost in a few households.
   Conclusion: Introduction of lockable boxes for storing pesticides to farming households in Sri Lanka appeared to be acceptable. Most households used the boxes responsibly, although there was some decline in the proper usage over time. A large-scale trial of lockable storage devices in farming households in rural areas as a means of prevention of suicide and accidental poisoning is now indicated.

AB These studies were undertaken to determine the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of suicide gene therapy using adenoviral-mediated herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (ADV/RSV-tk) and the prodrug ganciclovir (GCV) in an orthotopic murine bladder cancer model. We utilized a replication-defective adenoviral construct containing the beta -galactosidase gene as a control and the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene as the therapeutic vector under the transcription control of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat promoter. Intravesically created, orthotopic bladder tumors were established in syngeneic C3H/He female mice. India ink injection and beta -galactosidase studies were performed to determine if transurethral administration, direct tumor injection, or the combination was the most efficient route of virus administration. Optimal dosing of ADV/RsV-tk was determined by direct tumor injection with increasing viral doses and treatment with GCV. Treatment efficacy, long-term survival, and toxicity were determined in separate but similar controlled experiments. Growth curve studies demonstrated reliable tumor formation by 14 days. Direct transvesical tumor injection resulted in the best distribution and intratumor gene expression as measured by X-gal staining. Dose-ranging experiments demonstrated an optimal viral dose of 5 x 10(8) plaque-forming units and a greater than twofold reduction in tumor growth for the animals treated with ADV/RsV-tk compared to controls. Efficacy studies demonstrated a greater than threefold reduction in tumor growth. No clinical or gross pathologic toxicity was detected. Long-term survival results suggested a survival benefit for the treatment animals compared to controls. We conclude that ADV/RsV-tk in combination with GCV provides effective therapy for orthotopic murine bladder cancer by significantly inhibiting tumor growth with limited toxicity to the host. These data provide further support for testing this suicide gene therapy strategy in human Phase I trials.

AB This paper compares the key findings from the first piece of research in the UK to focus exclusively on 'stress, support and well-being of social work students' (n = 76), with findings from a cohort of Indian social work students studying in the Tamil Nadu region in Southern India (n = 235), using the same questionnaire. This comparative international study highlights a range of differences in the key outcome variables, namely British students reported significantly higher levels of demands and significantly lower levels of support than their Indian counterparts; however, despite the lower levels of demands and higher levels of support reported by Indian students, they had significantly poorer well-being than their British counterparts. In the Indian study, there were no significant correlations between the main outcome variables of demands, support and well-being; however, in the British study, support was negatively correlated with well-being (measured using the GHQ-12), indicating that those who reported higher levels of support also reported better well-being. This study draws particular attention to the potentially differing contexts of 'support' amongst both groups, and raises questions concerning the challenges of using questionnaires to capture culturally specific stressors and support mechanisms.

AB Purpose: Globally, adolescents are at risk of depression, traumatic stress, and suicide, especially those living in vulnerable environments. This article examines the mental health of 15- to 19-year-old youth in five cities and identifies the social support correlates of mental health.
   Methods: A total of 2,393 adolescents aged 15-19 years in economically distressed neighborhoods in Baltimore, MD; New Delhi, India; Ibadan, Nigeria; Johannesburg, South Africa; and Shanghai, China were recruited in 2013 via respondent-driven sampling to participate in a survey using an audio computer-assisted self-interview. Weighted logistic regression and general linear models were used to explore the associations between mental health and social supports.
   Results: The highest levels of depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms were displayed in Johannesburg among females (44.6% and 67.0%, respectively), whereas the lowest were among New Delhi females andmales (13.0% and 16.3%, respectively). The prevalence of suicidal ideation ranged from 7.9% (New Delhi female adolescents) to 39.6% (Johannesburg female adolescents); the 12-month prevalence of suicide attempts ranged from 1.8% (New Delhi females) to 18.3% (Ibadan males). Elevated perceptions of having a caring female adult in the home and feeling connected to their neighborhoods were positively associated with adolescents' levels of hope across the sites while negatively associated with depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms with some variation across sites and gender.
   Conclusions: Adolescents living in the very economically distressed areas studied register high levels of depression and posttraumatic stress. Improving social supports in families and neighborhoods may alleviate distress and foster hope. In particular, strengthening supports from female caretakers to their adolescents at home may improve the outlooks of their daughters. (C) 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

AB On cotton farms in Telangana, India, performance draws attention to farmers' work not merely as an economic activity but as directed toward different kinds of audiences and in conversation with different roles, stages, and scripts. Importantly, this performance is contextualized by a neoliberal seed market where a seasonal deluge of accelerated and consumerist seed marketing diminishes the value of experiential knowledge in favor of the expansion of private genetically modified (GM) seed sales. This article draws on mixed methods and qualitative fieldwork conducted between 2012 and 2016 on cotton farms in Telangana to explore the use of "scripts" in rural life: the learned and socially mediated mental maps that reflect sets of rules, values, patterns, or expectations in smallholder commercial agriculture. The script of manci digubadi (good yield) helps order and justify GM cottonseed decision making in rural Telangana, where seed knowledge is uncertain, environmental feedback is ambiguous, and social emulation dominates farmer choices. While being cautious not to present performance in such a way that questions authenticity or presupposes either fatalism or economic rationalism, I argue that scripts help farmers navigate cotton agriculture amid uncertain GM cottonseed markets and the anxieties and aspirations of neoliberal rural India.

DE Depression; Community mental health; Care; Elderly; South Asia
ID PSYCHIATRY; IDENTITY
AB Depression has become a major public health concern in Kerala, South India. Media and mental health professionals often attribute the rise of depression and suicide to a discontent around modern transformations and the flipside of the "Kerala model of development". Kerala's primary health care system of health governance, surveillance and care with its backbone of community and multi-purpose health workers is currently being expanded to target inner feelings, emotional suffering and existential despair, as a result of complex global, national and local processes of making visible and stabilizing depression as a public health category. Rather than relying on NGOs and foreign funding, mental health policy planners in Kerala engage the state of Kerala. Using the case of a junior health inspector's counseling, I argue that the reconfiguration of suffering from an existential part of life and symptom of adversity into a medical condition can also lead to mobilization of (gendered) care in a context of familial marginalization and neglect. In this context, individual bodies are healed by restoring social bodies. Medicalization does not necessarily silence social inequalities and marginalization but can become productive in providing an idiom to critique a family's moral economy.

AB Background. Violence against women may have an impact on infant and child mortality. We aimed to determine whether domestic violence is a risk factor for infant and child death.
   Methods. Eighty infant and child deaths (under 5 years of age) were identified from a central register of a comprehensive community health programme in rural southern India; controls were matched for age, gender and street of residence.
   Results. Domestic violence during the lifetime (OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.39-4.99), which was severe (OR 4.00, 95% CI 2.02-7.94) and during pregnancy (OR 5.69, 95% CI 2.03-15.93) and father's smoking status (OR 3.81, 95% CI 1.92-7.55) were significantly related to infant and child death while immunization being completed for age (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01-0.19) and having at least one boy child in the family (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.14-0.59) were protective. These variables remained statistically significantly associated with outcome after adjusting for other determinants using conditional logistic regression.
   Conclusion. There is evidence for an association between domestic violence in mothers, and infant and child death.

AB Groundwater is one of the most challenging common pool resources to govern, resulting in resource depletion in many areas. We present an innovative use of collective action games to not only measure propensity for cooperation, but to improve local understanding of groundwater interrelationships and stimulate collective governance of groundwater, based on a pilot study in Andhra Pradesh, India. The games simulate crop choice and consequences for the aquifer. These were followed by a community debriefing, which provided an entry point for discussing the interconnectedness of groundwater use, to affect mental models about groundwater. A slightly modified game was played in the same communities, one year later. Our study finds communication within the game increased the likelihood of groups reaching sustainable extraction levels in the second year of play, but not the first. Individual payments to participants based on how they played in the game had no effect on crop choice. Either repeated experience with the games or the revised structure of the game evoked more cooperation in the second year, outweighing other factors influencing behavior, such as education, gender, and trust index scores. After the games were played, a significantly higher proportion of communities adopted water registers and rules to govern groundwater, compared to other communities in the same NGO water commons program. Because groundwater levels are affected by many factors, games alone will not end groundwater depletion. However, games can contribute to social learning about the role of crop choice and collective action, to motivate behavior change toward more sustainable groundwater extraction.

ID VIOLENCE; ABUSE
AB Eve teasing was identified as a significant community problem through a community-based participatory process with nine villages in Punjab, India. Eve teasing is a common euphemism in South Asia for sexual harassment of women in public areas by men. The purpose of this study was to characterize the meaning of eve teasing in the rural context, especially among female youth, and to develop a means to measure its occurrence. Mixed methods were utilized including focus group discussions (FGDs), semistructured interviews, and direct observation of questionnaire administration. Thirty-four people participated in six FGDs; two with adolescent boys (n = 10), two with adolescent girls (n = 15), and two with women ages 20 to 26 years (n = 9). Eighty-nine females, ages 14 to 26 years, were recruited through purposive sampling for face-to-face interviews in homes and schools. Twenty-four interviews were observed directly to aid questionnaire development. Eve teasing was described as staring, stalking, passing comments, and inappropriate physical touch. Perceived consequences of eve teasing included tight restrictions on girls' mobility, inability to attend school or work, girls being blamed, and causing family problems. FGD participants suggested that eve teasing can lead to depression and suicide. Among the 36 (40.4%) interview participants who reported eve teasing, 61.1% reported feelings of anger, 47.2% reported feelings of shame or humiliation, and more than one third reported feelings of fear, worry, or tension. The questionnaire offers a means to assess the occurrence of eve teasing that is culturally relevant and age appropriate for female youth in India.

AB Agriculture in India is eminently prone to danger like natural calamities, droughts, floods, etc. It is very crucial to safeguard the farmers from natural disasters and to safeguard their credit eligibility for the next approaching season. For this objective, the GOI (Government of India) has introduced several agricultural schemes throughout the country for the benefit of the farmers. With the growing technology and internet services the information related to the different government agricultural schemes are now available on internet in the form of websites and mobile apps. But enormous population of farmers in our country are uneducated and do not know how to access or view the information given on the website or in the app due to the language barrier. Thousands of farmers in India are killing themselves on their devastated field. This is not just because the weather gods have been cruel; but it is also because the safety from such climatic hazard, in terms of crop insurance, has failed the farmer when he needed it the most. The suicides of farmers that are being reported across the country undoubtedly indicate that these government schemes have not found enough takers. This is not only because of the language barrier and illiteracy of the farmers; it is also because of the poor usability of the websites which provide different agricultural information including the information of government schemes. So, the motivation of this research is to provide the farmers of our country with easy to use website and mobile app for their benefit so that they can get all the information related to agricultural government schemes.

AB Although India's cotton sector has been penetrated by various input- and capital-intensive methods, penetration by herbicide has been largely stymied. In Telangana State, the main obstacle has been the practice of 'double-lining', in which cotton plants are spaced widely to allow weeding by ox-plow. Path dependency theory primarily explains the persistence of sub-optimal practices, but double-lining is an example of an advantageous path for cash-poor farmers. However, it is being actively undermined by parties intent on expanding herbicide markets and opening a niche for next-generation genetically modified cotton. We use the case to explicate the role of treadmills in technology 'lock-in'. We also examine how an adaptive locked-in path may be broken by external interests, drawing on recent analyses of 'didactic' learning by farmers.

SO ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL JUSTICE: AN INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE
SE Research in Social Problems and Public Policy
LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
AB Purpose - The globally controversial genetically modified (GM) cotton has been adopted widely by Indian farmers. Claiming the adoption to be a success of the GM technology, the GM proponents call for a large-scale introduction of GM crops in Indian agriculture. Opposition to GM crops is largely constructed in terms of the environmental risks that GM technologies pose to crop and forest biodiversity. This chapter examines the economic and political context in which these seeds were adopted to see if adequate support mechanisms were available to farmers to facilitate adoption of the new technology.
   Design/methodology/approach - A field study was conducted in Vidharbha, Eastern Maharashtra. In addition, government reports and newspaper articles were reviewed and interviews were conducted in Maharashtra and Delhi.
   Findings - This chapetr finds that the problems faced by farmers are much deeper than what technology can solve or which have been addressed in the GM debate. Cotton farmers face persistent problems in the agricultural production process that increase their production costs. A spate of farmer's suicides in Vidharbha and other rain-fed regions of India epitomizes the dire conditions farmers are in. This chapter asserts that state-supported policies transformed India from a food importing to a food surplus country in the 1960s during the green revolution. However, GM cotton has been introduced without a supportive infrastructure for technology transfer in Maharashtra and most cotton-growing states. The lack of support makes the gain of cotton farmers in Vidharbha from the new technology highly uncertain.
   Originality/value - This analysis shows the need to examine the role of government programs in helping farmers implement technological advances in agriculture.

DT Article
DE Behavioral emergencies; Emergency psychiatry; Suicide
AB Behavioral emergencies constitute an important but neglected part of emergencies seen worldwide in both emergency departments and by emergency services. Yet research on behavioral emergencies in India has been scarce.
   The study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of acute behavioral problems as an emergency attended by our emergency management service-108 services. During the period of August 1st 2007-July 31st 2008, all behavioral emergencies presenting to our emergency services in the states of Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, which together account for more than 15% of India's population, were reviewed for data completeness and validity. Key word analysis of recorded case details was carried out to determine cause of emergency. Survival to hospital and 48-h outcome was also evaluated to study risk factors for mortality.
   A total of 40,541 cases of behavioral emergencies were recorded, in which the male:female ratio was 1.3:1. Most victims were in the 20 and 30 years (42%), from a poor socio-economic background (93%), rural area (74.3%), and backward caste (42.6%). Suicidal attempts, whether in the form of poisoning (60.5%) or otherwise (30.7%) was the most common emergency, followed by acute psychiatric causes (4%) and alcohol intoxication (3%). Victims, who met a fatal outcome, were more likely to be male (p = 0.02), having a better socio-economic condition (p < 0.001) and older (p < 0.001).
   Suicidal attempts, which form the largest chunk of behavioral emergencies, need to be tackled on a war-footing, given the sensitivity it deserves. Acute psychiatric emergencies, which form about 9% of all emergencies, require the emerging role of emergency psychiatric services.

AB Para-phenylenediamine is widely used as a chemical in hair dyes and in combination with henna. This dye is used to paint the body for decorative reasons, to speed the processing time of henna and to intensify the results. Para-phenylenediamine is widely used in the Middle East, North Africa and India. Several reports have been published of the fatal ingestion of hair dye containing para-phenylenediamine. Here, we describe the case of a 14-year-old girl who ingested the compound but whose prompt treatment prevented her death. Ingestion of para-phenylenediamine produces a typical triad of angioneurotic oedema, rhabdomyolysis and acute tubular necrosis. Awareness of signs of these associated conditions in our patient, together with a comprehensive history, facilitated appropriate treatment to be instituted. We document the steps we took to enable her complete physical recovery.

These two nuclear states are responsible for a situation that has been ongoing for 70 years: hundreds of people lose their lives every year, suicide attacks frequently occur, state forces apply disproportionate interventions, and the community is oppressed. The UN Security Council, which is primarily responsible for protecting international peace and security, adopted Resolution (47) during its first years of existence. This resolution provides detailed content for direct resolution of the Kashmir problem. For example, the resolution includes the plan for Kashmir to first be cleared of the military, and then the final situation of Jammu-Kashmir should be determined on the basis of the plebiscite application under UN supervision. Unfortunately, despite the plan, the resolution was not implemented due to disruptions in the UN system.

AB This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of pesticide poisoning in Jiangsu Province, China, and to provide a scientific basis for developing effective interventional measures and preventive strategies. From 2006 to 2015, a total of 35,308 cases of pesticide poisoning were reported in Jiangsu Province. Non-occupational poisoning accounted for 73.79% of all poisoning cases. A comparison of the data collected before (2006) and after (2015) this study showed a decrease in non-occupational pesticide poisoning. Pesticide poisoning showed an age central tendency of 30 to 44 years, area central tendency for northern Jiangsu, and seasonal central tendency of occupational pesticide poisoning in autumn. Pesticide poisoning remains a major health concern in China. Government agencies together with scientists should focus their efforts on the prevention of potential threats to vulnerable groups such as the elderly, women, and children.

ID FRESH-FROZEN PLASMA; DEFICIENCY
AB Organophosphorus (OP) pesticides are commonly used in agricultural fields to control pests in India. However, exposure to it can cause poisoning in humans and animals, or it can be taken intentionally as poison to commit suicide. We present a case of a 35-year-old suicidal man who developed prolonged apnea for almost 4 hours on day 13 of OP poisoning after brief general anesthesia induced by propofol and 1 mg/kg of suxamethonium, during the first session of the third cycle of modified electroconvulsive therapy, despite all due precautions. Such prolonged apnea secondary to complex interactions has been reported very rarely in literature. This case therefore, highlights the importance of careful evaluation and monitoring while giving anesthesia to OP-poisoning patients.

AB Objectives: To measure the prevalence of depression among the rural elderly population of North Tamilnadu in India and to identify the associated social factors.
   Methods: A community based cross sectional study was carried out among those aged 60 years and above. The data was collected from 162 consenting participants, who were selected through a multi staged cluster sampling, using a structured interviewer administered questionnaire and Geriatric depression scale (short form) and prevalence was calculated. A binary logistic regression was done to identify the independent association of risk factors with depression.
   Results: The study found the prevalence of old age depression as 52.5% (95% CI: 44.7-60.3) with factors low socio economic status, increasing age and single status posing strong independent risk.
   Conclusion: The authors advocate community based support systems in rural areas which will increase the social interaction and inclusiveness of the aged.

SO GEOPOLITICS
LA English
DT Article
ID CONFLICT DIAMONDS; GEOGRAPHIES; IMPERIALISM; STATES
AB The impacts of recent food, financial, and energy crises have reinvigorated a geopolitical enframing of global food security that makes foreign development assistance a primary component of national security strategies. This centres elite fears of hunger and underdevelopment and strongly shapes policies and strategies adopted in response. Geopolitical fears of hungry and food insecure populations are compounded by the politics of austerity and cuts to foreign aid budgets and social spending. This paper examines the geopolitics of food security, fear, and austerity as expressed in the rhetoric and strategies of major aid donor governments, especially the US and UK, and proposes an alternative geopolitics that builds from the affective dimensions of hunger, food insecurity, and vulnerability as experienced by the hungry and poor. The example of farmer suicides and agrarian political mobilisation in India demonstrates how this affective alternative geopolitics may be constructed and examined.

AB We present a sociohydrological model that can help us to better understand the system dynamics of a smallholder farmer. It couples the dynamics of the six main assets of a typical smallholder farmer: water storage capacity, capital, livestock, soil fertility, grazing access, and labor. The hydroclimatic variability, which is a main driver and source of uncertainty of the smallholder system, is accounted for at subannual scale. The model incorporates rule-based adaptation mechanisms of smallholders (for example, adjusting expenditures on food and fertilizers and selling livestocks) when farmers face adverse sociohydrological conditions, such as low annual rainfall, occurrence of dry spells, or variability of input or commodity prices. We have applied the model to analyze the sociohydrology of a cash crop producing smallholder in Maharashtra, India, in a semisynthetic case study setting. Of late, this region has witnessed many suicides of farmers who could not extricate themselves out of the debt trap. These farmers lacked irrigation and were susceptible to fluctuating commodity prices and climatic variability. We studied the sensitivity of a smallholder's capital, an indicator of smallholder well-being, to two types of cash crops (cotton and sugarcane), water storage capacity, availability of irrigation, initial capital that a smallholder starts with, prevalent wage rates, and access to grazing. We found that (i) smallholders with low water storage capacities and no irrigation are most susceptible to distress, (ii) a smallholder's well-being is low at low wage rates, (iii) wage rate is more important than absolution of debt, (iv) well-being is sensitive to water storage capacity up to a certain level, and (v) well-being increases with increasing area available for livestock grazing. Our results indicate that government intervention to absolve the debt of farmers or to invest in local storage to buffer rainfall variability may not be enough. In addition, alternative sources of income may need to be provided, for instance by ensuring minimum wages or by providing more access to grazing areas.

AB India is a country where major source of living and economy is through agriculture and agricultural industry Prediction of prices in agricultural commodity has always been a major problem for the farmers. Farmers aren't able to get desired price for their crops and that's why the suicide rate is increasing with every passing year. This paper mainly focuses on proposing a decision making support model for prediction of prices in agricultural commodities. This paper also includes techniques of data mining in agriculture that will help the farmers to predict the agricultural commodity prices. The objective of this project is to build a system which provides efficient and effective price prediction features. The aim is to propose a new framework and develop a system to make some advances towards more efficient price prediction.

DE Educational Stress; Happiness; Happiness Quotient; Emotional Support
AB Genuine Learning is always a pleasant experience, but 24 students commit suicide every day because of educational stress. Thus, stress poses as a significant public health problem, especially in India, for many students due to the highly competitive examination system and the school environment producing various other academic, social, and personal challenges therefore impacting their overall perceived happiness. The primary purpose of this research was to find out why students are not happy in current times & how and what should be done to make education process a happy and stress free experience for students and teachers. The study examines whether students' perceived happiness differed significantly based on stress and emotional closeness to others, like teachers and parents (social support) and to explore the ways to maintain and improve their Happiness Quotient (HQ). For this, the authors have adopted a qualitative approach and collected data through a semi-structured interview design from students, teachers and student counselors. This research revealed that if we are able to eliminate root causes for educational stress on young minds after exploring the psychological requisites for happiness and implement them; then we can expect our students to achieve success in various fields and prevent suicides. Potential methods for combating the challenges of academic stress are then suggested to help shape a healthy, safe and friendly environment for all who live, learn and work in school that support their social and emotional well-being.

TI Impact of different sources of credit in creating extreme farmer

DE Borrowing; Indebtedness; Farmer suicide; Agrarian distress
AB Purpose According to the published report by the National Sample Survey 2014 the data says that the incidence of indebtedness among households in the rural areas of Maharashtra, India, is almost twice that of other rural places in India. Around 64 percent of rural households are indebted in Maharashtra as against 31 percent other households in India. The purpose of this paper is to examine which source of credit is creating more distress among the farmers. Further the researchers also wanted to find out the reasons why the farmers choose private moneylender over the formal financial institutions. Design/methodology/approach To achieve the objective, the authors used the mixed method methodology. The qualitative study was done using the ethnography approach .In depth interviews were conducted and coded accordingly to find out the themes. The interviews conducted were semi structured and had open ended questions in it, followed by a structured questionnaire. Different statistical tests were also applied on the responses obtained from the questionnaire to check the reliability and validity of the interviews. This methodology gave a robustness to the findings of the study. Findings The results show that sources of loan play a major role in causing farmer distress in Maharashtra. The findings also show major reasons like grapevine bureaucracy, lengthy documentation, etc. as the major reasons for choosing private lenders over the formal financial institutions. The most interesting finding of the study was a phenomena observed during the field study. The borrowers first borrow from financial institutions for their credit needs, when they fail to repay the debt borrowed they again borrow money from the private money lenders and with this borrowed money they try repaying a part of the old existing loan in order to make themselves eligible for the next loan cycle.
   Originality/value The paper contains significant information with regard to indebtedness. It focuses on the issue troubling the authorities the most. It provides the ground realities of the incidence of indebtedness in Maharashtra, one of the most distressed states of India. Lot of studies have been done in the past but very few studies have used mixed methodology to study this incidence of debt among the farmers of Maharashtra. This study also unveils a new phenomena of borrowing happening among the farmers of Maharashtra.

AB HIV risk and mental health problems are prevalent among female sex workers (FSWs) in China. The purpose of this research was to study age group differences in HIV risk and mental health problems in this population. In the current study, we divided a sample of 1022 FSWs into three age groups (20 years, 21-34 years, and 35 years). Results showed that among the three groups (1) older FSWs (35 years) were likely to be socioeconomically disadvantaged (e.g., rural residency, little education, employment in low-paying venues, and low monthly income); (2) older FSWs reported the highest rates of inconsistent, ineffective condom use, and sexually transmitted diseases history; (3) younger FSWs (20 years) reported the highest level of depression, suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts, regular-partner violence, and substance use; (4) all health-related risks except casual-partner violence were more prevalent among older and younger FSWs than among FSWs aged 21-34 years; and (5) age had a significant effect on all health indicators except suicide attempts after controlling for several key demographic factors. These findings indicate the need for intervention efforts to address varying needs among FSWs in different age groups. Specific interventional efforts are needed to reduce older FSWs' exposure to HIV risk; meanwhile, more attention should be given to improve FSWs' mental health status, especially among younger FSWs.

AB The present study was carried out to analyze various factors associated with death due to hanging among adolescents and to identify the areas of intervention for preventing such deaths. A retrospective study was carried out on 51 cases of adolescent deaths due to hanging, the autopsies of which were conducted by the Department of Forensic Medicine, Dr Shankarrao Chavan Government Medical College, Nanded, Maharashtra State (India), during the period between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2010.
   In the present study, death by hanging among the adolescent age group was most commonly suicidal (96.08%) in nature, and only two (3.92%) cases of deaths due to accidental hanging were observed. Of the total number of suicidal deaths due to hanging among adolescents, the majority (80.39%) were among the older adolescent (15-19 years) age group. Rope and clothing items were commonly used ligature materials for committing suicide by hanging. Females outnumbered male victims (M:F ratio 1:1.13) among adolescents, contrary to the male preponderance observed among victims of the older age group (M:F ratio 1:0.44). Most of the suicidal deaths due to hanging (83.67%) among adolescents were observed at the victims' home. The predisposing and precipitating factors observed were domestic strife, examination-related stress, and physical and psychological illness.

   Methods: In this study we report on patient calling a round-the-clock crisis helpline for suicide prevention supported by psychiatric facilities in Mumbai, India. Chi-square and test of mean differences were used to compare outcomes between first-episode patients and those with a previous history.
   Results: Within five years, the helpline received 15,169 calls. Of those callers, 2341 (15.4%) experienced suicidal ideation. Two hundred and thirty four patients opting for counseling lasting 12 months agreed to a psychiatric assessment. Of those, 32 were fist time psychosis sufferers, whereas, 54 had previously been psychotic. Of all psychiatric assessments, the clinic received 94 patients with 'first-episode psychosis'. We found that the duration of illness was significantly shorter (17 vs. 28 months) and suicide attempts were fewer (16 vs. 21) in first-time psychosis sufferers compared to those with a treatment history.
   Conclusions: We conclude that some first-episode patients of schizophrenia and other disorders do access services by using helplines. We also argue that helplines may be somewhat immune to stigma, allowing patients a safe alternative when finding help.

TI Mental Health Policy in India: Seven Sets of Questions and Some Answers
SO JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH POLICY AND ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID RURAL INDIA; DEPRESSION; DISORDERS; SUICIDE; QUALITY; PROGRAM
AB Background: This paper frames the state of mental health policy in India in terms of seven sets of questions, and seeks to provide at least partial answers to these questions, based on a meta-analysis of existing research. The context of the analysis is the arguably poor state of mental health care in India, as well as an unprecedented level of policy attention to the issue.
   Aims of the Study: In brief, the questions we pose pertain to (i) the provision of such care in hospitals, (ii) non-hospital provision, including by non-medical providers, (iii) issues of education and social acceptance, (iv) affordability, (v) within-country variation of care and possibilities for benchmarking, (vi) aggregate resource impacts of a concerted effort to change policies and improve care, and (vii) the shape of a more effective "continuum of care" for mental health issues.
   Methods: Given the complexity of the subject, this paper is meant to serve as a framing of issues for further research, but in doing so, to clarify what issues are most pressing, those that are most difficult and perhaps those that can be tackled more readily, to create some momentum in changing the relatively poor state of mental health care in India.
   Results: While new laws and policies being introduced in India propose ideas and changes that are groundbreaking for that country, leading to cautious optimism, there still are many gaps in the understanding of the challenges of the provision of increased access to, as well as better quality, mental health care in India. These challenges can be understood on two fronts: one is the psychiatric and medical aspect of the issues, and the other is the management and administration of the system.
   Discussion: Perhaps the highest priority in achieving the goals of greater access and better quality is to increase the number of trained personnel at all levels of specialization and shilling that are relevant. Further, while the new legal framework and policy identify the importance of information technology in rapid expansion of access to mental healthcare, more context-specific research and trials are needed. With respect to the administration and management needs of the public system, important challenges will be the need for significant organizational innovations in the education system, and cultural changes that allow specialized medical professionals to accept the use of software and less-qualified, more dispersed, frontline providers. A final area is the interface between the public and private sectors, including the role of non-profit organizations: challenges include information sharing, division of responsibilities, and resource allocation.
   Implications for Health Care Provision and Use: Our analysis suggests that incorporating information technology, along with training professionals at a variety of skill levels in its use, may provide a resource-feasible approach to improving access to mental healthcare at reasonable cost and quality in the Indian context.
   Implications for Health Policies: India's mental health policies are already undergoing major changes, and our analysis emphasizes the need for translating these generic policies into specific and implementable versions that can be tested at the local level across different regional and social contexts in India.
   Implications for Further Research: The overall challenge is daunting, being the need to expand access and improve quality, while still managing costs, all within an overall healthcare system that is itself struggling to achieve these goals. Further research based on piloting and trials of assistive software and training programs will likely be useful.

TI Land, Water, and Food: Eco-cosmopolitan Feminist Praxis in Sabiha
   Sumar's Khamosh Pani
SO ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATION-A JOURNAL OF NATURE AND CULTURE
LA English
DT Article
DE Eco-cosmopolitanism; Feminism; Islamization; Pakistan; Partition
AB In an attempt to address the violence against women in South Asia while also keeping the environment in mind, I argue that Sabiha Sumar's film Khamosh Pani resists both religious nationalism and global capitalism through an eco-cosmopolitan feminist stance that is grounded in a materiality of place signified by land, water, and food. In my reading, the eco-cosmopolitan feminism of this film critiques patriarchy in the Punjab across the border with India and, simultaneously, remains locally grounded in that place with its local language, customs, and religious practices. As the history of the partition of British India has shown, when fathers and brothers forced their women to commit suicide by jumping in the village well to avoid rape, they simultaneously poisoned the well-water as the men migrated across the border. Violence against women was also violence against the waters of the Punjab. After showing how the film is feminist, I discuss how it draws attention to the materiality of the Pakistani Punjab on eco-cosmopolitan feminist terms. Specifically, I demonstrate that portrayals of land, water, and food present crucial tensions between patriarchal and nationalist Islamization and the resistance of Pakistan's women to these forces. An eco-cosmopolitan feminist reading of this film is particularly significant at this time given the continued violence against women in Punjab in the name of honor.

AB Aim of the study was to ascertain the various causes of unnatural deaths among 1-19 years analysing the postmortem data in a regional referral centre of northern India. A retrospective observational study from the data base was done for the same. All unnatural deaths in children aged 1-19 years from April 2010 to March 2011 were identified from the postmortem database. The children were classified into 3 groups-1-5 years, 6-10 years and 11-19 years separately for males and females. The various modes of unnatural deaths were identified and analysed. Retrospective analysis of Postmortem data during one year revealed total of 434 unnatural deaths in children aged 1-19 years. The most vulnerable age group included children between 11-19 years (74.5%). Females (51.6%) marginaly outnumbered the males (48.4%). Flame Burns (58.3%) was the commonest cause of death in all age followed by road traffic accidents 15%, electrocution 7.8% & Poisoning accounted for 6%. The most frequent victims were adolescents (74%) almost 3 times that of other age group.
   This study showed Adolescents were the most common victims of the unnatural death with flame burn being the most common cause followed by RTA, electrocution and poisoning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine. All rights reserved.

   interventions; Low and middle income countries; India; Process
   evaluation
AB Background: Availability of basic mental health services is limited in rural areas of India. Health system and individual level factors such as lack of mental health professionals and infrastructure, poor awareness about mental health, stigma related to help seeking, are responsible for poor awareness and use of mental health services. We implemented a mental health services delivery model that leveraged technology and task sharing to facilitate identification and treatment of common mental disorders (CMDs) such as stress, depression, anxiety and suicide risk in rural areas of the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. The intervention was delivered by lay village health workers (Accredited Social Health Activists - ASHAs) and primary care doctors. An anti-stigma campaign was implemented prior to this activity. This paper reports the process evaluation of the intervention using mixed methods.
   Methods: A mixed methods pre-post evaluation assessed the intervention using quantitative service usage analytics from the server, and qualitative interviews with different stakeholders. Barriers and facilitators in implementing the intervention were identified.
   Results: Health service use increased significantly at post-intervention, ASHAs could followup 78.6% of those who had screened positive, and 78.6% of the 1243 Interactive Voice Response System calls made, were successful. Most respondents were aware of the intervention. They indicated that knowledge received through the intervention empowered them to approach ASHAs and share their mental health symptoms. ASHAs and doctors opined that EDSS was useful and easy to use. Medical camps organized in villages to increase access to the doctor were received positively by all. However, some aspects or facilitators of the intervention need to be improved, including network connectivity, booster training, anti-stigma campaigns, quality of mental health services provided by doctors, provision of psychotropic medications at primary health centers and frequency of health camps.
   Conclusion: The respondents' views helped to understand the barriers and facilitators for improving the likely effectiveness of the intervention using Andersen's Modified Behavioral Model of Health Services Use, and identify the mechanisms by which those factors affected mental health services uptake in the community.

AB Unnatural deaths in women of reproductive age (range 12-49 years) have a serious psychological and social impact on the family and community. Deaths among women of reproductive age reported as medico-legal cases were investigated to see the trend in terms of cause and manner of death. The study group consisted of a series of 328 consecutive forensic autopsies on women in the reproductive age group, performed between 2009 and 2011 at the Government Wenlock District Hospital, Mangalore, India by qualified specialist forensic medicine experts. Unnatural deaths formed 93.6% of the cohort. The top three causes of death included burns, poisoning and hanging forming 69.5% of the cases. The manner of death was suicide in 45.4% cases, accident in 43.6% cases and homicide in 4.6% cases. The circumstances of death were related to alleged medical negligence in 2.4% cases. Death in 4% cases was natural mannered with a disease being the cause of death. Three-fourths of the victims were married. Married women formed 63.1% of the suicidal victims. Homicidal deaths were not reported among unmarried women. The preponderant method of suicide was by poisoning at 42.3% (63 cases), followed by hanging (34.9%), burns (11.4%) and drowning (9.4%). These four methods comprised 98% of the total suicidal deaths in this study cohort. Accidental deaths were predominantly caused by burns (62.2%) and road traffic accident (23.1%). Two-thirds of the homicidal deaths were due to assault caused by blunt-force trauma, ligature strangulation and sharp-force trauma. One-third of the homicidal victims died due to burns. With a clear understanding of the cause and manner of death, it may be possible to predict, and hopefully prevent, future cases of unnatural deaths in women of reproductive age who form a very important group of society.

AB Metal phosphides such as aluminum phosphide are potent insecticides. This highly toxic substance is used for rice and other grains protection in Iran. Due to its high toxicity potential and easy availability, it is widely used as a suicide poison. This substance has no effective antidote and the incidence of deaths due to its poisoning is increasing day by day in Iran.The present study was conducted to show the increasing incidence of fatal aluminum phosphide poisoning and its toxicological and forensic aspects in an 8-year study, 2006 to 2013. Autopsy sheets were reviewed and cases with the history of aluminum phosphide poisoning were selected. Toxicological analysis results, demographic and necroscopic examination findings were studied. A total of 51.8% of studied cases were female. Most of the cases were between 10 and 40 years old. The manner of death was self-poisoning in 85% of cases. Morphine, ethanol, and amitriptyline were the most common additional drugs detected in toxicological analysis. The incidence of fatal aluminum phosphide poisoning cases referred for phosphine analysis was 5.22 and 37.02 per million of population of Tehran in 2006 and 2013, respectively. The results of this study showed that in spite of ban and restrictions, there was a dramatic increase in the incidence of fatal aluminum phosphide poisoning in Tehran from 2006 to 2013. Safety alert should be highlighted in training program for all population groups about the toxic effects of aluminum phosphide tablets.

AB Objective Despite the rapid industrialisation and urbanisation over the past 30years, agriculture is one of the largest economic sectors in China and the unregulated use of pesticides result in extensive pesticide poisoning. The objective of this study was to analyse pesticide poisoning cases registration received by Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, China.
   Design Register-based study.
   Setting Cases registered regarding pesticide poisoning. Data were obtained from the Occupational Disease Surveillance and Reporting Systems in Zhejiang province from 2006 to 2010, which contains anonymous records representing general population of Zhejiang province, China.
   Participants All cases registered as pesticide poisoning were identified.
   Primary outcome Monthly and age-group pesticide poisoning death rates were calculated.
   Results A total of 20097 pesticide poisoning cases with 1413 deaths were recorded during the study period. There were 10513 male pesticide poisoning cases with 782 deaths, and 9584 females with 631 deaths. Pesticide poisoning occurred mostly in non-occupational exposure (79.86%), in which the majority (85.77%) of the cases was of intentional pesticide poisoning. The occupational exposure was most common in men during the farming season. The death rate increased stepwise with age, and the pesticide suicide rate was higher in the older age group.
   Conclusions Pesticide poisoning remains a major health problem in China, and further recommendations to reduce the pesticide poisoning are required.

TI Jainism - Its relevance to psychiatric practice; with special reference
   to the practice of <i>Sallekhana</i>
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE Jainism; psychiatry; Sallekhana; Santhara; Tamil history
AB Jainism is one of the oldest religions of India. Since the founding of the religion, Jainism has given prominence to Sallekhana, death by ritual fasting facing north, as exemplified in the deaths of Bhadrabahu and Chandragupta Maurya. The controversy whether this religious form of starvation is related to suicide is debated since the time of the early Jain teachers. History is replete with instances where kings and warriors who have failed in their duty punish themselves for their sin and welcome death as expiation. Such starvation deaths are referred to as vadakirutthal (literally, facing north) and become quite prevalent during the Sangam age, probably copied from the Jain culture. The present-day thinking on Sallekhana needs to be considered here in more detail which should be brought to the knowledge of current-day psychiatrists. These ideas are relevant to psychiatric counseling of the ordinary people and would be very useful if included in the armamentarium of the mental health professionals.

AB Aim: To study the plasma omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acid levels in patients with depressive episode and in matched healthy controls.
   Method: Thirty patients with first episode depression and thirty healthy matched control subjects were recruited from a tertiary care hospital setting. We measured plasma omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid levels of the study and the control group.
   Result: There were no significant differences in plasma omega 3 fatty acid levels between study group and control group. The plasma omega 6 fatty acid levels of study group were significantly less than that of control group.
   Conclusions: The present study is an initial attempt to investigate the link between fatty acids and depression in a clinical setting in India. This comparative study with normal controls did not etiologically link these polyunsaturated fatty acids in this sample of depressive disorder.

AB This study compared 75 wives of alcoholics with an equal number of wives of non-alcoholics matched on key socio-demographic variables, using a cross sectional ex-post facto research design. Instruments to assess the extent of conflict and danger perceived by them in their marital relationship, besides the communication apprehension experienced towards their partners were administered. Analyses showed that the wives of alcoholics as a group had higher levels of conflict, perceived more danger and experienced more apprehension in relating with their spouses, than the subjects of the reference group. Results indicate the need to consciously focus on the spouse of the alcoholic and to help her resolve various marital issues with which she is faced. Implications for therapeutic intervention with couples in alcohol complicated relationships to enable them overcome their marital life deficits are discussed.

AB Neuropsychiatric disorders and suicide amount to 12.7% of the global burden of disease and related conditions (GBD) according to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates for 1999, and recognition of the enormous component of mental illness in the GBD has attracted unprecedented attention in the field of international health. Focusing on low- and middle-income countries with high adult mortality, this article discusses essential functions of international agencies concerned with mental health. A review of the history and development of national mental health policy in India follows, and local case studies consider the approach to planning in a rural mental health programme in West Bengal and the experience in an established urban mental health programme in a low-income community of Mumbai. Local programmes must be attentive to the needs of the communities they serve, and they require the support of global and national policy for resources and the conceptual tools to formulate strategies to meet those needs. National programmes retain major responsibilities for the health of their country's population: they are the portals through which global and local interests, ideas, and policies formally interact. International priorities should be responsive to a wide range of national interests, which in turn should be sensitive to diverse local experiences. Mental health actions thereby benefit from the synergy of informed and effective policy at each level.

AB Introduction. Human contact with potentially toxic plants, which may occur through abuse or by accident or attempted suicide, is frequent and sometimes results in clinically significant toxicity. Objective. The aim of the present study was to identify which plants may lead to severe poisoning, and to define the clinical relevance of plant toxicity for humans in Switzerland. Methods. We analyzed 42 193 cases of human plant exposure and 255 acute moderate, severe, and lethal poisonings, which were reported to the Swiss Toxicological Information Centre between January 1995 and December 2009. Results. Plant contact was rarely responsible for serious poisonings. Lethal intoxications were extremely rare and were caused by plants with cardiotoxic (Taxus baccata) or mitosis-inhibiting (Colchicum autumnale) properties. Conclusions. Most often, plant contact was accidental and patients remained asymptomatic or developed mild symptoms, which fully resolved within a short time.

AB Epidemiological and medicolegal, including forensic pathological, aspects of 456 cases of unnatural deaths of females aged 16 to 30 years were studied in Lucknow during the period of 1 year (May 2, 2011 to May 1, 2012). These constituted 62.5% of the total unnatural deaths autopsied from all ages in females. Most of the victims were young Hindu housewives killed or who died within 7 years of marriage. The most common cause was vehicular accidents followed by poisons and burns. The homicidal, suicidal, and accidental deaths were 87, 129, and 240, respectively. The common motives and circumstances were mental stress due to various reasons, family quarrel, maladjustment in married life, and cruelty by the in-laws. Level of education, joint family structure, unemployment, dependence of the woman on the in-laws, infidelity, large families, and failure in love in unmarried girls were other contributing factors affecting the incidence. The study suggests different measures to check unnatural female deaths to improve the situation.

AB Objectives To describe the pattern and clinical-psychiatric profile of patients presenting with deliberate self-harm attempt to an emergency setting. Methods The study involves the analysis of the case records of 109 consecutive patients with deliberate self-harm evaluated by the psychiatric emergency team at a premier, tertiary care hospital in India over a period of 13 months (January 2015-January 2016). Results Deliberate self-harm had a clinical prevalence of 16.4% (109/666) among total mental and behavioral emergencies attended in the same period. A large majority of attempters were in the age range of 18-39 years (84.4%), and females (58.7%) outnumbered males in total sample. Married females and unmarried males had significantly higher chances of attempting deliberate self-harm (chi(2) = 6.57, p = 0.01). More than half (52.3%) of patients were found to have a diagnosable psychiatric illness at the time of presentation, most common being depressive disorder in 19.3% of overall sample. Past history of a psychiatric illness was evident in only 12.5% of patients. Common methods of deliberate self-harm were prescription drug/psychotropic overdose, poisoning with ingestion of phenyl cleaner or rat-killer poison. Significant gender differences were observed in the nature of precipitating events for deliberate self-harm, with interpersonal relationship problems being significantly more common in women (p = 0.03). Conclusion This study adds relevant and useful information on cross-cutting as well as gender-specific characteristics of patients presenting with deliberate self-harm attempt, from a developing country context. The study findings bear implications for designing interventions for primary and secondary prevention of such behavioral emergencies at a community level.

AB Background: In order to facilitate case identification of incident (untreated and recent onset) cases of psychosis and controls in three sites in India, Nigeria and Trinidad, we sought to understand how psychoses (or madness) were conceptualized locally. The evidence we gathered also contributes to a long history of research on concepts of madness in diverse settings.
   Methods: We conducted focus group discussions and individual interviews to collect information about how informants in each site make sense of and respond to madness. A coding framework was developed and analyses of transcripts from the FGDs and interviews were conducted.
   Results: Analyses suggest the following: a) disturbed behaviors are the primary sign of madness; b) madness is attributed to a wide range of causes; and, c) responses to madness are dictated by cultural and pragmatic factors. These findings are congruent with similar research that has been conducted over the past 50 years.
   Conclusions: The INTREPID research suggests that concepts about madness share similar features across diverse settings: a) terms for madness are often derived from a common understanding that involves disruptions in mental processes and capacities; b) madness is recognized mostly by disruptive behaviours or marked declines in functioning; c) causal attributions are varied; and, d) help-seeking is a complex process.

AB Background: Non-suicidal self-injurious behaviour (NSSI) is a growing concern among youth and rarely reaches the attention of mental health and medical services.
   Aims: The study explored the occurrence, methods, characteristics and reported reasons for NSSI among a sample of college students in India.
   Methods: A total of 470 participants from undergraduate and postgraduate colleges completed the Functional Assessment of Self Mutilation (FASM) questionnaire.
   Results: Results indicated that 31.2% of the participants reported NSSI in the past year, with the mean age of onset being 15.9 years. Moderate/severe forms of NSSI were reported by 19.8% of the sample. The most common method was self-hitting (15.2%) followed by cutting or carving skin (13.2%). A majority of self-injurers endorsed multiple methods of NSSI, and there were no significant gender differences in NSSI rates. The NSSI was performed both to regulate internal emotional states (automatic reinforcement) and to influence others in the environment (social reinforcement).The most commonly endorsed reasons for NSSI were to feel relaxed' and to get control of the situation', while the least frequently endorsed reasons were to make others angry' and to avoid college, work, or other activities'.
   Conclusion: The findings underscore the need to increase the awareness and understanding of NSSIs and to plan targeted interventions among college youth.

ID INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE; PREVALENCE
AB Background: Violence against women is a global phenomenon.
   Aims: To estimate and forecast cognizable crime against women in New Delhi, India, from 2016 to 2020.
   Methods: Reported cognizable crime against women in New Delhi for 2009-2015 was extracted for statistical analysis, synthesis and modelling. The cognizable crimes reported are rape, attempt to commit rape, kidnapping and abduction, dowry deaths, assault on women with intent to outrage her modesty, insult to modesty of women, cruelty by husband or his relative, importation of girls from foreign countries, abetment of suicide of women and indecent representation of women.
   Results: The actual number of registered cases of crime against women ranged from 4251 (2009) to 17 104 (2015). The projected number of cases ranged between 18 991 [95% confidence interval (CI): 13 092-24 889) in 2016 to 28 663 (95% CI: 22 314-35 013)] in 2020. A rising trend in crime against women was noticed in New Delhi, ranging from 204.6 (2016) to 308.8 (2020) per 100 000 women. After witnessing a substantive increase (116.2%) in reported crime against women in New Delhi in 2013, the subsequent actual and projected rise appears to be incremental in nature, with an annual percentage point change ranging between 9% and 18%.
   Conclusion: Within limitations, it is concluded that the safety of women will continue to be a concern in the near future.

AB Background: Stigma is an important factor that determines whether individuals seek treatment for mental illnesses. Studies assessing public perceptions regarding mental illnesses are scarce in India. This study documents the stigma perceived by a rural population toward patients with mental illness and their families. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional pilot study was done in five villages, selected by simple random sampling, from a rural block in Vellore, Tamil Nadu. Households in each village were selected by systematic random sampling. From the selected households, 150 subjects aged 18-65 years, without known mental disorders, were chosen by convenience sampling, based on availability. Stigma was assessed using the Devaluation of Consumers Scale (DCS) and Devaluation of Consumer's Families Scale (DCFS). Results: The proportion with high perceptions of stigma associated with mentally ill persons was 63.8%, among the 150 interviewed rural respondents (women: 112, median age: 37 years). The proportion which perceived that there was public stigma toward families of those with mental illnesses was 43.4%. Older respondents (>37 years) had higher perceptions of stigma (odds ratio: 2.07; 95% confidence interval: 1.02-4.20) than others. Conclusion: The high perception of stigma associated with persons who are mentally ill as well as their families needs to be kept in mind while planning interventions to decrease the treatment gap for psychiatric morbidity, especially in rural areas.

AB Cleistanthus collinus ( local name: oduvan) poisoning is a common suicidal poisoning method used in rural southern India. There are few studies on this issue and they have small sample sizes. This study examines the epidemiology of oduvan poisoning in a large sample, highlighting socio-demographic and clinical profile, complications, and risk factors for mortality. This study is a retrospective case series of 127 oduvan intentionally poisoned patients presenting at a tertiary care teaching hospital between the years 1990-1999. Descriptive statistics, cumulative case fatality rates and time to death from ingestion of poison were calculated. Cox regression adjusting for left truncation was used to investigate the effects of covariates on death. Patients' average (sd) age was 29.1 (10.9), 62% were female, 76% were married and 49% were housewives. The cumulative case fatality rate was 30%. The median time to death after oduvan ingestion was 3 days. Common signs and symptoms included hypokalaemia, vomiting, hyponatraemia, altered sensorium, bradycardia and abnormal ECG. There was a 58% risk reduction (95% CI: 29-75) in death with each 1 mmol/l increase in plasma potassium level. Patient's age was associated with an increased risk of death and the estimated hazard ratio for an increase of 10 years in age was 1.56 (95% CI: 1.18-2.07). Use of boiled oduvan extract was associated with an increased mortality (HR: 2.71, 95% CI: 1.17-6.32) compared to ingesting fresh leaves. Risk factors for oduvan poisoning mortality were hypokalaemia, older age, mode of consumption and an elevated risk for death with presence of chronic disease. When consumed as a boiled extract, oduvan is more lethal. We recommend close monitoring, correction of plasma potassium and appropriate supportive measures.

AB Background: Harmful effects of alcohol abuse are well documented for drinkers, and adverse effects are also reported for the physical and emotional well-being of family members, with evidence often originating from either drinkers or their families in clinic-based settings. This study evaluates intra-household associations between alcohol abuse in men, and depression and suicidal attempts in women, in community-based settings of Chennai, India.
   Methods: This community-based cross-sectional study of chronic disease risk factors and outcomes was conducted in n = 259 households and n = 1053 adults (aged 15 years and above) in rural and urban Chennai. The Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) score was used to classify alcohol consumption into 'low-risk', 'harmful', 'hazardous' and 'alcohol dependence' drinking and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score to classify depression as 'mild', 'moderate', 'moderate-severe' and 'severe'. Multivariate logistic regression models estimated the association of depression in women with men's drinking patterns in the same household.
   Results: A significant 2.5-fold increase in any depression (PHQ-9 >= 5) was observed in men who were 'alcohol-dependent' compared to non-drinkers (OR = 2.53; 95 % CI: 1.26, 5.09). However, there was no association between men's drinking behavior and depression in women of the same household, although suicidal attempts approached a significant dose-response relationship with increasing hazard-level of men's drinking (p=0.08).
   Conclusion: No significant intra-household association was observed between men's alcohol consumption and women's depression, though an increasing (non-significant) trend was associated with suicidal attempts. Complex relationships between suicidal attempts and depression in women and male abusive drinking require further exploration, with an emphasis on intra-household mechanisms and pathways.

AB BACKGROUND
   Psychiatric comorbidities are common in patients with substance use disorder & they tend to complicate the management, course & prognosis of both disorders. So, this study was conducted in the M.B.S. Hospital of Govt. Medical College, Kota, to know the psychiatric comorbidities in patients with substance use disorder, coming for the de-addiction treatment in a tertiary care hospital of western India.
   MATERIALS & METHODS
   This is a case control study. 50 patients of substance use disorder were compared with the 50 age & sex matched controls & assessed by the especially designed semistructured performa, General Health Questionnaire & Indian Psychiatric Interview Schedule. Convenience sampling method was used for taking the sample. Data so collected was displayed in the form of various tables. Chi square test was used to test the significance.
   RESULTS
   54% patients with substance use disorder were found to have co-morbid psychiatric diagnoses in comparison to 12% psychiatric morbidity in control group. In psychiatric co-morbidities, depressive disorder was the commonest diagnosis followed by anxiety disorder, personality disorder, bipolar disorder & schizophrenia spectrum disorders.
   CONCLUSION
   Effective management of psychiatric comorbidities is necessary for improvement in substance related behavioural & psychosocial outcomes. So the regular screening & management of psychiatric comorbidities should be the essential routine practice in deaddiction clinics & mental health care settings.

AB About 30% of the fruits and vegetables grown in India (40 million tons amounting to US$ 13 billion) get wasted annually due to gaps in the cold chain such as poor infrastructure, insufficient cold storage capacity, unavailability of cold storages in close proximity to farms, poor transportation infrastructure, etc. This results in instability in prices, farmers not getting remunerative prices, rural impoverishment resulting in farmers' frustrations and suicides. India wastes more fruits and vegetables than it consumes. Enough attention has been paid at the preharvest stage for boosting the levels of production by techniques like crop rotation, soil conservation, pest control, fertilizers, irrigation, etc., but, postharvest issues have been addressed inadequately. Despite having achieved national food security, the well-being of over 200 million Indian farmers and farm workers who have been the backbone of Indian agriculture continues to be a matter of grave concern. Operating costs for Indian cold storage units are over $60 per cubic metre per year compared to less than $30 in the West. Energy expenses make up about 28% of the total expenses for Indian cold storages compared to 10% in the West. These factors make setting up cold storages difficult, unviable and uneconomical. About 30-35% of the losses can be reduced by transporting the freshly harvested fruits and vegetables in refrigerated containers thus closing this gap in the cold chain. We would need about 20,000 refrigerated containers of standard TEU size (with about 0.24 million sq. meters using solar PV panels fixed on their rooftops to be totally independent of the power grid or DG sets using fossil fuels, valued at US$ 0.53 billion), to transport the freshly harvested produce, placed strategically at various locations in the farms all across the country. Commercially, the payback period for this mammoth project is quite attractive. Refrigerated containers score substantially over conventional refrigerated trucks in terms of suitability for this application in Indian terrain.

AB Background: Human rights abuses, denial of care, police surveillance, and violence directed at IDUs have been found to impact HIV prevention efforts due to decreased attendance in harm reduction programs. The association of mental health status with rights abuses has not been examined extensively among drug users. In India, drug control laws are often in conflict with harm reduction policies, thus increasing the likelihood of rights abuses against IDUs. The purpose of this study was to describe human rights abuses occurring among IDUs in Delhi and examine their association with suicidal ideation.
   Methods: 343 IDUs were recruited in two research sites in Delhi through respondent driven sampling and were interviewed with a cross sectional survey questionnaire that included items on human rights and socio demographics.
   Results: IDUs in the study experienced many human rights abuses. Notably among these were denial of admission into hospital (38.5%), denial of needles and syringes (20%), police arrests for carrying needles and using drugs (85%), verbal abuse (95%) and physical abuse (88%). Several human rights abuses were associated with suicidal ideation. These include being denied needles and syringes (OR: 7.28, 95% CI: 3.03-17.49); being arrested by police for carrying needles and using drugs (OR: 2.53,95% CI: 1.06-6.03), and being physically abused (OR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.05-2.23). The likelihood of suicidal ideation is also strongly related to the cumulative number of abuses.
   Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that there is a high prevalence of human rights abuses among IDUs in Delhi. Given the alarming rate of suicidal ideation and its close relationship with human rights abuses it is essential that IOU interventions are executed within a rights-based framework.

TI The Tribal Health Initiative model for healthcare delivery: A clinical
   and epidemiological approach
SO NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
LA English
DT Article
ID MADHYA-PRADESH; INDIA; DEFICIENCY; POPULATIONS; PREVALENCE; ANEMIA
AB Background. Tribal populations generally have poor health outcomes, often because of a healthcare delivery system that does not cater to their needs. This study evaluates a current healthcare model for tribals, and explores it in combination with the health status of the target population, placing emphasis on the long term sustainability and cross-implementation of the model.
   Methods. We examined the health system from the perspective of the base hospital, by concentrating on mortality patterns, Inpatient incidence of selected infectious and non-Infectious Illnesses, and the preventive and curative health services administered by the hospital to the community.
   Results. Gender susceptibility patterns revealed disparities in anaemia and tuberculosis besides fluctuations in gastrointestinal disorders, tuberculosis and typhoid. A combination of gender and age-susceptibility patterns revealed specific age intervals for mental health-related disorders. Mortality patterns indicated an increase in youth deaths and suicide, with an overall reduction in infant mortality. However, an increased tribal confidence In allopathic medicine was noted after Implementation of the health system.
   Conclusion. The base tribal hospital is important in administering primary and secondary healthcare, health education, disease surveillance, community outreach and for continued confidence in allopathic medicine. Diet-based morbidities may be combated via organic farming and banning local alcohol production, while anaemia may be combated through continued iron, salt and folic acid supplementation to women. The formulation of mental health programmes and long term educational initiatives at the village level are critical to reducing suicide and infant mortality. Further epidemiological studies are required to gain a complete picture of health within the population, and successful implementation of the model elsewhere must factor in sociocultural disparities among tribes.

AB Objective. To identify poisoning and toxic exposure pattern, severity, and clinical outcome in Thailand during 2001 to 2004. Method. This is a prospective study. All inquiries were registered, followed up, and verified. Interlocutors, poisons, patients' profiles, severity, and medical outcome after exposure or poisoning were analyzed. Results. A total 14,428 events was suspected as human poisoning or exposure. After follow-up and verification, 98.9% were confirmed as poisoning or poison exposure. These involved 15,016 patients and accounted for 6.0 per 100,000 populations per year. The vast majority of calls (92.4%) were from physicians. Pesticides, household products, and pharmaceutical products were the most common poisons involved in human exposure, which were 41.5%, 19.5%, and 18.9%, respectively. Patients aged 0-6 years, teenagers and adults with 20-29 years of age had the highest rates of exposure, which were 33.0, 24.5, and 10.5 exposures per 100,000 per year, respectively. Unintentional accidental exposure is the major reason of exposure in children, but intentional suicide was the main reason of exposure in teenagers and adults. The death rate of all exposure was 5.5%. Pesticides cause more severe clinical course and the highest death rate (10.0%). Conclusion. Features of poisoning in Thailand were different from those in Western countries. Pesticide poisoning was the major problem in Thailand. Intentional suicide was the major circumstance of poison exposure in adults, but accidental exposure was the major reason of exposure in children.

ID RURAL BANGLADESH; EPIDEMIOLOGY; DELHI; INDIA
AB Background Few studies have examined injury-related deaths among women in Bangladesh. We did a case-finding study to identify causes and the impact of intentional and unintentional injury-related deaths among women aged 10-50 years in Bangladesh.
   Methods Between 1996 and 1997, health care and other service providers at 4751 health facilities throughout Bangladesh were interviewed about their knowledge of deaths among women aged 10-50 years. In addition, at all public facilities providing inpatient service. medical records of women who died during the study period were reviewed. The reported circumstances surrounding each death were carefully reviewed to attribute the most likely cause of death.
   Findings 28 998 deaths among women aged 10-50 years were identified in our study, and, of these, 6610 (23%) were thought to be caused by intentional or unintentional injuries. About half (3317) of the injury deaths were attributable to suicide, 352 (5%) to homicide, 1100 (17%) to accidental injuries, and the intent was unknown for 1841 (28%) deaths. The unadjusted rate of suicides were higher in the Khulna administrative division (27.0 per 100 000) than the other four administrative divisions of Bangladesh (range 3.5-11.3 per 100 000). Poisoning (n=3971) was the commonest cause of injury-related death-60% of all injury deaths (6610) and 14% of all deaths (28 998). Other common causes of injury deaths in order of frequency were hanging or suffocation, road traffic accidents, bums, drowning, physical assault, firearm or sharp instrument injury, and snake or animal bite.
   Interpretation Intentional and unintentional injuries are a major cause of death among women aged 10-50 years in Bangladesh. Strategies to reduce injury-related deaths among women need to be devised.

   ASSOCIATION; SEVERITY; DISTRICT
AB Aims Suicidal behaviour is an under-reported and hidden cause of death in most low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) due to lack of national systematic reporting for cause-specific mortality, high levels of stigma and religious or cultural sanctions. The lack of information on non-fatal suicidal behaviour (ideation, plans and attempts) in LMIC is a major barrier to design and implementation of prevention strategies. This study aims to determine the prevalence of non-fatal suicidal behaviour within community- and health facility-based populations in LMIC.
   Methods Twelve-month prevalence of suicidal ideation, plans and attempts were established through community samples (n = 6689) and primary care attendees (n = 6470) from districts in Ethiopia, Uganda, South Africa, India and Nepal using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview suicidality module. Participants were also screened for depression and alcohol use disorder.
   Results We found that one out of ten persons (10.3%) presenting at primary care facilities reported suicidal ideation within the past year, and 1 out of 45 (2.2%) reported attempting suicide in the same period. The range of suicidal ideation was 3.5-11.1% in community samples and 5.0-14.8% in health facility samples. A higher proportion of facility attendees reported suicidal ideation than community residents (10.3 and 8.1%, respectively). Adults in the South African facilities were most likely to endorse suicidal ideation (14.8%), planning (9.5%) and attempts (7.4%). Risk profiles associated with suicidal behaviour (i.e. being female, younger age, current mental disorders and lower educational and economic status) were highly consistent across countries.
   Conclusion The high prevalence of suicidal ideation in primary care points towards important opportunities to implement suicide risk reduction initiatives. Evidence-supported strategies including screening and treatment of depression in primary care can be implemented through the World Health Organization's mental health Global Action Programme suicide prevention and depression treatment guidelines. Suicidal ideation and behaviours in the community sample will require detection strategies to identify at risks persons not presenting to health facilities.

AB The study presents a retrospective analysis of 64 cases of death resulting from ingestion of corrosive substances. The cases represented approximately 0.4% of all autopsies conducted and 13.6% of all fatal poisonings studied during the 10-year period from January 2005 to December 2014 at the Department of Forensic Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi. The data was analyzed with regard to age, sex, nature and source of corrosive substance used, survival period, cause and manner of death. Males (64.06%) outnumbered females (35.94%), with a male-to-female ratio of 1.78:1. The most common age group involved was 21-30 years (35.94%). Sulfuric acid (68.75%) presented as the most common corrosive substance ingested. Household cleaning substances (39.06%) were identified as a common source of such type of corrosive substance, but the exact source could not be identified in 56.26% of cases. In the majority of cases (46.88%) death was due to perforation peritonitis. Most of the victims (54.69%) succumbed to their injuries within a day of ingestion. In 87.5% of cases, the corrosive substance was consumed for suicidal purposes. A strict regulatory framework is required for the production, distribution, storage and use of corrosive substances. Preventive guidelines and creating awareness among the masses will go a long way towards curbing such unfortunate incidents.

AB Poisoning is recognized as a major factor for deaths in majority of low-income and middle-income countries. Although it is considered as a global burden, the nature of poisoning may vary in different areas across the world. The Charutar region in the state of Gujarat in western India has a unique topography and cultivation practises which sets it apart from the rest of the state. Due to the dearth of studies pertaining to the access of the population at this area to different types of poisons and pattern of poisoning, we planned this study to find magnitude, morbidity and mortality of poisoning with a specific consideration of gender, age and poison in contrast to the usual adopted cumulative approach. In a retrospective study, 1092 cases were identified as poisoning cases. The study revealed a higher vulnerability to poisoning in males, married individuals, during the third decade of life, from rural areas, due to accidental causes, during day time events and during the monsoon seasons. The gender specific approach clarified additional comparative data. More deaths were reported from suicidal poisoning than accidental ones. 49 specific poisons were found in the study, among which accidental snake bite poisoning, insecticidal substances and aluminium phosphide were prevalent. Aluminium phosphide and quinalphos were responsible for the highest fatalities (in terms of number of persons died). Gender predominance was observed for specific poisons. Age wise distribution of specific poisons was derived. Treatment duration and survival period for specific poisons were calculated.

ID MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; RISK-FACTORS; TOBACCO; CANCER; ALCOHOL
AB Background In India most adult deaths involve vascular disease, pulmonary tuberculosis, or other respiratory disease, and men have smoked cigarettes or bidis (which resemble small cigarettes) for several decades. The study objective was to assess age-specific mortality from smoking among men (since few women smoke) in urban and in rural India.
   Methods We did a case-control study of the smoking habits of 27 000 urban and 16 000 rural men who had died in the state of Tamil Nadu, southern India, from medical causes lie, any cause other than accident, homicide, or suicide), and of 20 000 urban and 15 000 rural male controls. The main analyses are of mortality at ages 25-69 years.
   Findings In the urban study area, the death rates from medical causes of ever smokers were double those of never smokers (standardised risk ratio at ages 25-69 years 2.1 [95% Cl 2.0-2.2]). The risks were substantial both for cigarette smoking (the main urban habit) and for bidi smoking. Of this excess mortality among smokers, a third involved respiratory disease, chiefly tuberculosis (4.5 [4.0-5.0], smoking-attributed fraction 61%), a third involved vascular disease (1.8 [1.7-1.9], smoking-attributed fraction 24%), 11% involved cancer (2.1 [1.9-2.4], smoking-attributed fraction 32%), chiefly of the respiratory or upper digestive tracts, and 14% involved alcoholism or cirrhosis (3.3 [2.9-3.8], not attributed to smoking). Among ever smokers, the absolute excess mortality from tuberculosis was substantial throughout the age range 25-69 years. (A separate survey of 250 000 men living in the urban study area found that ever smokers are three times as likely as never smokers to report a history of tuberculosis, corresponding to a higher rate of progression of chronic subclinical infection to clinical disease.) The proportional excesses of respiratory, vascular, and neoplastic mortality at ages 25-69 years among ever smokers in the urban study area were replicated, each with similarly narrow Cl for the risk ratio, in the rural study area (where bidi smoking predominated), and are taken to be largely or wholly causal. For urban and for rural death from medical causes at older ages (greater than or equal to70 years), the standardised risk ratio was 1.3.
   Interpretation Smoking, which increases the incidence of clinical tuberculosis, is a cause of half the male tuberculosis deaths in India, and of a quarter of all male deaths in middle age (plus smaller fractions of the deaths at other ages). At current death rates, about a quarter of cigarette or bidi smokers would be killed by tobacco at ages 25-69 years, those killed at these ages losing about 20 years of life expectancy. Overall, smoking currently causes about 700 000 deaths per year in India, chiefly from respiratory or vascular disease: about 550 000 men aged 25-69 years, about 110000 older men, and much smaller numbers of women (since few women smoke).

AB Although a significant body of scholarship has examined medical discourse in clinical and other institutional settings, far less has been studied in regard to the discursive activity of health professionals in the public sphere. This line of inquiry is particularly relevant in Kerala, south India, where, for reasons including felt obligation, the political economy of allopathic mental health care, and desires for social prestige, many psychologists and psychiatrists actively engage the public as lecturers, authors, and guests of television and radio programs alongside their clinical work. Ethnographic attention to discursive activity in the public sphere reveals how these experts blur the boundaries between clinical and popular registers of speech and forge alternative ethical sensibilities and values that challenge institutionally prescribed ideas of clinical professionalism. They do so in ways that can attract reprobation and accusations of quackery among critical peers who hold competing ideas of where, how, and to whom mental health professionals should speak.

AB Life satisfaction in China declined dramatically precisely at the time of its unprecedented economic growth and poverty reduction. We posit that a "progress paradox" is among the possible channels explaining these contrasting trends. Using data from the Chinese Livelihood Survey, we explore the role of reported physical and psychological health. The standard correlates of life satisfaction such as age, income, and health hold. In addition, we find that those with insufficient rest and leisure are significantly less satisfied. Urban, educated respondents are more likely to report depression, while rural and uneducated respondents are more satisfied with their lives and are less likely to report poor mental health. We also find that insufficient rest, stress, and low life satisfaction have a strong correlation with mental health problems. Given the gains in growth and poverty reduction in China, it is time to consider policies that focus on quality of life and mental illness. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID INTOXICATION; INDIA
AB Endosulfan is a widely used insecticide that is associated with a high fatality rate in humans when ingested accidentally or with the aim of suicide. However, the literature concerning human endosulfan exposure is limited to case reports. Thus, we sought to 1) describe the clinical features of patients with acute endosulfan poisoning and 2) identify independent factors to predict patients' outcome. Fifty-two patients who presented with acute endosulfan poisoning between January 2001 and January 2007 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Sixteen (30.7%) of the 52 patients died, and 48 patients experienced seizures. Endosulfan poisoning caused the hypotension and the abnormalities on electrocardiogram at presentation. Over half of the patients developed complications, such as rhabdomyolysis, hepatic toxicity, and hypotension. These complications resolved without sequelae in the survival group. Refractory status epilepticus was the most common cause of death in this series (75.0%). Amount ingested being greater than 35 g of endosulfan was the most found to be an independent variable that predicted patient mortality. Patients with this risk factor must be treated aggressively during the early stage of endosulfan poisoning.

AB India is an agricultural country and 70% of the people directly or indirectly depends on agriculture for their living. Nowadays, water scarcity is one of the main challenges faced by the farmers. Another major challenge faced by Indian agriculture sector is the increase in rate of farmers suicide because of debt. So, effective measures have to be devised in order to reduce the cost of farming and increase the yield from agriculture. This research work proposes the design of a generic IoT framework for improving agriculture yield by effectively scheduling irrigation and fertilization based on the crops current requirements, environmental conditions and weather forecasts. This work proposes the design of an affordable irrigation and fertilization system. The proposed fertilization system spreads fertilizers to the root directly. This reduces the amount of fertilizers required and thus reduces the cost and improves the soil health. A user friendly mobile application has been designed to deliver this information to the farmers in their regional language. The generic framework has been validated using a case study for chilli farming.

ID METABOLISM; INGESTION; BRAIN
AB Introduction: Aluminum phosphide (ALP), as an effective pesticide and a substance used for protecting rice during storage, has become one of the commonest causes of poisoning and even suicide in developing countries including Iran and India. The authors aimed to study the efficacy of sweet almond oil as an antidote in ALP toxicity. Methods: The present experimental study was conducted over 35 rats. The animals were divided into four groups: one group as the control group and three other groups which received ALP alone or ALP and sweet almond oil with different time intervals. In addition to estimating the survival rate of the animals, plasma cholinesterase activity as a possible factor affected in ALP poisoning was evaluated. Results: Treatment by intragastric irrigation of sweet almond oil resulted in significant reduction of mortality. Moreover, mean plasma cholinesterase levels were inhibited in groups receiving ALP. Conclusion: Oral sweet almond oil, if especially used immediately after poisoning with ALP, improves the survival rate.

AB The ligature mark is the most relevant feature of hanging. This study was undertaken with a view to determine the characteristic features of hanging and its association with ligature material or mode of suspension. Of a total medicolegal deaths reported at an Apex Medical Centre, hanging was noted in 4.1% cases, all suicidal with mortality rate of 1.5 per 100,000 population per year. The hanging was complete in 67.7% with nylon rope as the commonest type of ligature material used for ligation. The hanging mark was usually single, situated above thyroid cartilage, incomplete, prominent, and directed toward nape of neck. The mark of dribbling of saliva was seen in 11.8% cases. Facial congestion, petechial hemorrhage, and cyanosis were significantly seen in partial hanging. Though occasionally reported, the argent line was noted in 78.7% hanging deaths with neck muscle hemorrhage in 23.6% cases. Fracture of neck structure was predominant in complete hanging.

AB There is a widespread belief that India is currently in an agrarian crisis, with the spate of Suicides by farmers several states since the 1990s seen as a tragic symptom of the crisis. In the large and growing literature on the crisis some common themes emerge: the role of systemic economic reforms since 1991, the opening of the Indian economy to external competition and investment after decades of insulation; the impact on India of implementing the Agreement on Agriculture of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations; the alleged neglect of agriculture in the planning process since the mid-eighties; the decline of public investment in agriculture in response to rising fiscal deficits at the Centre and the States and above all, the slowing of the growth of agricultural output (particularly food grains) as well as a stagnation in yields per hectare of land since the nineties.
   This paper argues that the fundamental factor that is at the root Of file Current state of agriculture is India's pursuit, until the 1991 reforms, of a state-directed, state-controlled and state-dominated development strategy of import substituting industrialization with emphasis on heavy industry and insulation from the world economy. This strategy completely ignored the lessons of economic history: successful development lies in the transformation of economic structure by shifting a substantial part of the large initial share of labour force in agriculture and other low productivity activities in the informal sector to more productive off-farm activities through rural and urban industrialization with emphasis on labour-intensive manufactures to supply growing domestic and world markets and raising agricultural productivity. Leap-frogging the labour-intensive manufacturing stage of development altogether and focusing on information technology intensive services sector to bring about the transformation is not simply not feasible. This paper elaborates this main point by looking at major policy interventions in agriculture since independence It argues that there was no coherence, and little coordination among the centre, states and other policy making institutions in the decisions on the myriad interventions and their effectiveness in achieving their intended objectives was limited.

AB Agriculture is one of the main needs for human to survive. Agriculture has to tackle many problems like changing climate, water shortage, changing soil quality, etc. Due to the increasing demand for cereals and other crops for daily usage by the consumers there is a need for smarter implementation of irrigation and also develop farming methods that alter the basic eco systems and is less harmful to other creatures. India is one of highest crop producing countries all over the world. At the same time, India is facing the challenge of farmers committing suicide because of crop failure and debt. Most of the land in India is still being used for agriculture purposes. Still there exists several places that uses very primitive methods for irrigation, fertilization etc. This leads to the reduction in the crop yield and eventually less income for the farmers. This paper discusses the design and development of an IoT framework that helps farmers to improvise their methods of farming and also make the best use of their land for a better yield and income. The major goal of this IoT framework is to sense agriculture characteristics and advice farmers to properly grow and treat the crops. The system deploys a group of wireless sensor networks nodes deployed in the field for sensing agricultural parameters and the RF communication of WSN node is used to transmit the measured data to base station. Base station is connected to a decision support system. Based on the sensed parameters and the optimum values, the decision support system will generate an appropriate message for farmers. By using the collected data from the sensors, the proposed system will provide suggestions about the monitoring crop such as irrigation timings, directions for optimum usage of fertilizers etc. in accordance to the farmers' lands. An android application has been designed to deliver the messages to farmers in their regional language. The android app also gives information regarding the weather forecast and precaution to be taken based on the weather forecast.

AB Background: Several Western countries have established mother-baby psychiatric units for women with mental illness in the postpartum; similar facilities are however not available in most low and medium income countries owing to the high costs of such units and the need for specially trained personnel.
   Materials and Methods: The first dedicated inpatient mother-baby unit (MBU) was started in Bengaluru, India, in 2009 at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences in response to the growing needs of mothers with severe mental illness and their infants. We describe the unique challenges faced in the unit, characteristics of this patient population and clinical outcomes.
   Results: Two hundred and thirty-seven mother-infant pairs were admitted from July 2009 to September 2013. Bipolar disorder and acute polymorphic psychosis were the most frequent primary diagnosis (36% and 34.5%). Fifteen percent of the women had catatonic symptoms. Suicide risk was present in 36 (17%) mothers and risk to the infant by mothers in 32 (16%). Mother-infant bonding problems were seen in 98 (41%) mothers and total breastfeeding disruption in 87 (36.7%) mothers. Eighty-seven infants (37%) needed an emergency pediatric referral. Ongoing domestic violence was reported by 42 (18%). The majority of the mother infant dyads stayed for <4 weeks and were noted to have improved at discharge. However, 12 (6%) mothers had readmissions during the study period of 4 years. Disrupted breastfeeding was restituted in 75 of 87 (86%), mother infant dyads and mother infant bonding were normal in all except ten mothers at discharge.
   Conclusions: Starting an MBU in a low resource setting is feasible and is associated with good clinical outcomes. Addressing risks, poor infant health, breastfeeding disruption, mother infant bonding and ongoing domestic violence are the challenges during the process.

TI Monsoon variability, the 2015 Marathwada drought and rainfed agriculture
SO CURRENT SCIENCE
LA English
DT Review
DE Marathwada drought; rainfall variability; rainfed agriculture; RAINFO
ID INDIA
AB The impact of the drought of the summer monsoon of 2015 has been particularly large in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra which is now facing unprecedented water scarcity and more than one thousand farmers have committed suicide. Substantial losses in the production of important crops such as pulses have been reported in Maharashtra. Naturally, the Marathwada drought has been extensively covered in the print and electronic media. The large impact has been attributed to exceptionally large deficit in rainfall by some journalists and politicians, to two successive droughts in 2014 and 2015 by some and some have considered the drought to be a manifestation of climate change. In this article, we present an analysis of the Marathwada monsoon rainfall from 1871 onwards and show that the quantum of deficit rainfall in 2015 as well as the occurrence of two successive droughts is within the observed variability of the Marathwada rainfall and the 2015 monsoon rainfall also cannot be considered as a manifestation of climate change. Thus the large impact of 2015 is a reflection of poor management of water resources and agriculture, despite the long experience of rainfall variability. We show that the prediction by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) of a high chance of below normal rainfall or a drought on the all-India scale and the occurrence of El Nino could have been used to anticipate large deficiency in Marathwada rainfall. We suggest that the problem of lack of progress in the production of rainfed crops such as pulses has to be addressed by using the rich rainfall data sets in the country to generate information which can be used by farmers and agricultural scientists to identify strategies, which are tailored to the entire spectrum of rainfall variability experienced. Towards this end an interactive software 'RAINFO' has been developed at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology ((IITM), Pune to provide location-specific information derived from the IMD data, on the desired facets of rainfall variability.

AB Background: HIV among people who inject drugs (PWID) is a major public health challenge in India. This paper examines PWID in Delhi who also have male-to-male sex with a focus on overlapping HIV risk behaviours and the psychosocial correlates of a history of male-to-male anal sex.
   Methods: We analysed data collected in April-May of 2012 from a community-based sample of 420 male PWID in Delhi obtained using time location sampling.
   Results: One third (37%) of the men reported a history of anal sex with men, among whom just 16% used a condom at last anal sex. Almost all (93%) participants who had a history of anal sex with men also had sex with women. Chi-square tests revealed that a history of anal sex with men was associated with a higher number of female sexual partners and sharing of needles and syringes. Additionally, unprotected sex at last sex with a male partner was significantly associated with unprotected sex at last sex with regular and paid female partners. Multivariate binary logistic regression revealed that the psychosocial correlates of a history of anal sex with other men were: being aged 18-24 (OR = 2.4, p = 0.014), illiteracy (OR = 1.9, p = 0.033), having never been married (OR = 2.6, p = 0.007), a main source of income of crime/begging (OR = 3.1, p = 0.019), a duration of injecting drug use greater than 20 years (OR = 3.4, p = 0.035) and suicidal ideation (OR = 1.7, p = 0.048).
   Conclusion: Male-to-male sex was associated with psychosocial vulnerability, including a longer history of injecting drug use, suicidal ideation and socio-economic disadvantage. Given the extent of overlapping HIV risk behaviours, HIV programs for PWID would benefit from a strong focus on prevention of sexual HIV transmission, especially among male injectors who also have sex with other men.

DE Poisoning; primary care; tertiary care teaching hospital; treatment and
   prognosis
AB Poisoning is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in India and also a major health problem worldwide. Majority of the studies shows that insecticides and pesticides compounds are the most widely used agents for poisoning. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted to explore the hospital records of patients with acute poisoning cases. A structured proforma used to collect data regarding patients' demographic information, incidence of poisoning, cause and type of poisoning, clinical presentation of patient, treatment, and prognosis. Data were analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: A total 505 patient files with poisoning cases were admitted at emergency department. The mean age of the patients was 28.43 +/- 14 years (range 1-84 years). In gender-wise ratio, male patients (59%) were higher than the females (39%). The occurrence of poisoning was high 209 (41.38%) in young adult with age of 21-30 years. The causes of poisoning were suicide in 63.96% of cases. In majority, 310 (61.38%) patients consumed insecticides or pesticides. About 51.1% patients were treated at locally available medical facilities and 48.9% cases were brought to tertiary care center directly for the treatment. About 258 (51.08%) patients treated with gastric lavage, and for 9 (1.8%) patients endotracheal intubation was performed. The average stay in the hospital was 12.53 +/- 7.53 days and mortality was 42 (8.31%). Conclusion: This study highlights that the incidence of poisoning and its morbidity and mortality can be reduced by development and implementation of effective intervention at primary level by health care providers and strategies on preventive aspect.

AB Substancial crop losses occur in each year due to attacks by insect pests or microbial pathogens, the magnitude of which is so great that farmers unable to cope up with the losses and in despair resorted to suicides. Genetic engineering promises to have an enormous impact on the improvement of crop species. Gene transplants can rapidly accelerate development of disease and insect resistant plants. Progress in engineering insect resistance in transgenic plants has been achieved through the expression of the insect toxin gene of Bacillus thuringiensis in plants. The parasporal protein crystals produced as spores by this bacterium have a natural insecticidal effect. Experiments have shown that the region essential for toxicity resides in the N-terminal portion of the protein extending approximately from aminoacid 29 to aminoacid 610. Although disease resistant plants were developed first by a Belgium Biotechnology company in tobacco, now a number of other plants like tomato and cotton for different insect species. The Dept. of Biotechnology India had given permission to US based multinational Monsanto company to test 'Bt' cotton seeds of Bell guard resistance to perfect the technology after field trials which is still in the laboratory stage. Permissin has been given for field trials in different states of India including Andhra Pradesh. Consequently there was tremendous amount of commotion, public protests, destruction of cotton fields in AP and Karnataka fearing that terminator gene blocks germination after one season and this is considered lethal and posed a global threat to farmers, biodiversity, food and ecological security. The pros and cons of development of genetically altered terminator seed for boll guard disase of cotton, its utility in crop improvement, the undesirable side effects, economic and social aspects of the problem are discussed.

AB Aim: To estimate the prevalence and distribution of psychiatric morbidity, and study pattern of help-seeking in a community representative sample from the state of Uttar Pradesh in northern India.
   Method: A multi-stage, stratified, random cluster sampling was used. The survey was conducted on 3508 adults during 2015-16 using M.I.N.I 6.0.0, modified Fagerstrom Nicotine Dependence Scale for all forms of tobacco, questionnaires for epilepsy and intellectual disability. The WHO Pathway Interview Schedule was used to study pattern of help-seeking behaviour. Focused group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs) were also carried out.
   Result: Current and lifetime prevalence of 'ny mental morbidity' (excluding tobacco use disorders) was 6.08% and 7.97%, respectively. The prevalence of substance use disorders, was 16.36%, of which tobacco use disorders alone contributed 16.06%. Neurotic and depressive disorders were the next most common morbidity. Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders had a current prevalence of 0.09%. High-risk for suicide was reported to be 0.93%. Treatment gap varied between 75 and 100% for different disorders. FGDs and KIIs reflected a higher burden of substance use, including prescription drug abuse, substantial prevalence of cultural mental morbidity, deep rooted stigma, low help-seeking behaviour, and issues surrounding homeless mentally ill persons in the community.
   Conclusion: The survey revealed high mental morbidity and alarming treatment gap. FGDs and KIIs also highlight the burden of morbidity that probably goes un-noticed, due to socio-cultural systems and stigma. Findings from this survey are intended to be the groundwork for the (re) planning of mental healthcare infrastructure in the state.

AB Background: Carbofuran is a widely-used carbamate insecticide which is listed as highly hazardous (Class 1b) by the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of pesticides. We report the poisonings among children following exposure to carbofuran crystal form, which is used as a household remedy for head lice infestation.
   Methods: The medical case records from June 2016 to January 2019 of a Tertiary Care Hospital in rural Maharashtra, India, were examined for the pediatric poisoning due to exposure to blue crystals in sachets being sold as medication for head lice infestation and its confirmation as being carbofuran. A total of 14 such exposures were found among 64 cases of pediatric poisoning (excluding bites and sting envenomation), recorded in the above period. The children were evaluated for their presentations, manner of unintentional poisonings, clinical profile, and outcomes.
   Results: The results in carbofuran poisonings showed universal unintentional exposure with the majority of patients being infants and toddlers. It was the most significant single cause of poisoning, excluding bites and envenomation, in the above period. The clinical features of excessive cholinergic activity were consistent with the characteristics of carbamate poisoning. Comparison with other poisonings during the period did not show significant differences concerning variables such as age, sex, religion, and length of hospital stay.
   Conclusion: Unintentional poisoning of the class1 pesticide carbofuran, among younger children, is associated with misuse and availability in the environment. Our obtained data about the agent, host, and environmental factors related to the poisoning are consistent with data available on the literature.

TI LOCALIZED FOOD SYSTEMS: THE WAY TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE LIVELIHOODS AND
   ECOLOGICAL SECURITY -A REVIEW
SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES
LA English
DT Review
ID AGRICULTURE; AGROECOLOGY
AB The crisis of global agriculture and food systems is evident from FAO figures which indicate that; more than 850 million people currently face hunger and malnutrition. Some 815 million of these live in economically developing countries, of which 76% live in rural areas (FAO, 2004). The food insecurity in India is at an alarming situation reflected by a recent study by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). According to the International Food Policy Research Institute India ranks 93 out of 119 developing countries on the latest Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2006. (IFPRI, 2006). The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, Jean Ziegler's suggest a similar situation. Nearly 50% of the world's hungry live in India. Around 35% of India's population, 350 million, are considered to be food-insecure, consuming less than 80% of the minimum energy requirement. In rural India wide-spread food insecurity is shown by the fall of food grain-availability to 152 kg per capita, which is 23 kg less than in the 1990s. The poorest 30% of Indian households, who spend 70% of their income on food, are able to eat less than 1,700 kilo calories per day per person. (Ziegler, 2005). This situation is inspite of an increase of 25 percent in world food production in the past 40 years during which time developing countries have increased their annual crop production from 420 to 1,176 million tonnes (FAO, 2000 in Pretty et al., 2005) These impressive advances in productivity have not solved the challenges of food insecurity in many parts of world, and have resulted in socio-cultural, environmental and economic problems for present and future generations. Modern agricultural systems that one based on external input have eroded the very bases of natural resources upon which the production system depends. The impacts of chemicals used in agriculture are also important. These chemicals are not limited to crops and the fields but have affected the surrounding natural ecosystems in the landscape, and impact on soil, biodiversity, the food chain, pollinators, ground water and surface water. The fields under such intensive farming systems are under ecological crisis and the production level has started to decline. Furthermore, the majority of small holders with marginal lands and limited resources are unable to adopt expensive technologies. Under conditions of high production costs and collapsing prices for farm products the farmers are pushed out of options in the current system of agriculture. Many resource-poor farmers have been left with no choice and have committed suicide in India in the last few years. The search for alternative agriculture and food systems around the world has begun, and what Pretty (2003) calls a quiet revolution has started. This shows hope for the future by making the best of nature and of people's knowledge and collective capacities (Pretty 2003). The aim of this search are influenced by different factors in developed and developing countries. In developed countries aim is to protect the environment and natural resources for present and future generations. However in the developing world the globalised model of increased food production has not provided food security and has caused a significant degradation of natural and social assets.

AB Suicidal ideation is life-threatening and is prevalent among people living with HIV (PLWH). A dearth of such studies was conducted in China. This study investigated the prevalence of suicidal ideation and associated factors among PLWH who were former blood and/or plasma donors (FBPD) in a rural county in central China. Prospective respondents were randomly selected from a local registry; 176 PLWH who were FBPD joined the study. With informed consent, these PLWH and their spouse were interviewed separately and anonymously. Respectively, 34 and 8% of the sampled (index) PLWH self-reported having suicidal ideation and making a suicidal attempt in the last year. The multivariate analyses results showed that the index PLWH's Physical Function subscale score of the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey scale (Odds ratio (OR)=6.67, 95% CI=1.69-26.27, 25 percentiles against 75 percentiles), the Depression subscale score of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS; OR=9.26, 95% CI=1.32-64.77), and the spouse's Depression subscale score of the DASS (OR=7.64, 95% CI=1.37-42.77) were independently associated with the index PLWH's suicidal ideation. HIV-related variables (e.g., duration of diagnosis, treatment and side effects) and perceived discrimination of the index PLWH, and HIV status of the PLWH's spouse, were not significant factors. Depression is a risk factor for suicides. Moreover, depression may be contagious and the depression status of the spouse also matters. Treatments for depression and prevention intervention for suicides targeting PLWH in rural China are not readily available. Such services are greatly warranted and need to be provided to both the PLWH and his/her spouse.

TI Trends in cause-specific mortality among children aged 5-14 years from
   2005 to 2016 in India, China, Brazil, and Mexico: an analysis of
   nationally representative mortality studies
SO LANCET
LA English

ID SURVEILLANCE; BURDEN
AB Background With global survival increasing for children younger than 5 years of age, attention is required to reduce the approximately 1 million deaths of children aged 5-14 years occurring every year. Causes of death at these ages remain poorly documented. We aimed to explore trends in mortality by causes of death in India, China, Brazil, and Mexico, which are home to about 40% of the world's children aged 5-14 years and experience more than 200 000 deaths annually at these ages.
   Methods We examined data on 244 401 deaths in children aged 5-14 years from four nationally representative data sources that obtained direct distributions of causes of death: the Indian Million Death Study, the Chinese Disease Surveillance Points, mortality data from the Mexican Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia, and mortality data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. We present data on 12 main disease groups in all countries, with breakdown by communicable and nutritional diseases, non-communicable diseases, injuries, and ill-defined causes. To calculate age-specific and sex-specific death rates for each cause, we applied the national cause of death distribution to the UN mortality envelopes for 2005-16 for each country.
   Findings Unlike Brazil, China, and Mexico, communicable diseases still account for nearly half of deaths in India in children aged 5-14 years (73 920 [46.1%] of 160 330 estimated deaths in 2016). In 2016, India had the highest death rates in nearly every category, including from communicable diseases. Fast declines among girls in communicable disease mortality narrowed the gap by 2016 with boys in India (32.6 deaths per 100 000 girls vs 26.2 per 100 000 boys) and China (1.7 vs 1.5). In China, injuries accounted for the greatest proportions of deaths (20 970 [53.2%] of 39 430 estimated deaths, in which drowning was a leading cause). The homicide death rate at ages 10-14 years was higher for boys than for girls in Brazil, increasing annually by an average of 0.7% (0.3-1.1). In India and China, the suicide death rates were higher for girls than for boys at ages 10-14 years. By contrast, in Mexico it was higher for boys than for girls, increasing annually by an average of 2.8% (2.0-3.6). Deaths from transport injuries, drowning, and cancer are common in all four countries, with transport accidents among the top three causes of death for both sexes in all countries, except for Indian girls, and cancer in the top three causes for both sexes in Mexico, Brazil, and China.
   Interpretation Most of the deaths that occurred between 2005 and 2016 in children aged 5-14 years in India, China, Brazil, and Mexico arose from preventable or treatable conditions. This age group is important for extending some of the global disease-specific targets developed for children younger than 5 years of age. Interventions to control noncommunicable diseases and injuries and to strengthen cause of death reporting systems are also required.

AB More than 85% of the world's population lives in 153 low-income and middle-income countries (LAMICs). Although country-level information on mental health systems has recently become available, it still has substantial gaps and inconsistencies. Most of these countries allocate very scarce financial resources and have grossly inadequate manpower and infrastructure for mental health. Many LAMICs also lack mental health policy and legislation to direct their mental health programmes and services, which is of particular concern in Africa and South East Asia. Different components of mental health systems seem to vary greatly, even in the same-income categories, with some countries having developed their mental health system despite their low-income levels. These examples need careful scrutiny to derive useful lessons. Furthermore, mental health resources in countries seem to be related as much to measures of general health as to economic and developmental indicators, arguing for improved prioritisation for mental health even in low-resource settings. Increased emphasis on mental health, improved resources, and enhanced monitoring of the situation in countries is called for to advance global mental health.

AB The need to maximize agricultural productivity has made pesticides an indispensable part of current times. Farmers are unaware of the lurking consequences of the pesticide exposure, which endanger their health. It also puts the unsuspecting consumers in peril. The pesticides (from organophosphates, organochlorine, and carbamate class) disrupt the immune and hormonal signaling, causing recurrent inflammation, which leads to a wide array pathologies, including teratogenicity. Numerous farmers have fallen victim to neural disorders-driven suicides and lungs, prostate/breast cancer-caused untimely deaths. Green revolution which significantly escalated agricultural productivity is backfiring now. It is high time that environmental and agricultural authorities act to restrain the excessive usage of the detrimental chemicals and educate farmers regarding the crisis. This review discusses the biological mechanisms of pesticide-driven pathogenesis (such as the activation or inhibition of caspase, serine protease, acetylcholinesterase) and presents the pesticide-exposure-caused health deterioration in USA, India, and Africa. This holistic and critical review should be an eye-opener for general public, and a guide for researchers.

ID CARCINOMA; INGESTION
AB Corrosive gastric injury is common in India due to easily available acids which are ingested mostly for suicide attempt. Resulting gastric outlet strictures need operation in majority of the patients. We review our experience of surgical management of these cases. Thirty-seven consecutive patients over the last 4 years with corrosive gastric strictures were reviewed. Extent of gastric cicatrisation was assessed by endoscopy and barium study. Nutrition was maintained, if necessary by feeding jejunostomy. Early definitive operation was preferred. Outcome of surgery was assessed. Patients presented with vomiting, weight loss, and dysphagia. Twenty patients (54 %) had predominant gastric corrosive injury. The oesophageal stricture in other 17 patients (46 %) could be managed easily by endoscopic dilatation. Prepyloric short gastric stricture was found in 19 patients (51 %). Surgical procedures included stricturoplasty for short strictures and gastrojejunostomy for more extensive distal gastric cicatrisation. Complications included wound infection in six (16 %) patients and pneumonitis in four (11 %) patients. All patients gained weight within 6 to 8 weeks. Management of corrosive gastric injury depends on the extent of gastric involvement, associated oesophageal stricture, and general condition of the patient. Early definitive operation and avoiding gastric resection can give satisfactory outcome.

TI Poverty in Global Perspective: Is Shame a Common Denominator?
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB Focussing on the psychosocial dimensions of poverty, the contention that shame lies at the 'irreducible absolutist core' of the idea of poverty is examined through qualitative research with adults and children experiencing poverty in diverse settings in seven countries: rural Uganda and India; urban China; Pakistan; South Korea and United Kingdom; and small town and urban Norway. Accounts of the lived experience of poverty were found to be very similar, despite massive disparities in material circumstances associated with locally defined poverty lines, suggesting that relative notions of poverty are an appropriate basis for international comparisons. Though socially and culturally nuanced, shame was found to be associated with poverty in each location, variably leading to pretence, withdrawal, self-loathing, 'othering', despair, depression, thoughts of suicide and generally to reductions in personal efficacy. While internally felt, poverty-related shame was equally imposed by the attitudes and behaviour of those not in poverty, framed by public discourse and influenced by the objectives and implementation of anti-poverty policy. The evidence appears to confirm the negative consequences of shame, implicates it as a factor in increasing the persistence of poverty and suggests important implications for the framing, design and delivery of anti-poverty policies.

AB Background VISHRAM was a community-based mental health programme with the goal of addressing the mental health risk factors for suicide in people from 30 villages in the Amravati district in Vidarbha, central India. We aimed to assess whether implementation of VISHRAM was associated with an increase in the proportion of people with depression who sought treatment (contact coverage).
   Methods A core strategy of VISHRAM was to increase the demand for care by enhancing mental health literacy and to improve the supply of evidence-based interventions for depression and alcohol-use disorders. Intervention for depression was led by community-based workers and non-specialist counsellors and done in collaboration with facility-based general physicians and psychiatrists. From Dec 25, 2013, to March 10, 2014, before VISHRAM was introduced, we did a baseline cross-sectional survey of adults randomly selected from the electoral roll (baseline survey population). The structured interview was administered by field researchers independent of the VISHRAM intervention and included questions about sociodemographic characteristics, health-care service use, depression (measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ]-9), and mental health literacy. 18 months after VISHRAM was enacted, we repeated sampling methods to select a separate population of adults (18 month survey population) and administered the same survey. The primary outcome was change in contact coverage with VISHRAM, defined as the difference in the proportion of individuals with depression (PHQ-9 score >9) who sought treatment for symptoms of depression between the baseline and the 18 month survey population. Secondary outcomes were whether the distribution of coverage was equitable, the type of services sought, and mental health literacy.
   Findings 1887 participants completed the 18 month survey interview between Sept 18, and Oct 8, 2015. The contact coverage for current depression was six-times higher in the 18 month survey population (27.2%, 95% CI 21.4-33.7) than in the baseline survey population (4.3%, 1.5-7.1). Contact coverage was equitably distributed across sex, education, income, religion, and caste. Most providers consulted for care were general physicians. We observed significant improvements in a range of mental health literacy indicators, for example, conceptualisation of depression as a mental health problem and the intention to seek care for depression.
   Interpretation A grass-roots community-based programme in rural India was associated with substantial increase in equitable contact coverage for depression and improved mental health literacy. It is now crucially important to translate this knowledge into real-world practice by scaling-up this programme through the National Mental Health Programme in India.

AB Local zebu cattle breeds in Indian villages are crossbred with exotic breeds at an unprecedented rate without utilising the full potential of genomic technologies. In addition to agriculture produce, livestock, particularly cattle, constitute a vital source of livelihood for farmers in India. Age-old agricultural practices, errant monsoon, and frequent crop failures have resulted in Maharashtra having the highest number of farmer suicides in the country. Local cattle breeds are considered low-yield breeds and thus are primarily used as beasts of burden. Information on functional gene variants in Indian cattle breeds is scant and limited to PCR-RFLP study in few breeds. In this study, 32 samples from 8 cattle breeds were obtained from remote villages of Maharashtra state. By using the re-sequencing technology, we sequenced 403 bp of the exon IV CSN3 allele and inferred its haplotypes. From 32 samples, 14 genotypes (G1-G14) defined by 7 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) were identified. From these 14 genotypes, we reconstructed 3 haplotypes (H01, H02, and H03) and estimated their frequencies. Of the 3 haplotypes, two (H01 and H03) corresponded to CSN3*B4 and CSN3*B and CSN3*H and CSN3*G alleles, respectively. The third haplotype H02 was identified as a new allele and differed from CSN3*B4 and CSN3*B and CSN3*H and CSN3*G alleles by one nonsynonymous mutation at the position C5306T-Ile100Thr. The neighbour-joining tree reconstruction revealed haplotype sharing or hybridisation between B. t. indicus and B. t. taurus because the 3 haplotypes originated in this study clustered with A1, B2, B4, B, G, and H alleles, which were reported previously in both the subspecies of B. taurus. The occurrence of one new allele in a small sample size highlights the urgency to screen local zebu cattle breeds by using genomic tools for circumventing genetic erosion that is widespread in Indian villages in India.

AB In the post-liberalization frame, employment generation in rural non-farm sector has shown a considerable growth at an all-India level but in Maharashtra the growth of employment in this sector has been a bit stagnant. The present study has been undertaken with the objective of examining the structure, growth and developmental potentials of non-farm activities for employment generation in rural Maharashtra and the determinants of entry into this sector employment in the post-liberalization period since Maharashtra is one of the most urbanized states in India and also a state with maximum incidences of farmer suicides. Based on the unit level National Sample Survey data on employment and unemployment for four quinquinnial rounds 50th, 55th, 61st and 66th, it has been observed that majority of the non-farm workers in the state belonged to the Inland Western region in the post-liberalization frame comprising of Pune, Ahmadnagar and Sholapur districts. Gender disparity with regards to employment in rural non-farm sector has been observed as the employment share is dominated by the males while the females constitute a very low share of employment in the same. Employment in trade, hotels and restaurants has seen a considerable increase mainly for the male workers, followed by construction sector. Caste status, proxied by social groups categorized as Other Backward Classes have majority of employment in this sector but their educational levels have been quite low as compared to the "others" in the social groups. This puts forward the role of education and other skills required to obtain economically viable jobs in this sector. The paper thus suggests implementation of proper education and training programmes keeping into account the local conditions of the region of the state to enhance the skills of the rural population which would benefit and provide better possibility of getting employment in non-farm sector.

AB The study was designed to analyze the incidence and pattern of pesticide poisoning calls reported to the National Poisons Information Centre (NPIC), AIIMS, New Delhi and highlight the common classes of pesticides involved in poisoning. The telephone calls received by the Centre during the thirteen year period (1999-2012) were entered into a preset proforma and then into a retrievable database. A total of 4929 calls of pesticide poisoning were recorded. The data was analyzed with respect to age, gender, mode and type of poisoning. The age ranged from 1 to 65 years with the preponderance of males (M = 62.19%, F = 37.80%). The age group mainly involved in poisoning was 18-35 years. While 59.38% calls pertained to household pesticides, 40.61% calls related to agricultural pesticides. The common mode of poisoning was intentional (64.60%) followed by accidental (34.40%) and unknown (1%). Amongst the household pesticides, the highest number of calls were due to pyrethroids (26.23%) followed by rodenticides (17.06%), organophosphates (6.26%), carbamates (4.95%) and others (4.86%). In agricultural pesticides group, the organophosphates (9.79%) ranked the first followed by, aluminium phosphide (9.65%), organochlorines (9.31%), pyrethroids (3.87%), herbicides, weedicides and fungicides (3.20%), ethylene dibromide (2.82%), and others (1.70%). The data analysis shows a high incidence of poisoning due to household pesticides as compared to agricultural pesticides, clearly emphasizing the need for creating awareness and education about proper use and implementation of prevention programmes.

AB Background: Rehabilitative services in India are inadequate in dealing with the physical and psychosocial problems faced by stroke survivors. The present study assessed these problems and the associated sociodemographic factors. Methods: Discharged stroke patients were interviewed at home. Logistic regression analysis assessed associations between patient variables and their problems. Results: We interviewed 127 stroke patients. Patients with modified Rankin Scale score higher than 3 were more likely to have complaints of pain (odds ratio [OR] = 2.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03-4.33), sleeping difficulties (OR = 2.78, 95% CI = 1.34-5.78), and feelings of hopelessness (OR = 2.92, 95% CI = 1.23-6.93). Patients aged 60 years or above were more likely to have feelings of helplessness (OR = 3.64, 95% CI = 1.23-10.75) and hopelessness (OR = 3.28, 95% CI = 1.02-10.54). Male patients were more likely to have feelings of hopelessness (OR = 2.88, 95% CI = 1.06-7.80). Patients residing in rural areas had higher odds of having thoughts of death (OR = 17.18, 95% CI = 1.98-153.93). Married patients were more likely to face difficulty in asking for help (OR = 4.39, 95% CI = 1.19-16.15) and preferred home-based care (OR = 3.95, 95% CI = 1.11-14.05). Patients educated above 2nd grade were more likely to have feelings of hopelessness (OR = 6.31, 95% CI = 2.17-17.29) and anger (OR = 3.35, 95% CI = 1.39-8.07). Employed patients were more likely to have feelings of helplessness (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.03-8.54). Conclusions: Sociodemographic variables of stroke patients can predict their physical and psychosocial problems, which can help the health-care professionals optimize rehabilitation strategies. There is an urgent need of expert rehabilitative and palliative services in India.

AB Background -There is a rapid emergence of cardiovascular disease in India with economic development, leading to an increase in mortality due to these diseases. The exact causes of death in India, however, are not known.
   Subjects and methods - We studied randomly selected death records from 2222 (1385 men and 837 women) victims, aged 25-64 years, out of 3034 death records during 1999-2001 at the Municipal Corporation, Moraclabad. All the families of these victims could be contacted individually to find out the causes of death, by scientists/doctors-administered pre-tested verbal autopsy questionnaires, completed with the help of spouses and local treating doctors practising in the concerned lane. Social classes were assessed by a questionnaire based on attributes of per capita income, occupation, education, housing and ownership of consumer luxury items in the household.
   Results - Causes of mortality included infectious diseases (41.1%, n = 915) such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diarrhea/dysentery, hepatitis B, and inflammatory brain infections as the commonest causes of death in the urban population of North India. The second most common causes of death were circulatory diseases (29.1%, n = 646), including heart attacks (10.0%), strokes (7.8%), valvular heart disease (7.2%, n = 160), sudden cardiac death, and inflammatory cardiac disease (each 2.0%, n = 44). Malignant neoplasm (5.8%, n = 131), injury (14.0%, n = 313), including accidents, fire and falls, and poisonings were also quite common causes of death. Miscellaneous causes of death were noted in 9.1 % (n = 202) death records, including diabetes mellitus (2.2%, n = 49), suicides (1.8%, n = 41), congenital anomalies (1.0, n = 37), dental caries infections (1.9, n = 42), and burns (1.3%, n = 33). Pregnancy and perinatal causes (0.72%, n = 15) were not commonly recorded in our study. Circulatory diseases as the cause of mortality were statistically significantly more common among higher social classes (1-3) than in lower social classes (4 and 5) whose members died more often due to infections. Heart attacks, strokes, hypertension, diabetes and obesity were statistically significantly more common among higher social classes (1-3) as compared to classes 3 and 4, but tobacco intake showed only minor differences among various classes.
   Conclusions - This study indicates that circulatory diseases, injury and malignant diseases have become the major causes of death in India, after infections. Members of social classes 1-3 died more often due to circulatory diseases and members in lower social classes died more often due to infections. Urbanization with rapid changes in diet and lifestyle in various social classes, and possibly aging of the population seem to be responsible for the double burden of diseases, related to under- and over-nutrition, causing death in a developing economy. Monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate around the clock for 7 days, with data analysed chronobiologically can detect abnormal circadian patterns associated with a large increase in cardiovascular disease risk, greater than hypertension itself, allowing the institution of prophylactic treatment. Such prehabilitation may be particularly useful to curb the increasing burden of cardiovascular diseases in both developed and developing countries.

AB On 16 February, 2017, Anil Ramdas (1958-2012) was commemorated in Amsterdam, five years after his suicide. This Surinam born author and media personality of Hindustan ancestry, had developed in the course of time into a thought provoking progressive intellectual. The themes he cherished in his essays and in his work for Dutch television were migration and identity, the values of western civilisation and the need for civility. On his return to the Netherlands, in 2003, after a three year stay as a correspondent in India, he became aware that, due to a change in the general cultural atmosphere, tolerance for immigrants had diminished. It made him question his own role as a 'non-western intellectual'. In February 2011, Ramdas published Badal, a novel of ideas on an autobiographical basis. Most reviews emphasised the autobiographical aspect, including Badal's alcoholism: Badal had to be identical to Anil Ramdas. In this article, Badal is interpreted as a complex, multi-layered, a-chronological novel, which explores the same themes as Ramdas' essays, using intertextual references to other novels and especially to songs and films. In the final analysis, it is a novel about the human condition, about loss and the demise of illusions.

TI 'The Rani of Sirmur' Revisited: Sati and sovereignty in theory and
   practice*
SO MODERN ASIAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB In The Rani of Sirmur: An Essay in Reading the Archives', Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak offered a literary analysis of British records to demonstrate the inextricability of language from the colonial/imperial project's goal of world domination. Honing her arguments on the threat of a Himalayan queen (rani) to become sati' (i.e. immolate herself), Spivak interpreted the event as representative of the plight of subalterns and of third world women' in particular. However, a close reading of the records reveals profound discrepancies between Spivak's interpretation and conditions that existed in and around the kingdom at the time. This article contextualizes the rani's story by supplementing archival sources with folk traditions, local histories, and recent research on sati and Rajput women. It shows that the rani was actually an astute ruler, similar to her peers in the West Himalayan elite, and that her threat of suicide resulted from reasons that go beyond an alleged attempt at recovering agency from the dual oppressions of patriarchal indignity and an invasive superpower. The discourses about sati in contemporary texts are also investigated, revealing a considerable overlap in South Asian and European views of sati among Himalayan elites in turn-of-the-nineteenth-century northwest India.

DT Article
DE Microfinance; agrarian crisis; Andhra Pradesh; debt; farmer suicides
ID AGRICULTURAL LABOR; SELF-HELP; MICROCREDIT; FINANCE; POLICY
AB Within neoliberal development discourse, the poor are represented as entrepreneurial subjects for whom integration into formalized financial systems can facilitate their escape from poverty. This paper examines how the 2010 microfinance crisis in Andhra Pradesh reveals significant fault lines that underlie this narrative. It argues that the crisis of microfinance in Andhra Pradesh needs to be placed within the context of severe agrarian dislocations stemming from the impact of trade liberalization, drought cycles and a transformation of rural social relations. The contradictions are most strikingly represented in increasing rural differentiation and a generalized crisis of social reproduction among land-poor farmers and landless labourers. A massive influx of microfinance - driven by both state-operated programmes and private-sector institutions leveraged with cross-border financial flows found a ready clientele among various agrarian classes seeking to bolster consumption and roll over debt in conditions of significant uncertainty and distress. Yet in banking on this vulnerability, microfinance institutions socialized the contradictions of rural Andhra Pradesh and have ultimately been thrown into limbo through the unleashing of political and social forces unforeseen in neoliberal narratives of agrarian change.

ID PRIMARY-CARE; MAJOR DEPRESSION; HEALTH-CARE; DISORDERS; PSYCHOTHERAPY;

AB Background: International evidence on the cost and effects of interventions for reducing the global burden of depression remain scarce.
   Aims: To estimate the population-level cost-effectiveness of evidence-based depression interventions and their contribution towards reducing current burden.
   Method: Primary-care-based depression interventions were modelled at the level of whole populations in 14 epidemiological subregions of the world. Total population-level costs (in international dollars or 1$) and effectiveness (disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted) were combined to form average and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
   Results: Evaluated interventions have the potential to reduce the current burden of depression by 10-30%. Pharmacotherapy with older antidepressant drugs, with or without proactive collaborative care, are currently more cost-effective strategies than those using newer antidepressants, particularly in lower-income subregions.
   Conclusions: Even in resource-poor regions, each DALY averted by efficient depression treatments in primary care costs less than 1 year of average per capita income, making such interventions a cost-effective use of health resources. However, current levels of burden can only be reduced significantly if there is a substantial increase in treatment coverage.

TI A new definition of health? An open letter of autochthonous peoples and
   medical anthropologists to the WHO
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE

DT Article
DE Public health; Wellbeing; Ecology; Medical anthropology; Suicide
AB Currently, formany practitioners (hospital and liberals) and researchers (including public health), the WHO definition of health is outdated: first it seems more utopian than pragmatic; then, it proves unsuitable for a large part of the world population. There is clearly a need to refine this definition or propose additional criteria to be more relevant or discriminating. In this perspective, what can indigenous people offer in the elaboration of a new definition of health?
   In this article, leaders or representatives of autochthonous peoples, anthropologists and physicians from many cultural origins (Amazonia, Patagonia, Papua New-Guinea, Inuit, North-American Indian, sub-Saharan Africa, India, China, Melanesia and Polynesia) have tried to identify and explain several key concepts that WHO should reintegrate into its new definition of health: human equilibrium in nature, accepted spirituality and adaptation. On the sidelines of the application of COP21 decisions that should give back to man his place into the environment, autochthonous people leaders, anthropologists and MDs explain why these three concepts are fundamental and universal health determinants, and need to be included in a new WHO definition of health.

SO PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
DE Burn; Medico-legal; Homicide; Suicide
ID DOWRY DEATHS; ASSAULT; WIVES; INDIA
AB Objectives: To see the prevalence and nature of medico-legal burns among patients.
   Methodology: It is a retrospective observational study conducted at Fauji Foundation Hospital, Rawalpindi from April 1999 to April 2008. All patients of more then ten years of age, irrespective of sex with burn injuries were included in the study.
   Results: One hundred seventy eight patients were studied and among them one hundred forty six (82.02%) were accidental burns with more prevalence among females (81.50%). Twenty three (12.92%) patients were having homicidal burns and all were females while nine (5.06%) patients sustained suicidal burns and among them six (66.66%) were females. Majority of patients i.e. one hundred six were from 2(nd) and 3(nd) decade of life. Among homicidal injuries twenty one (65.62%) were from flame and two (6.26%) from acid. All suicidal patients sustained flame burns. Females are more commonly involved (66.66%) as compared to males (33.34%).
   Conclusion: Homicidal and suicidal burns are not uncommon especially among young women (i.e. 15 to 30 years of age) and every case should not be taken as accident until proved otherwise. A clinical forensic expert or concerned authorities should evaluate all these cases to minimise the likelihood of inaccurate diagnosis.

AB In spite of the diffusion of focus groups method across disciplines and in several areas of research, and although scholars have indicated the utility of this method in cross-cultural research and research with ethnic minority groups, focus groups have been used in this kind of study to a limited extent. One of the reasons for this might be due to the lack of confidence of the researcher in using this kind of method in culturally diverse populations. Being culturally sensitive and, at the same time, pursuing data comparability, makes doing cross-cultural focus groups research a difficult task that necessitates adequate planning and preparation. In this chapter, I present advantages and possible pitfalls of the use of focus groups in cross-cultural research, referring to my recent experience as moderator of focus group discussions in Italy, India and Australia. Suggestions and recommendations for the use of this method with culturally diverse groups are provided, looking at the three phases of the focus groups process: planning, conducting and analysing/reporting.

   EPIDEMIOLOGY; PREVENTION; TRAGEDY; INDIA; CHINA
AB Objectives Most data on self-poisoning in rural Asia have come from secondary hospitals. We aimed to: assess how transfers from primary to secondary hospitals affected estimates of case-fatality ratio (CFR); determine whether there was referral bias according to gender or poison; and estimate the annual incidence of all self-poisoning, and of fatal self-poisoning, in a rural developing-world setting.
   Methods Self-poisoning patients admitted to Anuradhapura General Hospital, Sri Lanka, were reviewed on admission from 1 July to 31 December 2002. We audited medical notes of self-poisoning patients admitted to 17 of the 34 surrounding peripheral hospitals for the same period.
   Findings A total of 742 patients were admitted with self-poisoning to the secondary hospital; 81 died (CFR 10.9%). 483 patients were admitted to 17 surrounding peripheral hospitals. Six patients (1.2%) died in peripheral hospitals, 249 were discharged home, and 228 were transferred to the secondary hospital. There was no effect of gender or age on likelihood of transfer; however, patients who had ingested oleander or paraquat were more likely to be transferred than were patients who had taken organophosphorus pesticides or other poisons. Estimated annual incidences of self-poisoning and fatal self-poisoning were 363 and 27 per 100 000 population, respectively, with an overall CFR of 7.4% (95% confidence interval 6.0-9.0).
   Conclusion Fifty per cent of patients admitted to peripheral hospitals were discharged home, showing that CFRs based on secondary hospital data are inflated. However, while incidence of self-poisoning is similar to that in England, fatal self-poisoning is three times more common in Sri Lanka than fatal self-harm by all methods in England. Population based data are essential for making international comparisons of case fatality and incidence, and for assessing public health interventions.

AB Background: Floods are the most common type of natural disaster, which have a negative impact on mental health. Following floods, survivors are vulnerable to develop PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), depression, anxiety and other mental health problems.
   Aim: The aim is to study the psychiatric morbidity in the persons affected by floods during December 2015.
   Materials and methods: This study was carried out in Chennai and Cuddalore. In total, 223 persons who were directly exposed to floods were assessed. PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version, Beck's Depression Inventory, Beck's Anxiety Inventory and World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Scale (WHO-5) were used in the study. Chi-square test was used to compare the means.
   Results: Overall, psychiatric morbidity was found to be 45.29%; 60 (26.9%) persons had symptoms of PTSD. Anxiety was found in 48 (27.4%) and depression was found in 101 (45.29%) persons; and 11 (4.9%) persons have reported an increase in substance abuse.
   Conclusion: Following disaster like floods, there is a need for better preparedness in terms of basic necessities and medical and psychological assistance, particularly emphasizing the needs of older persons in order to prevent the development of psychiatric problems.

AB Background Observational evidence suggests that community-based services for people with schizophrenia can be successfully provided by community health workers, when supervised by specialists, in low-income and middle-income countries. We did the COmmunity care for People with Schizophrenia in India (COPSI) trial to compare the effectiveness of a collaborative community-based care intervention with standard facility-based care.
   Methods We did a multicentre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial at three sites in India between Jan 1, 2009 and Dec 31, 2010. Patients aged 16-60 years with a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia according to the tenth edition of the International Classification of Diseases, Diagnostic Criteria for Research (ICD-10-DCR) were randomly assigned (2:1), via a computer-generated randomisation list with block sizes of three, six, or nine, to receive either collaborative community-based care plus facility-based care or facility-based care alone. Randomisation was stratified by study site. Outcome assessors were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was a change in symptoms and disabilities over 12 months, as measured by the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) and the Indian disability evaluation and assessment scale (IDEAS). Analysis was by modified intention to treat. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN 56877013.
   Findings 187 participants were randomised to the collaborative community-based care plus facility-based care group and 95 were randomised to the facility-based care alone group; 253 (90%) participants completed follow-up to month 12. At 12 months, total PANSS and IDEAS scores were lower in patients in the intervention group than in those in the control group (PANSS adjusted mean difference -3.75, 95% CI -7.92 to 0.42; p=0.08; IDEAS -0.95, -1.68 to -0.23; p=0.01). However, no difference was shown in the proportion of participants who had a reduction of more than 20% in overall symptoms (PANSS 85 [51%] in the intervention group vs 44 [51%] in the control group; p= 0.89; IDEAS 75 [48%] vs 28 [35%]). We noted a significant reduction in symptom and disability outcomes at the rural Tamil Nadu site (-9.29, -15.41 to -3.17; p=0.003). Two patients (one in each group) died by suicide during the study, and two patients died because of complications of a road traffic accident and pre-existing cardiac disease. 18 (73%) patients (17 in the intervention group) were admitted to hospital during the course of the trial, of whom seven were admitted because of physical health problems, such as acute gastritis and vomiting, road accident, high fever, or cardiovascular disease.
   Interpretation The collaborative community-based care plus facility-based care intervention is modestly more effective than facility-based care, especially for reducing disability and symptoms of psychosis. Our results show that the study intervention is best implemented as an initial service in settings where services are scarce, for example in rural areas.

AB Self-immolation is a self-destructive conduct described since antiquity. Its frequency is variable from one country to another and it is a real public health problem in parts of the world. In Tunisia, after the 2011 revolution the problem of self-immolation protest has been highly publicized giving the impression of an increase in this phenomenon. This is a retrospective analysis of all fatal self-immolation cases, collected over a 20-year period (1996-2015) at the Forensic Medicine Department of the Farhat Hached University Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia. A total of 41 cases were collected, of which 23 were men (56%). The mean age was 36.1 years. Prior to 2011, 78.9% of the victims of self-immolation were women and after 2011, 86.4% were men. The rural origin of the victims was found in 56.25% of the cases. History of psychiatric illness was found in four individuals. The self-immolation took place in the victims' homes in 19 cases (46.3%). It came after a conjugal or family conflict in 14 cases (34.1%) and it is of protest character in 8 cases (19.5%). This study confirmed the increasing frequency of self-immolation in Tunisia after the 2011 revolution and noted a change in the victims' profiles.

AB This study attempted to evaluate religious coping and its correlates among patients presenting with self-harm to an emergency setting and compared it with a healthy control group. Religious coping was assessed using brief RCOPE. Beck Hopelessness Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Barratt Impulsivity Scale, Scale for Suicidal Ideations and Irritability Depression Anxiety scale were used to assess for hopelessness, depression, impulsiveness, suicidal ideations and irritability respectively. The study included 32 subjects with depression and 77 subjects without any psychiatric diagnosis who presented with self-harm and 50 healthy controls. Compared to healthy controls, those with self-harm irrespective of presence or absence of psychiatric diagnosis less often used positive religious coping and more often used negative religious coping. Further, among those without psychiatric diagnosis (with self harm), there was positive correlation of negative religious coping with impulsivity and hopelessness. Among those without psychiatric diagnosis with self-harm, both positive and negative religious coping correlated positively with depressive scores, severity of suicidal ideations, anxiety and irritability, but associations were stronger for negative religious coping than that for positive religious coping. The findings of the present study suggest that those who indulge in self harm have lower use of positive religious coping and higher use of negative religious coping.

AB The aim of this retrospective epidemiological study was to investigate the demographical, etiological and clinical characteristics of acute drug poisonings in Iasi County, Romania. All patients were referred and admitted in the Toxicology Clinic of "Sf. loan" Emergency Clinic Hospital Iasi, Romania. Between 2003 and 2009, 811 cases of acute drug poisonings were recorded, counting for 28.43% from the total number of poisonings. The majority of these poisonings resulted in mild (51.94%) and medium (28.35%) clinical forms, while 19.71% were coma situations. In all, 63.51% of patients originated from urban areas, 39.94% were unemployed and the patients were predominantly women (66.46%). A high percentage (97.27%) were suicide attempts, using only one type of drug (65.88%) and the 21-30 years group (29.8%) records the highest incidence, for both women and men. The most frequently involved drugs were benzodiazepines 13.69%, anticonvulsive drugs 8.63%, barbiturates 8.51% and cardiovascular drugs 5.92%. Drugs combinations were recorded in 32.92% of cases and 1.2% were combinations between drugs and other substances. Mortality was the outcome in 0.3% of the total registered number of acute drug poisonings. This study underlines that in order to provide a proper management of these situations, a Regional Poison Information Center is absolutely necessary.

TI Burden of poisoning on a critical care unit in southern India
SO NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
LA English
DT Article
ID SELF-HARM; SUICIDE
AB Background. Poisoning inflicts a considerable economic cost on the health sector. Few cases of poisoning may require intensive management in a critical care unit and thus add to the financial burden. In this study, our primary objective was to analyse the financial burden of poisoning on critical care facilities and the secondary objective was to analyse the critical care needs and treatment outcomes of patients with poisoning.
   Methods. We did this retrospective study of patients admitted with poisoning in the critical care unit of Government Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala (12-bedded critical care unit of 2500-bedded medical college hospital) from January 2011 to December 2013. Patients <13 years of age were excluded. Cost was estimated using the hospital expenditure data.
   Results. A total of 118 patients, comprising 2.5% of the total critical care unit admissions, were included in the study. The average cost of providing critical care for cases of poisoning was (sic)367 333 per annum. Organophosphorus poison was the most common agent (33.9%) with the highest cost per admission of approximately (sic)18 500. The highest number of deaths was due to phosphide poisoning with a case fatality rate of 83%.
   Conclusions. Poisoning imposes a considerable burden on the limited critical care services. Organophosphorus was the most common substance consumed for poisoning and it led to the highest expenditure per admission.

TI Agro-feminism: An Ideology of Hope for Dalit Women
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE Agro-feminism; land ownership; equality; Dalit women; social justice
AB This study was undertaken in Vellore district of Tamil Nadu, South India, which largely depends on agriculture and leather industries to employ its economically active population. Agriculture engages 2.1 million of its population while the leather and allied factories accommodate a substantial amount of the rest. Both sectors share the water available but the leather industries consume a large amount of water and pollute it for agriculture. Moreover, agriculture suffers from the land appropriation for Special Economic Zones (SEZ), the failure of Green Revolution, and the industrialization of agriculture, which obliterate the scope for employment of women. Under these circumstances, women villagers face severe health crisis, sexual abuses, food insecurity and low wages. The Thendral Movement that I describe here carries out people-centered activities to empower women and instill in them the optimistic ideology of agro-feminism. Agro-feminism affirms the importance of food production and the role of women in it. As the rural-feudal set up is patriarchal, agro-feminism denounces every aspect of male domination in the agricultural community and liberates women in feminist agricultural methods to preserve natural resources in their original form. This study concludes that by promoting agro-feminism, women would claim land ownership legally to secure lives for women by addressing the problems of migration, internal refugees, unequal wages, destitution, poverty, exploitation, suicide attempts, and violence against women.

AB Background, Setting and Design: The chronicity, distress, high rates of comorbidity and varying degree of non response to treatment in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) may contribute to suicidal behavior. There is relatively little information on suicidal behavior in OCD subjects. Our study design is Single point non-invasive, cross sectional, clinical study of new and follow up cases.
   Materials and Methods: Assessment of Suicidal Behavior in patients of OCD attending the adult Psychiatry O.P.D. of Chatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Medical University (CSMMU) U.P. Lucknow using (DSM-IV) criteria for diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I disorders, Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Rating Scale, Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI), Beck's Hopelessness Scale (BHS).
   Statistical Analysis: Mean standard deviation and t test for independent samples, Pearson's correlation coefficient.
   Results: Statistically significant differences were seen in the SSI score between the "Clinical" and "Sub-Clinical cases" with Clinical group having higher scores. Value of correlation coefficient between YBOCS score and SSI and BHS score is positive and statistically significant (P<0.01).
   Conclusion: "Clinical" group of patients had significantly higher scores of suicidal ideation measured by Scale of Suicidal Ideation (SSI). There was a significantly positive correlation between disease severity (YBOCS Score) and degree of suicidal ideation (SIS Score).

There may be a significant correlation between rates of depression and altitude, but little data exist outside the United States. The purpose of the present study is to conduct a survey of depression among the elderly highlanders in Asia. We enrolled 114 persons aged 60 years or older (mean, 69.2 +/- A 6.7 years; women, 58.8 %) in Domkhar (altitude, 3800 m), Ladakh, India and 173 ethnic Tibetans (mean, 66.5 +/- A 6.1 years; women, 61.3 %) in Yushu (altitude, 3700 m), Qinghai Province, China. The two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) and the geriatric depression scale were administered. A psychiatrist interviewed the subjects who had a positive score on the PHQ-2. The results of the interview with the residents conducted by the specialist showed that two cases (1.8 %) from Domkhar and four (2.3 %) from Qinghai had depression. Despite the high altitude, the probability of depression was low in elderly highlander in Ladakh and Qinghai. Our finding seems to indicate that cultural factors such as religious outlook and social/family relationship inhibit the development of depression.

AB Objective To assess the effectiveness of a counselling intervention in antenatal care settings for pregnant women who report domestic violence. Design Pre-experimental study with pretest-posttest design. Settings Two public hospitals in Mumbai, India. Sample In all, 2778 pregnant women accessing antenatal care (ANC) in the hospitals from February to November 2016 were approached for study participation; 2515 women consented. These women were screened by trained counsellors for domestic violence during pregnancy (domestic violence during pregnancy). Domestic violence during pregnancy was reported by 16.2% (408) of women. Of these, 155 women sought counselling services. Post-intervention analyses were carried out with 142 women at 6 weeks post-delivery; 13 women were not contactable. Methods The 442 women who reported domestic violence during pregnancy were provided a minimum of two counselling sessions by trained counsellors during their ANC visits. A counselling intake form was used to collect pre- and post-intervention data. Main outcome measures Prevalence of domestic violence during pregnancy, change in women's ability to cope, safety, and health. Results Prevalence of domestic violence during pregnancy (16.1%) was comparable to those of common obstetric complications routinely screened for during ANC. In all, 60-65% women reported cognitive changes such as recognising impact of violence and need to speak out against it. In all, 50.7% women took action at the individual level to address domestic violence during pregnancy. This change was not statistically significant (P-value 0.193). Of the women studied, 35.9% adopted at least one safety measure, and 84% of the women reported better health status post-intervention. Conclusion Routine enquiry and counselling for domestic violence during pregnancy are effective in improving women's ability to cope, safety, and health. Funding This study was funded by The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. Tweetable abstract Improving coping strategies, safety and health of pregnant women who reported domestic violence by providing counselling in antenatal care setting.

TI Automated versus physician assignment of cause of death for verbal
   autopsies: randomized trial of 9374 deaths in 117 villages in India
SO BMC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE COD classification; Algorithms; Physician coding; Verbal autopsies
AB BackgroundVerbal autopsies with physician assignment of cause of death (COD) are commonly used in settings where medical certification of deaths is uncommon. It remains unanswered if automated algorithms can replace physician assignment.MethodsWe randomized verbal autopsy interviews for deaths in 117 villages in rural India to either physician or automated COD assignment. Twenty-four trained lay (non-medical) surveyors applied the allocated method using a laptop-based electronic system. Two of 25 physicians were allocated randomly to independently code the deaths in the physician assignment arm. Six algorithms (Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC), King-Lu, InSilicoVA, InSilicoVA-NT, InterVA-4, and SmartVA) coded each death in the automated arm. The primary outcome was concordance with the COD distribution in the standard physician-assigned arm. Four thousand six hundred fifty-one(4651) deaths were allocated to physician (standard), and 4723 to automated arms.ResultsThe two arms were nearly identical in demographics and key symptom patterns. The average concordances of automated algorithms with the standard were 62%, 56%, and 59% for adult, child, and neonatal deaths, respectively. Automated algorithms showed inconsistent results, even for causes that are relatively easy to identify such as road traffic injuries. Automated algorithms underestimated the number of cancer and suicide deaths in adults and overestimated other injuries in adults and children. Across all ages, average weighted concordance with the standard was 62% (range 79-45%) with the best to worst ranking automated algorithms being InterVA-4, InSilicoVA-NT, InSilicoVA, SmartVA, NBC, and King-Lu. Individual-level sensitivity for causes of adult deaths in the automated arm was low between the algorithms but high between two independent physicians in the physician arm.ConclusionsWhile desirable, automated algorithms require further development and rigorous evaluation. Lay reporting of deaths paired with physician COD assignment of verbal autopsies, despite some limitations, remains a practicable method to document the patterns of mortality reliably for unattended deaths.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02810366.

   Impeding factors; Organic food products
ID WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; PREFERENCES; ATTITUDES
AB Purpose - Food gives us essential nutrients to lead a healthy lifestyle but lately it has been found that many food products have become hazardous due to contamination and lead to many diseases. The rampant use of pesticides and chemical-based fertilizers in agriculture has, increased the productivity but at the same time they have created an alarming situation for the environment. The demand of the hour is to therefore to encourage organic farming and offer a better choice to consumers as well as save the environment. The purpose of this paper is to explore and understand the factors affecting perception of consumers on organic food products in Indian context.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study used a structured survey of 150 respondents covering Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) of Ghaziabad, Noida and Faridabad (India). Exploratory research was used to know the variables from the literature that affect the perception of consumers regarding organic food. Descriptive research was used to understand the demographic profile of the organic food consumer's. Conclusive research design was used to test the hypotheses based upon the motivating and inhibiting factor in the growth of organic food.
   Findings - The data collected from the survey were analyzed using t-test, chi(2) test, factor analysis and multiple linear regression tests. Results indicated that the intention to purchase organic products was impacted by the consumer's belief on the safety and health aspect of the product, trust and certification, information and availability and lifestyle and are hence drivers of growth. And certain impeding factors were identified like doubt in the professed quality of organic food, lack of awareness and price parity.
   Social implications - There are enough evidences of fertile land being converted into wasteland because of use of agro-chemical-based fertilizers in farming. There are also enough incidents of polluted water (ground and surface) due to agrochemical-based farming. Heavy use of pesticides leads to adverse effect on the health of farmers also. There were many reports of farmers committing suicide because of debt due to heavy investment on pesticides and fertilizers. Organic farming is a win-win proposition for environment, farmers and consumer's.
   Originality/value - The study was an effort to understand awareness and perception of organic food consumers in urban India post-agriculture revolution. The result would help the organic food producing and marketing companies to understand the factors that influence the belief of consumers when they purchase organic food and henceforth they can formulate communication strategies and marketing policy based on consumer's expectations.

TI Family matters! - The caregivers' perspective of Mental Healthcare Act
   2017
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Review
DE Caregiver; family; Mental Healthcare Act 2017
AB Mental health continues to fight for acceptance in health care all over the world. The need for a separate act for mental illnesses proves this fact even more. The very nature of the mental illness has necessitated legislation to aid the service providers and service users. The Mental Healthcare Act 2017 has taken great initiatives in terms of protection of human rights for people with mental illness such as the inclusion of mental illness in health insurance, stress on informed consent, decriminalization of suicide, and introduction of advance directives (ADs) and punishment to those who violate the law. However, in a country like India where the family as a unit has more significance than personal autonomy, the new act emphasizes the patient's rights and, in doing so, may make the doctors more defensive and fearful in making clinical decisions, thus shifting the burden to the shoulders of the family members. There is a need for suitable amendments to include the family's concerns as well; otherwise, the present act would stand as an alien Western law enforced on Indian cohesive family dynamics. Qualitative studies are required from the family's perspective to illustrate the hindrances that the patients' families are facing. In the context of Indian family structure and dynamics and working in the Indian community, we feel that without suitable amendments to include the family's concerns, the present act would stand as an alien Western law enforced on Indian cohesive family dynamics.

AB Pediatric burns admitted to the tertiary care burn facility of Kanchi Kamakoti CHILDS Trust Hospital in Chennai (India) were retrospectively analysed between 1992 and 2003. Five hundred and thirty-five burn cases were admitted during these years. These children belonged to the age group of 0-18 years (as WHO has increased the pediatric age group range to 0 to 18 years). The etiology of these burns was looked into and the outcome of these patients in respect to etiology and complications were studied. After analysis, they were classified according to age, sex, TBSA and the occurrence of infection during the course of treatment. The complications that really affected the outcome were looked into and infection ranked first in fatal cases. Inhalation burns were not very common in our group and were associated only with large flame burns, which occur when a child is burnt while the mother commits suicide, or in cases of abuse of female children in a closed room with lots of inflammable upholstery. Scalds were the most common type of burn among children under 4 years of age. Flame burns predominated the older age group. Although there were 13 deaths among the entire group, the majority occurred within the 2-4 years age group. There was no significant gender difference with respect to mortality. Large burn size and infection were the strongest predictors of mortality. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

DT Article
AB Objective: The objective of this study was to follow up a cohort of subjects who completed detoxification treatment and a deaddiction program based on the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) model. The factors associated with complete abstinence were investigated. Method: Patients (187 men) admitted consecutively to an addiction facility, who fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence, were recruited for the study. Patients with major psychopathology were excluded from the cohort. The program was based on the principles of AA. The final outcome at 1 year was determined by visiting the patient and talking to the family and members of the local AA group. Results: Of the 187 initially recruited, five were excluded due to the presence of major psychopathology, one committed suicide and seven could not be traced. Of the 174 patients followed up, 58 (33.3%) remained sober (complete abstinence for the past year) at 1 year. Patients coming from distant places and those with follow-up workers in their localities fared better than those from the local area and those from towns where there was no one to motivate them to continue with AA meetings. These variables were significantly associated with sobriety even after adjusted for other confounders using multivariate techniques. Conclusions: A third of the cohort remained sober at 1-year follow-up. The patients' initial motivation and continued support once they returned to their communities were associated with being sober at follow-up.

SO CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE plant poisoning; suicide; Cerbera manghas
AB Objective. Self-poisoning with plant seeds or fruits is a common method of self-harm in South Asia. While most deaths follow ingestion of Thevetia peruviana (yellow oleander) seeds, other plants are locally common. During review of fatal injuries seen in a teaching hospital in eastern Sri Lanka, we noted cases of fatal self-poisoning with Cerbera manghas (sea mango, pink eyed cerbera, odollam tree) fruits. Methods. We reviewed the post-mortem records of the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital and extracted data on all cases of fatal injury. Results. During 2001 and 2002, 315 post mortems for injury were performed in Batticaloa Teaching Hospital. Intentional self-harm was responsible for 48.6% of cases. While T. peruviana was responsible for 33 deaths, C. manghas self-poisoning caused seven deaths. C. manghas cases had typical features of cardenolide poisoning with cardiac dysrhythmias and hyperkalemia. In the absence of pacing facilities and anti-digoxin Fab, management involved administration of atropine and of insulin and dextrose to lower serum potassium concentrations. Conclusions. C. manghas self-poisoning has only previously been reported from Kerala and Tamil Nadu in south India. While uncommon in other parts of Sri Lanka, it has become a common method of self-harm in one east coast district, accounting for 20% of fatal self-harm with plants in one hospital. Management was inadequate with the available resources, emphasising the need for an affordable antitoxin for plant cardenolide poisoning.

AB India is a country where agriculture and agriculture related industries are the major source of living for the people. Agriculture is a major source of economy of the country. It is also one of the country which suffer from major natural calamities like drought or flood which damages the crop. This leads to huge financial loss for the farmers thus leading to the suicide. Predicting the crop yield well in advance prior to its harvest can help the farmers and Government organizations to make appropriate planning like storing, selling, fixing minimum support price, importing/exporting etc. Predicting a crop well in advance requires a systematic study of huge data coming from various variables like soil quality,pH ,EC,N,P,K etc. As Prediction of crop deals with large set of database thus making this prediction system a perfect candidate for application of data mining. Through data mining we extract the knowledge from the huge size of data. This paper presents the study about the various data mining techniques used for predicting the crop yield. The success of any crop yield prediction system heavily relies on how accurately the features have been extracted and how appropriately classifiers have been employed. This paper summarizes the results obtained by various algorithms which are being used by various authors for crop yield prediction, with their accuracy and recommendation.

TI A STUDY OF CORROSIVE INJURY OF UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT- STUDY OF
   SURGICAL ASPECTS OF ACUTE STAGE AND ITS SEQUELAE
SO JOURNAL OF EVOLUTION OF MEDICAL AND DENTAL SCIENCES-JEMDS
LA English
DT Article
ID INGESTION
AB BACKGROUND
   Corrosive injury to upper gastrointestinal tract is an agonizing experience for both patient and treating physician. Though formulations of household cleansing agents have become safer in recent times, corrosive injury still remains common clinical problem in many countries particularly India. Lye is most commonly ingested caustic in west. Acid ingestion is a commoner cause of upper gastrointestinal tract injury in our country. Childhood injuries are usually accidental while suicide is frequent motive in young adults.
   METHODS
   This is a prospective observational study. All the patients who presented to the Emergency Department or OPD in M.Y. hospital with history of Corrosive Agent Ingestion from Year March 2016 to July 2017 were included in the study.
   RESULTS
   In our study, the most common symptom is dysphagia which was present in 95% (59/62), chest pain 65% (40/62), vomiting 47% (29/62), abdominal pain 15% (9/62), drooling of secretions 60% (37/62), Hematemesis 10% (6/62). The site of lesion is predominantly oesophagus with 23% mid oesophagus (14/62), 19% distal oesophagus (11/62), 23% involving both mid and distal oesophagus (14/62), stomach 16% (10/62) and single case involving duodenum. Seven out of 62 patients presented to us with signs of acute abdomen with X-ray abdomen revealing gas under diaphragm. Three patients after adequate resuscitation were taken for exploratory laparotomy. Remaining four patients succumbed to resuscitation. 27% (16/62) had severe oesophageal injury. In our study, oesophageal stricture was present in 75% cases (46/62), gastric outlet obstruction in 16% cases (10/62), epigastric pain due to GERD in 20% cases (12/62).
   CONCLUSIONS
   Corrosive injury of the upper gastrointestinal tract is a common problem with variable clinical presentations. Acid injury is more common in developing countries like India. The depth of injury is the most important determinant of the outcome. Early endoscopy is helpful in assessing the extent of injury to plan future management of the patient. Nutritional support is given by total parenteral nutrition and feeding jejunostomy. Nasogastric tube and antibiotics have no role in preventing stricture. Endoscopic dilatation is the treatment of choice for oesophageal stricture. Surgery remains the last option for endoscopic failure and for patients who develop complications on endoscopic dilatation.

AB Background: Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a chronic and disabling psychiatric illness with waxing and waning course. Lithium is the mainstay of treatment for Bipolar disorder (BD). There is limited literature on the clinical markers of Lithium treatment response from south Asia.
   Methods: Two hundred and ten individuals with BD I and a history of at least 6 months of treatment with Lithium were recruited from the outpatient services of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) after obtaining informed consent. A diagnosis of BD I was made according to the DSM-IV criteria. The characterization of response to lithium prophylaxis was done using NIMH Retrospective Life Chart and "Retrospective Criteria of Long Term Treatment Response in Research Subjects with Bipolar Disorder" scale.
   Results: There were 132 (62.86%) good responders and 78 (37.14%) non-responders. Good responders were noted to have less number of hospitalizations and more onset episode of depression than non-responders. Using continuous phenotype, Lithium response was inversely correlated with total number of episodes, number of episodes of mania/depression, number of hospitalisations and presence of suicide attempt. Multivariate analysis only revealed number of episodes and hospitalization to be associated with Lithium response.
   Conclusion: Our Lithium response rates were higher than what have been reported in the few previous studies. Illness severity was the only factor associated with Lithium response. There is a need to examine this question in larger prospective samples and to focus on biological/molecular markers of treatment response.

AB Objective. Abuse of women has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Data about abuse from developing countries are scarce, especially from Muslim societies. Our objective was to investigate domestic violence before and during pregnancy among women in an urban area of Pakistan. Design. Population-based cohort study. Setting. An urban community in Hyderabad, Pakistan. Population. Thousand three hundred and twenty-four pregnant women at 20-26 weeks gestation. Methods. Socio-demographic and reproductive history data were obtained through structured interviews. We used a modified World Health Organization screening instrument to assess women's experience of domestic violence. Measures. Physical, sexual, and verbal abuse and demographic characteristics. Results. The majority of women had received some schooling and in most households the husbands were employed; by Pakistani standards, they were middle class. Young maternal age, having an unemployed husband and one with other wives/partners, and having had a prior pregnancy were significant predictors of abuse. In the six months prior to and/or during pregnancy, 51% reported experiencing verbal, physical or sexual abuse. Twenty percent reported physical or sexual abuse alone. Sixteen percent of women considered suicide as a response to the abuse. Conclusions. Domestic violence is common among urban Pakistani women of reproductive age, suggesting a need for universal screening during antenatal care, and for support and referral. Further research is needed to determine factors that place women at greatest risk, and to assess the impact of domestic violence on pregnancy outcomes.

TI Caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease: a qualitative study from
   the Indian 10/66 Dementia Research Network
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE dementia; Alzheimer's disease; developing countries; caregivers; family
AB Background Dementia is a rapidly growing problem in all parts of the developing world. Such societies are characterised by low levels of awareness regarding dementia as a chronic degenerative brain syndrome, and by an absence of supportive health and welfare services. There is reliance upon families as the cornerstone of support and care. However, surprisingly little is known of the care arrangements for people with dementia and the strain experienced by their family caregivers.
   Method In a qualitative study of 17 caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease identified through an innovative casefinding program in Thrissur, South India, we obtained information on the range of care arrangements, attitudes towards care giving roles and sources of strain.
   Results The majority of caregivers were young women, often daughters-in-law of women with dementia. The principal sources of caregiver strain were behavioural problems associated with the dementia syndrome, and incontinence. Strain was exacerbated by the lack of supportive response by local health services, and by lack of support and, sometimes, criticism from other family members. Family conflict was commonly encountered. The majority of caregivers experienced significant deterioration in their mental health. One caregiver unfortunately committed suicide after the death of her husband.
   Conclusions There is a clear need for more education, advice and support for families affected by dementia. Community services in developing countries should consider training existing domiciliary outreach services, the community-based multi-purpose health workers, to identify and support family caregivers.

SO LEGAL AND CRIMINOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID SUICIDE BOMBERS MOTIVATION; RADICALIZATION; QUEST
AB It is hypothesized that individuals who play different roles in terrorist organizations will have different psychological processes underlying their activities. An innovative examination of the personal construct systems of terrorists explored this. As part of a larger study, three individuals convicted of Islamic-related terrorist violence in India were interviewed using a semi-structured life narrative procedure enhanced by a Repertory Grid (Kelly, 1955/1991). One was a senior leader of a terrorist group, one a subordinate, the third a person who planted a bomb without full knowledge of the larger design he was part of. Principal component analyses of these grids informed by comments from the life narratives were used to elaborate each man's conceptual system and how it related to his commitment to violence. Important differences among the three individuals' in their construct systems were found. This demonstrated that the forms of Jihadi commitment is embedded in the individual's personal construct system. So, although these three case studies can only be taken as providing indicative results, they do point to aspects of construct systems that reveal the potential for disengagement, being most likely present in the lower echelons of terrorist organizations. Those who are unable to reconstrue themselves as having a non-terrorist future are unlikely to disengage. This is probably typical of those who lead these organizations. The results therefore contribute to the growing literature arguing for significant differences in terrorists' understanding of themselves and their roles and provide an original methodology for assessing a person's potential for deradicalization.

AB Introduction: While mental health consequences following the Asian December 2004 tsunami have been studied, its impact on the survivors who lost close family members deserves attention. We investigated the usefulness of trained volunteer-delivered mental health support for the bereaved persons.
   Method: Non-randomized control design involving all adults aged 18 years or above who lost at least one close family member during tsunami from two geographically different coastal areas in Chennai, India. From the intervention and control sites, 45 and 57 participants were recruited respectively for the study. One year after baseline assessment, all 102 participants in intervention and control sites were interviewed.
   Results: Participants receiving interventions on a consistent basis from trained volunteers were less likely to report depressive symptoms and general psychological distress compared with participants who did not receive the above intervention. Regression analysis for predicting the effect of intervention on the difference between the baseline and follow-up in BDI as well as GHQ scores, found a significant association between intervention and the improvement in BDI (adjusted beta (SE): -0.53 (2.44); p = 0.000) and GHQ (adjusted beta (SE): -0.52 (1.81); p = 0.001) scores. Suicidal attempts were also significantly less in the intervention group (FET p = 0.02).
   Conclusion: In settings where mental health professionals are limited in number, trained lay volunteers can offer empathetic listening, support and referrals that can be potentially beneficial.

AB IntroductionThis study was to assess differences in the symptom profile of depressive illness across various countries/territories in Asia. The study was a part of the Research on Asia Psychotropic Prescription project. The participating countries/territories include China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand.
   MethodsThe pattern of depressive symptoms in 1,400 subjects with depressive disorder from 42 psychiatric centers in 10 Asian countries/territories was assessed. We collected information on socio-demographic and clinical characteristics with a standardized protocol and data collection procedure.
   ResultsThe most common presentations of depressive symptoms were persistent sadness, loss of interest, and insomnia. Similar findings were found regardless of the region, country, or its income level. Patients with depressive disorder from high-income countries presented significantly more with vegetative symptom cluster (P<0.05), while those from the upper middle-income countries had significantly more with both mood (P<0.001) and cognitive symptom clusters (P<0.01). In lower middle-income countries, patients with depressive symptoms had significantly less mood symptom cluster (P<0.001) but significantly more cognitive symptom cluster (P<0.05).
   DiscussionThis study demonstrates that in Asia, despite variations in the initial symptom reported by the patients, across different countries/territories, core depressive symptoms remain the same. Variations have been found in presentation of depressive symptoms with regards to the level of income of countries. Physical or vegetative symptoms were reported more by centers in higher income countries, while depressive cognition and suicidal thoughts/acts were more frequently reported from lower income countries.

AB Context: Blue Whale Challenge is a phenomenon which gained its early foothold on the internet chatboards. It is a dare-based harmful game which has a list of fifty tasks which you perform culminating in one's death on the final task. The fatalities caused by individuals playing this game have been reported first in Russia and followed by at least twenty countries reporting it, including India. Aims: This study was conducted to assess perceptions and knowhow of the first responders in medical profession about online challenges. Settings and Design: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study. Subjects and Methods: Fifty-four medical professionals who practice either psychiatry, clinical psychology, or pediatrics were interviewed using a semi-structured open-ended survey was administered and data were obtained. Statistical Analysis Used: Descriptive statistics was used. Results: Thirty-five (65%) of the total participants have heard about the Blue Whale Challenge but lacked further knowledge about the game. Ten percent of total participants knew about other internet challenges. Only 26% of total participants were largely aware about the details and harmful nature of the game. Only 12 (22%) participants knew the signs to identify the children playing this game. None of the practitioners reported of having encountered any parent or child enquiring or reporting this in their practice at the time of conducting the survey. Conclusions: The medical fraternity is lagging behind in updating themselves of the online phenomena which are important for the better outcome of children presenting with participation in online challenges. The nature of the game has been discussed, and guidelines for identifying vulnerable population have been put forward.

AB There is a lot of study related stress on school students. Consequences of such stress drive some students to take drastic actions such as suicide [3]. With thorough analysis, we found that Mathematics, is one of the major source of stress for most of these students. To help them relieve their stress to some extent, an immersive suite of mobile applications, named as "Revi-seOnTheGo", was developed by the first author [Atharva], who just passed out his SSC exam a few years back. He was supported by his mother, who is trained singer. She lent her voice for the formulas. There are a number of courses online, but they are typically long and one has to complete them in order to benefit. For revision, what students need are precise formulas. This is the main focus of the suite ReviseOnTheGo. Till date there are similar to 25000 direct downloads from the Google Play Store. This number could be inaccurate because of 3rd party app stores and also due to use of popular app sharing apps. Many students have acknowledged that these simple mobile apps have helped them to score better marks whilst being stress free. This concept also demonstrates, how students can create very useful and relevant mobile applications for themselves as well as other students. All of these downloads were achieved without any major marketing campaigns. ReviseOnTheGo received a special jury mention in the prestigious IAMAI awards (2015) [7] and were runner-ups in the final round of Aegis Graham Bell Awards (2014) [8]. Times Of India newspaper wrote an article on these apps [1]. In this paper, the journey of application development, the challenges faced, learning, and a scale-up plan, are described in detail.

AB Despite improvements in prevention and rescue, mortality rates after severe blunt trauma continue to be a problem. The present study analyses mortality patterns in a representative blunt trauma population, specifically the influence of demographic, injury pattern, location and timing of death.
   Patients that died between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2005 were subjected to a standardised autopsy. Inclusion criteria: death from blunt trauma due to road traffic injuries (Injury Severity Score ae<yen> 16), patients from a defined geographical area and death on scene or in hospital. Exclusion criteria: suicide, homicide, penetrating trauma and monotrauma including isolated head injury. Statistical analyses included Student's t test (parametric), Mann-Whitney U test (nonparametric) or Chi-square test.
   A total of 277 consecutive injured patients were included in this study (mean age 46.1 +/- 23 years; 67.5% males), 40.5% of which had an ISS of 75. A unimodal distribution of mortality was observed in blunt trauma patients. The most frequently injured body regions with the highest severity were the head (38.6%), chest (26.7%), or both head and chest (11.0%). The cumulative analysis of mortality showed that several factors, such as injury pattern and regional location of collisions, also affected the pattern of mortality.
   The majority of patients died on scene from severe head and thoracic injuries. A homogenous distribution of death was observed after an initial peak of death on scene. Moreover, several factors such as injury pattern and regional location of collisions may also affect the pattern of mortality.

AB Aim: Japanese psychiatrists have increasingly reported patients with depression that does not seem to fit the criteria of the ICD-10 and the DSM-IV, and which has recently been called modern type depression (MTD). We explored whether MTD is frequently seen in Japan and also in other countries, and if so, how patients with MTD are diagnosed and treated.
   Methods: The questionnaires, with two case vignettes (traditional type depression (TTD) and MTD), were sent to psychiatrists in Australia, Bangladesh, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the USA. Participants rated their opinions about each case's prevalence in their country, etiology, diagnosis, suicide risk, and treatment using Likert scales.
   Results: Out of 247 responses (123 from Japan and 124 from other countries), two hundred thirty-nine valid responses were received. MTD was recognized in all participating countries, and especially in urban areas. Generally, the factor of personality was regarded as the most probable cause of MTD. Whereas about 90% of Japanese psychiatrists applied the ICD/DSM criteria to TTD, only about 60% applied the criteria to MID.
   Conclusion: Our results indicate that Japan's MID seems to be occurring in many other countries, and that the present ICD/DSM criteria may not be sufficient to diagnose MID. Therefore, it could be an important candidate for a new international diagnostic criterion as a subtype of depression. A clear diagnostic framework and consensus on the interventions to treat MID would be valuable. Further clinical, psychopathological and international epidemiological studies are needed to confirm our preliminary findings of MID. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB About 1.2 million new cancer cases have been diagnosed in 1998 worldwide and 2.5 million cases have been recorded in 2009 in India alone. Cancer is thus a major leading public problem that always remains first cause of death in both developed and developing countries (K.U. Devi 2009). Various promising treatment modalities for cancer starts from surgery or tumour removal, radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, employing hormones till stem cell transplantation procedures. Still, cancer is not completely eradicated from the body. One of the prime cons of these therapies is they over act during the treatment process. It damages the homeostatic balance of leading to increase in mortality rates widely across the world. Beyond the management of cancer the worse phase is pain experienced during the treatment of cancer. Such unrelieved pain has impact on their sleep, daily activities, food intake and at times their chronic pain leads them to commit suicide. Thus researchers have recently engineered a neo technique by impregnating Magnano particles into micro needles less than a hair follicle diameter to counteract tumour cells. Healthy cells will not be facing the damage amidst the targeted drug delivery to the cancerous cells. These non-toxic Magnano vehicles can overcome the debilitating systemic toxicities caused by cytotoxic chemotherapies. Moreover nano fine particles opt the Trojan horse mechanism to initiate tumour death. Its advanced property of possessing extensive surface-to-volume ratio is projected in its functionality through surface chemistries, especially when these nanoparticles are received in combinatorial with micro magnets. Thus Nanjects not only avoid side effects caused during cancer therapies but is also applicable for vaccine delivery which can eventually overcome fear and stress in Trypanophobia individuals.

AB Adolescents (10-19 years old) comprise a fifth of the Indian population (253.2 million), yet there is very little published information about the burden of disease and injury for this age group. This paper aims to provide a contemporary picture of the leading causes of death and disability for Indian adolescent girls and boys for 2013, and changes in deaths and disability between 1990 and 2013.
   Data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study for India, for the years 1990 and 2013, were accessed. Data were categorized into two age groups: 10 to 14 years (younger adolescents) and 15 to 19 years (older adolescents) and analysed separately for girls and boys.
   The study shows that for both younger and older adolescent boys and for older adolescent girls, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and injuries are responsible for a greater number of deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) than communicable diseases. Communicable diseases are still important causes of death and disability for young adolescents. Among older adolescents there is an increasing burden of death and disability due to self-harm, road traffic injuries, fire- and heat-related injuries and mental disorders such as depressive disorders.
   Although strategies to reduce the burden of communicable diseases among adolescents must continue to be an important focus, innovative, evidence-based strategies aimed at reducing the growing burden of NCDs and injuries must be elevated as a priority.

TI Offshoring and layoffs: How about a little decency?
SO CHEMICAL PROCESSING
LA English
DT Article
AB "Offshoring," or the movement of U.S. engineering and technical jobs over-seas, is striking a raw nerve, sparking political debate and concerns over the. future of the U.S. economy and basic R&D. The IT and telecommunications sector, where the U.S. Jobless rate continues to hover at 7 percent, has been first and hardest hit. The Communication Workers of America reckon that 400,000 U.S. jobs have moved offshore. According to Cambridge Mass., based Giga Information, 200 of the Fortune 500 shipped nearly $7.7 billion worth of IT work overseas last year. Although there are no firm statistics right now, more chemical process design, R&D and engineering jobs also appear to be moving abroad.
   The economic reasons for off-shoring, outsourcing, or "lower-cost arbitrage," whatever you choose to call the trend, are compelling. But they're compelling only in the short term. And, whether they're eliminating positions or moving them offshore, many U.S. companies are "clearing the decks" in an extremely degrading way. We read, for example, of IT companies giving senior engineers just enough notice to allow them to train their less-costly replacements, here on H-1 B or L-1 visas. One chemical company reportedly laid off 17 people last month, asking those who were "off " that day to come in, then gave them all of 30 minutes to get their things and leave.
   Police cars have become a fixed presence in company parking lots during U.S. layoffs, just in case anyone decides to "go postal." Given the way that layoffs are handled, it's a wonder that more people don't! Suicides and severe depressions have resulted, in some extreme cases.
   Xenophobic or knee-jerk responses would be counterproductive. We're living in a global economy, and, if researchers and engineers in Russia or India can most effectively solve a technical problem, why shouldn't they? Ph.D. engineers in Russia earn one-tenth what their American peers do. In many parts of the world today, trained professionals employed by national institutes routinely "moonlight" driving cabs or whatever they can to make ends meet. Surely they deserve more professional opportunities to use their talents.
   More U.S. chemical companies are planning to tap that underutilized labor pool. Earlier this month, for example, Raymond LeBoeuf, CEO of Pittsburghbased PPG Industries, said that he sees his company "bringing new research to market" - research that, he says, will be increasingly carried out in the former Soviet Union, India and China.

AB Background: Sedative hypnotics class of drugs is increasing become the drug of choice for intentional overdose. The frequent prescription of these agents in those with psychiatric illnesses, insomnia and other substance use disorders has also increased the risk of accidental overdose. The growing use is reflected in the latest epidemiological findings and also underline the importance of the study of factors contributing to fatal overdoses so that appropriate steps can be taken to curb the growing epidemic of sedatives-hypnotic overdose.
   Methods: A literature review was conducted of articles on sedatives-hypnotic overdose/toxicity published in the last few years on search engines PUBMED, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Google Scholar.
   Results: A plethora of studies existed on the epidemiology of sedatives-hypnotic overdose in various developed and developing nations. These data mainly came from countries with good reporting of fatal and non-fatal as well as intentional/accidental poisonings in the healthcare system. There is a lack of Indian studies focusing on sedatives-hypnotic or prescription drugs related deaths, overall. Various factors associated with increased risk of sedative-hypnotic overdosing have been studied in recent years. From the managementperspective, use of flumazenil andits associate adverse effects have been extensively reported.
   Conclusion and significance: The increasing number of emergency admissions and deaths owing to sedatives-hypnotics overdose place a huge economic burden. From the public health point it becomes important to regulate the prescription and availability of these drugs to reduce associated fatalities.

AB A retrospective analysis of poisoning calls received by the National Poisons Information Centre showed a total of 2719 calls over a period of three years (April 1999-March 2002). The queries were made on poisoning management (92%) and information (8%) about various products and functioning of the centre. The data were analysed with respect to age, sex, mode and type of poisoning. The agents belonged to various groups: household products, agricultural pesticides, industrial chemicals, drugs, plants, animal bites and stings, miscellaneous and unknown groups respectively. The age ranged from less than 1 to 70 years, with the highest incidence in the range of 14-40 years, with males (57%) outnumbering females (43%). The most common mode of poisoning was suicidal (53%), followed by accidental (47%). The route of exposure was mainly oral (88%). Dermal (5%), inhalation and ocular exposure contributed 7% to the total. The highest incidence of poisoning was due to household agents (44.1%) followed by drugs (18.8%), agricultural pesticides (12.8%), industrial chemicals (8.9%), animals bites and stings (4.7%), plants (1.7%), unknown (2.9%) and miscellaneous groups (5.6%). Household products mainly comprised of pyrethroids, rodenticides, carbamates, phenyl, detergents, corrosives etc. Drugs implicated included benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, analgesics, antihistamines, tricyclic antidepressants, thyroid hormones and oral contraceptives. Among the agricultural pesticides, aluminium phosphide was the most commonly consumed followed by organochlorines, organophosphates, ethylene dibromide, herbicides and fungicides. Copper sulphate and nitrobenzene were common among industrial chemicals. The bites and stings group comprised of snake bites, scorpion, wasp and bee stings. Poisoning due to plants was low, but datura was the most commonly ingested. An alarming feature of the study was the high incidence of poisoning in children (36.5%). The age ranged from less than 1 to 18 years and the most vulnerable age group included children from less than 1 year to 6 years. Accidental mode was the most common (79.7%). Intentional attempts were also noticed (20.2%) in the age group above 12 years. The present data may not give an exact picture of the incidence of poisoning in India, but represents a trend in our country. The Poisons Information Centre plays a vital role in providing timely management guidelines including the supply of necessary antidotes from the recently established National Antidote Bank, thereby helping to save precious lives.

TI ANALYSIS OF THE CLINICAL PROFILE AND OUTCOMES OF PATIENTS PRESENTING
   WITH STRESS CARDIOMYOPATHY AFTER SUICIDAL HANGING TO A MULTIDISCIPLINARY

LA English

DE Suicidal Hanging; Stress Cardiomyopathy; Pulmonary Oedema; Ejection
   Fraction; Reversed Takotsubo
AB BACKGROUND
   Stress cardiomyopathy, a reversible left ventricular dysfunction, following suicidal hanging is an uncommon clinical entity among intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As there is a dearth of data on this condition, we intended to study the clinical profile and outcomes of patients admitted to our multidisciplinary ICU with stress cardiomyopathy following an attempted suicidal hanging.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS
   An observational study was conducted for a period of seven years on consecutive suicidal hanging patients admitted to the ICU with stress cardiomyopathy Demographic details, severity of illness, interventions and outcomes of these patients were studied.
   RESULTS
   During the study period, 19 patients were admitted to our multidisciplinary ICU with left ventricular dysfunction compatible with stress cardiomyopathy following an attempted suicide by hanging. The patients in the study were young with a mean age of 26.89 years and showed a female predominance of 63%. Non survivors had a significantly low Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) (Mean=3.67), high mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score (31.33) and low mean ejection fraction (25.83%) compared to survivors. Mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support were required in 89.5% and 68.4% patients respectively. We observed a mortality rate of 31.6% (n=6). Hospital stay and ICU free days were significantly shorter in non survivors reflecting their critical presentation from the time of admission. Due to the short course of stay in hospital of both survivors and non survivors we could not assess the reversal of the cardiac dysfunction in our study.
   CONCLUSION
   Stress cardiomyopathy being a reversible condition and considering the high mortality observed in our study further studies with a large sample size is needed for a better understanding of this condition in suicidal hanging patients.

AB Studies of men who have sex with men (MSM) in diverse geographic and cultural contexts have identified health challenges affecting this population. MSM might be particularly vulnerable to sexual victimization and forced sex. The aim of this research study was to examine prevalence of sexual victimization and correlates of forced sex among Japanese MSM. We recruited a sample of 5,731 Japanese MSM who completed an internet-administered survey. Participants reported on history of different types of sexual victimization, unprotected anal sex, other health risk behaviors, exposure to gay-related teasing and bullying, depression, and suicidality. Over one-fifth of the sample (21.4%) reported experiencing at least one form of sexual victimization, and 8.7% reported a history of forced sex. MSM who had ever experienced forced sex were significantly more likely to report experiencing psychological risks (depression OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.28-1.89; attempted suicide OR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.81-2.81; other forms of bullying OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.13-1.68) and other behavioral risks (unprotected anal sex OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.29-1.90; sex venue attendance OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.04-1.54; methamphetamine use OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.05-1.36), compared to MSM who had not experienced forced sex. Efforts to develop holistic and integrated health services for Japanese MSM are warranted, particularly related to psychosocial determinants of HIV prevention. However, due to cultural factors that emphasize familial and social relations and that stigmatize same-sex behavior, Japanese MSM might experience challenges to seeking social support and health services. Interventions must be provided in safe and non-judgmental settings where Japanese MSM feel comfortable disclosing their health and social support needs.

AB Previous studies based on either single hospital data or sampling of specific groups of hospitalized burns victims in Taiwan have provided only minimal epidemiological information. The study is designed to provide additional data on the epidemiology of hospitalized burns patients in Taiwan. Data were obtained from the Burn Injury Information System (BIIS), which brings together information supplied by 34 contracted hospitals. The study time course spanned a 2-year period from July 1997 to June 1999. Patient characteristics (age, sex, education level, etc.), causes and severity of injuries, and medical care measures were explored. A total of 4741 patients were registered with BIIS over the study period. The majority of hospitalized patients (67%) were male. The age distribution of burns patients showed peaks occurring at the age groups of 0-5 and 35-44 years. Over the time course of a day, burn injuries occurred more frequently from 10:00 to 12:00 h and 16:00 to 18:00 h. Injuries suspected as the result of suicide, homicide or child abuse accounted for 4.8% of hospitalized cases. More than 48% of the burns occurred in the home. The leading type of burn injury was scalding, followed by naked flame, explosion, electrical burns, and chemical burns due to caustic or corrosive substances. The mean percent total body surface area (%TBSA) for adults was 19%, and for young children was 12%. The average length of hospital stay was 18 days. In conclusion, children under 5 years and adults between 35 and 44 years of age are two high-risk groups for burn injuries. Corresponding to meal preparation time, hot substances such as boiling water, hot soup, etc. are the most common agents responsible for scalds. Prevention programs for reducing the risk of burn injuries during cooking and eating are required, especially for parents with young children. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd and ISBI.

AB Purpose: Overweight and underweight are one of the leading risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), but little research on this area has been undertaken in Cambodia. Therefore, this study aimed to measure underweight and overweight and their associated risk behaviors among Cambodian high school students.
   Methods: 3806 students (mean ag =15.65 years, SD 1.80, age range 11-18 years) from the 2013 Cambodia-Global School-based Student Health Survey were used to yield representative samples of the Cambodian students. Body Mass Index (BMI) was assessed by students' self-reported height and weight. The substance use, depression, eating behaviors, suicidal ideation, and violence were examined as risk factors. The Chi-square and multinomial regressions were performed to assess the relationships between risk factors and BMI.
   Results: The prevalence of underweight was 47.4% (N = 1805, Male = 23.3%vs.24.1%) and overweight was 2.3% (N = 89, Male 1.0%vs.1.3%). The BMI was significantly controlled by age, gender, and body height. Both underweight and overweight students were significantly vulnerable to substance use, feeling depressed, and violent behaviors. Of the risk factors, shortest sleep was prevalent for underweight students while feeling lonely and suicide attempts were the critical risks for overweight students. The daily fruit/vegetable consumption and physical activity were good preventive factors of both underweight and overweight epidemics.
   Conclusions: The risk behaviors of students appear to be strongly associated with underweight and overweight. Interventions targeting these risk behaviors may have the potential to reduce risks. Meanwhile, the preventive strategies should focus on vulnerable students who have poor academic performance, mental health issues and a history of violent experiences. (C) 2018 Diabetes India.

AB Context: Sociocultural factors complement psychopathological factors that result in deliberate self-harm (DSH). A study of change in these factors over time is essential for preventive action.
   Aims: To identify factors influencing DSH, which have shown significant variation over a period of 10 years.
   Settings and Design: Two hospital-based cross-sectional analytic types of observational studies were performed at two different times at an interval of 10 years.
   Materials and Methods: Sociodemographic profile, factors related to DSH, stressful life events, and psychiatric disorders were assessed in two groups of patients drawn from the same tertiary care hospital, 100 consecutive patients in 2002 and 117 in 2012. The observations were compared to identify factors that have undergone significant change.
   Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics along with Chi-square test was used in this study.
   Results: A significant decrease in the overall number of married subjects (60% vs. 43%) and an increase in the number of unmarried females (34% vs. 61%) were seen. A significant increase in the overall number of rural subjects (17% vs. 34%) and especially in a number of rural females (7% vs. 23%) was also seen. An increase in subjects from middle socioeconomic class (15% vs. 29%) and education up to secondary school (9% vs. 25%) was also seen. A significantly higher number of subjects had a psychiatric disorder (50% vs. 81%) with a significant increase in diagnoses of depression (36% vs. 67%). Family and social issues remain the most common antecedent stressful events. Chemical methods are still the most preferred means, but a higher number (8% vs. 18%) report a history of self-harm.
   Conclusion: Variations in factors responsible for DSH identified in this comparative study have preventive implications.

DE Drop size distributions; Monsoon shower; Simulator; Terminal velocity;

ID SIZE DISTRIBUTION; VELOCITY
AB Severe droughts were experienced by many southerly states of the Indian subcontinent during the past decade. Farmer suicides were reported from the state of Andhra Pradesh year after year, especially when the monsoons failed. The government of India conducted expensive rain enhancement experiments through artificial cloud seeding; this did happen, but at enormous infrastructural costs and organizational endeavors. In this paper, the attempt is to find alternative shower generation mechanisms at the scale of an individual cropland. The application of a new rain simulator is explored. The crux of the problem lies in generating showers with drops that not only fall with approximately the same speeds as the natural rain showers but also have matching drop size distributions. Previous simulators have not looked at this aspect; none have attempted to recreate a drop size spectrum that is indistinguishable from natural rain showers. This is the paper's mainstay; new calculations are shown for a uniquely fabricated rain simulator that allows tridirectional maneuverability with regard to the spraying geometry. Only when the nozzle placed at 2.5m from the ground is tilted at an upward angle of 80 degrees with respect to the boom's horizontal axis, a resultant spectrum is obtained that closely matches the northeast monsoon shower spectra at optimal crosswind speeds. In contrast, when the spray nozzles point vertically downwards, as in sprinklers, the resultant droplet spectra do not match real rain shower spectra; the number concentrations of both large and small droplets are overpredicted with fall velocities grossly higher than their terminal velocities. The droplet energy flux obtained from a vertically downward tilted nozzle reach the highest value of 24W center dot m(-2). On the contrary, the maximum energy flux value from a skyward projected shower slides down to 2.0W center dot m(-2) matching fluxes for natural rainfall. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

SO BMC PHARMACOLOGY & TOXICOLOGY

DT Article
DE Gloriosa superba seeds; Poisoning; Colchicine; Sri Lanka
ID COLCHICINE; SUICIDE
AB Background: Gloriosa superba, well known as the glory lily or superb lily, is a tropical climbing plant that features an exotic red flower. The plant is poisonous because of high concentrations of colchicine in all parts of the plant. It is commercially grown for use in Ayurveda medicine and as a cash crop for extracting colchicine in India and Africa. It is a wild plant in Sri Lanka and commercial cultivation is rare. Accidental and suicidal poisonings with Gloriosa tubers are well known and reported. There are no case reports of poisoning by Gloriosa seeds in Sri Lanka. Google and PubMed searches showed no reported cases of poisoning with seeds or their use with homicidal intent in other parts of the world.
   Case presentation: A 27-year-old man was brought to hospital with profuse vomiting and diarrhea after drinking coriander tea, which is a common traditional treatment for common cold. The family members suspected poisoning by Gloriosa because they had seeds at home and the victim's sister-in-law who had made the herbal tea went missing from home. They were able to identify Gloriosa seeds, which looked similar to coriander, in the pot. The patient developed shock and respiratory distress and needed ventilation and intensive care. He also developed mild renal impairment, and thrombocytopenia. He developed massive generalized alopecia while recovering from acute illness. Full recovery was achieved after 15 days of hospital care.
   Conclusions: There are many poisonous plants in Asian countries. This case highlights the possibility of accidental or intentional use of Gloriosa seeds or its extracts to cause potentially fatal poisoning. It would be difficult to identify Gloriosa as the cause of poisoning without any background information because of multiple complications that can mimic a systemic infection. This case is a good example of the use of plants as biological weapons.

TI <i>Nanda-bangshochchhed</i> and <i>Hariraj</i>: Re-configuring Politics
   and the Private Mind in Two Bengali Adaptations of <i>Hamlet</i>
SO LITERATURE COMPASS
LA English
DT Article
AB My essay will examine how two nineteenth-century Bengali adaptations of Hamlet negotiate the Shakespearean text and try to re-configure its approach towards politics and the private mind. The two Bengali plays in question are (i) Nanda-bangshochchhed ("The Destruction of the Nanda Dynasty"; published 1873) by Lakshminarayan Chakraborty, a text that was sparingly staged and is yet to gain adequate recognition as a case of Shakespearean appropriation; and (ii) Hariraj by Nagendranath Chaudhury (first staged in 1897), commercially the most successful adaptation of any Shakespeare play in the nineteenth-century Bengali theatre. The major point of departure for the first play is the question of political intrigue - which is to a large extent upstaged in the Shakespearean original by the focus on Hamlet's subjectivity. The first play curiously amalgamates the mythos of Hamlet with suggestions of a semi-legendary past, especially as derivable from the classical Sanskrit play Mudrarakshasa (4th-8th century CE). Accordingly, the Fortinbras-equivalent of the play is Nanda's half-brother Chandragupta (identifiable as the historical Chandragupta Maurya, 340-298BCE), and it has references to the historical figures of Rakshasa, Chanakya and even Alexander the Great. Similarly, the second play, which is set in a pseudo-historical Hindu state, greatly emphasizes elements of political and sexual conspiracy. It shows the Gertrude-equivalent as a Lady Macbeth-like figure who conspires with her lover to kill her husband, later plans against her son Hariraj, and commits suicide when the monstrosity of the crime dawns on her. Thus, the plays revise the dominant reading of Hamlet as a tragedy of deeply interiorized suffering, and alert one to the political catastrophe attendant upon the extinction of Hamlet's family line. These two Bengali adaptations choose to show the Hamlet-figure as subject to the contingencies of a communal existence, which are not always filtered through his consciousness. However, these two plays, which incidentally embody early attempts in Bengali at adapting the tragic to the received aesthetic repertoire of India, also evoke at key moments Hamlet's celebrated contemplativeness and engage on indigenous terms with a Western model of staging interiority.

AB Background Although structured psychological treatments are recommended as first-line interventions for harmful drinking, only a small fraction of people globally receive these treatments because of poor access in routine primary care. We assessed the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Counselling for Alcohol Problems (CAP), a brief psychological treatment delivered by lay counsellors to patients with harmful drinking attending routine primary health-care settings.
   Methods In this randomised controlled trial, we recruited male harmful drinkers defined by an Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score of 12-19 who were aged 18-65 years from ten primary health centres in Goa, India. We excluded patients who needed emergency medical treatment or inpatient admission, who were unable to communicate clearly, and who were intoxicated at the time of screening. Participants were randomly allocated (1: 1) by trained health assistants based at the primary health centres to enhanced usual care (EUC) alone or EUC combined with CAP, in randomly sized blocks of four to six, stratified by primary health centre, and allocation was concealed with use of sequential numbered opaque envelopes. Physicians providing EUC and those assessing outcomes were masked. Primary outcomes were remission (AUDIT score of <8) and mean daily alcohol consumed in the past 14 days, at 3 months. Secondary outcomes were the effect of drinking, disability score, days unable to work, suicide attempts, intimate partner violence, and resource use and costs of illness. Analyses were on an intention-to-treat basis. We used logistic regression analysis for remission and zero-inflated negative binomial regression analysis for alcohol consumption. We assessed serious adverse events in the per-protocol population. This trial is registered with the ISCRTN registry, number ISRCTN76465238.
   Findings Between Oct 28, 2013, and July 29, 2015, we enrolled and randomly allocated 377 participants (188 [50%] to the EUC plus CAP group and 190 [50%] to the EUC alone group [one of whom was subsequently excluded because of a protocol violation]), of whom 336 (89%) completed the 3 month primary outcome assessment (164 [87%] in the EUC plus CAP group and 172 [91%] in the EUC alone group). The proportion with remission (59 [36%] of 164 in the EUC plus CAP group vs 44 [26%] of 172 in the EUC alone group; adjusted prevalence ratio 1.50 [95% CI 1.09-2.07]; p=0.01) and the proportion abstinent in the past 14 days (68 [42%] vs 31 [18%]; adjusted odds ratio 3.00 [1.76-5.13]; p<0.0001) were significantly higher in the EUC plus CAP group than in the EUC alone group, but we noted no effect on mean daily alcohol consumed in the past 14 days among those who reported drinking in this period (37.0 g [SD 44.2] vs 31.0 g [27.8]; count ratio 1.08 [0.79-1.49]; p=0.62). We noted an effect on the percentage of days abstinent in the past 14 days (adjusted mean difference [AMD] 16.0% [8.1-24.1]; p<0.0001), but no effect on the percentage of days of heavy drinking (AMD -0.4% [-5.7 to 4.9]; p=0.88), the effect of drinking (Short Inventory of Problems score AMD-0.03 [-1.93 to 1.86]; p=0.97), disability score (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule score AMD 0.62 [-0.62 to 1.87]; p=0.32), days unable to work (no days unable to work adjusted odds ratio 1.02 [0.61-1.69]; p=0.95), suicide attempts (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.8 [-2.4 to 6.0]; p=0.25), and intimate partner violence (adjusted prevalence ratio 3.0 [-10.4 to 4.4]; p=0.57). The incremental cost per additional remission was $ 217 (95% CI 50-1073), with an 85% chance of being cost-effective in the study setting. We noted no significant difference in the number of serious adverse events between the two groups (six [4%] in the EUC plus CAP group vs 13 [8%] in the EUC alone group; p=0.11).
   Interpretation CAP delivered by lay counsellors plus EUC was better than EUC alone was for harmful drinkers in routine primary health-care settings, and might be cost-effective. CAP could be a key strategy to reduce the treatment gap for alcohol use disorders, one of the leading causes of the global burden among men worldwide. Copyright (C) The Author(s).

AB Hydrological knowledge or information has mostly remained in the domain of scientific community. The communities that interact with the hydrological aspects such as groundwater and surface water on a day to day basis are hardly aware of the information that could critically influence their livelihoods. From the perspective of the communities' information pertaining to groundwater aquifer characters, potential to provide the water resource, surface groundwater interactions in varying geo-hydrological conditions are important. The 'public good' nature of the resources and their linkages with ecological systems gives rise to externalities that could be pervasive. In a number of countries, especially the developing countries, groundwater is the single largest source of drinking as well as irrigation water. In the absence of scientific information with the communities, extraction of groundwater resources for productive purposes has become a risky venture leading to adverse impacts on livelihoods. The externalities associated with over exploitation of groundwater resources and the resulting widespread well failure is identified as one of the main reasons for pushing farmers into debt trap and one of the reasons for farmer suicides in India. The negative externalities are increasingly becoming severe in the context of climate variability.
   This paper attempts to highlight the importance of hydrological information to the user communities from a socioeconomic perspective using a newly developed framework 'REDUCE' based on theories of effective communication. It shows, based on the evidence, how farming communities are getting affected in the absence of the basic hydrological information across socioeconomic groups. It is argued, using relevant information that the negative externalities could be mitigated to a large extent with proper dissemination of information among the communities and capacitating them to measure and use the information on their own. In order to make the hydrological information relevant and useful for the communities at the macro level, there are six key areas to be addressed viz., Resource (water), Estimation or Evaluation, Distribution, Users, Communication and Execution. Ground water extraction and use is associated with mostly negative externalities. Estimation methods and scale are not commensurate with the users' needs. The natural distribution pattern of the groundwater accentuates the inequalities in its access and use. These inequalities could be corrected through proper policy interventions that pave the way for treating the resources as a common pool resource instead of allowing it to be exploited like a private resource. That is, the hydrological resources ought to be brought under the management regime with the help of policy and governance structures. Users neither have the wherewithal to obtain the right kind of information nor the ability to manage the resource judiciously without institutional support. In this context the communication part of the process of groundwater management becomes important. The external agencies like the NGOs, scientists and policy makers and implementers have to interact and provide the right kind of information packaged to suit the needs of the users. Innovative execution of policies through evolution of institutional mechanisms and user involvement is key to the success of groundwater management. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB IMPORTANCE The literature focuses on mortality among children younger than 5 years. Comparable information on nonfatal health outcomes among these children and the fatal and nonfatal burden of diseases and injuries among older children and adolescents is scarce.
   OBJECTIVE To determine levels and trends in the fatal and nonfatal burden of diseases and injuries among younger children (aged < 5 years), older children (aged 5-9 years), and adolescents (aged 10-19 years) between 1990 and 2013 in 188 countries from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 study.
   EVIDENCE REVIEW Data from vital registration, verbal autopsy studies, maternal and child death surveillance, and other sources covering 14 244 site-years (ie, years of cause of death data by geography) from 1980 through 2013 were used to estimate cause-specific mortality. Data from 35 620 epidemiological sources were used to estimate the prevalence of the diseases and sequelae in the GBD 2013 study. Cause-specific mortality for most causes was estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble Model strategy. For some infectious diseases (eg, HIV infection/AIDS, measles, hepatitis B) where the disease process is complex or the cause of death data were insufficient or unavailable, we used natural history models. For most nonfatal health outcomes, DisMod-MR 2.0, a Bayesian metaregression tool, was used to meta-analyze the epidemiological data to generate prevalence estimates.
   FINDINGS Of the 7.7 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 7.4-8.1) million deaths among children and adolescents globally in 2013, 6.28 million occurred among younger children, 0.48 million among older children, and 0.97 million among adolescents. In 2013, the leading causes of death were lower respiratory tract infections among younger children (905 059 deaths; 95% UI, 810304-998 125), diarrheal diseases among older children (38 325 deaths; 95% UI, 30 365-47 678), and road injuries among adolescents (115 186 deaths; 95% UI, 105 185-124 870). Iron deficiency anemia was the leading cause of years lived with disability among children and adolescents, affecting 619 (95% UI, 618-621) million in 2013. Large between-country variations exist in mortality from leading causes among children and adolescents. Countries with rapid declines in all-cause mortality between 1990 and 2013 also experienced large declines in most leading causes of death, whereas countries with the slowest declines had stagnant or increasing trends in the leading causes of death. In 2013, Nigeria had a 12% global share of deaths from lower respiratory tract infections and a 38% global share of deaths from malaria. India had 33% of the world's deaths from neonatal encephalopathy. Half of the world's diarrheal deaths among children and adolescents occurred in just 5 countries: India, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Ethiopia.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Understanding the levels and trends of the leading causes of death and disability among children and adolescents is critical to guide investment and inform policies. Monitoring these trends over time is also key to understanding where interventions are having an impact. Proven interventions exist to prevent or treat the leading causes of unnecessary death and disability among children and adolescents. The findings presented here show that these are underused and give guidance to policy makers in countries where more attention is needed.

TI Suffering in silence: consequences of sexual violence within marriage
   among young women in Nepal
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE; BANGLADESH; ABUSE; INDIA; RISK; HIV
AB Background: Despite the grave consequences of sexual violence, and it's persistence both within and outside marriages, this subject has received relatively little attention from researchers, policy makers, and programme managers in Nepal. This paper explores the definition of sexual violence and its various forms and consequences as reported by young married women in Nepal. In addition, it describes the coping mechanisms used by young married women to avoid sexual violence perpetrated against them by their husbands.
   Methods: This paper analyzes data collected during the qualitative study on "Sexual violence among young couples in Nepal", conducted amongst two major ethnic groups - Brahmin/Chhetri and Tharu - between 2006 and 2007. The data is comprised of 39 free-lists and 15 in-depth case histories with married women aged 15-24 years. The average rank and Smith's Salience were calculated from the free-listing data. The thematic analysis approach was used for the analysis of information from the case histories.
   Results: Approximately three-quarters (74%) of the young women mentioned 'sex against one's wishes' as sexual violence within marriage (SVWM). Sixty-two percent of respondents described 'forced sex during illness' and 'forced sex after consumption of alcohol' as SVWM. About half of young women (48.7%) who participated in the free-listing exercise reported having experienced SVWM. The types of SVWM ranged from unwanted sexual touch to forced sex. Backache, headache, lower abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding and thoughts of suicide were the most commonly reported negative physical and psychological health consequences of SVWM. Women reported various coping strategies including 'trying to convince husbands', 'sleeping in a separate room', 'visiting maternal home', 'waking up the children', and 'using pretexts such as being ill or menstruating', to avoid SVWM. However, in most cases, women reported that these coping strategies were unsuccessful. Almost all women experiencing SVWM were socially isolated and did not turn to institutions, relatives or friends for advice and support.
   Conclusions: Sexual violence within marriage is common in Nepal. Findings provide circumstantial evidence of links between sexual violence and negative general and reproductive health outcomes for women. Various actions are required to prevent SVWM and provide immediate support to the victims.

AB Objectives: To collate data from multiple obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) treatment centers across seven countries and five continents, and to report findings in relation to OCD comorbidity, age of onset of OCD and comorbid disorders, and suicidality, in a large clinical and ethnically diverse sample, with the aim of investigating cultural variation and the utility of the psychiatric diagnostic classification of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.
   Methods: Researchers in the field of OCD were invited to contribute summary statistics on current and lifetime psychiatric comorbidity, age of onset of OCD and comorbid disorders and suicidality in their patients with OCD.
   Results: Data from 3711 adult patients with primary OCD came from Brazil (n = 955), India (n = 802), Italy (n = 750), South Africa (n = 565), Japan (n = 322), Australia (n = 219), and Spain (n = 98). The most common current comorbid disorders were major depressive disorder (28.4%; n = 1055), obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (24.5%, n = 478), generalized anxiety disorder (19.3%, n = 716), specific phobia (19.2%, n = 714) and social phobia (18.5%, n = 686). Major depression was also the most commonly co-occurring lifetime diagnosis, with a rate of 50.5% (n = 1874). OCD generally had an age of onset in late adolescence (mean = 17.9 years, SD = 1.9). Social phobia, specific phobia and body dysmorphic disorder also had an early age of onset. Co-occurring major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and psychotic disorders tended to have a later age of onset than OCD. Suicidal ideation within the last month was reported by 6.4% (n = 200) of patients with OCD and 9.0% (n = 314) reported a lifetime history of suicide attempt.
   Conclusions: In this large cross-continental study, comorbidity in OCD was common. The high rates of comorbid major depression and anxiety disorders emphasize the need for clinicians to assess and monitor for these disorders. Earlier ages of onset of OCD, specific phobia and social phobia may indicate some relatedness between these disorders, but this requires further study. Although there do not appear to be significant cultural variations in rates or patterns of comorbidity and suicidality, further research using similar recruitment strategies and controlling for demographic and clinical variables may help to determine whether any sociocultural factors protect against suicidal ideation or psychiatric comorbidity in patients with OCD.

AB Objectives To assess in a developing Asian country the impact of pesticide regulation on the number of deaths from poisoning. These regulations, which were implemented in Sri Lanka from the 1970s, aimed to reduce the number of deaths - the majority from self-poisoning - by limiting the availability and use of highly toxic pesticides.
   Methods Information on legislative changes was obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture, national and district hospital admission data were obtained from the Sri Lanka Health Statistics Unit, and individual details of deaths by pesticide poisoning were obtained from a manual review of patients' notes and intensive care unit records in Anuradhapura.
   Findings Between 1986 and 2000, the total national number of admissions due to poisoning doubled, and admissions due to pesticide poisoning increased,by more than 50%. At the same time, the case fatality proportion (CFP) fell for total poisonings and for poisonings due to pesticides. In 1991-92, 72% of pesticide-induced deaths in Anuradhapura were caused by organophosphorus (OP) and carbamate pesticides - in particular,the WHO class I OPs monocrotophos and methamidophos. From 1991, the import of these pesticides was reduced gradually until they were banned for routine use in January 1995, with a corresponding fall in deaths. Unfortunately, their place in agricultural practice was taken by the WHO class II organochlorine endosulfan, which led to a rise in deaths from status epilepticus - from one in 1994 to 50 in 1998. Endosulfan was banned in 1998, and over the following three years the number of endosulfan deaths fell to three. However, at the end of the decade, the number of deaths from pesticides was at a similar level to that of 1991, with WHO class II OPs causing the most deaths. Although these drugs are less toxic-than class I OPs, the management of class II OPs remains difficult because they are, nevertheless, still highly toxic, and their toxicity is exacerbated by the paucity of available facilities.
   Conclusion The fall in CFP amidst a rising incidence of self-poisoning suggests that Sri Lanka's programmes of pesticide regulation were beneficial. However, a closer inspection of pesticide-induced deaths in one hospital revealed switching to other highly toxic pesticides, as one was banned and replaced in agricultural practice by another. Future regulation must predict this switching and bear in mind the ease of treatment of replacement pesticides.. Furthermore, such regulations must be implemented alongside other strategies, such as integrated pest management, to reduce the,overall pesticide availability for self-harm.

AB Adolescents are recognised as one of the most vulnerable groups against AIDS infection. The reasons are more than one. However, they also posses some unique strength such as inquisitiveness, fast grasping power, enthusiasm to implement and energy to carry out any mission that they are involved with. These could be channelised not only for their own benefit, but also for the benefit of the community.
   Parivartan has been making attempts to compose those strengths and translate them into reality. The methodology to accomplish the objectives has been training programme for the adolescents and the teachers with whom they spend a good part of the day and their life. Since, they need a sound board and to be guided and time to time, we ask the teachers to be involved with them and remain watchful at whatever they do. Parivartan has set up a Resource Unit, which is comprised of both the teachers as well as students for providing guidance to the peers in the school.
   Adolescence is viewed in most imaginative way and compared with such likeness as running stream, fresh air, flushes of rains and so on. It is also considered as the formative stage or the foundation of the lifeline. In fact, since time immemorial its richness is highly praised by the poets and sages. Yet adolescents are accused of being restless, reckless, illogical, impatient, irresponsible, over sensitive, difficult, dreamer, careless and many such things which are not approved by the adults.
   While both the positive as well as negative attributes are true, they basically reinforce the strength of the adolescents, who form 25 to 26 percent of the total human population. At this fort-native stage their behavioral pattern and personality development largely depend on the kind of interventions provided to them. Unfortunately, this unique phase of human life is the most neglected area. Its concerns though recognised yet are not addressed with total commitment. That is why the maximum number of drug addiction and suicides and the highest number of accidents, including running away from home take place amongst this age group.
   The urgency is further accelerated due to the rise in unwanted pregnancies and prevalence of STDs in this age group. The rising trend of HIV infection in young people, especially in the age group of 15 to 19 years further aggravates the situation. Statistics indicate that this age group forms one third of the total 3 to 5 million HIV positive in India. In both cases, sexual relationship remains the principal mode of transmission. That makes it necessary to impart sex education as preventive measures before the adolescents become sexually active. Unfortunately, the NPEP (National Population Education Program) though recognises sex related topics essential part of the conceptual framework of population education, the concept of adolescent health is not clearly defined. Even in the medical curriculum, there is nothing specific about adolescence.

AB IMPORTANCE Preventing depression in older adults living in low- and middle-income countries is important because of the scarcity of treatment resources and the risk of disability, suicide, and dementia.
   OBJECTIVE To assess whether an intervention for depression prevention provided by lay counselors is effective in older adults from low- and middle-income countries.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This parallel-group randomized clinical trial with masked outcome assessment was performed in 181 older adults (>= 60 years) with subsyndromal depressive symptoms at rural and urban primary care clinics in Goa, India. The first participant entered the trial on March 31, 2015, and the last exited on June 2, 2017. Data analysis used the intention-to-treat approach.
   INTERVENTIONS Lay counselors provided problem-solving therapy, brief behavioral treatment for insomnia, education in self-care of common medical disorders such as diabetes, and assistance in accessing medical and social programs.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcomewas incidence of major depressive episodes. The study also assessed symptom change during 12 months (12-item General Health Questionnaire [GHQ-12]; score range of 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating greater symptoms of depression and anxiety), functional status(World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0; score range of 12 to 60, with higher scores indicating greater disability), cognition (Hindi Mini-Mental State Examination; score range of 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive functioning), blood pressure, and body mass index to provide further clinical context.
   RESULTS The study enrolled 181 participants(mean[SD] age, 69.6[7.2] years; 114[63.0%] female): 91 to the intervention arm(depression in later life[DIL] intervention) and 90 to care as usual(CAU). Incident episodes of major depression were lower in the DIL intervention than in the CAU group(4.40% vs 14.44%; log-rank P = .04; number needed to treat, 9.95; 95% CI, 5.12-182.43). The 12-month Kaplan-Meier estimates of percentage of depression-free participants were 95.1%(95% CI, 90.5%-99.9%) in the DIL group vs 87.4% (95% CI, 80.4%-95.1%) in the CAU group. The incidence of depressive symptoms(GHQ-12) was also less(12-month mean difference,-1.18; 95% CI,-2.03 to -0.31; group x time interaction P < .001). There were no changes in measures of disability or cognition. The DIL intervention was associated with a significantly greater lowering of systolic blood pressure (12-month mean difference, -6.98; 95% CI, -11.96 to -2.01; group x time interaction P < .001) and change in body mass index (12-month mean difference, 0.23; 95% CI, -0.97 to 1.43; P = .04).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The DIL intervention is effective for preventing episodes of major depression in older persons with subsyndromal symptoms. If replicated, the DIL intervention may be effective in older adults living in low- and middle-income countries.

AB Background Efforts to establish the 2015 baseline and monitor early implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) highlight both great potential for and threats to improving health by 2030. To fully deliver on the SDG aim of "leaving no one behind", it is increasingly important to examine the health-related SDGs beyond national-level estimates. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017), we measured progress on 41 of 52 health -related SDG indicators and estimated the health-related SDG index for 195 countries and territories for the period 1990-2017, projected indicators to 2030, and analysed global attainment.
   Methods We measured progress on 41 health-related S DG indicators from 1990 to 2017, an increase of four indicators since GBD 2016 (new indicators were health worker density, sexual violence by non-intimate partners, population census status, and prevalence of physical and sexual violence [reported separately]). We also improved the measurement of several previously reported indicators. We constructed national-level estimates and, for a subset of health-related SDGs, examined indicator-level differences by sex and Socio-demographic Index (SDI) quintile. We also did subnational assessments of performance for selected countries. To construct the health related SDG index, we transformed the value for each indicator on a scale of 0-100, with 0 as the 2.5th percentile and 100 as the 97.5th percentile of 1000 draws calculated from 1990 to 2030, and took the geometric mean of the scaled indicators by target. To generate projections through 2030, we used a forecasting framework that drew estimates from the broader GBD study and used weighted averages of indicator-specific and country-specific annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2017 to inform future estimates. We assessed attainment of indicators with defined targets in two ways: first, using mean values projected for 2030, and then using the probability of attainment in 2030 calculated from 1000 draws. We also did a global attainment analysis of the feasibility of attaining SDG targets on the basis of past trends. Using 2015 global averages of indicators with defined SDG targets, we calculated the global annualised rates of change required from 2015 to 2030 to meet these targets, and then identified in what percentiles the required global annualised rates of change fell in the distribution of country-level rates of change from 1990 to 2015. We took the mean of these global percentile values across indicators and applied the past rate of change at this mean global percentile to all health-related SDG indicators, irrespective of target definition, to estimate the equivalent 2030 global average value and percentage change from 2015 to 2030 for each indicator.
   Findings The global median health-related SDG index in 2017 was 59.4 (IQR 35.4-67.3), ranging from a low of 11.6 (95% uncertainty interval 9.6-14.0) to a high of 84.9 (83.1-86.7). SDG index values in countries assessed at the subnational level varied substantially particularly in China and India, although scores in Japan and the UK were more homogeneous. Indicators also varied by SDI quintile and sex, with males having worse outcomes than females for non-communicable disease (NCD) mortality, alcohol use, and smoking, among others. Most countries were projected to have a higher health-related SDG index in 2030 than in 2017, while country-level probabilities of attainment by 2030 varied widely by indicator. Under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality ratio, and malaria indicators had the most countries with at least 95% probability of target attainment. Other indicators, including NCD mortality and suicide mortality, had no countries projected to meet corresponding SDG targets on the basis of projected mean values for 2030 but showed some probability of attaimnent by 2030. For some indicators, including child malnutrition, several infectious diseases, and most violence measures, the annualised rates of change required to meet SDG targets far exceeded the pace of progress achieved by any country in the recent past. We found that applying the mean global annualised rate of change to indicators without defined targets would equate to about 19% and 22% reductions in global smoking and alcohol consumption, respectively; a 47% decline in adolescent birth rates; and a more than 85% increase in health worker density per 1000 population by 2030.
   Interpretation The GBD study offers a unique, robust platform for monitoring the health -related SDGs across demographic and geographic dimensions. Our findings underscore the importance of increased collection and analysis of disaggregated data and highlight where more deliberate design or targeting of interventions could accelerate progress in attaining the SDGs. Current projections show that many health -related SDG indicators, NCDs, NCD-related risks, and violence -related indicators will require a concerted shift away from what might have driven past gains curative interventions in the case of NCDs towards multisectoral, prevention -oriented policy action and investments to achieve SDG aims. Notably, several targets, if they are to be met by 2030, demand a pace of progress that no country has achieved in the recent past. The future is fundamentally uncertain, and no model can fully predict what breakthroughs or events might alter the course of the S DGs. What is clear is that our actions or inaction today will ultimately dictate how close the world, collectively, can get to leaving no one behind by 2030.
