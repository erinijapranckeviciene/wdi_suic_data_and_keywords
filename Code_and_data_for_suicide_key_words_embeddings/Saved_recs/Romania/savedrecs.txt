AB Homicide-suicides are the term for homicides followed by the suicide of the offender. This study utilized police statistics, information from the penal files and an online search of news reports to establish the prevalence of homicide-suicides in Romania. We compare characteristics of homicide-suicides among current or former Romanian emigrants and Romanians who never emigrated. The estimated homicide-suicide rate was 0.005-0.146 per 100,000 inhabitants in Romania between 2002 and 2013. Intimate partners committed significantly more homicide-suicides among emigrants than non-emigrants. Emigrant homicide-suicides also had significantly more reports of prior abuse than non-emigrant homicide-suicides. The findings of this study call for improvements in intimate partner violence prevention in Romania and among Romanian migrant communities abroad.

AB Across the 42 counties of Romania, the total suicide rate and the population percentage of ethnic Hungarians were strongly positively interrelated (79% attributable variance). Counties with the strongest Hungarian minority had suicide rates converging to (or exceeding) the suicide rate for Hungary, which rate is high. Of a set of about 20 vital statistics and socioeconomic indicators, only life expectancy predicted a significant increment of further variance in the suicide rates. However, this effect was small, adding merely 3% further variance explained to 79% already accounted for, Overall, the findings are supportive of the Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis, i.e., the notion that geographic patterns of suicide prevalence may be partially due to genetic differences between Populations. Supplemental analyses of a questionnaire item which specifically queried this study's main finding indicated widespread disbelief of this fact of suicide prevalence across a variety of samples, including two samples from Romania.

AB Objective. The present paper analyses the relation between the number of blows, location of wounds and the length between homicide and suicide in homicide-suicide (HS) cases committed in Romania in the timeframe 2002-2013. At the same time, the study presents the correlation between three types of HS (intimate partner homicide-suicide (IPH-S), filicide-suicides (FS), familicides-suicides (Fam-S) and the above mentioned variables.
   Method. The data regarding the number of blows, location of wounds and length between homicide and suicide were extracted from the Homicide-suicides in Romania 2002-2013 database (N=132). The database includes information regarding all HS committed in Romania and the data were collected from the recordings of the Criminal Investigations Services, from criminal files in prosecutors' custody and from articles published in online newspapers. The data analysis was done by using SPSS 22.0.
   Results. More than a half of the suicides occurred immediately after the aggressor committed the homicide (N=71; 53.8%). In approximately two thirds of the cases (N=56; 57.1%), the death of the victim resulted from a great number of blows. Many aggressors preferred to hit their victims in the head area (21.5%) or neck area (22.3%) only. The most common suicide method recorded in HS cases was by hanging (34.8%).
   Conclusions. The prevention of the HS seems to be a difficult task after the aggressor initiated the first act of aggression (the homicide). Therefore, prevention and intervention have to be focused on the initial phases of the acts of violence that precede HS.

AB Evidence from politically and socially stable countries in Northern Europe and the Southern Hemisphere indicates a marked decrease in the seasonality of suicide over the past two decades. Generalizability of this trend to societies in transition has not vet been investigated. Data for suicide by hanging in Timis County of Romania show both a nondecrease in seasonality of suicide for the current transitional period (1990-98), relative to the last decade of the Communist regime (1980-89) and shifts in location for suicide peak and trough months. Recent decreases in the seasonality of suicide might not generalize to societies in transition, and research would improve from focusing on the "natural laboratories" these societies represent.

AB Voracek, Vintila, Fisher, and Yip (2002) reported that 1,120 suicides by hanging in one county in Romania from 1980-1999 did not show a decrease in seasonality from the 1980s to the 1990s using a time-series harmonic analysis. They generalized from this sample to the seasonality of suicide in the transitional societies of Eastern Europe in general.
   This Comment presents data on all 83,297 suicides (by all methods) in Hungary from 1980-1999.(2) Comparing the numbers of suicides each month in the 1980s and the 1990s (correcting for the extra leap year in the 1980s) showed a significant difference (X-11(2) =64.8, p<.001). The seasonal distribution in 1980 showed peaks in August and May. The percentage of suicides in May dropped from 9.94% in the 1980s to 9.70% in the 1990s. The percentage of suicides in July dropped from 9.86% in the 1980s to 9.44% in the 1990s.

However, it was the strongest ever to be documented with contemporary suicide data, supporting the conjecture of Voracek, et al. (2002) that seasonality of suicide remains high in Eastern Europe. A new hypothesis regarding the co-occurrence of high incidence and strong seasonality of suicide is presented.

AB Despite the fact that no major suicide terrorist act has occurred on Romanian territory, the Romanian national security system is deeply involved in the global war on terror, not only in military operations abroad but also in understanding it, as well as in counterterrorism prevention at home. Intelligence data shows that there are some supporters of Islamic fundamentalist groups in Romania who are involved in intense Islamic fundamentalist propaganda under cover of religious gatherings, attempting to win new members by means of mutual relations between Muslim believers, mostly in the main university centres. This paper tries to describe terrorist activities in Romania, to analyze the phenomenon of suicide terrorism and to present the main strategies to tackle it. It is a case study based on a multi-disciplinary approach.

AB The genetics of suicide is increasingly recognized and relevant for mental health literacy, but actual beliefs may lag behind current knowledge. We examined such beliefs in student samples (total N = 686) from Estonia, Malaysia, Romania, the United Kingdom, and the United States with die Beliefs in the Inheritance of Risk Factors for Suicide Scale. Cultural effects were small, those of key demographics nil. Several facets of construct validity were demonstrated. Marked differences in perceived plausibility of evidence about the genetics of suicide according to research design, observed in all samples, may be of general interest for investigating lily theories of abnormal behavior and communicating behavioral and psychiatric genetic research findings.

Chemical suicide records an increased incidence worldwide being one of "imported" autolytic methods, original from Japan, but propagated through websites. Intentional death by H2S inhalation raises important issues as the lethal gas can be obtained by mixing substances available on the market and because it leads to high mortality rate in suicide attempts in rescuers, family members and forensic research teams.

DT Review
DE Seppuku; Suicide; Self-stabbing abdominal wounds; Psychiatric disorders
ID HARA-KIRI; CLINICAL-FEATURES; STAB WOUNDS
AB Seppuku is a traditional suicide method practiced by honorable Japanese samurai. Today this method of suicide is rarely used in Japan or worldwide and may be exceptionally encountered in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders, the majority of them being older men. It is well known that clinical and cultural factors also play a role in practicing this method of suicide. The mortality rate is significantly higher in cases of abdominal wounds suggesting seppuku, compared to the mortality rate caused by simple stab wounds. Death can occur immediately through massive external or/and internal hemorrhage as well as later on through complications, often septic. In the Romanian forensic literature files, suicide by abdominal stabbing suggesting seppuku is rarely encountered and documented. When investigating violent deaths owing to sharp force, the role of the forensic pathologist is not only to establish the cause of death and the mechanism used for creating the lesions, but also to identify the object used for inflicting the injuries, the type of the injuries, allowing thus to formulate a conclusion from legal perspective upon the act itself: suicide or homicide? The present paper reviews the international literature and presents three cases of suicide by self- inflected abdominal stab wounds suggesting seppuku, autopsied at the Bihor County Forensic Service, Romania, during 2013-2017.

AB General aspects. Due to stigma and lack of codification for attempted suicide, no country in the world has a rigorous statistics of attempted suicide.
   The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the statistic profile of attempted suicide in Bihor County.
   Material and method. All the attempted suicide cases that were directed to the psychiatric units in Oradea, Bihor County, Romania for the first 6 months of 2012, different deliberate self-harm cases by different methods and self - poisoning which arrived at the emergency care unit (ECU) at the county hospital, as well as suicide cases in the same geographical area, in the same time frame were analyzed.
   Results. The suicide rate was of 23.16 cases in 100,000 inhabitants (estimated of being of 46.16 in 100,000 inhabitants yearly). Compared to complete suicide this means a 2.57 lower rate than the one suggested by the WHO (of 10-20 times suicide rate), with certain specific features: a peak of attempted suicide rate in the month of June. The profile of the majority suicidal tendencies is described as follows: women aged 15-24, unemployed, desperately resorting to drug overdose.

AB The conditions under which Physician-Assisted-Suicide (PAS) would be considered as acceptable among Romanians were examined. In July 2015-May 2016, 212 lay people and 52 health professionals judged the acceptability of PAS in 36 realistic vignettes composed of all combinations of four factors: the patient's age, the level of incurability of the illness, the type of suffering, and the patient's request for PAS. A majority of lay people (51%) and health professionals (85%) were opposed to PAS, quite irrespective of conditions. The most important factors determining acceptability were, for 36% of lay people, request for PAS and, for 18%, advanced age.

AB Helium is the chemical element with atomic number 2, represented by the symbol He. It is an inert, colorless, odorless, insipid monoatomic gas. It has the lowest boiling point and the lowest melting point among the chemical elements and appears only in gaseous state, except for extreme conditions. The use of helium for suicidal purposes is extremely rare. In Romania, suicide has a frequency of 12 per 100,000 inhabitants, which classifies us in the category of countries with low suicide rates. As methods, men use hanging most often while women use more softer methods such as poisoning. Helium is rarely used for suicidal purposes because it is relatively difficult to obtain. Basically, it is not poisoning in the true sense of the word, but rather the substitution of oxygen with helium, which cannot be carried by hemoglobin, and thus transport asphyxia occurs. At the end of the paper we shall exemplify a case of helium poisoning for suicide purposes, purchased from a cylinder for inflating balloons.

AB There is evidence for widespread disbelief in the genetics of suicide, despite recent research progress in this area and convergent evidence supporting a role for genetic factors. This study analyzed the beliefs held in 8 samples (total N=1224) of various types (psychology, medical, and various undergraduates, psychology graduates, and the general population) from 6 countries located on 3 continents (Austria, Canada, Malaysia, Romania, United Kingdom, and the USA). Endorsement rates for the existence of genetic risk factors for suicide ranged from 26% and 30% (Austrian psychology undergraduates and general population) to around 50% (psychology undergraduates in the USA and United Kingdom). In the 8 samples, respondents' sex, age, religiosity, political orientation, and other demographic variables were, for the most part, unrelated, but overall knowledge about suicide throughout was related positively to endorsement rates. Consistent with previous research, across a considerable variety of sample types and cultural settings there was no evidence for a clear majority believing in genetic bases for suicide.

AB Background The suicide rate is a macro indicator of the population's psychosocial wellbeing and an evaluation criterion of the effectiveness of suicide prevention strategies. A high level of injury deaths of undetermined intent (UD) is usually discussed in connection with the validity of suicide statistics. An effort is made to develop a criterion to characterise the quality of suicide statistics.
   Methods Standardised rates of suicides (X60-X84) and UD (Y10-Y34) by the International Classification of Disease version 10 as an average for the past five available years were taken from the WHO European mortality database. Rate ratios were computed by dividing rates of UD by suicide rates.
   Results There is considerable variation in suicide and UD rates among countries. The highest overall rates of UD were registered in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, and the lowest in Greece, Spain and Italy. The EU-15 average UD rate of 1.97 and the rate ratio of 0.194 UD to suicides were combined into a '2-20 benchmark', in which the primary indicator is 2.0 UD cases per 100 000 and the secondary indicator is the proportion of UD to suicides 0.20 (20%), which enables countries to be clustered according to the quality of suicide statistics. The following countries satisfied the benchmark: Greece, Norway, Spain, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Austria, Italy, Romania, Hungary, Ireland and Finland.
   Conclusion This study used the developed '2-20 benchmark' in Europe to assess suicide registration quality in a particular country, to compare the relative position of countries, and to set a target for those European countries that have not yet achieved the benchmark.

AB Suicide is globally recognized as one of the leading causes of death and a major issue for the public health sector. Considering the importance of suicide, this study attempts to correlate decreased platelet serotonin levels with increased suicide risk in bipolar I disorder (BPD I), while also evaluating other risk factors. All patients admitted to the "Prof. Dr. Alexandru Obregia" Clinical Hospital of Psychiatry in Bucharest, Romania, between the June 1st, 2015 and February 16th, 2016 were asked to participate in this study. Those between 18 and 65 years of age, who agreed to participate and whose diagnoses of BPD I were confirmed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview were included in the study, leading to a number of 75 patients. Suicide risk was assessed using the SAD PERSONS Scale to quantify current suicide risk factors. Platelet serotonin levels were determined using the IVD ELISA system (LDN GmbH, Germany) on platelet rich plasma per manufacturer protocol. The scores received from applying the SAD PERSONS Scale were shown to be inversely proportional to platelet serotonin levels, and those patients with bipolar disorder classified as showing medium-high suicide risk, had significantly lower platelet serotonin concentrations.

DE industrial accidents; work health and safety; suicide; psychological
   harassment / sexual harassment in the workplace
AB The work-related suicide is a new phenomenon and also an important warning sign in terms of work health and safety. In such cases, the employer's liability cannot be of a criminal nature, given the "moral harassment" or "manslaughter" offences, but consideration should be given to investigating a possible negligence on the part of the employer, which may have caused the suicidal act whose victim his/her employee was. Thus, the employer must be aware of the danger to which his/her employees are subjected and take appropriate preventive measures, i.e. such measures to protect the employees from the risks they face during work. Situations of psychological or sexual harassment in the workplace are likely to result in a state of depression, which may lead to a suicidal act. These are the main elements that led to the qualification of suicide as a work-related accident in many European countries, such as France. In Romania, however, current legislation excludes any intentional self-harming, self-mutilation or suicide from the notion of work-related accidents.
   The purpose of this paper is to analyse and outline the conditions where the suicide of an employee in the workplace or outside of it may be recognized as a industrial accident. Over time, the caselaw in many European states has evolved to include the suicide or the attempted suicide occurring in the workplace or outside of during the performance of a work contract to be work-related as well. We believe that it is enough for the suicide or the attempted suicide to be work-related in order to be considered an industrial accident. Evidently, suicides in the workplace that are not related to the professional situation cannot be treated as industrial accidents.

AB Suicide is globally recognized as one of the leading causes of death and a major issue for the public health sector. Considering the importance of suicide, this study attempts to correlate decreased platelet serotonin levels with increased suicide risk in bipolar I disorder (BPD I), while also evaluating other risk factors. All patients admitted to the "Prof. Dr. Alexandru Obregia" Clinical Hospital of Psychiatry in Bucharest, Romania, between the June 1st, 2015 and February 16th, 2016 were asked to participate in this study. Those between 18 and 65 years of age, who agreed to participate and whose diagnoses of BPD I were confirmed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview were included in the study, leading to a number of 75 patients. Suicide risk was assessed using the SAD PERSONS Scale to quantify current suicide risk factors. Platelet serotonin levels were determined using the IVD ELISA system (LDN GmbH, Germany) on platelet rich plasma per manufacturer protocol. The scores received from applying the SAD PERSONS Scale were shown to be inversely proportional to platelet serotonin levels, and those patients with bipolar disorder classified as showing medium-high suicide risk, had significantly lower platelet serotonin concentrations. In further studies, with a larger sample size, and other improvements further discussed in this article, it may be possible to demonstrate the need to test platelet serotonin levels as part of the biological model of suicide in bipolar disorder.

AB The current paper seeks to systematize the discussion on the causes of the changes in Eastern European countries' suicide mortality during the last 15 years by analyzing the changes in relation to some common causes: alcohol consumption, economic changes, "general pathogenic social stress", political changes and social disorganization. It is found that the development in suicide has varied between in different countries, and that the same causes cannot apply to all of them. However, the relation between suicide mortality and social processes is obvious. A model consisting of general stress, democratization, alcohol consumption and social disorganization (with a period-dependent effect) predicted fairly accurately the percentual changes in the suicide rates in 16 out of the 28 Eastern Bloc countries in 1984-89 and 1989-94, while it failed to do so for Albania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and the Caucasian and Central Asian newly independent states. The data are subject to many potential sources of error: the small number of units and the large multicollinearity between the independent variables may bias results. Nevertheless, the results indicate that the changes in Eastern European suicide mortality, both its decreases and increases, may be explained with the same set of variables. However, more than one factor is needed, and the multicollinearity will continue to pose a problem.

DE satellite accounts; health; compilation; Romania
AB For specific needs concerning the obtained data, i.e. for health, the best solution is to have separate satellite accounts as compared to System of National Accounts (SNA). We compiled and proposed two satellite accounts in relation with health care in Romania since the data for the health care industry are missing from official statistics. One health satellite account with high valuable information is one that includes total health expenditure, current health expenditure and gross capital formation, reported to GDP, as well as the percentage of GDP allocated to health care in time series, i.e. 2003-2009. A second approach is that health expenditure (amount or a percentage of GDP) time series could be analyzed in relation to a number of indicators of sustainable development, namely life expectancy at birth by gender, life expectancy at 65 years by gender, giving up care for financial reasons, mortality rate, death rates due to chronic diseases (total and by gender), suicide rates by gender and age and the number of injured at work.

AB Aim: To examine high school students' suicidal behavior and to identify predictors of suicide attempt among adolescents in Timis County, Romania. We hypothesized that suicide attempt is associated with other health-risk behaviors.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study we included 2908 high school students in grades 9 to 12. The students were asked to complete an anonymous structured questionnaire during a normal class. We examined the relationship between having attempted suicide and engaging in other health-risk or problem behaviors.
   Results: During the previous 12 months, 15.4% of the students had had suicidal ideation, 7.5% had made a suicide plan and 6.1% reported that they had attempted suicide. Based on logistic regression multivariate analysis, attempted suicide was associated with feeling sad or hopeless almost every day for two or more consecutive weeks (OR = 4.74; 95% CI: 3.07-7.31), being forced to have sexual intercourse (OR = 3.18; 95% CI: 1.83-5.50), being physically aggressed by his or her father (OR = 4.28; 95% Cl: 1.96-9.34), performing poorly at school (OR = 4.22; 95% CI: 1.51-11.74), having an impaired relationship with parents (OR = 2.45; 95% Cl: 1.17-5.12), not eating for 24 hours or more to lose weight or to avoid gaining weight during the past 30 days (OR = 2.23; 95% Cl: 1.40-3.53), being female (OR = 1.91; 95% Cl: 1.21-2.99) and carrying a weapon (OR = 2.44; 95% Cl: 1.53-3.90).
   Conclusion: This study suggests that suicide attempts are associated with other risk behaviors. These behaviors may help to evaluate suicide risk and should be considered when establishing preventive programs.

AB Background Childhood injury rates are higher in low and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. Childhood injuries have not been widely studied in Romania, a middle-income country, because data sources are lacking.
   Objective This study presents the first surveillance data of nonfatal childhood injuries from a large children's hospital in Cluj, a major city of Romania.
   Methods This retrospective study included review of medical records of injured children of 0-18 years of age treated in a major city pediatric emergency department from 1999 to 2003.
   Results In the 5-year study period, 1179 childhood injuries were treated in the emergency department, for an average of 236 patients per year. For the county of Cluj, this represents an annual average injury incidence of 197 per 100 000 children younger than 5 years, 140 per 100 000 children aged 5-14 years, and 135 per 100 000 for children aged 15-18 years. Unintentional injuries represented 77.8% of cases, 18% were self-harm and suicide attempts, and 4.3% were assaults.
   Conclusion These trends, among the first reported from Romania, can help identify priority prevention areas.

DE diazinon; accidental poisoning; suicide; sheep breeders
AB The study aims at highlighting accidental and intentional acute diazinon poisoning regarding a series of 24 cases recorded between 2006 and 2015 in Sibiu County (Romania). All exposures have been by ingestion, of which in two thirds of cases it was accidental, the rest of them being suicides. A total of 8 cases had fatal outcomes, 7 of them passing away before any resuscitation manoeuvre could have been performed. In most cases (n=21) poisoning occurred in rural people having as main activity sheep breeding. Women and men were affected in almost equal proportions. The victims belonged to all age groups, including children. In 18 of these cases, the level of education was at most secondary school. The majority of cases (n=22) occurred during peak periods of pastoral activity. The last 5 years of the study period recorded an upward trend in the number of poisoning cases.
   The study demonstrates that those who practice traditional sheepherding represent a vulnerable population, given the relative isolation of such communities, the low educational level and the fact that toxic substances are routinely stored in homes (because the residential area overlaps with the occupational one).

AB The objective was to examine changes in temporal trends in suicide mortality in 26 Western countries by retrospective trend analysis of the WHO mortality database on causes of deaths. From 1990 to 2010, there was a median reduction in suicide mortality of 22.7%, ranging from a 46% reduction in Estonia to a 26.2% increase in Romania. Suicide mortality decreased by >= 20% in 15 countries, and the reduction tended to be greater in countries with higher mortality in 1990. In most of the central European countries mortality strongly declined. The median changes in the age groups were -25.3% (range -62.9% to 72.6%) in people aged 15-24 years, -36.9% (-60.5% to 32.4%) in 25-34 years, -3.6% (-57.1% to 92%) in 35-54 years, -12.2% (-37% to 65,7%) in 55-74 years and -16.1% (-54.5% to 166.7%) in >= 75 years. Suicide prevention programs in youths and in the elderly seem to be effective (at least in females for the elderly) and efforts should be pursued in this way. However, suicide mortality of the people aged 35-54 years has increased in half of the studied countries between 1990 and 2010. Public policies should further orientate their efforts toward this population.

AB The purpose of this study is to determine the pattern of drug related deaths in Romania between 2008 and 2011 by analyzing the medical-legal cases, from a significant proportion of Romanian Counties (out of 41 plus the capital), in which the direct causal link between drug overdose and death was drug related. Material and methods. 446 forensic toxicology cases were analyzed in a four year period, obtained from more than two thirds of the counties in Romania. Results. 54.26% yielded a positive toxicological analysis, most often with benzodiazepines, opiates, barbiturates and cannabinoids. Males around 31 years old represented the most affected group. Illegal drug related deaths were more frequent in males and non-illegal drug related deaths were proportionally more frequent in females. Discussions and conclusions. The pattern of consumption is similar to the one obtained by similar studies in neighboring countries. The city capital has a very distinct pattern of consumption compared to other cities/counties.

ID FORMER USSR; ALCOHOL-CONSUMPTION; PERESTROIKA; RATES; RELIABILITY;
   COUNTRIES; GERMANY; RUSSIA; CRISIS; MEN
AB The current paper seeks to systematize the discussion on the causes of the changes in Eastern European countries' suicide mortality during the last 15 years by analyzing the changes in relation to some common causes: alcohol consumption, economic;changes, "general pathogenic social stress", political changes, and social disorganization. It is found that the developments in suicide have been very different in different countries, and that the same causes cannot apply to all of them. However, the relation between suicide mortality and social processes is obvious. A model consisting of the hypothetical general stress (as indicated by mortality/life expectancy), democratization, alcohol consumption, and social disorganization (with a period-dependent effect) predicted the percentual changes in the suicide rates in 16 out of the 28 Eastern Blee countries in 1984-89 and 1989-94 fairly accurately, while it failed to do this for Albania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and the Caucasian and Central Asian newly independent states. Most interesting were the strong roles played by changes in life expectancy, the causes of which are discussed, and the fact that economic change seemed to lack explanatory power in multiple analyses. The data are subject to many potential sources of error, the small number of units and the large multicollinearity between the independent variables may distort the results. Nevertheless, the results indicate that the changes in Eastern European suicide mortality, both decreases and increases, may be explained with the same set of variables. However, more than one factor is needed, and the multicollinearity will continue to pose problems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Does austerity really kill?

DT Article
DE Recession and health; Socioeconomic determinants of health; Austerity
ID HEALTH; UNEMPLOYMENT; RECESSIONS; MORTALITY; SUICIDE; POLICY
AB A growing body of the literature has argued that austerity has been bad for health, though without directly measuring austerity. This paper explicitly distinguishes the association of mortality with macroeconomic fluctuations from that with fiscal policy measures, using data for 28 European Union (EU) countries covering the period 1991-2013. The main results present a nuanced, complex picture about the mortality impact of fiscal policies. We confirm the mortality decreasing (increasing) effect of recessions (booms), with the exception of suicide mortality, which shows the opposite effects. Austerity regimes are associated with an increase in all-cause mortality (0.7%). At the same time, fiscal stimuli tend to significantly increase death rates due to cirrhosis or chronic liver disease (3%) and those due to vehicle accidents (4.3%). Our results are sensitive to the set of countries included: when excluding the Baltics, Romania and Hungary, austerity policies turn out to significantly increase suicide-related mortality (2.8%), while the effect on all-cause mortality remains unaffected (0.7%). Overall, however it appears that the austerity-increasing effects are mostly compensated by the (mostly) mortality-decreasing effects of recessions. A notable exception appears to be suicides, which receive a 'double-boost' from both recessions and austerity. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   ADOLESCENT SUICIDE; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; CHILD; PROGRAM; PARTICIPATION;
   DEPRESSION
AB Background: There have been only a few reports illustrating the moderate effectiveness of suicide-preventive interventions in reducing suicidal behavior, and, in most of those studies, the target populations were primarily adults, whereas few focused on adolescents. Essentially, there have been no randomized controlled studies comparing the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and cultural adaptability of suicide-prevention strategies in schools. There is also a lack of information on whether suicide-preventive interventions can, in addition to preventing suicide, reduce risk behaviors and promote healthier ones as well as improve young people's mental health.
   The aim of the SEYLE project, which is funded by the European Union under the Seventh Framework Health Program, is to address these issues by collecting baseline and follow-up data on health and well-being among European adolescents and compiling an epidemiological database; testing, in a randomized controlled trial, three different suicide-preventive interventions; evaluating the outcome of each intervention in comparison with a control group from a multidisciplinary perspective; as well as recommending culturally adjusted models for promoting mental health and preventing suicidal behaviors.
   Methods and design: The study comprises 11,000 adolescents emitted from randomized schools in 11 European countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden serving as the scientific coordinating center. Each country performs three active interventions and one minimal intervention as a control group. The active interventions include gatekeeper training (QPR), awareness training on mental health promotion for adolescents, and screening for at-risk adolescents by health professionals. Structured questionnaires are utilized at baseline, 3- and 12-month follow-ups in order to assess changes.
   Discussion: Although it has been reported that suicide-preventive interventions can be effective in decreasing suicidal behavior, well-documented and randomized studies are lacking. The effects of such interventions in terms of combating unhealthy lifestyles in young people, which often characterize suicidal individuals, have never been reported. We know that unhealthy and risk-taking behaviors are detrimental to individuals' current and future health. It is, therefore, crucial to test well-designed, longitudinal mental health-promoting and suicide-preventive interventions by evaluating the implications of such activities for reducing unhealthy and risk behaviors while concurrently promoting healthy ones.

AB Objective. In Romania medical-legal studies on the pattern of drug consumption have not yet been conducted nationwide; the purpose of this study was, therefore, to determine whether such a pattern could be identified. Methods. A total number of 577 analyses were performed during a three-year period on people suspected of non-lethal substance abuse, in more than two-thirds of the counties in Romania. Preliminary tests were conducted using immunoassay tests (blood or urine) and confirmatory tests were carried out using either GC-MS or HPLC. Results. 240 cases (41.6%) were negative while 327 cases (58.4%) tested positive for illegal drugs, central nervous system medication or both. Men represented 89.5% of all cases, while women accounted for only 10.5%. The pattern of substance abuse varied significantly, depending on the geographical area. In most cases, the identified drugs of abuse were cannabinoids and opiates, with a significantly different distribution of cases, depending on the geographical area. The highest number of positive cases was identified in the month of October, whereas the smallest numbers were identified in July and December. The annual trend of consumption revealed a significant decrease in the analysed substances in 2011. Conclusions. Our study has determined the presence of a specific pattern of consumption in different geographical areas - a result that suggests the need for more targeted prevention programmes, addressing local particularities in consumption behaviours. A significant decrease in the identification of drugs of abuse in the third year of our study, combined with data attesting the significant increase in the consumption of legal highs suggests that the forensic toxicology laboratories need to be equipped with apparatus able to detect these newer substances of abuse more efficiently.

AB One of the most critical complications of severe personality disorders is suicide. Earlier studies on patients with borderline personality disorder have reported rates from 8% to 10% of completed suicide. Some prospective investigations have also revealed antisocial personality disorder among predictors of future suicide attempts. On the other hand, there is substantial empirical evidence that severe personality disorders robustly predict suicidal behaviours among male and female offenders. In Romania, the literature on suicidal behaviours in prisons is relatively scarce. This study responds to a call to investigate factors that contribute to the prediction of lifetime suicide risk among persons imprisoned for criminal offences. Our aim was to test predictive models of current suicide risk and suicidal antecedents among imprisoned male offenders. A principal focus was on the role of severe personality disorders. Participants were 338 males incarcerated for a wide range of violent or non-violent offences (M-age = 34.41 years; SD = 8.95). Participants were interviewed individually using a protocol for demographic data, judicial status, vulnerabilities related to personal life history, and suicidal antecedents. The current suicide risk was captured with the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised. The psychiatric history and current diagnoses were collected from personal records. Raw data were analyzed using parametric and non-parametric comparative tests, multiple linear regression and binary logistic regression. At the time of data collection, eighty-two participants (24.3%) were diagnosed with at least one severe personality disorder. Antisocial personality disorder was prevalent (52.4%). Other diagnoses included: emotionally unstable personality disorder (17%), emotionally unstable personality disorder-impulsive type (13.4%), and borderline personality disorder (9.7%). Violent victimization during early socialization, disharmonic organization of personality in adolescence, personal history of self-harming behaviours, negative global perception of childhood and adolescence, and the presence of a severe personality disorder were predictors of suicidal antecedents. On the other hand, disharmonic organization of personality in adolescence, previous self-harming behaviours, and the diagnosis of severe personality disorder were the main predictors of current suicide risk. Furthermore, the likelihood of a future suicide attempt was higher among male inmates who had suicidal antecedents. The results suggest that severe personality disorders should be considered when developing self-destructive behaviours prevention programs in prisons.

AB To identify the prevalence, characteristics, and risk markers for childhood poisonings treated in the emergency department of a large Romanian hospital. Trauma registry data using ICD-10 codes and case summaries were studied to identify poisonings among children aged 0-18. Multivariate logistic regression identified factors associated with hospital admission. Between 1999 and 2003, 1,173 pediatric trauma cases were seen in the emergency department; 437 (37.3%) were treated for poisoning, including medication (35%), alcohol (26%), chemical products (19%), and carbon monoxide (14%). Half of all poisonings were unintentional, primarily affecting children < 10 years. Half were intentional, mainly affecting children 10-18. Females were three times more likely than males to have documented suicidal intent (P < .0001). Over 30% of suicide attempts were among children ages 10-14 (P < .0001). We report significantly increased adjusted odds ratios (P < .05) of hospital admission for children 10-18, and for chemical substance poisoning, and suicidal intent. Pediatric poisoning is a serious public health issue in Romania, and we suggest these findings are relevant across other eastern European countries with limited resources. Poisonings result in morbidity and hospital admissions, yet there are few prevention resources available. Health education programs and consumer product safety policies are needed in Romania and eastern Europe.

AB The aim of this retrospective epidemiological study was to investigate the demographical, etiological and clinical characteristics of acute drug poisonings in Iasi County, Romania. All patients were referred and admitted in the Toxicology Clinic of "Sf. loan" Emergency Clinic Hospital Iasi, Romania. Between 2003 and 2009, 811 cases of acute drug poisonings were recorded, counting for 28.43% from the total number of poisonings. The majority of these poisonings resulted in mild (51.94%) and medium (28.35%) clinical forms, while 19.71% were coma situations. In all, 63.51% of patients originated from urban areas, 39.94% were unemployed and the patients were predominantly women (66.46%). A high percentage (97.27%) were suicide attempts, using only one type of drug (65.88%) and the 21-30 years group (29.8%) records the highest incidence, for both women and men. The most frequently involved drugs were benzodiazepines 13.69%, anticonvulsive drugs 8.63%, barbiturates 8.51% and cardiovascular drugs 5.92%. Drugs combinations were recorded in 32.92% of cases and 1.2% were combinations between drugs and other substances. Mortality was the outcome in 0.3% of the total registered number of acute drug poisonings. This study underlines that in order to provide a proper management of these situations, a Regional Poison Information Center is absolutely necessary.

ID HEALTH
AB Death in custody is defined as a death taking place in the custody of the police, prison service, involuntary patients in psychiatric institutions or in the custody of other authorities; independent of the cause or manner of death. In this article we wanted to analyze the main features of the death in custody in Romania. The study was conducted using data obtained from the Romanian National Penitentiary Administration from 2003 to 2008; data was included in, and analyzed using the Microsoft Excel 2007 software. The main results we have obtained are (1) the medium number of prisoners, mortality and morbidity have declined from 2003 to 2008, whilst the mortality and morbidity rates remained almost constant. By analyzing the causes of death we identified a significant decrease in the number of non-violent deaths, whilst the number of violent deaths remained almost constant. The most frequent non-lethal pathologies were respiratory, gastrointestinal and dermatological whilst the most frequently lethal pathologies were cardiovascular and neoplastic. A violent manner of death was identified in a minority of cases, and was usually represented by suicides (by hanging).
   In conclusion, the matter of death in penitentiaries in Romania is mostly non-violent, with cardiovascular and neoplastic disorders being the most frequent lethal pathologies. The relative number of violent deaths has increased in the last years, suggesting the need for more strict rules and regulations.

AB Carbamates are potent cholinesterase inhibitors derived from carbamic acid but compared to organophosphates their action is reversible thus making them less dangerous. Carbamates are frequently used as insecticides the most known in Romania being carbofuran (Furadan) secondary to a famous singer's suicide using this substance. In the current paper the authors analyse the severity, mechanism of action and therapeutic methods used in carbamate insecticide intoxication based on one case of accidental poisoning secondary to contaminated beer ingestion. To our opinion, carbamates exhibit a different toxicity than the organophosphates, with a more brutal, life-threatening behaviour than previously considered.

AB BackgroundThe recognition of work stressors and their links to sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviours and coping strategies is important for enhancing the working conditions of dentists.
   AimThe aim of our study was to identify and rank work stressors in dentists from Cluj-Napoca, Romania, and to investigate their potential links to sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviours and coping strategies.
   Study designA questionnaire based on the Work Stress Inventory for Dentists (WSID) was delivered to a cross-sectional sample of 250 dentists working in six neighborhoods across Cluj-Napoca, Romania, as well as at the local Faculty of Dentistry. We collected and analysed information on sociodemographic characteristics, work stressors, health behaviours and coping strategies.
   ResultsTime and scheduling pressure, concerns about the future and pay-related work stressors were found to rank highest among the categories of work stressors investigated. Higher work stress was significantly linked to higher workloads, lower job satisfaction, poorer eating and exercise habits, higher work pain and discomfort, lower perceived health and less sleep. Job satisfaction was the single best predictor variable of work stress scores. The most frequently used coping strategy to deal with work stress was resting and taking breaks. Only one-quarter of respondents used active coping strategies.
   ConclusionOur findings suggest that work stress is linked to a number of detrimental attitudes in dentists and that there is room for dentists to make lifestyle improvements.

AB The current study looked into non-suicidal self-injury behavior, comparing two countries, that is Belgium and Romania, tackling into the attachment styles and the psychopathology characteristic for this behavior. The sample consisted of 85 non-clinical participants, 43 in Romanian sample and 42 in Belgian sample, aged between 20 and 26 years, students or graduates. The data was collected via both social networks and pen-and-pencil. The measurements we used were: Non-Suicidal Self-Injury Questionnaire (NSSIQ), Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL - 90), Experiences in Close Relationships Scale Revised (ECR-SR), Functions of Non-Suicidal Self-Injury Questionnaire (FNSIQ). Results showed for Belgian sample that participants had a higher rate of non-suicidal self-injury behavior and we found a positive correlation between avoidant attachment, but not between anxious attachment, and non-suicidal self-injury behavior. None of the following symptoms (somatization, depression, anxiety, hostility, paranoid ideation, psychotic traits, phobic anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity, obsessive-compulsive traits) were predictors of non-suicidal self-injury for Belgian or Romanian participants.

AB Introduction. Aiming at generating evidence for cost-effective public health (PH) interventions for suicidal behaviour (SB) prevention in South Eastern Europe, the objective was to identify adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) most strongly predicting SB in emerging adults.
   Methods. Survey data of 3283 students aged 18-29 from Montenegro and Romania were analysed by logistic regression. Based on estimation of risk-for-SB, the profiles with the highest values were identified.
   Results. The SB odds were the highest in respondents, experienced a suicide attempt in the household (OR: 13.81; p < 0.001), and whose primary family was not complete, in particular in those with the foster family background (OR: 18.30; p = 0.001).
   Conclusions. Magnitude of impact on emerging adults' mental health vulnerability tends to vary considerably with individual ACEs. This should be considered carefully when developing cost-effective response to SB burden through PH interventions in particular at the times of financial crises and in scarce resources settings.

AB During the post-communist transition, Romanians experienced some of the highest mortality rates in eastern Europe, some of the greatest fluctuations in life expectancy and some of the greatest delays in recovery. This study examines the shifts in cause-specific mortality underlying these fluctuations. Using demographic methods to understand the peaks and troughs in life expectancy during the past twenty years, we explore several explanations for these fluctuations: changes in exposure and behaviour associated with the social, economic and political changes; changes in health care affecting amenable causes of death and the progression of the epidemiologic transition. Throughout this period, there is a continuing shift from infectious towards chronic diseases mortality. Psycho-social stress during the period of transition affected survival, evidenced by increases in suicides and differences in mortality between men and women. Amenable causes of death took a greater toll on life expectancy, and increases in tuberculosis and congenital heart abnormality mortality provide evidence of a weakening of health services. However, decreases in vaccine-preventable mortality demonstrate that the health system did not fully fail. Policy changes also affected survival, including decreasing abortion-related mortality and, after initial increases in accidental mortality, new improvements, especially in traffic fatalities.

AB Background: Children's exposure to violence is a major public health issue. The Balkan epidemiological study on Child Abuse and Neglect project aimed to collect internationally comparable data on violence exposures in childhood.
   Methods: A three stage stratified random sample of 42,194 school-attending children (response rate: 66.7%) in three grades (aged 11, 13 and 16 years) was drawn from schools in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Greece, Romania, Serbia and Turkey. Children completed the ICAST-C questionnaire, which measures children's exposure to violence by any perpetrator.
   Results: Exposure rates for psychological violence were between 64.6% (FYROM) and 83.2% (Greece) for lifetime and 59.62% (Serbia) and 70.0% (Greece) for past-year prevalence. Physical violence exposure varied between 50.6% (FYROM) and 76.3% (Greece) for lifetime and 42.5% (FYROM) and 51.0% (Bosnia) for past-year prevalence. Sexual violence figures were highest for lifetime prevalence in Bosnia (18.6%) and lowest in FYROM (7.6%). Lifetime contact sexual violence was highest in Bosnia (9.8%) and lowest in Romania (3.6%). Past-year sexual violence and contact sexual violence prevalence was lowest in Romania (5.0 and 2.1%) and highest in Bosnia (13.6 and 7.7% respectively). Self-reported neglect was highest for both past-year and lifetime prevalence in Bosnia (48.0 and 20.3%) and lowest in Romania (22.6 and 16.7%). Experiences of positive parental practices were reported by most participating children in all countries.
   Conclusions: Where significant differences in violence exposure by sex were observed, males reported higher exposure to past-year and lifetime sexual violence and females higher exposure to neglect. Children in Balkan countries experience a high burden of violence victimization and national-level programming and child protection policy making is urgently needed to address this.

AB Lung cancer is the first cause of death worldwide of oncological patients. Most of them are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and many of them are characterized by different molecular markers that allow the development of personalized treatments. Epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are the most frequently tested genes in lung adenocarcinoma and other lung carcinomas with glandular component. The aim of our study is to evaluate the distribution of ALK gene mutation in lung cancer patient from North West part of Romania. We analysed a number of 289 lung biopsies along 18 months. The samples have been incubated with monoclonal ALK antibodies (clone D5F3), according to the manufacturer's instruction. The interpretation guide provided by manufacturer was used to distinguish the positives vs negative cases. In our study from a total number of 289 lung biopsies, 196 cases were carcinomas. 57.65 % from the total number of lung cancers were adenocarcinomas. A total number of 79 cases have been analysed for ALK gene supra expression. 5.08 % of adenocarcinomas were positive for ALK, but the mean age for this population is higher comparing with the data from other studies.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the association of cigarette smoking and 2 indicators of psychosocial distress (hopelessness and loneliness) among adolescents from 2 distinctly different regions of the world: Central-Eastern Europe (Hungary, Ukraine, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Romania, Poland) and Southeast Asia (Thailand, Taiwan, and the Philippines). Among Southeast Asian boys and girls, smokers had elevated hopelessness in comparison to nonsmokers but among Central-Eastern European students, this relationship was true only for girls and there was no relationship for boys. Across the country samples, there was only association of smoking with loneliness among Southeast Asian girls and Central-Eastern European girls. While Southeast Asian girls who smoked scored higher on loneliness than nonsmokers, the opposite was true among Central-Eastern European girls, with smokers scoring lower on loneliness.

AB The study aims to evaluate some predictors in the statement of suicidal thoughts in the last year by students from Timisoara universities, Romania. The student population consisted of 2536 young people aged 18-29, with an average age of 21.06 years and a standard deviation of 1.529 years, 64.5% girls and 35.5% boys. It was conducted a transversal population survey. In the logarithmic model of predictors in the context of social and psychoactive drugs use in students regarding the likelihood of suicidal thoughts in the last year, we have identified predictors with OR between 1.5-2, poorly significant: dissatisfaction with the relationship with parents (OR = 1.782), drug use frequency (OR = 1.697), dissatisfaction with the relationship with current friends (OR = 1.531).

AB Growing up without parents can seriously affect psychological development of children and adolescents. In the present in Romania over 300,000 children up to the age of 18 have one or both parents working abroad. Existing data mostly focused on children, less is known about parental absence effect on adolescents. Objective: We aimed to examine the association of parents' migration with adolescent mental health assessing distress and health risk behaviors. Method: A sample of N=477 participants (291 girls and 185 boys) with one or both parents working abroad was withdrawn from a large nationally representative adolescent sample (N=3423). A self-administered online questionnaire assessed level of depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, health-risk behaviors like skipping meals, physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol and drug use as well as sexual risk behaviors. Findings: Overall results indicated more negative outcomes for adolescents with mother or both parents absent.

AB Drowning is a major, but often neglected global public health problem, representing the third leading cause of death from unintentional injury, with the higher prevalence in the low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
   In this paper the authors present the results of a retrospective study which aimed at analysing the epidemiological aspects of drowning in children from the Crisana region. Our study demonstrated that the children most exposed to drowning were boys aged over 5, from rural areas, with poor socio-economic and cultural background, unattended and without the ability to swim. The results of the study also show that young males who are unsupervised in rural areas and have limited formal swimming instruction are at greatest risk of drowning in small bodies of water around their homes. The results of our study could be useful in designing the most suitable preventive methods for drowning, starting from the methods already provided in the literature.

ID RISK; BEHAVIOR; SUICIDE
AB Self-harm is a much more common pathology within the prison environment than outside of this, so much so that it can be considered specific to it. For 7 years, in the biggest prison hospital in Romania, self-harm was present in 5% of the hospitalized patients, with a total of 762 cases. The mechanisms of self-harm were the ingestion of foreign bodies (63%) and the insertion of foreign bodies in: the soft parts (19%), intracranially (6%), intraabdominally (2%) and intrathoracically (2%). Metal bodies are the most commonly used in self-harm (over 90%). The self-harm technique is learnt from the inmates with a history of such incidents. The mortality is low (0.4%), refusal of treatment is found in 13% of cases, and recurrence of self-harm is common where the ingestion and intracranial insertion of foreign bodies occurs (42%-50%). Mental disorders, dominated by personality disorders, are found in 46% of patients.

AB An estimated 800 000 suicide deaths occur worldwide. The global suicide rate is 11.4 per 100 000 population; 15.0/100 000 for males and 8.0/100 000 for females. Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year olds. In a collaborative effort to reduce the high rates of suicide and mental health problems among youth across Europe, the European Union 7(th) Framework funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. SEYLE is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to promote mental health and healthy lifestyles, while preventing psychopathology and suicidal behaviours among adolescents. The epidemiological data on 11,110 pupils in the age group 14-16 years, with a mean age of 14.8 years (SD +/- 0.8), who were recruited from 168 schools across 10 European Union countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden as the coordinating centre showed the following prevalences: alcohol use (13.4%), smoking (30.9%), physical inactivity (32.8%), pathological Internet use (4.4%) and sleeping on average 7.7 hours per night. In terms of reproductive health, the prevalence of sexual debut was 18.8% for the total sample. Pupils aged >= 16 years had a higher prevalence (38%) of sexual debut compared to those aged <= 15 years (13.2%). Males had a higher prevalence (21.3%) than females (16.9%). Three clusters of adolescents were identified: 57.8% with low frequency of all risk-behaviours; 13.2% with high frequency of all risk behaviours; and 29% so-called `invisible' risk group, which did not show any striking externalised risk behaviours, but scored positive for high use of Internet/TV/videogames, sedentary behaviour and reduced sleep. When comparing pupils in the `invisible' risk group with those in the high-risk group, similar prevalence rates of anxiety (8% vs. 9.2%), subthreshold depression (33.2% vs. 34%), depression (13.4% vs. 14.7%) and suicidal thoughts (42.2% vs. 44%) were observed. Pupils meeting the criteria of depression and subthreshold depression were 10.5% and 32%, respectively. Prevalence rates for anxiety and subthreshold anxiety was 5.8% and 29.2%, respectively. Lifetime prevalence of deliberate self-injurious behaviours (D-SIB) was 27.6%, with higher rates reported for occasional D-SIB (19.7%) compared to repetitive D-SIB (7.8%). Suicidal ideation was present in approximately one third of the sample (32.3%). More than four percent (4.2%) of the sample reported attempting suicide during their lifetime, with a significantly higher prevalence among girls (5.1% vs. 3.0%, p<0.05). In comparing the effectiveness of the three active SEYLE interventions, based on three specific preventive strategies directed towards teachers and school staff, professionals and pupils in comparison to a control group, the intervention empowering pupils, called the Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) showed significant results in preventing new cases of suicide attempts, severe suicidal ideation with plans and depression. More than a 50% reduction of incident cases of suicide attempts (OR: 0.45 [0.24 - 0.85]; p=0.014), and of incident cases of severe suicidal ideation and plans (OR: 0.50 [0.27 - 0.92]; p=0.025), as well as a significant reduction by 30% of incident cases with moderate to severe depression (OR: 0.71 [0.52- 0.97]; p=0.031) was observed.

ID ENOLASE LEVELS; HEME; INTOXICATION; EXPOSURE
AB Carbon monoxide (CO) remains an insidious and silent killer due to its physical and chemical properties; its lethal effects are encountered in cases of household accidents, occupational hazards or suicide. Deaths due to CO poisoning were studied retrospectively in the period 2000-2018 at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, Timisoara, Romania. These cases represent 1.75% of all the autopsies and 0.63% of all violent deaths. There have been cases of single deaths and cases with multiple victims - concomitant deaths. The analysis of lethal CO intoxication cases that occurred in different circumstances (incomplete burning with CO accumulation, fires - associated with burns, death in the fountain - due to fossil fuel pump failure, suicide due to exhaust gases) was based on the examination of 298 autopsy files. In this type of poisoning, the forensic examination of the body is marked by the non-specific character of most of the macroscopic and microscopic changes. Although inconstant, these types of changes (e.g., red discoloration of livor mortis) raise the suspicion of death by CO poisoning; the essential contribution to establishing cause of death resides in the determination of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) concentration by spectroscopy. In all cases, the cerebral and cardio-pulmonary modification and their contribution to the cause of death were studied. Comorbidities interfere with the cause of death in cases with average COHb concentrations, in the 20-50% range, where CO blood levels alone are not reason enough to explain the onset of death.

AB Using two new scales, this study examined beliefs in genetic determinism and attitudes towards psychiatric genetic research in student samples from Austria, Malaysia, Romania, and the United Kingdom. For both constructs, effects of culture were detectable, whereas those related to key demographics were either small and inconsistent across samples (political orientation and religiosity) or zero (sex and age). judged from factorial dimensionality and internal consistency, the psychometric properties of both scales were satisfactory. Belief in genetic determinism had lower prevalence and corresponded only modestly to positive attitudes towards psychiatric genetic research which had higher prevalence. The correlations of both constructs with a preference of inequality among social groups (social dominance orientation) were modest and inconsistent across samples. Both scales appear appropriate for cross-cultural applications, in particular for research into lay theories and public perceptions regarding genetic vs environmental effects on human behavior, mental disorders, and behavioral and psychiatric genetic research related to these.

AB Objective To evaluate the association between adverse childhood experiences e.g. abuse, neglect, domestic violence and parental separation, substance use, mental illness or incarceration and the health of young adults in eight eastern European countries.
   Methods Between 2010 and 2013, adverse childhood experience surveys were undertaken in Albania, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, Romania, the Russian Federation, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey. There were 10 696 respondents 59.7% female - aged 18-25 years. Multivariate modelling was used to investigate the relationships between adverse childhood experiences and health-harming behaviours in early adulthood including substance use, physical inactivity and attempted suicide.
   Findings Over half of the respondents reported at least one adverse childhdod experience. Having one adverse childhood experience increased the probability of having other adverse childhood experiences. The number of adverse childhood experiences was positively correlated with subsequent reports of health-harming behaviours. Compared with those Who reported no adverse experiences, respondents who reported at least four adverse childhood experiences were at significantly increased risk of many health-harming behaviours, with odds ratios varying from 1.68 (95% confidence interval, Cl: 1.32-2.15) - for physical inactivity - to 48.53 (95% CI: 31.98-76.65) - for attempted suicide. Modelling indicated that prevention of adverse childhood experiences would substantially reduce the occurrence of many health-harming behaviours within the study population.
   Conclusion Our results indicate that individuals who do not develop health-harming behaviours are more likely to have experienced safe, nurturing childhoods. Evidence-based programmes to improve parenting and support child development need large-scale deployment in eastern European.

AB Aim To assess and compare general practitioners' (GPs') views of diagnosing and treating depression in five southeastern European countries. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Albania, Bulgaria, Moldova, Romania, and Serbia. The sample included 467 GPs who completed a hard-copy self-administered questionnaire, consisting of self-assessment questions related to diagnosing and treating depression. Results The most common barriers to managing depression in general practice reported by GPs were: patients' unwillingness to discuss depressive symptoms (92.3%); appointment time too short to take an adequate history (91.9%), barriers for prescribing appropriate treatment (90.6%); and patients' reluctance to be referred to a psychiatrist (89.1%). Most GPs (78.4%) agreed that recognizing depression was their responsibility, 71.7% were confident in diagnosing depression, but less than one-third (29.6%) considered that they should treat it. Conclusions Improvements to the organization of mental healthcare in all five countries should consider better training for GPs in depression diagnosis and treatment; the availability of mental healthcare specialists at primary care level, with ensured equal and easy access for all patients; and the removal of potential legal barriers for diagnosis and treatment of depression.

AB Background: Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a sudden unexpected event, from a cardiac cause, that occurs in less than 1 hour after the symptom onset in a person without any previous condition that would seem fatal or who was seen without any symptoms 24 hours before being found dead.
   Objective: The aims of the study were to describe the features of SCD in Brasov County, Romania (400,000 inhabitants) according to local forensic department autopsy files.
   Methods: We retrospectively chart reviewed a number of 7200 autopsy reports between 2001 and 2015 to identify cases of SCD. Data included cause of death, demographics, location of the event, prior known illnesses, as well as psychiatric comorbidities.
   Results: Of 7200 autopsies effectuated during the 15-year period, we excluded 276 cases with incomplete data. The rest of the 6924 cases included 3000 autopsies (43.3%) of individuals with a violent death: accidents, suicides, and homicides. In 3924 cases (56.7%), the death was nonviolent. Of 3924 nonviolent deaths, based on the registry of Forensic department, we identified 1085 cases of SCD (749 males [69%]; mean age, 56 +/- 17.4 years).
   Conclusion: Sudden death with a cardiac etiology remained a major cause of unexpected end of life in the vast majority of cases autopsied during the study period.

DE anomy; deviant behavior; rule; psychological reactance; liberty
AB The question of liberty, anomy and their causal relationships to various manifestations of deviant behaviour are widely debated upon in the literature in the field. Webster Dictionary (1913) defines anomy as non-abidance by laws and social disorder. E. Durkheim (1893) has first introduced this term in his treaty on suicide, where it was defined as an infringement of the social standards, which govern behaviour. Further, Merton R. borrowed the term, asserting that anomy manifests more acutely in the case of those who do not have acceptable means to reach their goals. Starting from these aspects, the paper analyses the question of school anomy, contrasted to the students' perception of liberty of manifestation, under all of its aspects.
   The main aim of this study is to determine the differences in the perception of school rules and order. We are also interested in identifying the main factors, which trigger the students' attitude towards the rules imposed in the school environment as well as the possible correlations of this attitude with the variables age and place of origin. The lot of subjects is made up of at least 200 students at various faculties of "Dunarea de Jos" University of Galati, Romania. Our research has started from the assumption that students' attitude towards order and the rules imposed by the school system is correlated with the variables age and place of origin.

AB Introduction: The aim of this study is to measure the prevalence of suicidal ideation and thoughts of death in elementary school children in a European survey and to determine the associated socio-demographic and clinical factors.
   Methods: Data refer to children aged 6-12 (N=7062) from Italy, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Germany, and the Netherlands randomly selected in primary schools. Suicidal thoughts and death ideation were measured using a computerized pictorial diagnostic tool from the Dominic Interactive (DI) completed by the children. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was administrated to teachers and parents along with a socio-demographic questionnaire.
   Results: Suicidal ideation was present in 16.96% of the sample (from 9.9 in Italy to 26.84 in Germany), death thoughts by 21.93% (from 7.71% in Italy to 32.78 in Germany). Sl and DT were more frequent in single-parent families and large families. Externalizing disorders were strongly correlated with Sl and DT after controlling for other factors and this was true for internalizing disorders only when reported by the children.
   Conclusion: Recognizing suicidal ideation in young children may be recommended as part of preventive strategies such as screening in the context of the presence of any mental health problems whether externalizing or internalizing. (C) 2015 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

ID SUICIDAL-BEHAVIOR; JAIL; PREVENTION; DISORDERS
AB Suicide and suicidal equivalents are a public health problem faced by all the states of the world, and Romania is no exception in this respect. The prison environment represents a supplemental risk factor in the frequency rise of this phenomenon among inmates, by comparison with the general population (Marzano, Ciclitira & Adler 2012; Nordentoft, 2007; Bolos, Ciubara & Chirita, 2012). Life in captivity, often with companions of deviant behaviour, associated to disciplinary measures found hard to bear by most people, determines the occurrence of certain particularities of autolytic acts inside prisons (Kerkhof & Bernasco, 1990; Lester 1998). Thus, on the one hand we are facing a rate increase of these acts, by comparison with the general population, while on the other hand, as a consequence of restricted access to various injury-inflicting means, the methods used by inmates can vary greatly (Green et al., 1992). The present paper aims at defining the socio-demographic characters of the inmates who resorted to chemical means (drug intoxication or the consumption of other toxic substances) classified as substance abuse in order to carry out the autolytic act, by contrast with the inmates who chose to act by physical means (plagues at various levels and/or ingestion of alien bodies). An enduring collaboration between the Prison and the C.I.R.T.I.T.A. Medical Association exists; it has materialised with the signing of a written protocol between the two entities, primarily preoccupied, at present, with the attitude towards the suicidal patient.

ID CONSUMER-BEHAVIOR; AGGRESSION; WORKPLACE; EMPLOYEES
AB The beginning of the 21st Century is characterized by significant acceleration of various types of changes in the world, especially in Central and Easter European markets (Mruk 2007, p. 9). These changes generate important influence on customer/patient of medical market and may have both positive and negative effect on their behavior, which has been well demonstrated in the recent global economic crisis. It is worth noting that the current crisis is of a system character and spreads as a result of correlations which are typical of the globalization process (Kolodko 2009, p. 2). Difficulties caused by the crisis across the whole economy, mounted by constant transformation processes, often result in various social problems including alcoholism, drug addiction, crime, divorce, suicide mental and civilization diseases, social care and education failure, abuse in the family, etc. Hence, it can be stated that the rate of changes in the developing economies is bigger than consumers' awareness of the ongoing changes and their ability to grasp the processes. The emerging disintegrative processes are reflected in the consumer market behavior and leads to a phenomenon of consumers' negative adaptation to this reality. Systematically, consumers tend to take a more liberal approach towards phenomena that only recently were considered negative or even pathological. In these circumstances, customer behavior pathologyrelated issues on the medical market present one of the most interesting, both theoretically and practically, economic subjects. That is why the purpose of the paper was to identify pathologies in patients' behavior on medical market. Very important purpose of the paper was to characterize determinant which diversification pathological behavior of patients on medical market. To reach the above-presented purposes, a survey was conducted with the use of a structured questionnaire in Poland, Romania and Ukraine.

DT Article
DE Religion; Birth; Marriage; Lent; Ramadan
ID SEASONALITY; FREQUENCY; TIME
AB What is the influence of religion on the actual behavior of people? The present paper introduces a methodology which permits a quantitative assessment. [1] have elsewhere analyzed the impact of Lent (prior to Easter) and Advent (prior to Christmas) on births in Romania. Here we broaden the analysis (i) by studying the effect of Lent on marriages as well as births (ii) by analyzing a number of other countries which allows a comparison with non-Orthodox countries. We also introduce a new methodology (that we call the "overlap probe") which treats the data in a way that avoids any bias related to seasonal patterns.
   The comparison between the effects on marriages and conceptions appears of particular interest for it permits to assess the respective weights of social pressure on one hand and personal behavior on the other hand. Our analysis reveals a strong effect of Lent on marriages with a reduction by 80% in Eastern Orthodox countries and 40% in West European Catholic and Protestant countries. Since the influence of Lent on conceptions is independent of any form of direct social control one expects this effect to be much smaller. This is born out by our results which show that the birth effect is about 10 times smaller than the marriage effect.
   The overlap methodology is so accurate that it allows us to determine the average length of pregnancy (from intercourse to birth) with a precision of 2 or 3 days.
   This methodology is also used to investigate the impact of the month of Ramadan on birth and suicide rates. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hepatitis C is a great burden to the health systems in all the countries. It accounts for over 170 million infected people worldwide. Only in 2015 there were approximately 700.000 people worldwide that died due to C hepatitis. In some other countries in Africa or Asia hepatitis C accounts for approximately 10% of the population.
   Hepatitis C is accompanied in most cases by neuropsychological diseases, mainly depression. Depression can be seen in HCV patients before and during the IFN treatment. It can also be developed by the treatment itself. Patients should be screen for depression pre-treatment and during treatment. Support from family and relatives are also important as it helps the patients to better cope with the disease and increase their successful treatment chances. Treatment abandon is also greatly reduced when patients are assisted by a therapist during the treatment and have full support of family and relatives. There is a large spectrum of causes for depression and these causes are influenced by gender, social stigma, education, local culture, etc.
   On rare occasions depression can lead to suicidal ideation and attempts. Suicide attempts per se do not represent a high percentage in hepatitis C infected patients.
   Mortality due to hepatitis C virus is about 4% per year, with death from hepatocellular carcinoma accounting for almost half of the total deaths number. In co-morbidity cases the HCV virus together with HIV mainly hepatitis is responsible for 11% of total deaths. This is considered a high number and establishes hepatitis C as an important priority.

AB In many European countries, the last decade has been marked by an increasing debate about the acceptability and regulation'of euthanasia and other end-of-life decisions in medical practice. Growing public sensibility to a 'right to die' for terminally ill patients has been one of the main constituents of these debates. Within this context. we sought to describe and compare acceptance of euthanasia among the general public in 33 European countries. We used the European Values Study data of 1999-2000 with a total of 41 125 respondents (63% response rate) in 33 European countries. The main outcome measure concerned the acceptance of euthanasia (defined as 'terminating the life of the incurably sick', rated on a scale from I to 10).
   Results showed that the acceptance of euthanasia tended to be high in some Countries (e.g. the Netherlands, Denmark, France, Sweden), while a markedly low acceptance was found in others (e.g. Romania. Malta and Turkey). A multivariate ordinal regression showed that weaker religious belief was the most important factor associated with a higher acceptance: however, there were also socio-demographic differences: younger cohorts. people from non-manual social classes, and people with a higher educational level tended to have a higher acceptance of euthanasia. While religious belief. sociodemographic factors, and also moral values (i.e. the belief in the right to self-determination) could largely explain the differences between countries, our findings suggest that perceptions regarding euthanasia are probably also influenced by national traditions and history (e.g. Germany). Thus, we demonstrated clear cross-national differences with regard to the acceptance of euthanasia, which can serve as an important basis for further debate and research in the specific countries.

AB Background: Mental health problems and risk behaviours among young people are of great public health concern. Consequently, within the VII Framework Programme, the European Commission funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted in eleven European countries, with Sweden as the coordinating centre, and was designed to identify an effective way to promote mental health and reduce suicidality and risk taking behaviours among adolescents.
   Objective: To describe the methodological and field procedures in the SEYLE RCT among adolescents, as well as to present the main characteristics of the recruited sample.
   Methods: Analyses were conducted to determine: 1) representativeness of study sites compared to respective national data; 2) response rate of schools and pupils, drop-out rates from baseline to 3 and 12 month follow-up, 3) comparability of samples among the four Intervention Arms; 4) properties of the standard scales employed: Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-II), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (Z-SAS), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), World Health Organization Well-Being Scale (WHO-5).
   Results: Participants at baseline comprised 12,395 adolescents (M/F: 5,529/6,799; mean age=14.9 +/- 0.9) from Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain. At the 3 and 12 months follow up, participation rates were 87.3% and 79.4%, respectively. Demographic characteristics of participating sites were found to be reasonably representative of their respective national population. Overall response rate of schools was 67.8%. All scales utilised in the study had good to very good internal reliability, as measured by Cronbach's alpha (BDI-II: 0.864; Z-SAS: 0.805; SDQ: 0.740; WHO-5: 0.799).
   Conclusions: SEYLE achieved its objective of recruiting a large representative sample of adolescents within participating European countries. Analysis of SEYLE data will shed light on the effectiveness of important interventions aimed at improving adolescent mental health and well-being, reducing risk-taking and self-destructive behaviour and preventing suicidality.

TI EUTHANASIA: AN "X-RAY" FROM WITHIN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION - COMPARATIVE
   SURVEY AMONG MEDICAL STUDENTS AND PHYSICIANS
SO REVISTA ROMANA DE BIOETICA
LA English

DE euthanasia; students; physicians
ID ASSISTED SUICIDE
AB In 1991, a debate of the European Parliament on euthanasia sparked controversy across Europe. Discussions continue this very day and will continue in the future as well: however in East European countries there are not consistent and open debates. The author presents most major accepted definitions and concepts; some of the most important cases in the last 15 years are remembered. A survey was carried out in hospitals and University of Medicine from Bucharest: 24 physicians agreed all to answer freely to all questions in the survey including 6 surgeons, 8 anesthesiologists (intensive care specialists) and 8 internal medicine specialists. A number of 353 medical students were questioned also, but despite the initial intention expressed freely to participate at the survey. Two questionnaires very similar but taking into consideration the medical background were applied for both students and physicians. Different attitudes may be drawn out from the study but mainly most physicians and approximately one half of the responding students said they agreed with euthanasia and its legalization. What seems interesting and, at the same time, unexpected is that not everyone who said they agreed with euthanasia would admit to practice it. The role of close relatives in influencing the physician's decision is consistent with the time spent by the former within the hospital and in making decisions regarding the patient's health. The author underlines that there is a need for more open balanced and unbiased debates in East European countries and in Romania. The results of the survey even not enough extended demonstrates however that physicians prove a radicalism and a simplicity of philosophy which may be the result of the debate lack. The reluctance of the students to answer to the questions does not in our opinion victimizing them but support the idea that the future young specialists are keener to reconsider their first options and to consider more wisely their options then one might expected. The author believe also that the society, after building up, through a fine feedback along thousands of years, a professional and ethical medical corps is now forcing the legitimization of some duty gaps or of a reordering the professional code of conduct by requiring an ethical step back. After requiring intolerance and radicalism in order to shape physicians' consciences, now the democratic society calls for tolerance, relativism and mercy.
