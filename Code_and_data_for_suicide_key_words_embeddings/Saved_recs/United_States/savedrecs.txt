AB Suicide is a serious public health concern that is responsible for almost 1 million deaths each year worldwide. It is commonly an impulsive act by a vulnerable individual. The impulsivity of suicide provides opportunities to reduce the risk of suicide by restricting access to lethal means.
   In the United States, firearms, particularly handguns, are the most common means of suicide. Despite strong empirical evidence that restriction of access to firearms reduces suicides, access to firearms in the United States is generally subject to few restrictions.
   Implementation and evaluation of measures such as waiting periods and permit requirements that restrict access to handguns should be a top priority for reducing deaths from impulsive suicide in the United States. (Am J Public Health. 2013;103:27-31. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2012.300964)

AB BACKGROUND: Suicide is one of the most important public health issues in both Japan and the United States. This study is to clarify the differences in methods of suicide between the two countries, among various races within the United States, and between genders and age-groups.
   METHODS: Vital statistics mortality data and the estimated population in 1999 in Japan and in the United States were used. Age-adjusted mortality rates were calculated using the age-specific total population of Japan and the United States as a standard population. In addition, the proportionate distribution of suicide methods was calculated.
   RESULTS: Age-adjusted mortality rates from suicide in Japan were about 2 times higher for males and 3 times higher for females compared with the United States. The most common method among both genders in Japan was hanging, followed by jumping from a high place. In the United States, it was firearms among both genders, followed by hanging among males and drugs among females. For Asians in the United States, hanging was the method of choice for about half among both genders; hanging was the most common method for the age group of 40 years or more among males and for all age groups among females. Firearms were the method of choice for the 20-39 age group among males.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the overall suicide rates among Asians in the United States were lower than Japan, the methods were similar to those in Japan.

AB Objectives. To identify and compare state policies for suicide prevention training among health care professionals across the United States and benchmark state plan updates against national recommendations set by the surgeon general and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention in 2012.
   Methods. We searched state legislation databases to identify policies, which we described and characterized by date of adoption, target audience, and duration and frequency of the training. We used descriptive statistics to summarize state-by-state variation in suicide education policies.
   Results. In the United States, as of October 9, 2017, 10 (20%) states had passed legislation mandating health care professionals complete suicide prevention training, and 7 (14%) had policies encouraging training. The content and scope of policies varied substantially. Most states (n = 43) had a state suicide prevention plan that had been revised since 2012, but 7 lacked an updated plan.
   Conclusions. Considerable variation in suicide prevention training For health care professionals exists across the United States. There is a need for consistent polices in suicide prevention training across the nation to better equip health care providers to address the needs of patients who may be at risk for suicide.

DE Attitudes; Suicide; Suicide prevention; South Korea; United States
AB Background: South Korea (hereafter, Korea) has witnessed a rapid increase in its suicide rate over the past few decades and currently reports the highest rate among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Conversely, the United States has maintained its suicide rate near the OECD average. The present study examines and compares attitudes toward suicide among college students in either country to explain the higher prevalence of suicide in Korea.
   Findings: Non-Korean students in the United States, Korean students in the United States, and Korean students in Korea completed a web-based questionnaire on Attitudes Toward Suicide (ATTS). A series of two-way 3 x 2 between subjects Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests of the participants' group and gender, as well as post-hoc comparisons, were conducted to examine differences across various attitude domains. As expected, the results revealed group differences in the majority of attitude areas. Most notably, students in Korea reported more permissive attitudes toward suicide and were less likely to believe in the right to prevent others' suicide. Gender did not have an effect on any attitudes except on the right to prevent suicide and there were no interactions between group and gender.
   Conclusions: The results suggest the importance of addressing public attitudes toward suicide in future suicide prevention efforts in Korea.

AB Purpose This study aims to describe and characterize the spatial and temporal clustering patterns of suicide in the ten states with the greatest suicide burden in the United States from 1999 to 2016. Methods All suicide deaths from January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2016 in the United States were identified using data from the Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) dataset. The ten states with the highest age-adjusted suicide rates were Montana, Alaska, Wyoming, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Arizona, and Oklahoma. A spatiotemporal scan statistic using a discrete Poisson model was employed to retrospectively detect spatiotemporal suicide clusters. Results From 1999 to 2016, a total of 649,843 suicides were recorded in the United States. Nineteen statistically significant spatiotemporal suicide mortality clusters were identified in the states with the greatest suicide rates, and 13.53% of the suicide cases within these states clustered spatiotemporally. The risk ratio of the clusters ranged from 1.45 to 3.64 (p < 0.001). All states had at least one cluster, with three clusters spanning multiple states, and four clusters were found in Arizona. While there was no clear secular trend in the average size of suicide clusters, the number of clusters increased from 1999 to 2016. Conclusions Hot spots for suicidal behavior in the United States warrant public health intervention and continued surveillance. As suicide rates in the US continue to increase annually, public health efforts could be maximized by focusing on regions with substantial clustering.

AB Background. In the United States, more people kill themselves with firearms than with all other methods combined. A central question regarding the relation between firearms and suicide is whether the ready availability of firearms increases the suicide rate, rather than merely increasing the proportion of suicides from guns.
   Methods. We used publicly available data for the nine regions and 50 states in the United States over a 10-year period (1988-1997) to examine the association between levels of household firearm ownership and rates of suicide, firearm suicide, and non-firearm suicide by age groups and gender.
   Results. In both regional and state-level analyses, for the U.S. population as a whole, for both males and females, and for virtually every age group, a robust association exists between levels of household firearm ownership and suicide rates.
   Conclusions. Where firearm ownership levels are higher, a disproportionately large number of people die from suicide.

AB While it has long been recognised that periods of economic uncertainty, characterised by increased unemployment and lower economic activity, are associated with increased suicide rates, no study has examined the impact of policy-related economic uncertainty on suicide mortality. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between economic policy uncertainty and suicide mortality in the United States over the period 1950-2013 , while controlling for several other socioeconomic determinants of suicide mortality, as well as age- and gender-variations. The results of the analysis reveal that increased economic policy uncertainty is associated with increased suicide mortality of the youngest and the oldest segments of the male population in the United States, while the female population across all ages is found to be resilient to changes in economic policy uncertainty.

AB Sex differences in suicide rates and suicide methods was compared among adolescents in South Korea, Japan, Finland, and the United States. This study analyzed suicide rates and suicide methods of adolescents aged 15-19 years in four countries, using the World Health Organization mortality database. Among both male and female adolescents, the most common method of suicide was jumping from heights in South Korea and hanging in Japan. In Finland, jumping in front of moving objects and firearms were frequently used by males, but not by females. In the United States, males were more likely to use firearms, and females were more likely to use poison. The male to female ratio of suicide rates was higher in the United States (3.8) and Finland (3.6) than in Korea (1.3) and Japan (1.9). Sex differences in suicide methods may contribute to differences in the suicide rates among males and female adolescents in different countries.

AB Aircraft assisted suicides were studied in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and Finland during 1956-2012 by means of literature search and accident case analysis. According to our study the frequency varied slightly between the studies. Overall, the new estimate of aircraft assisted suicides in the United States in a 20-yr period (1993-2012) is 0.33% (95% Cl 0.21-0.49) (24/7244). In the detailed accident case analysis, it was found that in five out of the eight cases from the United States, someone knew of prior suicidal ideation before the aircraft assisted fatality. The caveats of standard medico-legal autopsy and accident investigation methods in investigation of suspected aircraft assisted suicides are discussed. It is suggested that a psychological autopsy should be performed in all such cases. Also the social context and possibilities of the prevention of aviation-related suicides were analyzed. In addition, some recent aircraft assisted suicides carried out using commercial aircraft during scheduled services and causing many casualties are discussed.

The current study examined male prison suicide rates and suicide rates for men in the total population in the United States and found that variables based on Durkheim's theory of suicide explained prison suicide rates better than suicide rates for total population. Possible reasons for these findings are discussed.

AB Objective. This study sought to investigate suicide notes drawn from Mexico and the United States (US) as these countries share geographical proximity, but markedly different cultures and suicide rates. Material and Methods. A theoretical conceptual analysis of 102 suicide notes drawn from these countries, matched for age and sex, was undertaken based on a thematic model of suicide developed by Leenaars,(1,2) across countries. Results. The inter-judge reliability was adequate (.86 coefficient of concordance). Conclusions. The results suggested that there are more psychological commonalities than differences. Yet, as this study marks the first one using suicide notes, between Mexico and the USA, much greater study is warranted.

AB This study examines the association between antidepressant use and suicide rates, by sex, age, and method of suicide, between 1998 and 2007 in the United States. Overall suicide rates for the young and elderly declined but rates for the middle-aged increased. All age groups experienced increases in antidepressant use. The elderly exhibited the largest increase in antidepressant usage and biggest declines in suicide rates. Firearm suicides for men and women declined but suicide by drug poisoning rose, particularly for women. For young males and elderly males and females, better treatment of severe depression may have contributed to declining suicide rates. However, rising rates of prescription drug use are associated with higher levels of suicide by drug poisoning.

AB We measure the association between rates of suicide and fertility in the United States using a panel of states from 1981 to 2005. We find a positive relationship between suicide and fertility rates, in contrast to previous empirical work from other countries that has reported a strong negative relationship between fertility and suicide. This suggests that differences in the health-care system and social safety net between the United States and Europe may influence the relationship between childbirth and suicide.

Comparisons were made between 184 homicide-suicides and 400 randomly selected victims of all other types of homicide. The findings indicate that homicide-suicides occurred predominantly in the family unit, especially involving female spouses, and among White victims and offenders. Handguns and other firearms were the weapon of choice in homicide-suicides.

AB In this study, we compared United States military decedents who died by suicide on their first attempt with decedents who had made multiple attempts. Death investigation files for 217 United States Air Force (USAF) personnel who died by suicide between 1996 and 2006 were coded for demographic, psychosocial, and psychiatric characteristics. Among USAF suicide decedents, 77% died by suicide on their first attempt and 23% had a documented history of at least one prior attempt. Decedents with a history of prior attempts were more likely to have an interpersonal stressor within 3 months of death and were twice as likely to have a documented Axis I diagnosis. There were few differences between military suicide decedents based on history of prior attempts. Further research is needed to inform military suicide prevention endeavors.

AB The rates and patterns of suicide in the United States and Australia are similar. There are, however, few empirical studies comparing these two countries; indeed, there is a paucity of cross-cultural study in suicidology in general. Suicide notes from both countries were compared, based on Leenaars' multidimensional model of suicide. No major differences were noted as is in keeping with similar studies of suicide notes around the world. It was concluded that the model may be applicable to suicides in both countries; further study is warranted.

AB We examined the relationship between educational attainment and suicide rate in the United States for 2001. Suicide rates, adjusted for age, were compared with percentage of college graduates, median household income, and poverty in 50 states in 2001. The correlations of suicide rates with educational attainment and median household income were both negative and statistically significant. Poverty was not significantly related to suicide rates. We concluded that higher education and income were associated with a decrease in suicide rates in 2001. Data from other years require examination for this conclusion to be generalizable.

AB Preventing suicide has been identified as a national priority by recent commissions in the United States. Despite increased awareness of suicide as a public health problem, suicide in older adults remains a neglected topic in prevention strategies and research. This is especially true regarding elderly White men, who in terms of suicide rates have represented the most at-risk age group for the past half century. In light Of the unprecedented aging of the United States as the baby boom generation enters late adulthood, suicide prevention initiatives that focus on aging males are needed to prevent a national crisis in geriatric mental health. This article provides a brief review of the perennially under-recognized reality of suicide in older men and prevention strategies that, if implemented, might help stern this rising tide of suicide in this vulnerable population.

AB Context. In the United States, more than 45,000 women died from gun violence over the last decade.
   Objective. To determine whether measures of firearm availability are related to rates of suicide, homicide, and unintentional firearm deaths among women in the United States.
   Design. Pooled cross-sectional time series data on suicide, homicide, and unintentional firearm deaths (1988-1997) were used to estimate the association between the rate of violent death among women and four proxies of firearm availability. Two proxies came from survey reports of household firearm ownership rates; two were derived from mortality statistics.
   Setting. United States, 1988-1997.
   Results. The increased rate of suicide and homicide in states with high gun levels was accounted for primarily by significantly elevated firearm suicide and firearm homicide rates. Unintentional firearm death rates were also increased in states with more guns. At the regional level, qualitatively similar results were obtained.
   Conclusion. Between 1988 and 1997, the suicide, homicide, and unintentional firearm death rates among women were disproportionately higher in states where guns were more prevalent. The elevated rates of violent death in states with more guns was not entirely explained by a state's poverty or urbanization and was driven primarily by lethal firearm violence, not by lethal nonfirearm violence.

AB We are all sadly familiar with the suicide bombings that have been occurring overseas-and even closer to home, with the series of suicide attacks that occurred within the United States. These have so far been limited to perpetration by Muslim extremists who for the most part planned and executed their own attacks. This pattern has led to the creation of a "profile" for what we would expect a suicide attacker to be. However, as this mode of attack migrates toward the United States, this "profile," or signature, may alter. This paper discusses how some of these alterations may occur based on changes in modus operandi, and how they would manifest themselves in detectable forms within the United States.

AB Death by suicide has increased in the United States. Experts have identified risk factors that may identify those at risk. It is understood that depression is one of the major risk factor. The families and community are the secondary victims when a suicide attempt or completion is made, and they are at risk for complicated grief. Recently, our team was consulted for the case of a young woman with a catastrophic suicide attempt.

AB Objective: About 21,000 suicides in the United States in 2014 involved a firearm. The authors reviewed evidence from around the world regarding the relationship between firearm ownership rates and firearm suicide rates and the potential effectiveness of policy-based strategies for preventing fire-arm suicides in the United States.
   Method: Relevant publications were identified by searches of PubMed, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar from 1980 to September 2015, using the search terms suicide AND firearms OR guns. Excluding duplicates, 1,687 results were found, 60 of which were selected for inclusion; these sources yielded an additional 10 studies, for a total of 70 studies.
   Results: Case-control and ecological studies investigating geographic and temporal variations in firearm ownership and firearm suicide rates indicate that greater firearm availability is associated with higher firearm suicide rates. Time-series analyses, mostly from other countries, show that legislation reducing firearm ownership towers firearm suicide rates. Because the Second Amendment curtails legislation broadly restricting firearm access in the United States, the emphasis is shifted to restricting access for those at risk of harming themselves or others. Most suicides involve guns purchased years earlier. Targeted initiatives like gun violence restraining orders, smart gun technology, and gun safety education campaigns potentially reduce access to already purchased firearms by suicidal individuals. Such measures are too new to have evidence of effectiveness.
   Conclusions: Broadly reducing availability and access to firearms has lowered firearm suicide rates in other countries but does not appear feasible in the United States. Approaches restricting access of at-risk individuals to already purchased firearms by engaging the public and major stakeholders require urgent implementation and outcome evaluation for firearm suicide prevention.

From 1968 to 1975, there were 2215 homicide-suicide events out of 123,467 homicides. The mean rate of homicide-suicide events was 0.134 per 100,000 per year. The murderers in these events differ from the typicalmurderer and the typical suicide in socio-demographic characteristics. Details of the characteristics of this population may be valuable for understanding the circumstances of homicide-suicide events and planning preventive measures. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB On an average day in the United States, more than 100 Americans die by suicide; half of these suicides involve the use of firearms. In this ecological study, we used linear regression techniques and recently available state-level measures of suicide attempt rates to assess whether, and if so, to what extent, the well-established relationship between household firearm ownership rates and suicide mortality persists after accounting for rates of underlying suicidal behavior. After controlling for state-level suicide attempt rates (2008-2009), higher rates of firearm ownership (assessed in 2004) were strongly associated with higher rates of overall suicide and firearm suicide, but not with nonfirearm suicide (2008-2009). Furthermore, suicide attempt rateswere not significantly related to gun ownership levels. These findings suggest that firearm ownership rates, independent of underlying rates of suicidal behavior, largely determine variations in suicide mortality across the 50 states. Our results support the hypothesis that firearms in the home impose suicide risk above and beyond the baseline risk and help explain why, year after year, several thousand more Americans die by suicide in states with higher than average household firearm ownership compared with states with lower than average firearm ownership.

AB The authors asserted the need for increased postvention efforts for suicide survivors, individuals left behind to grieve the loss of a loved one by suicide, because they have an increased risk for suicide. Indeed, Shneidman (1972) asserted that suicide postvention efforts serve the dual purpose of assisting survivors through the grief process and preventing suicide for future generations. First, the authors briefly discussed the increased risk for suicide among survivors. Second, the authors overviewed the potential benefits of postvention programs and current strategies for suicide postvention in the United States. Finally, they recommended plans for suicide postvention program development such as states should include efforts to create or expand traditional postvention services as well as active survivor outreach to link survivors to these services.

AB Low atmospheric pressure may increase depression and suicide through inducing hypoxia. Previous studies have not evaluated the geographic variation of this relationship across the United States. Analyses were based on three groupings of age-adjusted completed suicide rates (all suicide, firearm-related suicide, non-firearm-related suicide) from 2286 counties in the United States. Multiple regression was used to determine the overall relationship between atmospheric pressure and completed suicide rates. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) models were used to obtain local coefficient estimates. A negative correlation between atmospheric pressure and completed suicide rates was observed for all three suicide groupings (p-value<0.0001). Significant, negative GWR coefficient estimates were located in the West and Northeast for the all suicides and firearm-related suicides, and in the Midwest for non-firearm-related suicides.

DE Asian Americans; suicide; acculturation; ethnicity
ID COLLEGE-STUDENTS; BEHAVIORS; ACCULTURATION; PREVALENCE; LATINO; RISK
AB Although the past decade has witnessed a growth in research on Asian Americans' suicide-related outcomes, previous studies have tended not to address within-group ethnic variability among Asian Americans. Therefore, this study examined ethnic differences in suicide ideation in a nationally representative sample of Asian Americans that included the six largest Asian American ethnic groups-Chinese, Filipino, Indian, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese Americans. Participants were 1,332 Asian American adults who participated in the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions. The authors found that participants who had lived a longer proportion of their lives in the United States had increased odds of lifetime suicide ideation. There were significant ethnic differences in suicide ideation rates, with Korean Americans and Indian Americans reporting the highest and lowest ideation rates, respectively. Ethnicity was also a significant moderator of the relationship between proportion of life in the United Sates and suicide ideation. The potential adverse impact of proportion of life in the United States on suicide ideation was weaker among Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese Americans, relative to non-Chinese, non-Japanese, non-Korean, and non-Vietnamese Asian Americans, respectively. In contrast, the association between proportion of life in the United States and suicide ideation was stronger among Indian Americans than among non-Indian Americans. These findings underscore the importance of disaggregating data on Asian American suicide-related outcomes.

AB Suicide is a critical public health problem, resulting in more than 40,000 deaths a year in the United States (U.S.) and 800,000 globally. Provision of mental health services is a key component of a comprehensive population-based approach to prevention. State licensing boards in some U.S. states require mental health practitioners to be trained in suicide risk assessment and management, but such requirements are not uniform. Our case study examined mental health practitioner preparedness to engage in suicide prevention and intervention in Colorado, a state with a high suicide rate, using a survey designed to understand training experiences and perceptions of the acceptability of mandated training. Our findings support efforts to require mental health practitioners be trained to prevent suicide.

AB Partly replicating findings from several cross-national studies (of Lester and of Voracek) on possible aggregate-level associations between personality and suicide prevalence, state-level analysis within the United States yielded significantly negative associations between the Big Five factor of Neuroticism and suicide rates. This effect was observed for historical as well as contemporary suicide rates of the total or the elderly population and was preserved with controls for the four other Big Five factors and measures of state wealth. Also conforming to cross-national findings, the Big Five factors of Agreeableness and Extraversion were negatively, albeit not reliably, associated with suicide rates.

AB Objectives. We examined how US cultural involvement related to suicide attempts among youths in the Dominican Republic.
   Methods. We analyzed data from a nationally representative sample of youths attending high school in the Dominican Republic (n=8446). The outcome of interest was a suicide attempt during the past year. The US cultural involvement indicators included time spent living in the United States, number of friends who had lived in the United States, English proficiency, and use of US electronic media and language.
   Results. Time lived in the United States, US electronic media and language, and number of friends who had lived in the United States had robust positive relationships with suicide attempts among youths residing in the Dominican Republic.
   Conclusions. Our results are consistent with previous research that found increased risk for suicide or suicide attempts among Latino youths with greater US cultural involvement. Our study adds to this research by finding similar results in a nonimmigrant Latin American sample. Our results also indicate that suicide attempts are a major public health problem among youths in the Dominican Republic. (Am J Public Health. 2012;102:664-671. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2011.300344)

   BEHAVIOR; ABUSE; LAWS
AB Suicide is the third leading cause of death for adolescents and young people in the United States. The etiology of suicide in this population has eluded policy makers, researchers, and communities. Although many suicide prevention programs have been developed and implemented, few are evidence-based in their effectiveness in decreasing suicide rates. In one northern California community, adolescent suicide has risen above the state's average. Two nurses led an effort to develop and implement an innovative grassroots community suicide prevention project targeted at eliminating any further teen suicide. The project consisted of a Teen Resource Card, a community resource brochure targeted at teens, and education for the public and school officials to raise awareness about this issue. This article describes this project for other communities to use as a model. Risk and protective factors are described, and a comprehensive background of adolescent suicide is provided.

TI Incidence and Method of Suicide in Hospitals in the United States
SO JOINT COMMISSION JOURNAL ON QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY
LA English
DT Article
ID DEATH REPORTING SYSTEM; INPATIENT SUICIDE
AB Background: There are no reliable estimates of hospital inpatient suicides in the United States. Understanding the rate and the methods used in suicides is important to guide prevention efforts. This study analyzed two national data sets to establish an evidence-based estimate of hospital inpatient suicides and the methods used.
   Methods: The study is designed as a cross-sectional analysis of data from 27 states reporting to the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) for 2014-2015, and from hospitals reporting to The Joint Commission's Sentinel Event (SE) Database from 2010 to 2017. Categorical variables and qualitative reviews of event narratives were used to identify and code suicide events occurring during hospital inpatient treatment.
   Results: Based on the hospital inpatient suicides reported in the NVDRS during 2014-2015, 73.9% of which occurred during psychiatric treatment, it is estimated that between 48.5 and 64.9 hospital inpatient suicides occur per year in the United States. Of these, 31.0 to 51.7 are expected to involve psychiatric inpatients. Hanging was the most common method of inpatient suicide in both the NVDRS and SE databases (71.7% and 70.3%, respectively).
   Conclusion: The estimated number of hospital inpatient suicides per year in the United States ranges from 48.5 to 64.9, which is far below the widely cited figure of 1,500 per year. Analysis of inpatient suicide methods suggests that hospital prevention efforts should be primarily focused on mitigating risks associated with hanging, and additional suicide prevention efforts may be best directed toward reducing the risk of suicide immediately following discharge.

AB BACKGROUND: Violent death is a serious problem in the United States. Previous research showing US rates of violent death compared with other high-income countries used data that are more than a decade old.
   METHODS: We examined 2010 mortality data obtained from the World Health Organization for populous, high-income countries (n = 23). Death rates per 100,000 population were calculated for each country and for the aggregation of all non-US countries overall and by age and sex. Tests of significance were performed using Poisson and negative binomial regressions.
   RESULTS: US homicide rates were 7.0 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25.2 times higher. For 15-to 24-year-olds, the gun homicide rate in the United States was 49.0 times higher. Firearm-related suicide rates were 8.0 times higher in the United States, but the overall suicide rates were average. Unintentional firearm deaths were 6.2 times higher in the United States. The overall firearm death rate in the United States from all causes was 10.0 times higher. Ninety percent of women, 91% of children aged 0 to 14 years, 92% of youth aged 15 to 24 years, and 82% of all people killed by firearms were from the United States.
   CONCLUSIONS: The United States has an enormous firearm problem compared with other high-income countries, with higher rates of homicide and firearm-related suicide. Compared with 2003 estimates, the US firearm death rate remains unchanged while firearm death rates in other countries decreased. Thus, the already high relative rates of firearm homicide, firearm suicide, and unintentional firearm death in the United States compared with other high-income countries increased between 2003 and 2010.

AB We examined the impact of a state gun law environment on suicides overall and within demographic subgroups. We linked 211,766 firearm suicides and 204,625 nonfirearm suicides in the 50 states of the United States for 2005-2015 to the population in each state, year, race/ethnicity, sex, and age, as well as to an index of state-level gun control. Difference-in-differences, zero-inflated, negative-binomial models were used to evaluate the impact of strengthening gun control on firearm and nonfirearm suicides. We subsequently stratified by sex and tested for interactions with race/ethnicity and age. We found 25 states strengthened gun control by an average of 6 points. Such an increase may result in a 3.3% (incidence rate ratio = 0.967; 95% confidence interval: 0.938, 0.996) decrease in firearm suicides. Although no impact on nonfirearm suicides was found overall, interaction models showed an increase in nonfirearm suicides among black men, white women, black women, and older individuals. Strengthening gun control may reduce firearm suicides overall but may increase nonfirearm suicides in some populations. The results indicate stricter gun laws should be advocated for and that additional policies are needed for populations who shifted to nonfirearm suicides.

AB Previous research on suicide in United States prisons focused on the characteristics of inmates who commit suicide while largely ignoring the prison context surrounding these suicides. The following analyses used national data on 1,082 state prisons in the United States to examine how prison conditions (deprivation) and inmate composition (importation) predict prison suicide. Results of a negative binomial regression model showed that the number of suicides was significantly increased in supermaximum and maximum security prisons (relative to minimum), under conditions of overcrowding and violence, and in prisons where a greater proportion of inmates received mental health services. Although deprivation variables were overwhelmingly predictive of suicide, the results pointed to the combined effects of institutional conditions and inmate composition on prison suicide.

AB This study explores differences in perpetrators of suicide attacks and non-suicide attacks in the United States. The study uses data on far-right and Al Qaeda and affiliated/inspired terrorists between 1990 and 2013 from the United States Extremist Crime Database. Our analysis estimates logistic regression models to test whether suicide attackers were more likely to have exhibited specific risk factors for suicidality, while examining other prominent claims regarding patterns of suicide terrorism. Suicide attackers were no more likely than non-suicide attackers to have previously attempted suicide or to have been diagnosed as mentally ill. Suicide attackers were more likely, though, to have a history of substance abuse, to be loners, have served in the military, participated in paramilitary training, and be more ideologically committed to the cause. We found that Al Qaeda affiliated/inspired attackers were more likely than far-right attackers to have engaged in a suicide mission. With the current focus on Americans traveling to Syria and Iraq to receive training and fight for jihadist movements (e.g., the Islamic State), our findings appear relevant. Observers have expressed concern that these fighters may return and then commit attacks in their homeland. Law enforcement could make use of this study's findings.

TI Surfing for Suicide Methods and Help: Content Analysis of Websites
   Retrieved With Search Engines in Austria and the United States
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID INTERNET; INFORMATION; PREVENTION; WEB
AB Objective: The Internet provides a variety of resources for individuals searching for suicide-related information. Structured content-analytic approaches to assess intercultural differences in web contents retrieved with method-related and help-related searches are scarce.
   Method: We used the 2 most popular search engines (Google and Yahoo/Bing) to retrieve US-American and Austrian search results for the term suicide, method-related search terms (eg, suicide methods, how to kill yourself, painless suicide, how to hang yourself), and help-related terms (eg, suicidal thoughts, suicide help) on February 11, 2013. In total, 396 websites retrieved with US search engines and 335 websites from Austrian searches were analyzed with content analysis on the basis of current media guidelines for suicide reporting. We assessed the quality of websites and compared findings across search terms and between the United States and Austria.
   Results: In both countries, protective outweighed harmful website characteristics by approximately 2:1. Websites retrieved with method-related search terms (eg, how to hang yourself) contained more harmful (United States: P < .001, Austria: P < .05) and fewer protective characteristics (United States: P < .001, Austria: P < .001) compared to the term suicide. Help-related search terms (eg, suicidal thoughts) yielded more websites with protective characteristics (United States: P = .07, Austria: P < .01). Websites retrieved with US search engines generally had more protective characteristics (P < .001) than searches with Austrian search engines. Resources with harmful characteristics were better ranked than those with protective characteristics (United States: P < .01, Austria: P < .05).
   Conclusions: The quality of suicide-related websites obtained depends on the search terms used. Preventive efforts to improve the ranking of preventive web content, particularly regarding method-related search terms, seem necessary. (C) Copyright 2014 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB Background: Violent death is a major public health problem in the United States and throughout the world.
   Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of the World Health Organization Mortality Database analyzes homicides and suicides (both disaggregated as firearm related and non-firearm related) and unintentional and undetermined firearm deaths from 23 populous high-income Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development countries that provided data to the World Health Organization for 2003.
   Results: The US homicide rates were 6.9 times higher than rates in the other high-income countries, driven by firearm homicide rates that were 19.5 times higher. For 15-year olds to 24-year olds, firearm homicide rates in the United States were 42.7 times higher than in the other countries. For US males, firearm homicide rates were 22.0 times higher, and for US females, firearm homicide rates were 11.4 times higher. The US firearm suicide rates were 5.8 times higher than in the other countries, though overall suicide rates were 30% lower. The US unintentional firearm deaths were 5.2 times higher than in the other countries. Among these 23 countries, 80% of all firearm deaths occurred in the United States, 86% of women killed by firearms were US women, and 87% of all children aged 0 to 14 killed by firearms were US children.
   Conclusions: The United States has far higher rates of firearm deaths-firearm homicides, firearm suicides, and unintentional firearm deaths compared with other high-income countries. The US overall suicide rate is not out of line with these countries, but the United States is an outlier in terms of our overall homicide rate.

AB The aim of the study is to compare the prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts in the United States in 1991-1992 and 2001-2002, and identify sociodemographic groups at increased risk for suicidal ideation and attempts. Data were drawn from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism 1991-1992 National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey (n = 42 862) and the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (n = 43 093), two nationally representative household surveys of non-institutionalized civilians aged 18 years and older, residing in the United States. The lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts remained unchanged in the United States between 1991-1992 and 2001-2002. Specific groups, namely 18- to 24-year-old white and black women, 25- to 44-year-old white women and 45- to 64-year-old Native American men were identified as being at high risk for suicide attempts. Despite prevention and treatment efforts, the lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts remains unchanged. Given the morbidity and mortality associated with suicide attempts, urgent action is needed to decrease the prevalence of suicide attempts in the United States.

AB Suicide, a manner of health ranked as the eleventh leading cause of death in the United States and accounted for approximately 30,000 deaths in 2001. A host of biological and psychosocial components interplay in a suicide investigation. Precipitating factors may include domestic quarrels. loss of employment. financial difficulties, substance abuse. chronic disease, or mental illness. The authors conducted a ten-year (1993-2002) retrospective review of suicide from all Medical Examiners' Offices in Kentucky. There were 2,864 suicides ranging between 11 and 96 years (average age 42.0 years). The majority of victims were males (81.7%) and Caucasian (94.8%). African-American females comprised the smallest group. consisting of only 0.59%. The preferred mode of death was by firearm (67.5%), followed by hanging (13.7%), overdose (9.9%). and carbon monoxide poisoning (4.4%). This comprehensive study discusses the trends of suicide in the United States during the twentieth century and underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to the investigation and prevention of suicide.

AB Purpose of reviewThis review will focus on recent research, initiatives, and legislation regarding the issue of gun violence as it pertains to adolescents.Recent findingsHomicide and suicide continue to be major killers of adolescents in the United States. Gun homicide kills teens in the most urban areas of the United States at the same rate as suicide kills teens in the most rural areas of the United States. Research on assault-injured youth sheds light on risk factors for teen gun homicide, and has found high rates of illegal gun carrying and retaliatory attitudes among at-risk teens. Suicide research continues to show a strong correlation between gun ownership and accessibility, and risk of completed suicide. Stand Your Ground laws and campus carry laws present unique threats to different populations of American teens.SummaryGiven the enormous toll that gun violence takes on adolescent lives, pediatricians should ask about guns in the home and become involved in efforts to strengthen laws that would decrease gun violence.

   TIME; LIFE
AB The increases in suicide among middle-aged baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1964) in the United States since 1999 suggest a changing epidemiology of suicide. Using data from 1935 to 2010, this paper conducts age-period-cohort analyses to determine the impact of cohorts in shaping temporal patterns of suicide in the United States. The analysis demonstrates that age, period and cohort effects are all important in determining suicide trends. Net of age and period effects, the cohort pattern of suicide rates is U-shaped, with cohorts born between 1915 and 1945 possessing among the very lowest suicide rates. Suicide rates begin to rise with boomers and subsequent cohorts exhibit increasingly higher rates of suicide. The general pattern exists for both men and women but is especially pronounced among males. The average suicide rate over the entire period for males is about 28 per 100,000, 95% CI [27.4, 28.7]. For males born in 1930-34, the suicide rate is estimated to be 17.4 per 100,000, 95% CI [15.9, 18.8]; for males born between 1955 and 1959, the rate is essentially the same as the average for the period while for males born between 1985 and 1989, the suicide rate is estimated to be 37.8 per 100,000, 95% CI [33.1, 43.4]. The results dispute popular claims that boomers exhibit an elevated suicide rate relative to other generations, but boomers do appear to have ushered in new cohort patterns of suicide rates over the life course. These patterns are interpreted within a Durkheimian framework that suggests weakened forms of social integration and regulation among postwar cohorts may be producing increased suicide rates.

AB The purpose of the study was to examine the association of temporal factors, in particular days of the week and seasons of the year and death from suicide in the United States.
   Data were pooled from the Multiple Cause of Death Files. Hierarchical logistic regression models were fitted to all deaths occurring in 2000 through 2004 by suicide.
   The incidence of suicide was significantly higher on Wednesdays, compared to Sunday. Specifically, individuals were 99% more likely to kill themselves on Wednesday than on Sunday. Suicides were more prevalent in the summer months, and they were less likely to occur in winter. The state suicide rate significantly elevated individual suicide risk. The results held even after controlling for the potentially confounding effects of socio-economic and demographic variables at both the individual and state levels.
   It was concluded that the observed association between seasonality and suicide cannot be discounted as a mere coincidence. Future research ought to focus on integrating individual level data and contextual variables when testing for seasonality effects.

TI The Impact of Student Loan Debt and Student Loan Delinquency on Total,

SO SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY
LA English

ID MENTAL-HEALTH; COLLEGE; FORECLOSURE; INCREASE; VIOLENT; CRISIS
AB In 2012, the outstanding student loan balance in the United States surpassed $1 trillion, and between 2005 and 2012, the student loan delinquency rate increased by 77 percent. Simultaneously, by the end of the 2005-2012 time period, the total suicide rate in the United States reached the highest levels in more than a decade. To investigate the recent trends in student loans and suicide, this paper examined the association between state-level student loan debt, student loan delinquency, and total, age-, and sex-specific suicide rates. The study used a hybrid (decompositional) longitudinal regression approach to examine the relationship between student loan debt, delinquency, and suicide rates during the 2005-2012 time period. The results showed student loan delinquency had a positive and significant effect on several of the suicide rates examined within states but had no effect on suicide rates between states net of controls. The results also showed student loan debt had a significant and negative association with suicide for people ages 20-24 and 25-34.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether suicide rates among ethnic immigrant groups were predicted by the ethnophaulisms, or the hate speech, used to refer to those ethnic immigrant groups. Methods: Data were obtained for 10 European ethnic immigrant groups during the 1950s. These 10 European ethnic immigrant groups accounted for approximately 40% of all immigration into the United States during this time period. Both the suicide rates for these ethnic immigrant groups in the United States and suicide rates for those ethnic immigrant groups in their countries of origin were derived. The complexity and valence of ethnophaulisms used to refer to these ethnic immigrant groups were derived from the historical record of hate speech in the United States. Results: Consistent with previous research, immigrant suicide rates were strongly correlated with origin suicide rates. As expected, the suicide rates for ethnic immigrant groups in the United States were significantly predicted by the negativity of the ethnophaulisms used to refer to those ethnic immigrant groups. This pattern was obtained even after taking into account the suicide rates for those ethnic immigrant groups in their countries of origin, and even after taking into account the size of those ethnic immigrant groups. Conclusions: This study found support for the expectation that suicide rates among ethnic immigrant groups would be predicted by the hate speech directed toward those ethnic immigrant groups.

TI A thematic comparison of suicide notes drawn from Northern Ireland and

SO CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Suicide is a global concern hence cross-cultural research ought to be central to national suicide prevention strategies. This study sought to investigate suicide notes drawn from Northern Ireland and the United States as these countries have broadly similar suicide rates but markedly different cultures. A theoretical -conceptual analysis of sixty suicide notes drawn from these countries, matched for age and sex, was undertaken based on a thematic model of suicide developed by Leenaars (1996) across countries. The results suggested that there were more psychological commonalities than differences. Two differences emerged which suggested that aspects of the interpersonal components may be more salient in Northern Irish rather than American suicides. It is argued that more wide-ranging cross-cultural studies are required to enhance our ability to identify and predict those most at risk from suicide.

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; WEATHER; MORTALITY; FLUCTUATIONS; IMPACT
AB Linkages between climate and mental health are often theorized but remain poorly quantified. In particular, it is unknown whether the rate of suicide, a leading cause of death globally, is systematically affected by climatic conditions. Using comprehensive data from multiple decades for both the United States and Mexico, we find that suicide rates rise 0.7% in US counties and 2.1% in Mexican municipalities for a 1 degrees C increase in monthly average temperature. This effect is similar in hotter versus cooler regions and has not diminished over time, indicating limited historical adaptation. Analysis of depressive language in >600 million social media updates further suggests that mental well-being deteriorates during warmer periods. We project that unmitigated climate change (RCP8.5) could result in a combined 9-40 thousand additional suicides (95% confidence interval) across the United States and Mexico by 2050, representing a change in suicide rates comparable to the estimated impact of economic recessions, suicide prevention programmes or gun restriction laws.

AB There is a marked difference between the suicide rates and trends in the U.S. versus Italy, with Italy having lower rates and a downward trend. It is hypothesized this suicide decrease may be explained in terms of an anthropological-based theory that a period of liminality and resulting communitas occurred. During research conducted in Italy, I interviewed four mental health practitioners, toured medical facil-ities, attended educational lectures and took various history related tours. I have chosen to undertake a qualitative approach with literature searches on suicide and related phenomena in both the U.S. and Italy. Combined with semi-structured interviews and first-hand observations, information on the "why" reveals disparity between the two countries. More structured studies of this nature must occur to ad-dress the epidemic of suicide in the U.S. and to validate the success of practices outside the United States.

AB Objective: To replicate a previously reported association between pollen counts and county suicide rates in the continental United States, across space and time.
   Method: The authors evaluated the relationship between airborne pollen counts and suicide rates in 42 counties of the continental United States, containing a pollen-counting station participating in the Aeroallergen Monitoring Network in the United States (N = 120 076 suicides), considering years' quarter, age group, sex, race, rural / urban location, number of local psychiatrists, and median household income, from 1999 to 2002. The county-level effects were broken into betweencounty and within-county.
   Results: No within-county effects were found. Between-county effects for grass and ragweed pollen on suicide rates lost statistical significance after adjustment for median income, number of psychiatrists, and urban vs. rural location.
   Conclusion: Future research is necessary to reappraise the previously reported relationship between pollen levels and suicide rates that may have been driven by socioeconomic confounders.

AB This study compares suicide and non-suicide incidents in the United States by analyzing data from the U.S. Extremist Crime Database (ECDB) on terrorist incidents committed by extreme far-right (FR) and radical Islamic terrorists between 1990 and 2014. Drawing from Situational Crime Prevention (SCP), we investigate whether suicide incidents are more likely than non-suicide incidents to be directed at secure targets and to utilize firearms. Findings reveal that suicide terrorism is significantly more likely to be committed against secure targets and similarly likely to involve the use of firearms in comparison with non-suicide terrorism. In addition, suicide terrorism is more likely to be committed by lone actors, radical Islamic terrorists, and result in fatalities. Implications for terrorism prevention are discussed.

TI <i>Vital Signs</i>: Trends in State Suicide Rates - United States,
   1999-2016 and Circumstances Contributing to Suicide-27 States, 2015
SO MMWR-MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY WEEKLY REPORT
LA English
DT Article
ID PSYCHOLOGICAL AUTOPSY
AB Introduction: Suicide rates in the United States have risen nearly 30% since 1999, and mental health conditions are one of several factors contributing to suicide. Examining state-level trends in suicide and the multiple circumstances contributing to it can inform comprehensive state suicide prevention planning.
   Methods: Trends in age-adjusted suicide rates among persons aged >= 10 years, by state and sex, across six consecutive 3-year periods (1999-2016), were assessed using data from the National Vital Statistics System for 50 states and the District of Columbia. Data from the National Violent Death Reporting System, covering 27 states in 2015, were used to examine contributing circumstances among decedents with and without known mental health conditions.
   Results: During 1999-2016, suicide rates increased significantly in 44 states, with 25 states experiencing increases > 30%. Rates increased significantly among males and females in 34 and 43 states, respectively. Fifty-four percent of decedents in 27 states in 2015 did not have a known mental health condition. Among decedents with available information, several circumstances were significantly more likely among those without known mental health conditions than among those with mental health conditions, including relationship problems/loss (45.1% versus 39.6%), life stressors (50.5% versus 47.2%), and recent/impending crises (32.9% versus 26.0%), but these circumstances were common across groups.
   Conclusions: Suicide rates increased significantly across most states during 1999-2016. Various circumstances contributed to suicides among persons with and without known mental health conditions.
   Implications for Public Health Practice: States can use a comprehensive evidence-based public health approach to prevent suicide risk before it occurs, identify and support persons at risk, prevent reattempts, and help friends and family members in the aftermath of a suicide.

ID SOCIOECONOMIC-FACTORS; SENTIMENT; RISK
AB I investigated whether or not social mood is associated with the financial decisions of market participants in the United States, using the monthly suicide rate to represent the degree of negative social mood in a society. From monthly suicide data collected over the period from January 1981 through to December 2012, I found that suicide rates are associated with stock market returns, in aggregate. Specifically, suicide rates predicted future stock market returns, showing contemporaneous and lagged relationships with U.S. stock market returns. Furthermore, small-cap stocks were found to be more likely to be affected by suicide rates than were large-cap stocks. Female suicide rates had a stronger effect on market returns than male suicide rates did, suggesting that this suicide effect is not induced by economic reasons but, rather, is related to emotional factors (e.g., investor mood).

AB This brief review summarizes the basic epidemiology of firearm violence, a large and costly public health problem in the United States for which the mortality rate has remained unchanged for more than a decade. It presents findings for the present in light of recent trends. Risk for firearm violence varies substantially across demographic subsets of the population and between states in patterns that are quite different for suicide and homicide. Suicide is far more common than homicide and its rate is increasing; the homicide rate is decreasing. As with other important health problems, most cases of fatal firearm violence arise from large but low-risk subsets of the population; risk and burden of illness are not distributed symmetrically. Compared with other industrialized nations, the United States has uniquely high mortality rates from firearm violence.

AB The role of ruminative coping and gender as potential moderators of cultural differences in suicide ideation among 194 college students from Ghana and the United States were studied. Participants completed the Adult Suicidal Ideation. Questionnaire and the Rumination scale of the Response Style Questionnaire. Significant main effects for cultural group and gender Lucre found for suicide ideation. Furthermore, gender and rumination together accounted for significant portions of the variance in suicide ideation scores. Implications for future research are discussed.

AB Life stressor precipitants and communications of distress and suicide intent were examined among a sample of United States Air Force (USAF) married versus unmarried suicide decedents. A total of 100 death investigations conducted by the Office of Special Investigations on active duty USAF suicides occurring between 1996 and 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. Married decedents were twice as likely 1) to have documented interpersonal conflict 24 hours prior to suicide and 2) to have communicated suicide intent to peers or professionals. Themes of distress communication for all decedents were intrapersonal (perceived stress, depression, psychological pain) and interpersonal (thwarted belongingness, rejection, loneliness). Suicide prevention programs and policies are encouraged to adapt efforts to the unique needs of married and unmarried individuals.

AB Asthma and suicide attempts are leading causes of morbidity and mortality among adults in the United States. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between asthma and suicidal ideation and suicide attempt among adults in the United States, and to examine whether timing of asthma, mood disorders, poverty, allergies, cigarette smoking and sex differences confound these relationships. Data were drawn from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES Ill), a representative sample of adults (N = 6584) in the United States. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relationships between current and former asthma and suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, adjusting for demographics, poverty, smoking, allergies and mood disorders. Current asthma is significantly associated with an increased likelihood of suicidal ideation (OR: 1.77, CI: 1.11, 2.84) and suicide attempt (OR: 3.26, CI: 1.97, 5.39), after adjusting for mood disorders, smoking, poverty and demographics. There does not appear to be a significant relationship between former asthma and suicidal ideation or suicide attempt. These findings confirm and extend previous evidence by showing that the link between asthma and suicide-related outcomes is evident among adults in a representative sample and that this relationship persists after adjusting for a range of variables. This study may provide an empiric foundation for including asthma in the clinical assessment of suicide risk. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Birth cohort effects in suicide rates are well established, but to date there is no methodological approach or framework to test the temporal stability of these effects. We use the APC-Detrended (APCD) model to robustly estimate intensity of cohort effects identifying non-linear trends (or 'detrended' fluctuations) in suicide rates. The new APC-Hysteresis (APCH) model tests temporal stability of cohort effects. Analysing suicide rates in 25 WHO countries (periods 1970-74 to 2005-09; ages 20-24 to 70-79) with the APCD method, we find that country-specific birth cohort membership plays an important role in suicide rates. Among 25 countries, we detect 12 nations that show deep contrasts among cohort-specific suicide rates including Italy, Australia and the United States. The APCH method shows that cohort fluctuations are not stable across the life course but decline in Spain, France and Australia, whereas they remain stable in Italy, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. We discuss the Spanish case with elevated suicide mortality of cohorts born 1965-1975 which declines with age, and the opposite case of the United States, where the identified cohort effects of those born around 1960 increase smoothly, but statistically significant across the life course.

AB The objective of this study was to identify the number and subtypes of homicide-suicides in the United States by age group and state over a 3-year period from 1997 through 1999. A total of 673 homicide-suicides, including 674 perpetrators and 779 victims, were identified from Internet searches of 191 national newspapers, and they were classified according to a modified Hanzlick-Koponen typology. One quarter of the homicide-suicides were perpetrated by persons 55 years or older, and 77% were spousal/consortial, higher than the 57% observed in the younger age group, 11% of the older homicide/suicides were familial, compared with 16% in the younger age group. Whereas only 37% of older homicide-suicides were infaniticide/pedicide, 16% of the younger homicide-suicides involved parents killing their children. Forty-five states, including the District of Columbia, reported a homicide-suicide during the 3-year period, and they occurred most frequently in Florida (163), California (98), Texas (36), and New York (35). Newspaper surveillance is useful to identify where homicide-suicides are occurring most frequently, but they are underestimates of the true prevalence. However, the number of incidents detected is large enough that the cases detected may be a fairly representative sample.

AB BACKGROUNDYouth suicide is a serious public health problem in the United States. School environments, and the attention of school adults, are promising but minimally studied avenues for promoting mental health among students.
   METHODSThe 2013 New Mexico Youth Risk and Resiliency Survey data were analyzed to identify ways in which the school environment influences suicide attempts in a sample of Hispanic students. Factors examined were: relationships with school adults, speaking a language other than English at home, being born outside the United States and not having enough to eat. Odds ratios were used to measure relationships.
   RESULTSFactors influencing suicide attempt were similar for boys and girls. The odds of suicide attempt declined by approximately one third as measures of positive relationships with school adults increased. Post-high school education plans also were protective. Being born outside the United States and not having enough to eat increased the odds of past-year suicide attempt. Speaking a language other than English at home was a weak risk factor for suicide attempt only among Hispanic girls.
   CONCLUSIONSTeachers and other school adults can decrease suicide risk for Hispanic teens by forming supportive relationships with students. Special consideration should be given to providing free breakfast in schools.

TI SUICIDE NOTES FROM INDIA AND THE UNITED STATES: A THEMATIC COMPARISON
SO DEATH STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Suicide is a global concern, hence, cross-cultural research ought to be important; yet, there is a paucity of cross-cultural study in suicidology. This study sought to investigate suicide notes drawn from India and the United States, as these countries have similar suicide rates but markedly different cultures. A thematic or theoretical-conceptual analysis of 72 suicide notes drawn from these countries, matched for age and gender, was undertaken, based on Leenaars' (1996) multidimensional model of suicide. The results suggested that there were more commonalities than differences; yet, not consistent with previous cross-cultural studies of suicide notes, Indian notes expressed more indirect expression including veiled aggression, or aggression turned inward, and unconscious dynamics. It was concluded that the model may be applicable to suicide in both countries, but also much greater study in India is warranted on collectivism and dissembling as a suicide risk factor.

AB The genetics of suicide is increasingly recognized and relevant for mental health literacy, but actual beliefs may lag behind current knowledge. We examined such beliefs in student samples (total N = 686) from Estonia, Malaysia, Romania, the United Kingdom, and the United States with die Beliefs in the Inheritance of Risk Factors for Suicide Scale. Cultural effects were small, those of key demographics nil. Several facets of construct validity were demonstrated. Marked differences in perceived plausibility of evidence about the genetics of suicide according to research design, observed in all samples, may be of general interest for investigating lily theories of abnormal behavior and communicating behavioral and psychiatric genetic research findings.

AB Objective: In 2003 and 2004, U.S. and European regulators issued public health warnings about a possible association between antidepressants and suicidal thinking and behavior. The authors assessed whether these warnings discouraged use of antidepressants in children and adolescents and whether they led to increases in suicide rates as a result of untreated depression.
   Method: The authors examined U.S. and Dutch data on prescription rates for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) from 2003 to 2005 in children and adolescents (patients up to age 19), as well as suicide rates for children and adolescents, using available data (through 2004 in the United States and through 2005 in the Netherlands). They used Poisson regression analyses to determine the overall association between antidepressant prescription rates and suicide rates, adjusted for sex and age, during the periods preceding and immediately following the public health warnings.
   Results: SSRI prescriptions for youths decreased by approximately 22% in both the United States and the Netherlands after the warnings were issued. in the Netherlands, the youth suicide rate increased by 49% between 2003 and 2005 and shows a significant inverse association with SSRI prescriptions. In the United States, youth suicide rates increased by 14% between 2003 and 2004, which is the largest year-to-year change in suicide rates in this population since the Centers or Disease Control and Prevention began systematically collecting suicide data in 1979.
   Conclusions: In both the United States and the Netherlands, SSRI prescriptions for children and adolescents decreased after U.S. and European regulatory agencies issued warnings about a possible suicide risk with antidepressant use in pediatric patients, and these decreases were associated with increases in suicide rates in children and adolescents.

AB In this paper we investigate the dual role of supply restrictions and drug treatment in combating the concurrent rise of opioid abuse and suicide in the United States over the last two decades. We find that supply-side interventions decrease suicides in places with strong addiction-help networks, implying that prescription drug abuse is associated with an inherent risk of suicide. Our findings support an important role for access to treatment services in policies designed to combat the opioid epidemic. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background Occupational sunlight exposure was examined in I-elation to death front suicide in a United States cohort of 138,905 male electric utility workers.
   Methods Case-control sampling included 536 deaths from suicide and 5,348 eligible controls randomly selected from the cohort, Exposure was classified based on work history?, linked to indices of cumulative sunlight exposure.
   Results Mortality from suicide was not associated with estimates of recent and career occupational sunlight exposure, with adjusted odds ratios around unity. Occupational sunlight exposure was positively associated with nonviolent suicides, but no dose-response gradient was observed and risk estimates were notably imprecise.
   Conclusions These data provide evidence against art association between occupational sunlight exposure and mortality from suicide. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Suicide is a troubling, preventable phenomenon. Prior to attempts, individuals often seek help, prompting practitioners to perform risk assessments that ideally use evidence-based risk management strategies. A literature review was performed using Harvard Countway Library of Medicine, Google Scholar, PubMed. Key words used were Forensic Science, Suicide Risk Management, Pediatric Suicide Risk Factors, Adult Suicide Risk Factors, Geriatric Suicide Risk Factors, Suicide Risk Assessment. Parameters limited articles to studies/reviews completed in the past twenty years in the United States. Results indicated predictors of suicide in juveniles were insomnia, burdensomeness, and recent conflicts with family or a romantic partner. Adults had greater risk if male, substance abusing, with marital/job loss. Elderly individuals with multiple medical comorbidities, hopelessness, and isolation were at higher risk. Everyone evaluated should be screened for access to firearms. Management of suicide risk involves providing the least restrictive form of treatment which maintains an individual's safety.

AB U.S. suicide rates vary across the states and are higher in the American West than in other regions. Reasons for these patterns have eluded social scientists. This research note examines whether residential stability and population density as ecological contexts for social integration help explain the patterns. Reflecting Durkheimian reasoning, results suggest that residential stability helps explain both the high Western suicide rate and state suicide rates more generally. Final remarks address the theoretical and empirical implications of the findings.

AB Suggestions that there is a growing epidemic of suicide among college students in the United States are false. The National Survey of Counseling Center Directors reports 1,404 student suicides over a 14-year period and an adjusted suicide rate of 6.5, half the rate of the general US population (12.6 for all races) during this period when matched for gender and age. Counseling centers appear effective in treating suicidal students, for although the suicide rate for students who were currently or previously clients at campus counseling centers is 3 times the rate of other students, student clients have 18 times the risk of suicide compared to students in general. Identifying and referring students at elevated risk for suicide could further reduce the crude and relative rate of student suicide. However, even programs that do this only moderately well may require substantial increases in counseling staffing.

The aim of the present study was to build on previous work by examining the impact of firearm storage practices and the strictness of firearm regulation on suicide rates at the state level. Data were compiled from primarily three sources. Suicide and firearm ownership information was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Strictness of handgun regulation was derived from figures available at the Law Center to Prevent Violence, and controls were taken from the US Bureau of the Census. Mixed models were fitted to the data. Household firearm ownership was strongly associated with both suicide by all mechanisms, and firearm suicide. Storage practices had especially elevated consequences on suicide rates. Percent with loaded guns and gun readiness increased suicide rates, and strictness of gun regulation reduced suicide rates. Ready access to firearms can make a difference between life and death. Loaded and unlocked firearms within reach become risk factors for fatal outcomes from suicidal behavior. Future research might want to examine ways of obtaining more recent data on individual firearm ownership. This study proposes several policy recommendations for suicide prevention.

AB Objective: Cross sectional studies in the United States often find a significant positive association between levels of household firearm ownership and suicide rates. This study investigates whether the association can be explained by differences in levels of mental health.
   Methods: The relationship between household handgun ownership and overall suicide rates across United States regions after accounting for two mental health variables-lifetime prevalence of major depression and serious suicidal thoughts-were examined. Analyses also add another control variable (urbanization, education, unemployment, or alcohol consumption). Data on mental health variables come from the National Comorbiclity Study, conducted in the early 1990s. Data on household handgun ownership come from the General Social Surveys.
   Results: Across the nine regions for the early 1990s (n = 9), household handgun ownership rates are positively correlated with the suicide rate (r = 0.59) and are not correlated with either the lifetime prevalence of major depression or suicidal thoughts. After controlling for major depression and suicidal thoughts (and any of the four additional control variables), handgun ownership rates remain significantly associated with the overall suicide rate.
   Conclusions: In United States regions with higher levels of household handgun ownership, there are higher suicide rates. This relationship cannot be explained by differences in the prevalence of two mental health indicators-lifetime rates of either major depression or suicidal thoughts.

AB Aim. To determine the association between feelings of inferiority and suicidal ideation and suicide attempt among youth in the United States.
   Methods. Data were drawn from the National Comorbidity Survey carried out among a representative sample of the 15-54 year old population (n = 8,098) in the United States. The subsample analyzed in this study included 1,456 respondents aged 15-19. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine the relationship between feelings of inferiority and the likelihood of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt among youth them.
   Results. Among the youth, 4.2% described themselves as having feelings of inferiority. Feelings of inferiority were associated with a significantly increased odds of suicidal ideation (odds ratio (OR) = 3.2; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.8-5.7) and suicide attempt (OR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.04.8), which persisted after adjusting for differences in socio-demographic characteristics and comorbid mental disorders among youth in the community. There was evidence of interaction between feelings of inferiority and major depression in the likelihood of suicide attempt.
   Conclusions. This preliminary evidence suggests that feelings of inferiority are associated with a significantly increased likelihood of suicidal thoughts and suicidal behavior among youth in the community. Intervention and prevention strategies aimed at identifying and intervening with youth at risk may benefit from the assessment of feelings of inferiority.

AB Background: The gender ratio (male/female) of suicide rates greatly differs by country and by age group. These differences are accompanied by differences in the use of violent methods of suicide.
   Methods: The gender ratio of suicide rates and the methods used were calculated from the most recently available official electronic mortality data published by the four countries (two Eastern (Korea and Japan) and two Western (Australia and the United states) countries) and from the World Health Organization [WHO] mortality database. Suicide gender ratios based on 95% Confidence intervals (CIs) were used to compare the countries between age groups.
   Results: The gender ratio of suicide rates was higher in the United States (3.9) and Australia (3.3), where gender differences in suicide methods were more prominent, than in Korea (1.8) and Japan (2.7). In the United States and Australia, the gender ratios greatly increased in the elderly (age 70 years and over), with a higher use of firearms by men. The gender ratio of suicide rates was lowest (1.0) in the young (age 20-29) in Korea, where hanging was a more common method in women than in men.
   Limitations: The study does not consider the various other factors that may have influenced gender differences of suicide rate.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that differences in suicide methods play a role in determining the differences in the gender ratio of suicide rates between countries. Because suicide methods varied with gender, age, and country and may play a role in the suicide rates of each group, these parameters should be taken into account in the design of suicide prevention measures.

AB This study presents results from the first combined quantitative assessment and comparative analysis of suicide terrorists and rampage, workplace, and school shooters who attempt suicide. Findings suggest that in the United States from 1990 to 2010, the differences between these offenders (N = 81) were largely superficial. Prior to their attacks, they struggled with many of the same personal problems, including social marginalization, family problems, work or school problems, and precipitating crisis events. Ultimately, patterns among all four types of offenders can assist those developing security policy, conducting threat assessments, and attempting to intervene in the lives of at-risk individuals.

AB This study examines the relationship between state-level earned income tax credit (EITC) laws in the United States on suicides. Following findings in previous work showing that the EITC is associated with lower depression rates and reduced number of risky biomarkers, I estimated the effects of state EITC generosity on suicide rates. Using data for the years 1996 to 2016, a period with 74 state-level EITC policy changes, I find that introducing a high state EITC rate reduces suicide rates for adults aged 25 or above by 3.91%. The results are consistent across four different measures of EITC generosity.

ID MIDDLE-AGED MEN; UNITED-STATES; CONSUMPTION; INTOXICATION; MORTALITY;
   BEHAVIOR; YOUNG
AB AimsTo estimate the association between per capita alcohol retail outlet density and blood alcohol concentration (BAC) from 51547 suicide decedents and to analyse the relationship between alcohol outlet density and socio-demographic characteristics among alcohol-positive suicide decedents in the United States by racial/ethnic groups and method of suicide.
   DesignAnalysis of US data, 2003-11, National Violent Death Reporting System.
   SettingSuicide decedents from 14 US states.
   ParticipantsA total of 51347 suicide decedents tested for BAC.
   MeasurementsBAC and levels were derived from coroner/medical examiner reports. Densities of county level on-premises and off-premises alcohol retail outlets were calculated using the 2010 Census.
   FindingsMulti-level logistic regression models suggested that higher off-premises alcohol outlet densities were associated with greater proportions of alcohol-related suicides among menfor suicides with alcohol present [BAC >0; adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.03-1.13]. Interactions between outlet density and decedents' characteristics were also tested. There was an interaction between off-premises alcohol availability and American Indian/Alaska Native race (AOR=1.36; 95% CI=1.10-1.69) such that this subgroup had highest BAC positivity. On-premises density was also associated with BAC >0 (AOR=1.07; 95% CI=1.03-1.11) and BAC 0.08 (AOR=1.05; 95% CI=1.02-1.09) among male decedents.
   ConclusionsIn the United States, the density of both on- and off-premises alcohol outlets in a county is associated positively with alcohol-related suicide, especially among American Indians/Alaska Natives.

AB Objective: This study explored nurse suicide in the United States.
   Methods: Characteristics were compared between occupations using 2014 National Violent Death Reporting System data.
   Results: Female nurse suicides were significantly higher (11.97/100,000) than in the female population (7.58/100,000) (p < 0.001); similarly male nurses (39.8/100,000) compared to the male population (28.2/100,000) (p < 0.001). Benzodiazepines and opioids were the most commonly used substances used in clinician suicide.
   Conclusion: These results suggest a public health imperative for future research and development of effective preventative strategies for nurses; a largely understudied population.

LA English
DT Article
ID YOUNG ADOLESCENTS; SCALE; RELIABILITY
AB To examine trends in suicide ideation and behavior over time, the authors analyze data from nationally representative samples of between 10,904 and 16,296 students participating in the 1991, 1993, 1995, and 1997 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys. These data describe the proportion of United States students in grades 9 through 12 that reported having (I) seriously considered attempting suicide, (2) made a plan to attempt suicide, (3) attempted suicide, and (4) made an injurious suicide attempt. From 1991 to 1997, the percentage of students seriously considering suicide and the percentage that made a suicide plan showed significant linear decreases. However, the percentage of students that made an injurious suicide attempt showed a significant linear increase. These trends make it unlikely that relevant national health objectives fur the year 2000 will be met. Additional efforts are needed to identify and disseminate strategies that effectively reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviors among adolescents.

TI Suicide acts in 8 states: Incidence and case fatality rates by
   demographics and method
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; RISK
AB Objectives. This study examined incidence rates of medically identified suicide acts (self-inflicted injuries, either fatal or nonfatal) and case fatality rates by age, sex, race, and method used.
   Methods. The authors analyzed data on 10892 suicides and 57439 attempted suicides among hospital-admitted individuals in 8 states, along with 6219 attempted suicides among individuals released from emergency departments in 2 states.
   Results. The 8 states experienced a mean of 11 suicides and 119 attempted suicides per 100000 residents each year. Groups with high suicide rates were men, the elderly, and Whites; groups with high attempted suicide rates were teenagers, young adults, women, and Blacks and Whites aged 25 to 44 years. Blacks aged 15 to 44 years evidenced high attempted suicide rates undocumented in previous studies. Poisoning and firearm were the most common methods used among those attempting suicide and those completing suicide acts, respectively. The most lethal method was firearm.
   Conclusions. The characteristics of suicides and attempted suicides differ dramatically. Method used is important in the lethality of the act.

ID CHOICE
AB Carbon monoxide (CO) inhalation is one of the leading methods of suicide in the United States. A sharp increase in suicide by inhaling the CO produced from burning charcoal has been reported in parts of Asia; however, the incidence of this method has not been determined in a U.S. population. Thus, we determined trends of CO suicide in the ethnically diverse population of King County, Washington, U.S.A. During the period 1996-2009, we identified 158 cases of suicide by CO poisoning, with 125 because of automotive exhaust, 26 because of charcoal burning, and seven from other CO sources. While historical U.S. data indicate > 99% of CO suicides in the United States occurring by automobile exhaust inhalation, in the most recent years analyzed, c. 40% of CO-related suicides in King County, Washington, were because of charcoal burning, indicating a possible shift in suicide trends that warrants further scrutiny in additional populations.

AB Suicide is a major public health problem for American Indians in the United States. Published studies indicate that American Indians experience the highest rate of suicide of all ethnic groups in the United States. This article synthesizes the epidemiology and risk factors associated with suicide among American Indians, barriers to research, prevention, mental-health services, and recommendations for research and practice. The authors' recommendations arise from the current literature as well as interviews with practitioners and academics in the field of suicide prevention. The authors present significant substantive and methodological issues that inform research on suicide in American Indian communities, as well as existing contemporary interventions. Overall, socioeconomic characteristics, substance abuse, barriers to mental health services and acculturation play a role in the occurrence of suicide in American Indian communities. These findings suggest suicide is an important public health problem that needs to be addressed for American Indians.

DT Article
ID AGE-SPECIFIC SUICIDE; SOCIAL INTEGRATION; METROPOLITAN-AREAS;
   GENDER-DIFFERENCES; DURKHEIM THEORY; HEALTH; INEQUALITY; EMPLOYMENT;
   STRESS; TIME
AB Objective
   This article addresses the relationship between suicide mortality and family structure and socioeconomic status for U.S. adult men and women.
   Methods
   We use Cox proportional hazard models and individual-level, prospective data from the National Health Interview Survey Linked Mortality File (1986-2002) to examine adult suicide mortality.
   Results
   Larger families and employment are associated with lower risks of suicide for both men and women. Low levels of education or being divorced or separated, widowed, or never married are associated with increased risks of suicide among men, but not among women.
   Conclusions
   We find important sex differences in the relationship between suicide mortality and marital status and education. Future suicide research should use both aggregate and individual-level data and recognize important sex differences in the relationship between risk factors and suicide mortality-a central cause of preventable death in the United States.

AB Deaths by suicide are the 10th leading cause of death for Latinxs in the United States. Given the heterogeneity of the Latinx population, additional focus on Latinx mental health is needed at the subgroup level. Puerto Ricans comprise the second largest Latinx subgroup in the nation. Their American citizenship, ethnohistory, and unique migration patterns to and from the U.S. mainland point to the need for further understanding of the impact of culture on Puerto Rican mental health. Guided by Leininger's Culture Care Theory, an integrative review examined cultural factors influencing suicidal ideation and behaviors in Puerto Ricans in the United States and in Puerto Rico; a total of 24 articles from the past 10 years were reviewed. There is a dearth of current research literature addressing suicide and suicide prevention in Puerto Ricans, particularly those living in the continental United States. Further focus on the cultural and social factors that impact suicide risk is warranted. Advancing the evidence regarding the culture care needs of Puerto Ricans and other Latinx subgroups can guide future research efforts and the development of culturally congruent nursing strategies aimed at mental health promotion and suicide prevention in the Latinx population.

AB Suicide is an important cause of death in prisons across the United States. Existing research on prison suicides has been criticized for focusing on static variables such as demographics. The purpose of the present investigation was to study dynamic variables by examining the experiences of 24 inmates who attempted suicide in prison. Inmates were interviewed in six state prison facilities in Oregon. The results were organized into three categories: mental health issues, relationship issues, and prison factors. The themes and subthemes of each category are illustrated with quotes, and results are discussed in light of relevant literature.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY

DT Article

   ADAPTATION; FIREARMS; HEALTH; STATES; RISK
AB Objective: The authors recently observed a correlation between state altitude and suicide rate in the United States, which could be explained by higher rates of gun ownership and lower population density in the intermountain West. The present study evaluated the relationship between mean county and state altitude in the United States and total age-adjusted suicide rates, firearm-related suicide rates, and non-firearm-related suicide rates. The authors hypothesized that altitude would be significantly associated with suicide rate.
   Method: Elevation data were calculated with an approximate spatial resolution of 0.5 km, using zonal statistics on data sets compiled from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Suicide and population density data were obtained through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) WONDER database. Gun ownership data were obtained through the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
   Results: A significant positive correlation was observed between age-adjusted suicide rate and county elevation (r=0.51). Firearm (r=0.41) and non-firearm suicide rates (r=0.32) were also positively correlated with mean county elevation.
   Conclusions: When altitude, gun ownership, and population density are considered as predictor variables for suicide rates on a state basis, altitude appears to be a significant independent risk factor. This association may be related to the effects of metabolic stress associated with mild hypoxia in individuals with mood disorders.

AB The study. aimed to determine the relationship between physical illness, mental disorder, and the likelihood of suicide attempt among adults aged 15-54 in the United States. Data were drawn from the National Comorbidity Survey (N = 8, 098), a national probability sample of adults in the United States. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine the relationship between self-reported physical illness and the likelihood of suicide attempt. Lung disease (OR =1.8 (1.1, 2.7)), ulcer (OR =2.1 (1.3, 3.4)), and AIDS (OR = 44.1 (10.5, 185.6)) were each associated with a significantly increased likelihood of suicide attempt, independent of the effects of mental disorders. Consistent with previous studies, the number of physical illnesses was linearly related to an increased odds of suicide attempt (OR = 1.3 (1.2, 1.5)). Possible mechanisms for these associations are discussed. These findings call for the inclusion of a range of physical health problems, especially chronic illnesses, in future research on suicide attempts in the population. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Suicide Rates and State Laws Regulating Access and Exposure to Handguns
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH

DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; GUN-CONTROL; HOMICIDE; PREVENTION; LETHALITY; CANADA
AB Objectives. Using previous research, we examined the impact of 4 handgun laws (waiting periods, universal background checks, gun locks, and open carrying regulations) on suicide rates.
   Methods. We used publicly available databases to collect information on state-wide laws, suicide rates, and demographic characteristics for 2013.
   Results. Each law was associated with significantly lower firearm suicide rates and the proportion of suicides resulting from firearms. In addition, each law, except for that which required a waiting period, was associated with a lower overall suicide rate. Follow-up analyses showed a significant indirect effect on overall suicide rates through the proportion of suicides by firearms, indicating that the reduced overall suicide rate was attributable to fewer suicide attempts, fewer handguns in the home, suicide attempts using less lethal means, or a combination of these factors. States that implemented any of these laws saw a decreased suicide rate in subsequent years, whereas the only state that repealed 1 of these laws saw an increased suicide rate.
   Conclusions. Our results were supportive of a potentially vital role in suicide prevention for state legislation that limits access and exposure to handguns.

TI RISING SUN: Prioritized Outcomes for Suicide Prevention in the Arctic
SO PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES
LA English
DT Article
AB The Arctic Council, a collaborative forum among governments and Arctic communities, has highlighted the problem of suicide and potential solutions. The mental health initiative during the United States chairmanship, Reducing the Incidence of Suicide in Indigenous Groups: Strengths United Through Networks (RISING SUN), used a Delphi methodology complemented by face-to-face stakeholder discussions to identify outcomes to evaluate suicide prevention interventions. RISING SUN underscored that multilevel suicide prevention initiatives require mobilizing resources and enacting policies that promote the capacity for wellness, for example, by reducing adverse childhood experiences, increasing social equity, and mitigating the effects of colonization and poverty.

Using individual-level US data from 1989 to 2004, our findings indicate that individuals have lower rates of suicide or are 'happy' when they live in a state that has lower unemployment rate.

ID DURKHEIM THEORY; RATES; FAMILY
AB A longstanding debate focuses on whether suicide and homicide rates walk hand in hand or whether they are reciprocally related. Much of the research on this issue investigates whether suicide or homicide predominates in certain geographic areas or whether they trend together over time. We theorize that the degree of social integration and social regulation associated with birth cohorts is negatively related to both of these forms of lethal violence. We develop a common explanation for shifts in the age distributions of homicide and suicide in the United States from 1930 to 2000. In this context, suicide rates and homicide rates walk hand in hand and their parallel movements are associated with two variables linked to social integration and regulation.

ID NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE; SOCIAL ECOLOGY
AB Abel and Kruger (2005) reported a negative association of educational attainment and suicide rate across the United States. Given strong links between intelligence and educational attainment, this appears to be inconsistent with positive associations of intelligence and suicide rate reported in several other geographical studies. However, the apparent inconsistencies may reflect interstate migration within the U.S. adult population. Testing this hypothesis showed that interstate migration was more strongly related to state suicide rates than educational attainment. Thus, the different results obtained by Abel and Kruger could reflect migration effects, which for the U.S. might render adult-age indicators of educational attainment inappropriate to reflect regional variation in intelligence by place of birth.

AB CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: The World Health Organization recognizes suicide as a public health priority. Increased knowledge of suicide risk factors is needed in order to be able to adopt effective prevention strategies. The aim of this study was to analyze and compare the association between the Gini coefficient (which is used to measure inequality) and suicide death rates over a 14-year period (2000-2013) in Brazil and in the United States (US). The hypothesis put forward was that reduction of income inequality is accompanied by reduction of suicide rates.
   DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive cross-sectional time-series study in Brazil and in the US.
   METHODS: Population, death and suicide death data were extracted from the DATASUS database in Brazil and from the National Center for Health Statistics in the US. Gini coefficient data were obtained from the World Development Indicators. Time series analysis was performed on Brazilian and American official data regarding the number of deaths caused by suicide between 2000 and 2013 and the Gini coefficients of the two countries. The suicide trends were examined and compared.
   RESULTS: Brazil and the US present converging Gini coefficients, mainly due to reduction of inequality in Brazil over the last decade. However, suicide rates are not converging as hypothesized, but are in fact rising in both countries.
   CONCLUSION: The hypothesis that reduction of income inequality is accompanied by reduction of suicide rates was not verified.

TI Suicide in Different Cultures: A Thematic Comparison of Suicide Notes

AB Suicide is a global concern, hence, cross-cultural research ought to be central; yet, there is a paucity of cross-cultural study in suicidology. A thematic or theoretical-conceptual analysis of 60 suicide notes drawn from Turkey and the United States, matched for age and sex, was undertaken, based on Leenaars's empirical-based multidimensional model of suicide. The results suggested that there were more culturally common factors than specific differences; yet, not consistent with previous cross-cultural studies of suicide notes, differences emerged in Turkey notes expressing more indirect and veiled communications (indirect expressions). Specifically, Turkish notes expressed that there may be more reasons to the act than the person writes. It was concluded that the model may be applicable to suicide in both countries, but also much greater cross-cultural study is warranted on specific cultural risk factors. A question raised is whether the findings are related to collectivism versus individualism.

AB Suicide is a leading cause of death among children in the United States; firearms cause 37% of these deaths. Research is needed to better understand firearm accessibility among youth at risk for suicide. We reviewed data from the National Fatality Review Case Reporting System (NFR-CRS). Firearm suicide deaths of children ages 10-18 occurring 2004 through 2015 with completed suicide-specific section were included. Children who had talked about, threatened or attempted suicide were identified as Greater Risk (GR). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated. Of the 2106 firearm suicide deaths, 1388 (66%) had a completed NFR-CRS suicide section. Of these, 36% (494/1388) met the criteria for GR. Firearms were less likely to be stored in a locked location for GR children [adjusted OR 0.62, (95%CI 0.49-0.98)]. Strategies to limit firearm access, particularly for GR youth, should be a focus of suicide prevention efforts.

ID ADOLESCENTS; VIETNAMESE; IDENTITY
AB To investigate whether a relationship exists between acculturation and attitudes about suicide, 81 Ghanaian immigrants living in the U.S. who responded to a mail inquiry were selected to participate in the current study. This particular immigrant sample was chosen because although they represent a rapidly growing group in the U.S., they have been rarely Studied. Respondents consisted of 42 women and 36 men (3 did not identify their sex), with a mean age of 29.5 yr. (SD=10.6). Participants completed measures of acculturation and attitudes about suicide. Results indicated significant correlations between length of residency in the United States and negative suicide attitudes, and also between psychological acculturation and negative suicide attitudes. No significant relationship was found between behavioral acculturation and suicide attitudes. Furthermore, length of residency was a stronger predictor of suicide attitudes than other subjective measures of acculturation. Implications and suggestions for further research are discussed.

AB For more than a decade, the ethics and legality of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide have been actively debated in the United States. This debate has fairly clearly settled the legal questions and added significant empirical data to inform the debate. This chapter gives a review of both the legal decisions and legislative initiatives regarding euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide and the many empirical studies of the American public, physicians, and patients related to their attitudes and experiences regarding euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide.
   In 1997, the United States Supreme Court definitively ruled 9-0 that there is no constitutional right to either euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. But it also made clear that there is no constitutional barrier for states to legalize euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. Only Oregon has legalized physician-assisted suicide; many other states have passed laws to ensure euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are illegal. The most recent referendum, in 1998 in Michigan, voted overwhelmingly to oppose legalizing physician-assisted suicide. Data on the public's attitudes shows that support for euthanasia and/or physician-assisted suicide is variable with a majority supporting these interventions for patients in extreme pain but not for other reasons. The elderly, African-Americans, Catholics, and religious individuals are much more likely to oppose euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. Most surveys of physicians show a majority oppose euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide, with considerable variation among specialties. Support for these interventions among physicians appears to have declined in recent years. About a quarter of physicians, and as many as half of oncologists, have received requests for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide, but a small minority, less than 10% of all physicians and fewer than 20% of oncologists, have performed euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. And the physicians who have performed these interventions do them very rarely: most only once in a career. Data from cancer, HIV/AIDS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and terminally ill patients suggest that depression, hopelessness, and psychological distress are the primary factors associated with personal interest in euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. Pain, which is the reason most Americans find euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide acceptable-does not appear to be a main motivating factor behind patients' personal desire for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. It appears that considerably less than 1% of all Americans die from euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide.
   Over the last decade the legality of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in the United States has been resolved. Empirical research has contributed significantly to our understanding of the attitudes and practices regarding euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, especially the depth of public support, the factors associated with patient interest, and physician practices regarding euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. However, several important questions remain unanswered.

AB Background: Suicide events observed in various groups, community or countries, especially in the periods of economic recession. It is thought that suicide cases increase when people's income decreases dramatically and they lose their jobs. Aim/Objective: In this study, it was aimed to investigate whether the 2008 economic crisis had any effect on suicides in the United States. Methods: Autoregressive distributed lag method was used. For the purpose of the study, the number of suicide-related deaths was taken as the dependent variable, while unemployment rates and 2008 economic crisis were taken as independent variables. Findings: The short-term and long-term relationships obtained within the scope of the study indicated that the 2008 economic crisis had a statistically significant effect on suicide cases in the United States. Results and Conclusion: It can be said that the results of this study are consistent with the information which emphasizes that economic crises increase suicide cases in the literature.

AB To explore the different trends of suicide incidence among Blacks and possible contributing factors, the current study compared national epidemiologic data of suicide in the United States from 1981 to 2002. For the first time, period and birth-cohort effects on the incidence trends of Black suicide were evaluated using an age-period-cohort analysis. Cohort effects were found for males and females, suggesting that younger generations of Blacks are at higher risk. If younger cohorts carry their increased suicide risk into later life, then the recent decline in Black suicide rates will be reversed. The results of the current study are only interpretable in terms of group-level characteristics and population suicide rates and not individual-level characteristics. The possible explanation and the implications for prevention and future research are discussed.

AB Consistent with a number of facts from suicide research and an evolutionary view of suicidal behavior, positive ecological (group-level) correlations between contemporary suicide rates and intelligence level have been observed in several geographical (cross-national and within-nation) studies (e.g., Lester, 1993, 1995, 2003; Voracek, 2004, 2005a, 2005b, 2006a-h, 2007). The present research extended these accounts cross-temporally to a test of the social ecology of U.S. state IQ and suicide rates during the early 20th century. Analysis of historical state suicide rates (1913-24), along with validated state IQ figures derived from the Army Alpha and Beta Intelligence Test data of Yerkes (1921), showed a clear positive correlation of state IQ with suicide rates (independent of state wealth) across the USA, thus suggesting temporal stability of the effect.

AB The issue of suicide among Asian Americans has been understudied to date, largely because suicide rates for Asian Americans in the United States have been historically lower than Caucasians. The current special issue gathers studies that represent progress in the state of science, both advancing the current state of knowledge about suicide in Asian American communities and highlighting innovative approaches to suicide prevention and management. We discuss how the articles in the special issue address the nature and salience of suicide among Asian Americans, risk factors, culturally based expression of suicidal ideation and behaviors, and recommendations for suicide prevention and interventions. We conclude by noting directions for future research.

AB For more than a decade, the Garrett Lee Smith Youth Suicide Prevention Program has provided funding for community-based suicide prevention programs to states, tribes, and colleges across the United States. Recent studies provided evidence of the program's effectiveness in reducing suicide mortality and suicide attempts among youth. This study compares the cost of implementing the program with the estimated savings resulting from avoided hospitalization and emergency department visits associated with the averted suicide attempts. The findings suggest that the cost of implementing multifaceted community-based suicide prevention strategies may be more than outweighed by savings in the health sector.

AB Suicide has become the second leading cause of death for individuals between 15 and 29 years old and increasingly more common within college students (WHO, 2016). The purpose of this study was to examine the associations among alexithymia, impulsivity, and locus of control as predictors of suicide risk in college students. Participants were comprised of 550 undergraduate students from two universities in the southeastern United States. Multiple regression analyses were examined to evaluate what variables could be significant predictors of suicide risk in college students. Age, alexithymia subscales of difficulty identifying feelings and externally oriented thinking, and impulsivity subscales of motor, self-control, and nonplanning were considered significant in the regression analysis of suicide risk. Psychoeducational implications, limitations, and future directions are also discussed.

AB This study examines geographic variability of factors associated with male suicide in the United States using county-level data covering 2000 to 2006. Three variables are used as indicators of social isolation: separated/divorced marital status, migration status, and unemployment. A geographically weighted regression analysis shows variation from analogous global ordinary least squares and spatial error regression analyses. Separated/divorced marital status demonstrated a global positive influence. Migration and unemployment effects ranged from positive to negative across the United States, showing some geographic clustering. The findings suggest regional variation is masked by global models and the effect of social isolation indicators have on suicide may vary with geographic context. Any detection of at-risk population will require careful evaluation of privacy issues given the sensitive nature of the health topic. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The top three causes of injury related death in this age goup in the United State are falls, those related to motor vehicle crashes, and suicide. Effective strategies exist for preventing fall related injuries and deaths. Preventing injuries and deaths from motor vehicles and suicide may be more difficult because of the nature of these problems.
   Conclusions: As the number and percentage of older adults continues to rise in the United States and globally, new approaches to preventing injuries will be critical. Interventions will need to operate at multiple levels-directed at the individual, at interpersonal relationships, and at the community level.

AB Objectives. To examine the relationship between state-level firearm ownership rates and gender-specific, age-adjusted firearm and total suicide rates across all 50 US states from 1981 to 2013.
   Methods. We used panel data for all 50 states that included annual overall and gender-specific suicide and firearm suicide rates and a proxy for state-level household firearm ownership. We analyzed data by using linear regression and generalized estimating equations to account for clustering.
   Results. State-level firearm ownership was associated with an increase in both male and female firearm-related suicide rates and with a decrease in nonfirearm-related suicide rates. Higher gun ownership was associated with higher suicide rates by any means among male, but not among female, persons.
   Conclusions. We found a strong relationship between state-level firearm ownership and firearm suicide rates among both genders, and a relationship between firearm ownership and suicides by any means among male, but not female, individuals.
   Policy implications. For male persons, policies that reduce firearm ownership will likely reduce suicides by all means and by firearms. For female persons, such policies will likely reduce suicides by firearms.

AB We investigated suicide timing over different time periods by age, sex and race/ethnicity. A total of 122,107 suicide deaths were identified from the population-based U.S. National Violent Death Reporting System in 18 U.S. states from 2003 through 2014. Suicides significantly increased (p < .05) from March to peak in September before falling, the first week of the month, and early in the week. Suicides also significantly increased (p < .05) in the morning, mainly peaking during the afternoon, although suicides in adolescents peaked in the evening and in those 65-years and older peaked in the morning. Comprehensive prevention efforts should focus on those at overall increased suicide risk and at peaks of high suicide frequency, especially among those vulnerable subgroups.

AB The purpose of the study was to examine the association of suicide rates, firearm ownership, political conservatism, religious integration at the state level, and individual suicide risk. Social structural and social learning and social integration theories were theoretical frameworks employed. It was hypothesized that higher suicide rates, higher state firearm availability, and state conservatism elevate individual suicide risk.
   Data were pooled from the Multiple Cause of Death Files. Multilevel logistic regression models were fitted to all deaths occurring in 2000 through 2004 by suicide.
   The state suicide rate significantly elevated individual suicide risk (AOR = 1.042, CI = 1.037, 1.046). Firearm availability at the state level was associated with significantly higher odds of individual suicide (AOR = 1.004, CI = 1.003, 1.006). State political conservatism elevated the odds of individual suicides (AOR = 1.005, CI = 1.003, 1.007), while church membership at the state level reduced individual odds of suicide (AOR = 0.995, CI = 0.993, 0.996). The results held even after controlling for socioeconomic and demographic variables at the individual level.
   It was concluded that the observed association between individual suicide odds and national suicide rates, and firearm ownership cannot be discounted. Future research ought to focus on integrating individual level data and contextual variables when testing for the impact of firearm ownership. Support was found for social learning and social integration theories.

TI Spatial Clustering of Suicide and Associated Community Characteristics,
   Idaho, 2010-2014
SO PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES
AB Introduction
   In 2015, Idaho had the fifth highest suicide rate in the United States. Little is known about the characteristics of areas in Idaho with high suicide rates. To aid suicide prevention efforts in the state, we sought to identify and characterize spatial clusters of suicide.
   Methods
   We obtained population data from the 2010 US Census and the 2010-2014 American Community Survey, analyzed data on suicides from death certificates, and used a discrete Poisson model in SaTScan to identify spatial clusters of suicide. We used logistic regression to examine associations between suicide clustering and population characteristics.
   Results
   We found 2 clusters of suicide during 2010-2014 that accounted for 70 (4.7%) of 1,501 suicides in Idaho. Areas within clusters were positively associated with the following population characteristics: median age <= 31.1 years versus >31.1 years (multivariable-adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-5.6), >53% female vs <= 53% female (aOR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.3-5.8; P = .01), >1% American Indian/Alaska Native vs <= 1% American Indian/Alaska Native (aOR = 2.9; 95% CI, 1.4-6.3), and >30% never married vs <= 30% never married (aOR = 3.4; 95% CI, 1.5-8.0; P= .004).
   Conclusion
   Idaho suicide prevention programs should consider using results to target prevention efforts to communities with disproportionately high suicide rates.

ID CANCER; SURVIVORS; DEBT
AB Objective: To examine the trends, characteristics, and outcomes of women with gynecologic malignancies who died of suicide in the United States.
   Methods: This is a retrospective, observational study using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program from 1973 to 2013. Women with uterine, ovarian, and cervical cancers who had cause of death recorded as suicide or self-inflicted injury were included, and temporal trends, patient and tumor characteristics, and outcomes were assessed.
   Results: Of 467,368 women with gynecologic cancers, there were 309 (0.07%) suicides during the study period. Across the three malignancies, suicide rates significantly decreased during the study period, with uterine cancer exhibiting the highest interval decrease (relative reduction: uterine cancer 88.2%, cervical cancer 78.1%, and ovarian cancer 73.6%; all, P < 0.05). Women with cervical cancer were younger at age of suicide (median age, 50 versus 60-68 years), and women with ovarian cancer had a shorter time to suicide from diagnosis (median time, 27 versus 66-67 months) (both, P < 0.05). On multivariable analysis, white race (hazard ratio [HR] 3.619), Western U.S. residence (HR 2.012), ovarian cancer (HR 1.991), cervical cancer (HR 1.765), stage IV disease (HR 1.735), and divorced status (HR 1.491) remained independent clinico-pathological characteristics associated with increased risk of suicide (all, P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: This study found that suicide rates in women with gynecologic malignancies have decreased in the United States. Characteristics of suicide vary across cancer types, and certain risk factors of suicide identified in this study may be useful to triage patients at risk for suicidal behavior and inform prevention strategies.

AB Background: A central question in suicide research is whether firearm availability increases the overall number of suicides rather than the proportion of suicides from guns.
   Methods: Seven state health departments supplied mortality and hospital discharge data for all suicides and nonfatal hospitalized suicide attempts between 1996 and 2000. Firearm prevalence measures came from the Behavioral Risk Factor Survey Surveillance. Pearson correlation coefficients and associated chi(2) statistics were used to quantify the relation between firearm prevalence and rates of suicide; ordinary least squares regression was used to explore whether the relation could be explained by differences across states in attempt rates or method-specific case fatality rates.
   Results: Firearm prevalence was positively related to the suicide rate, even after controlling for rates of attempted suicide, and could not be accounted for by differences in method-specific case fatality rates.
   Conclusion: When it comes to suicide, the availability of household firearms matters-a lot.

AB Background: Suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States. Social media such as Twitter is an emerging surveillance tool that may assist researchers in tracking suicide risk factors in real time. Aims: To identify suicide-related risk factors through Twitter conversations by matching on geographic suicide rates from vital statistics data. Method: At-risk tweets were filtered from the Twitter stream using keywords and phrases created from suicide risk factors. Tweets were grouped by state and departures from expectation were calculated. The values for suicide tweeters were compared against national data of actual suicide rates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results: A total of 1,659,274 tweets were analyzed over a 3-month period with 37,717 identified as at-risk for suicide. Midwestern and western states had a higher proportion of suicide-related tweeters than expected, while the reverse was true for southern and eastern states. A strong correlation was observed between state Twitter-derived data and actual state age-adjusted suicide data. Conclusion: Twitter may be a viable tool for real-time monitoring of suicide risk factors on a large scale. This study demonstrates that individuals who are at risk for suicide may be detected through social media.

AB A disproportionate share of firearm suicides and homicides are committed by individuals who have a psychiatric diagnosis, many with a history of substance abuse. This study assessed whether selected variables that potentially indicate increased access to mental health care or known demographic risk factors for firearm trauma best predicted state variations in firearm homicide and suicide. Partial correlation coefficients indicated that the proportion of the population within a given state that was African American or Hispanic was significantly associated with increased state firearm homicides. The percent of the population within a given state that had earned a Baccalaureate degree was associated with decreased state firearm homicides. Additionally, increased state firearm ownership rates were significantly associated with firearm suicides, while state educational expenditures were associated with a significant reduction in firearm suicides. The findings suggest that mental health resources within a state have minimal association with firearm homicide and suicide rates. However, state levels of educational achievement and educational expenditures reduce firearm mortality.

AB studies have found that rates of homicide of children aged under one (infant homicide) are associated with rates of suicide, but not with rates of homicide. Linear regression was used to examine associations among infant homicide, homicide, and suicide in samples of regions in the United States and other countries. Infant homicide rates were significantly and independently associated in all analyses with both total homicide and total suicide rates. The epidemiological evidence supports the clinical observation that infant homicides are due to a range of causes, including maternal mental illness, but are also related to the level of serious violence within a community.

DE Suicide; Suicide prevention strategy
ID NATIONWIDE
AB Suicide is a tragedy that has massive impact on society In order to prevent suicide, active government intervention is necessary. The suicide rate in Seoul is rapidly increasing and is more than five times higher than that in the state of Massachusetts (MA) during the last decade, especially in the elderly. The suicide prevention program of MA is one of the most effective suicide prevention programs in the United States. The program views suicide as a preventable public health problem, and emphasizes treatment of depression and de-stigmatization of mental health illnesses to prevent suicide. Also, through active collaboration with mental health professionals, they try to identify at risk populations and help them to get medical interventions. The program also actively collaborates with the regional coalition program and the Samaritans in taking care of the elderly, and supports the elderly in feeling worthwhile after retirement by helping them to work for communities as volunteers. For its part, the Seoul suicide prevention program puts more emphasis on "life respect culture" and "emotional support to high risk individuals by regular visiting". The annual budget of the Seoul suicide prevention program is one-quarter and that for mental health is about one-twentieth that of MA. Considering the high suicide rate and lower mental health service usage in Seoul, it is crucial to raise awareness of depression and decrease the stigma on mental illnesses. Furthermore, educational efforts with long-term investment in research on suicide are necessary.

AB Background: No one knows whether the temporality of nonfatal deliberate self-harm in the United States mirrors the temporality of suicide deaths. Aims: To analyze day-and month-specific variation in population rates for suicide fatalities and, separately, for hospital admissions for nonfatal deliberate self-harm. Methods: For 12 states, we extracted vital statistics data on all suicides (n = 11,429) and hospital discharge data on all nonfatal deliberate self-harm admissions (n = 60,870) occurring in 1997. We used multinomial logistic regression to analyze the significance of day-to-day and month-to-month variations in the occurrence of suicides and nonfatal deliberate self-harm admissions. Results: Both fatal and nonfatal events had a 6%-10% excess occurrence on Monday and Tuesday and were 5%-13% less likely to occur on Saturdays (p < .05). Males were more likely than females to act on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Nonfatal admission rates were 6% above the average in April and May (p < .05). In contrast, suicide rates were 6% above the average in February and March and 8% below it in November (p < .05). Conclusions: Suicides and nonfatal hospital admissions for deliberate self-harm have peaks and troughs on the same days in the United States. In contrast, the monthly patterns for these fatal and nonfatal events are not congruent.

TI Causing someone else to commit suicide: Incitement or manslaughter?
SO ALTERNATIVE LAW JOURNAL

DT Article
DE Criminal law; manslaughter; suicide; criminal liability; causation; free
   will
AB For more than half a century, Australian states and territories have criminalised the distinct offence of inciting another person to commit suicide. The maximum penalties for these offences vary and require the accused to have intended that the victim would commit suicide. In contrast, the offence of involuntary manslaughter does not require such an intention. Instead, a charge of manslaughter requires that the accused acted in a conscious and voluntary way that caused the victim's death, and that their conduct was either criminally negligent or unlawful and dangerous. Drawing on cases from the United States and United Kingdom, this article suggests that in appropriate circumstances in Australia, especially in the context of family violence, offenders should be held criminally liable for manslaughter if they cause another person to commit suicide.

AB Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents in the United States. Imitation plays an important role in adolescent suicides. Identification theory suggests that media coverage of adolescent suicides can increase imitation suicides among adolescents. The present study examines this possibility using data collected from South Korea. It also explores the relationship between media coverage of celebrity suicides and suicide rates among adolescents. We found that adolescent suicides increase after media coverage of either an adolescent's suicide or a domestic celebrity's suicide.

ID NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE; SOCIAL ECOLOGY; EDUCATIONAL-ATTAINMENT; REGIONAL

AB Previous findings pertaining to the direction (positive or negative) of the ecological correlation between intelligence and suicide rates in the USA have been conflicting. Using novel state IQ estimates, derived from the Scholastic Assessment Test, the American College Test, these tests combined, or the National Assessment of Educational Progress state scores, these estimates were not consistently associated to state suicide rates. Whereas ACT-derived state IQ was significantly positively correlated with suicide rates, the correlation with composite ACT-SAT-derived state IQ was significantly negative and with both SAT-derived and NAEP-derived state IQ also negative but not significant. Validity checks pointed to possible methodological problems with the state IQ estimates. Currently available estimates of state IQ, therefore, seem not appropriate to resolve the question of the direction of the ecological correlation of intelligence and suicide mortality across the USA.

AB Background: Recently, suicide in the United States has begun to be viewed as a preventable public health issue. This has led to the creation of a National Violent Death Reporting System that collects and integrates data on the social circumstances surrounding suicides. Aims: The study examines data on social circumstances surrounding suicides as collected by the medical examiner report (ME) and police report (PR) and subsequently integrated into the state of Maryland's violent death reporting system. Methods: Reported data on social circumstances surrounding suicides occurring in the years 2003-2006 in Maryland (n = 1,476) were analyzed by examining their prevalence in the ME and PR, strength of association, and integration. Results: With the exception of three circumstances, there was variation among reported circumstances in the ME and PR. Furthermore, there was only a moderately strong relationship between the ME and PR for most circumstances, while a significant increase occurred in the prevalence of these circumstances when ME and PR were integrated. Conclusions: The integration of ME and PR has the potential to increase our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding suicide and to better inform prevention efforts. However, before this potential can be reached, there are still issues that must be considered.

AB This study investigated whether state levels of social capital are associated with rates of completed suicides in the fifty U.S. states. To do this we regressed state-level suicide rates on an index of social capital, along with other variables known to influence suicide rates such as gun ownership, income inequality, alcohol abuse and dependence, drug abuse and dependence, serious mental illness, unemployment, percent of population living in urban areas, poverty, population instability, and living in a "suicide belt" state. Suicide rates were aggregated from 1999 to 2002, and examined separately by sex and different race/ethnic groups. The results showed that White men and women in states with higher levels of social capital had significantly lower rates of suicide when controlling for the other influential variables. When we examined sub-dimensions of social capital, we found that community organizations (for White women) and group membership (for White men) were particularly strongly associated with lower suicide risk.

   METAANALYSIS; LONGITUDE; LATITUDE
AB There is now convergent evidence from classic quantitative genetics (family, twin, and adoption studies) and molecular genetic studies for specific genetic risk factors for suicidal behavior. This emerging research field has recently been supplemented by geographical studies concerned with the Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis (FUSH), which states that population differences in genetic risk factors may partially account for conspicuous geographical patterns seen in suicide prevalence. In particular, the European high-suicide-rate nations constitute a contiguous, J-shaped belt, spanning from Finland to Austria. This area maps onto the second principal component identified for European gene distribution, most likely reflecting a major migration event of the past (i.e., the ancestral adaptation to cold climates and the Uralic language dispersion) still detectable in modern European populations. The present research tested the hypothesis in the United States. Consistent with the hypothesis, available historical (1913-1924 and 1928-1932) U.S. state suicide rates were uniformly positively associated with available state proportions of reported American ancestries from European high-suicide-rate countries (Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, and the Ukraine). However, contrary to the hypothesis, available contemporary (1990-1994) suicide rates were uniformly negatively associated with these ancestry proportions. The findings of this first test outside Europe are therefore conflicting. A proposal based on the geographical study approach is offered to further the progress of investigations into the genetics of suicide.

ID SEXUAL ORIENTATION; RISK; YOUTH; BEHAVIOR; STATES; RATES
AB Suicide is a major public health problem in the United States. Suicide and attempted suicide are important causes of morbidity and mortality in adolescents. Epidemiologic trends in adolescent suicide point to increasing rates of suicide and increasing access to lethal attempts, particularly firearms. It is important for clinicians to recognize risk factors for suicide, but it is even more important to screen all adolescents for suicidal thoughts and feelings. This article highlights important publications from the past year (April 2000 to April 2001) regarding adolescent suicidal behavior, with particular focus on risk factors, recognition, and management.

AB Background: The Mountain West region of the United States consistently reports the highest rates of suicide in the country. This pattern could reflect a regional culture-of-suicide script in support of suicide that implicitly influences individual's behavior. Aims: The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether suicide rates are elevated in the Mountain West across a wide range of demographic groups, thereby supporting a regional cultural script. Method: Suicide rates in the Mountain West between 1999 and 2014 were compared to the rest of the country across a wide range of demographic categories and levels of population density using the Center for Disease Control Multiple Causes of Death dataset published on the WONDER online database. Results: Suicide rates are elevated in the Mountain West for men and women, all racial groups, all age groups, and at every level of population density compared to the rest of the country. Limitations: Missing and suppressed data, the use of coroner reports, and the arbitrary nature of state and regional boundaries are all discussed as possible limitations to this study. Conclusion: These findings support a broad culture-of-suicide script that is pervasive in this region across demographic groups and all levels of population density.

In the present study, state rates of suicidal ideation and attempted suicide were not found to be associated with any state scores for the Big Five personality traits, suggesting that lethal and non-lethal suicidal behavior may have different ecological correlates.

DE alcohol; Canada; suicide; time-series analyses
ID UNITED-STATES; CONSUMPTION; MORTALITY; RATES
AB Studies suggest that the population level link between alcohol and suicide differs across countries and between men and women. The aim of this paper was to estimate the relationship between alcohol consumption and suicide in Canada and to put the results in a comparative perspective. The relationship was elucidated for whole Canada, different provinces and also separately for men and women. The total suicide rate in Canada increased signicantly by around 4% as alcohol consumption increased by one litre per capita, suggesting that approximately 25 - 30% of Canadian suicides were related to alcohol. The relationship was stronger for women than for men. A signicant effect was found in all provinces except from Quebec, but the overall regional variation was not statistically signicant. In an international perspective, the relationship for women was somewhat weaker than in Sweden and Norway, but larger than in Finland, the United States and Southern European countries. For men, the association was similar to what is found in the United States and Finland, weaker than in Sweden, Norway and Russia but stronger than in Southern European countries. The results only partly support the idea that intoxication frequency explains national differences in this relationship. Possible explanations for the stronger association among women are also discussed.

TI Relationship between altitude and lithium in groundwater in the United

AB Therapeutic dosages of lithium are known to reduce suicide rates, which has led to investigations of confounding environmental risk factors for suicide such as lithium in groundwater. It has been speculated that this might play a role in the potential relationship between suicide and altitude. A recent study in Austria involving geospatial analysis of lithium in groundwater and suicide found lower levels of lithium at higher altitudes. Since there is no reason to suspect this correlation is universal given variation in geology, the current study set out to investigate the relationship between altitude and lithium in groundwater in the United States of America (USA). The study utilised data extracted from the National Water-Quality Assessment programme implemented by the United States Geological Survey that has collected 5,183 samples from 48 study areas in USA for the period of 1992 to 2003. Lithium was the trace-element of interest and 518 samples were used in the current analyses. Due to uneven lithium sampling within the country, only the states (n = 15) with the highest number of lithium samples were included. Federal information processing standard codes were used to match data by county with the mean county altitude calculated using altitude data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. The study was controlled for potential confounding factors known to affect levels of lithium in groundwater including aquifer, aquifer type, lithology, water level and the depths of wells. The levels of lithium in groundwater, increased with altitude (R-2 = 0.226, P < 0.001) during the study period. These findings differ from the Austrian study and suggest a need for further research accounting also for the impact of geographical variation.

AB This note examines the purported impact of conventional socioeconomic and social environment factors on annual, state-level suicide rates. Results from an inductive fixed-effects (covariance) analysis, of state-level time-series/cross-section data for the period 1985-95, do little to support Durkheim's social causes hypothesis that aggregate socioeconomic factors matter in explaining state suicide rates. A possible source of heterogeneity-aggregation bias is identified raising questions surrounding past inferences made in aggregate suicide research. The data and empirical method support a mounting sentiment of an abiding ecological fallacy in the suicide literature. Implications of this investigation call for a shift in research focus and method to a smaller unit of analysis (for example, individual-level, controlling for key social processes).

AB Background/Purpose: Few studies have compared methods of suicide used by women in different countries. This study compared methods used by women in South Korea, Taiwan, Sweden and the United States.
   Methods: Age- and method-specific suicide rates for women in the four countries in 2002 were calculated and compared. Hanging, firearms and jumping from a height were classified as violent suicide methods. Poisoning suicides were further classified according to use of drugs, gases, pesticides and other agents.
   Results: Half of Taiwanese and American women used violent methods, while only one third of women in South Korea and Sweden used such methods. Poisoning was the most often used suicide method by women in all four countries. About 90% of American and Swedish women used drugs. In contrast, almost half of women from Korea and Taiwan used pesticides.
   Conclusion: Different countries contrast greatly in the agents used in suicide by poisoning but not in patterns of violent methods used. [J Formos Med Assoc 2009;108(6):452-459]

AB Suicide mortality varies widely across age, sex, race, and geography, far more than does mortality from the leading causes of natural death. Unlike the tight correlation between cancer mortality and the incidence of cancer, suicide mortality is only modestly correlated with the incidence of suicidal acts and other established risk factors for suicidal behavior, such as major psychiatric disorders. An implication of this modest correlation is that the proportion of all suicidal acts that prove fatal (the case fatality ratio) must account for a substantial portion of the (nonrandom) variation observed in suicide mortality. In the United States, the case fatality ratio is strongly related to the availability of household firearms. Findings from ecologic and individual-level studies conducted over the past two decades illustrate the importance of accounting for the availability of highly lethal suicide methods in efforts to understand (and ultimately reduce) disparities in suicide mortality across populations.

Data elements included the most common method of suicide (firearms), most common behavioral health diagnoses (substance abuse/dependence), common life stressors (failed intimate-partner relationships), and an individual's history of operational deployment. Age- and sex-adjusted rates for the Services were compared with rates for the U.S. adult population. Results showed that the current reporting period (2015) is similar to patterns that have been observed over the preceding years and to patterns reported in the overall U.S. adult population. Suicide rates remain elevated but stable for both the Active and Reserve Components of the Military Services compared to historical levels observed prior to 2003. Finally, we discuss common errors and misinterpretations that can occur when analyzing surveillance data.

AB Correctional institutions in the United States witness higher rates of suicide compared with the general population, as well as a higher number of attempted suicides compared with completed cases. Prison research focused little attention on investigating the combined effects of inmate characteristics and prison context on suicide, with studies using only one level of analysis (prison or prisoner) and neglecting the nested nature of inmates in prisons. To extend this literature, multilevel modeling techniques were employed to investigate individual- and prison-contextual predictive patterns of attempted suicide using a nationally representative sample of 18,185 inmates in 326 prisons across the United States. Results revealed that several individual-level factors predicted odds for attempted suicide, such as inmate characteristics/demographics, prison experiences, having a serious mental illness, and symptoms of mental health issues. Some prison-contextual variables, as well as cross-level interaction effects, also significantly predicted odds for attempted suicide. Policy and research implications are discussed.

   HISPANIC HEALTH; PUERTO-RICANS; PREVALENCE; TRENDS; COMORBIDITY;

AB Objective: Suicide rates differ between ethnic groups in the United States. Since suicide is commonly associated with a mood disorder, the authors compared suicide rates relative to depression rates in five ethnic groups in the United States.
   Method: Rates of major depression were generated from the Epidemiologic Catchment Area study and the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Epidemiologic Survey. Sociodemographic effects were determined by examining depression rates for respondents who were separated or divorced, earning low incomes, or not working for pay. The survey data were analyzed with age and sex standardization to generate 1-year prevalence rates of major depression. The depression rates of the different ethnic groups were compared and were examined in relation to suicide rates.
   Results: The 1-year prevalence rates of major depression were 3.6% for whites, 3.5% for blacks, 2.8% for Mexican Americans, 2.5% for Cuban Americans, and 6.9% for Puerto Ricans. Compared to the rate for whites, the rate of depression was significantly higher in Puerto Ricans and significantly lower in Mexican Americans. Relative to the depression rates, the annual suicide rates were higher for males than for females. Mexican American and Puerto Rican males had lower relative suicide rates than white males.
   Conclusions: Identifying reasons for differences in suicide rates relative to depression among ethnic groups and between males and females may suggest interventions to reduce suicide rates. Some possibilities are that depression differs in form or severity or that unidentified factors protect against suicide in different subgroups.

AB Research has shown how honor cultures promote aggression against others (e.g., homicide) and the self (e.g., suicide). Two studies examine the connection between honor and a predilection for guns in the commission of suicide. Study 1 shows that Whites living in honor states are especially likely to use guns to commit suicide, controlling for gun accessibility. Study 2 reveals that a "gun access gap" in honor states-a positive difference between the proportion of all suicides that involve a gun and the gun ownership rate-predicts outcomes linked previously to honor cultures: homicides and accidental deaths.

ID CORRECTIONAL SUICIDE; UNITED-STATES; PREVENTION; IDEATION; PRISON; RISK
AB Custodial suicide is a foundational concern for correctional systems. The incarcerated population is at an increased risk for suicide as compared with people living in the community. Sufficient suicide prevention is a critical component of a constitutionally adequate system of correctional mental health care. The remedial phases of class action litigations have animated improvement in suicide prevention in many correctional systems across the United States. In the current climate, many legal obstacles make it more difficult for plaintiffs to prevail in such cases, but it is expected that advocates will find novel approaches in response to these legal hurdles, such as greater reliance on state law remedies, and will seek to expand the scope of potential actions in emerging areas such as immigration detention. Defendants and courts will, in turn, need to respond to these changes. This article explores the history of relevant litigations, and the legal obstacles currently faced by plaintiffs, as well as future directions the authors consider will likely be taken. Practical issues such as appropriate measurement of improvement in the area of suicide prevention are also explored.

ID SUICIDE; RISK; PREVALENCE; MEDICATION; TRENDS; ASSOCIATION; ADOLESCENTS
AB A series of drug innovations that began in 1987, including the introduction of several selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), has led to a tremendous growth in the use of antidepressants in the United States. This growth, however, has been accompanied by a growing concern about the risks of prescribing antidepressants, particularly to children. Indeed, research linking the use of antidepressant drugs to an increased risk of suicidal behaviors in youth motivated the US Food and Drug Administration to direct antidepressant drug manufacturers to include warning labels about the potential dangers. This paper examines the relationship between antidepressants and suicide among youth in the USA. Using state-level data on youth suicides and age-specific prescriptions for antidepressants, we find no relationships between suicides for adolescents aged 15-19 and prescriptions for SSRIs/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors or tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants. In contrast, we find that newer generation antidepressants are associated with lower numbers of suicides for this age group. For younger children aged 10-14, we find no relationship with suicides for any type of antidepressant. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reviews the sentences dictated between 1993 and 2002 by the Supreme Courts of Canada and the Unites States, the House of Lords and Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the European Human Rights Court, about the validity of the legal prohibition of assistance for suicide. These sentences constituted a judicial consensus about the right to die. This consensus recognized the legal right of patients to reject medical treatments but did not recognize the right to be assisted by a physician to commit suicide. This exclusion is changing in the recent case law of Canada and the United Kingdom, which accepts the fundamental right of terminal patients to medically assisted suicide.

   HOMICIDE; RATES; DEATH
AB To determine the extent of misclassification of suicides with regard to work-relatedness and the implication for intervention, a matched case-control design was used. Cases were identified from California's master mortality file using ICD 9-CM external cause codes E950-959 and a positive response to the "injury-at-work" designation on the death certificate. Two controls matched on the same external cause of death codes, age, date of death, and county of occurrence were randomly selected. Outcome measures were odds ratios and accuracy assessments. Over 11 % of cases and 23 %, of controls were misclassified. Extrapolation to the United States suggests thousands of suicides are misclassified as to a work-related connection. The - findings point to misappropriation of the work-relatedness of suicide and hence, an inaccurate understanding of underlying risk factors and their intervention potential.

TI Mortality, or probability of death, from a suicidal act in the United

SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
AB The probability of death resulting from a suicidal act as a function of age is explored. Until recently, data on suicide attempts in the United States were not available, and therefore the relationship between attempts and completed suicide could not be systematically investigated. Now, with new surveillance of self-harm data from the Centers for Disease Control, our examination found that (1) the mortality among self-harmers fits an exponential function of age and (2) the logarithmic difference between female and male suicidal mortality increases in direct proportion to age from puberty to menopause. The mortality exponential function of age is a description that provides a life-span perspective of suicide and suggests data-informed criteria for future suicide and public health research.

AB Few empirical studies have focused on the associations among suicide proneness, hopelessness, and depression cross-culturally. The current study examined the potential to determine differences in the overall expression of suicide proneness between Japanese (n = 396) as compared with U.S. (n = 417) college students. Depressive symptoms were considered as a potential mediator of the relation between hopelessness and suicide proneness in both samples of students. Preliminary analyses focused on estimates of internal consistency reliability and differential item functioning (DIF) on the measures of hopelessness, depressive symptoms, and suicide proneness. Results of the primary analyses revealed that Japanese students reported more suicide proneness, greater hopelessness, and higher levels of depressive symptoms than did U.S. students. As expected, hopelessness and depressive symptoms were significantly associated with suicide proneness in both cultures. Additionally, the hopelessness-suicide proneness link was significantly mediated by depressive symptoms in both samples. Implications are offered for improved identification and treatment of college students at risk of suicidal behaviors both in the United States and in Japan.

AB This study adds to the existing research concerning ecological relationships between suicide rates, social interaction, and urbanicity in the United States. Age-sex-race adjusted five-year averaged suicide rates for 1993-1997 and various measures of urbanicity are used. Some proposed relationships held true, while others indicate that social integration and urbanicity are so intertwined in their effects on suicide that no clear, unidirectional pattern emerges. The religious affiliation measure captured unique variations in the role religion plays in this relationship, depending on how urbanicity was measured. Findings suggest closer attention needs to be paid to how both urbanicity and religious affiliation are measured. Overall, vast regional variation exists in suicide rates and the role of urbanization can be misunderstood if not properly specified.

ID RATES; RELIGION; DECOMPOSITION; ACCEPTABILITY; ASSOCIATION; CULTURE
AB Objectives This study examines individual characteristics associated with suicide acceptability in the United States and how (1) effects of these characteristics on attitudes have changed over time and (2) the degree to which shifts in attitudes are explained by changes in population characteristics. Methods We use General Social Survey (GSS) data from the 1980s (n = 4,840) and 2010s (n = 5,607) and conduct an Oaxaca decomposition. Results Although Americans remain largely unaccepting of suicide, except in the case of incurable disease, a greater percentage found suicide to be acceptable in 2010s than in 1980s. Individuals who are male, white, more educated, less religious, and more politically liberal find suicide more acceptable. Changes over time in population composition (e.g., rising education levels and declines in religion) account for about 50 percent of the rise in suicide acceptability between 1980s and 2010s. Conclusions Results hint at shifting societal patterns, but the causal direction between attitudes and behavior cannot be determined.

AB In the United States, suicide rates consistently vary among geographic regions; the western states have significantly higher suicide rates than the eastern states. The reason for this variation is unknown but may be due to regional elevation differences. States' suicide rates (1990-1994), when adjusted for potentially confounding demographic variables, are positively correlated with their peak and capital elevations. These findings indicate that decreased oxygen saturation at high altitude may exacerbate the bioenergetic dysfunction associated with affective illnesses. Should such a link exist, therapies traditionally used to treat the metabolic disturbances associated with altitude sickness may have a role in treating those at risk for suicide.

AB Suicide is a critical public health problem worldwide. In the United States ( US), firearm ownership is common, and firearms account for the majority of deaths by suicide. While suicide prevention strategies may include limiting access to firearms, the contentious nature of gun regulations in the US, particularly among members of rural communities, often gives rise to constitutional concerns and political polarization that could inhibit suicidal persons from seeking the help they need. We examine potential outcomes of public health strategies in the US that encourage limiting access to firearms for populations who both value firearm ownership and are vulnerable to suicide. Based on preliminary results from a firearm safety study, we argue that attempts to limit access to firearms among those at risk of suicide will only succeed when the most affected cultural groups are engaged in collaborative discussions.

AB Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of nonreceipt of specialty psychiatric treatment among those who experienced suicidal thoughts or who attempted suicide. Methods: Data were from the 2008-2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health and included responses from adults 18 years and older who answered mental health and suicide-related questions (N=75,690). Results: Overall, 3.7% of the respondents experienced suicidal thoughts and .5% attempted suicide. Lack of psychiatric treatment was common among these individuals. Men, 18- to 25-year-olds, persons without insurance, and racial-ethnic groups other than white non-Hispanics were least likely to receive treatment. Conclusions: Prevention and treatment efforts have targeted seekers of specialty treatment at high risk of suicide, but fewer interventions have focused on individuals with suicidal thoughts or attempters who do not seek treatment. More targeted prevention strategies are needed to mitigate suicide in the United States.

AB This study investigated Asian Pacific Islander Americans' (APIAs) and White Americans' use of three common suicide methods-firearm, poisoning, and hanging-using data from the National Violent Death Reporting System in the United States. Overall, hanging was the most common suicide method among APIAs, whereas firearm suicides were most prevalent among White Americans. APIA suicide decedents died by firearms and poisoning at lower rates, but by hanging at a higher rate than White Americans, after controlling for the effects of gender and age. Several gender by race moderation effects demonstrated that these racial differences in suicide methods were stronger among women than among men. In parallel with the findings on racial differences, APIA immigrants had a lower rate of firearm suicide but a higher rate of suicide by hanging than their U.S.-born counterparts. A gender by nativity moderation effect showed that among APIA men, immigrant decedents had a greater likelihood of using hanging as a suicide method than U.S.-born decedents, whereas among APIA women, there were no differences between immigrant and U.S.-born decedents in their likelihood of suicide by hanging. The researchers also uncovered several age by race and age by nativity moderation effects. These findings underscore the value of attending to within-group diversity in APIAs' suicide methods.

AB Objective: We tested the hypothesis that suicide rates in the United States are associated with indicators of access to health care services.
   Method: With an ecological study design, we compared age-adjusted suicide rates for men and women with demographic, socioeconomic, and other indices of access to health care, by state (N = 51, including the District of Columbia). The most recently available information from the National Statistics Reports at the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Center for Health Statistics, and the American Board of Medical Specialties was used. Data on suicide are from 2001; other measures were matched for the closest available year, except that state-based data on psychiatrists and physicians are from 2004.
   Results: Positive bivariate associations with state suicide rates (all p <= .005) are ranked as follows: mate sex, Native American ethnicity, and higher proportion of uninsured residents. Negative bivariate associations (all p <= .002) are ranked as follows: higher population density, higher annual per capita income, higher population density of psychiatrists, higher population density of physicians, higher federal aid for mental health, and higher proportion of African Americans. All factors were associated with state suicide rates in expected directions. In multivariate models of associations between suicide rates and indices of access to health care, the state rate of federal aid for mental health was the strongest indicator, followed by the rate of uninsured persons and population density of psychiatrists and physicians and by population density.
   Discussion: Such aggregate analyses cannot specify risk indices for individual persons. Nevertheless, the methods employed detected several factors with well-established associations with suicide. They also yielded strong correlations of state-based suicide rates with proposed indicators of access to health care. The findings support the view that clinical intervention is a crucial element in the prevention of suicide.

AB A negative correlation between societal suicide rates and social integration has been reported, but rarely specifically examined for suicide rates of the elderly although suicide rates of elderly persons are among the highest. The associations of suicide rates of elderly persons and fertility rates for 81 countries were examined using data from the World Health Organisation and United Nations. Fertility rates were considered a proxy measure for social integration. Multiple regression analysis indicated that suicide rates for males and females in the age bands 65-74 years and 75+ years were independently (negative) correlated with fertility rates. Fertility rates, as a measure of social integration, may interact with, modify and mediate the effect of cultural factors on suicide rates of elderly persons.

TI Suicide Trends Among Elementary School-Aged Children in the United

AB IMPORTANCE Suicide is a leading cause of death among school-aged children younger than 12 years but little is known about the epidemiology of suicide in this age group.
   OBJECTIVE To describe trends in suicide among US children younger than 12 years by sociodemographic group and method of death.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Period trend analysis of national mortality data on suicide in children aged 5 to 11 years in the United States from January 1, 1993, to December 31, 2012. Data were analyzed per 5-year periods, between 1993 to 1997 and 2008 to 2012.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Number of suicide deaths and crude suicide rates. Period trends in rates of suicide were estimated using negative binomial regression incidence rate ratios (IRRs).
   RESULTS The overall suicide rate among children aged 5 toll years remained stable between 1(-393 to 1997 and 2008 to 2012 (from 1.18 to 1.09 per lmillion; IRR = 0.96; 95% Cl, 0.90-1.03). However, the suicide rate increased significantly in black children (from 1.36 to 2.54 per 1 million; IRR = 1.27; 95% Cl, 1.11-1.45) and decreased in white children (from 1.14 to 0.77 per 1 million; IRR = 0.86; 95% Cl. 0.79-0.94). The overall firearm suicide rate (IRR = 0.69; 95% Cl. 0.57-0.85) and firearm suicide rate among white boys (IRR = 0.72; 95% Cl, 0.59-0.88) decreased significantly during the study. The rate of suicide by hanging/suffocation increased significantly in black boys (IRR = 1.35; 95% Cl, 1.14-1.61), although the overall change in suicide rates by hanging/suffocation or other suicide methods did not change during the study.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The stable overall suicide rate in school-aged children in the United States during 20 years of study obscured a significant increase in suicide incidence in black children and a significant decrease in suicide incidence among white children. Findings highlight a potential racial disparity that warrants attention. Further studies are needed to monitor these emerging trends and identify risk, protective, and precipitating factors relevant to suicide prevention efforts in children younger than 12 years.

AB Suicide continues to be a significant public health problem in the United States and the Department of Defense (DoD). Timely and systematic postvention efforts can play an instrumental role in helping family members, peers, and military command to best manage the aftermath of a suicide. To date, several postvention efforts have been implemented in the military. However, there continues to be an overall lack of understanding of the specific short- and long-term effects of exposure to military suicide. In addition, more emphasis needs to be placed on empirically driven approaches to postvention and program evaluation. The purpose of this article is threefold: (1) to provide a summary of the postvention literature with special emphasis placed on the military organization; (2) to propose a conceptual model as a framework for understanding Military-Unit Suicide Survivorship; and (3) to briefly highlight postvention strategies within the DoD in the context of a number of research, clinical, and policy recommendations.

TI Is COPD associated with suicide behavior?
SO JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Suicide; Epidemiology; COPD; Respiratory disease
ID COMORBIDITY; RISK
AB Background: The goal of this study is to examine the relationship between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and suicidal ideation and suicide attempt among adults in the United States.
   Methods: Data were drawn from the National Comorbidity Study-Replication (NCS-R), a household probability sample of adults ages 18 and older in the United States.
   Results: COPD is associated with significantly increased odds of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, compared with those without COPD. The association between COPD and suicide attempt remained statistically significant after adjusting for demographics, depression, panic disorder, substance use and nicotine dependence. The association between COPD and suicidal ideation was no longer significant after adjusting for nicotine dependence.
   Conclusions: Our findings provide initial evidence that there is a relationship between COPD and suicidal behavior among adults in the community. Future studies that can examine the relationship between COPD and completed suicide, as well as replication of these results, would improve our understanding of whether and to what degree COPD confers an increased vulnerability for suicide behavior.

AB The goal of this study is to provide, for the United States, estimates for gun-owning and non-owning households in terms of firearm and non-firearm suicides and suicide attempts. To make these ballpark estimates I combine a half-dozen known "facts" about suicide (e.g., households with firearms are at approximately 3x the risk of suicide as households without firearms). Among the six major conclusions are that about 90% of firearm suicides occur among members of gun-owning households, that 75% of suicides among gun-owning families are firearm suicides, but only 20% of suicide attempts among these families are with firearms. This study not only provides estimates of suicides and suicide attempts by gun-owning and non-owning households, but the reasonableness of the estimates provides support for the reasonableness of the half-dozen known "facts" about firearms and suicide.

AB Despite over a century of research examining the macro-level link between religion and suicide, only recently has research examined this important relationship for Latinos within the United States. Such research has grown more essential in light of the growing geographic diversification of Latinos in the United States over the past two decades with increasing settlement beyond traditional Latino communities and into "new destinations." Therefore, our aim was to answer two key questions: (1) What is the impact of the religious context on Latino suicide across emerging and traditional points of settlement? and (2) Are religious contextual characteristics associated with Latino suicide differently for native- or foreign-born Latinos in each of these types of communities? Our results suggest that (1) religion has no impact on Latino suicide in traditional destinations, (2) only Catholicism negatively impacts foreign-born Latino suicide in new destinations, and (3) native-born Latinos' suicide is negatively impacted by Catholicism, mainline Protestantism, and evangelical Protestantism. We discuss the implications of these findings.

AB Despite advances in theory and the development and implementation of evidence-based treatments, the United States suicide rate has been rising continuously for over a decade. Although this does not indicate that traditional treatment approaches should be abandoned, it does highlight the need to supplement such approaches with alternatives. One seemingly highly valuable option is means safety, defined as the reduced access to and/or increased safe storage of potentially lethal methods for suicide. This paper provides a review of the current literature on the prevalence of six methods for suicide and preventative efforts aimed to reduce suicide rates. The majority of means safety interventions seem promising given that these methods are common and highly lethal. However, cultural and practical barriers will need to be taken into consideration when implementing these plans. Overall, means safety efforts and preventative measures seem to be promising ways to reduce the national suicide rate if implemented.

AB Youth suicide remains a significant public health problem in the United States. In 2004, the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act provided states and tribes with funding to implement and evaluate youth suicide prevention programs. The Tennessee Lives Count project was developed through a collaborative model at the state level and delivers an enhanced version of the Question, Persuade, Refer gatekeeper training program to individuals working with youth across the state. This article describes the development of the project and preliminary outcomes of 416 participants in child welfare, juvenile justice, health, and education systems at pretest, postiest, and 6-month follow-up. The findings suggest the training has an immediate and long-term impact on perceived knowledge of suicide prevention, self-efficacy, and attitudes about the inevitability of suicide. Policy and practice implications are presented.

AB The national cost of suicides and suicide attempts in the United States in 2013 was $58.4 billion based on reported numbers alone. Lost productivity (termed indirect costs) represents most (97.1%) of this cost. Adjustment for under-reporting increased the total cost to $93.5 billion or $298 per capita, 2.1-2.8 times that of previous studies. Previous research suggests that improved continuity of care would likely reduce the number of subsequent suicidal attempts following a previous nonfatal attempt. We estimate a highly favorable benefit-cost ratio of 6 to 1 for investments in additional medical, counseling, and linkage services for such patients.

TI A systematic review of suicide prevention interventions targeting
   indigenous peoples in Australia, United States, Canada and New Zealand
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Review
ID ALASKA NATIVE COMMUNITIES; ALCOHOL; BEHAVIOR; PROGRAM; DISEASE; INJURY
AB Background: Indigenous peoples of Australia, Canada, United States and New Zealand experience disproportionately high rates of suicide. As such, the methodological quality of evaluations of suicide prevention interventions targeting these Indigenous populations should be rigorously examined, in order to determine the extent to which they are effective for reducing rates of Indigenous suicide and suicidal behaviours. This systematic review aims to: 1) identify published evaluations of suicide prevention interventions targeting Indigenous peoples in Australia, Canada, United States and New Zealand; 2) critique their methodological quality; and 3) describe their main characteristics.
   Methods: A systematic search of 17 electronic databases and 13 websites for the period 1981-2012 (inclusive) was undertaken. The reference lists of reviews of suicide prevention interventions were hand-searched for additional relevant studies not identified by the electronic and web search. The methodological quality of evaluations of suicide prevention interventions was assessed using a standardised assessment tool.
   Results: Nine evaluations of suicide prevention interventions were identified: five targeting Native Americans; three targeting Aboriginal Australians; and one First Nation Canadians. The main intervention strategies employed included: Community Prevention, Gatekeeper Training, and Education. Only three of the nine evaluations measured changes in rates of suicide or suicidal behaviour, all of which reported significant improvements. The methodological quality of evaluations was variable. Particular problems included weak study designs, reliance on self-report measures, highly variable consent and follow-up rates, and the absence of economic or cost analyses.
   Conclusions: There is an urgent need for an increase in the number of evaluations of preventive interventions targeting reductions in Indigenous suicide using methodologically rigorous study designs across geographically and culturally diverse Indigenous populations. Combining and tailoring best evidence and culturally-specific individual strategies into one coherent suicide prevention program for delivery to whole Indigenous communities and/or population groups at high risk of suicide offers considerable promise.

AB Multiple measures of sexual minority status are necessary to accurately describe the diversity of attractions, identities, and behaviors in sexual minority populations. We investigated whether four measures of sexual minority status (sexual minority attraction, sexual minority identity, sexual minority lifetime behavior, and sexual minority recent 12-month behavior) were associated with suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts among young adults ages 24 to 34 in the United States. We analyzed data from Wave IV (2007-2008) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. We employed logistic regression models in the analysis. Multiple sexual minority status measures had significant associations with increased suicidal thoughts among women and men. Multiple sexual minority status measures had significant associations with increased suicide attempts among women, but not among men. Diverse sexual minority populations are at increased risk for suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts. Multiple measures of sexual minority status should be utilized in future studies of sexual minority status and suicide risk. Suicide prevention programs should ensure intervention is available across diverse sexual minority populations.

AB Introduction: Determining whether the prevalence of gun ownership is associated with youth suicide is critical to inform policy to address this problem. The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between the prevalence of household gun ownership in a state and that state's rate of youth suicide.
   Methods: This study, conducted in 2018, involved a secondary analysis of state-level data for the U.S. using multivariable linear regression. The relationship between the prevalence of household gun ownership and youth (aged 10-19 years) suicide rates was examined in a time-lagged analysis of state-level household gun ownership in 2004 and youth suicide rates in the subsequent decade (2005-2015), while controlling for the prevalence of youth suicide attempts and other risk factors.
   Results: Household gun ownership was positively associated with the overall youth suicide rate. For each 10 percentage-point increase in household gun ownership, the youth suicide rate increased by 26.9% (95% CI=14.0%, 39.8%).
   Conclusions: Because states with high levels of household gun ownership are likely to experience higher youth suicide rates, these states should be especially concerned about implementing programs and policies to ameliorate this risk.

AB This research addresses the paradox that the crude and age-adjusted suicide rates of United States blacks are less than half those of whites despite similar risks. Upper and lower limits for true suicide rates are estimated to assess the potential for differential suicide misclassification by race. Construction of these two rate scenarios respectively incorporate one or all of the three cause-of-death categories identified in the literature as most prone to obscure suicides: injury of undetermined intent and unintentional poisonings and drownings. The data source is the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System, and the observation period is 1999-2002. We found that as in the official rates, the racial suicide gap persists within the lower and upper limit scenarios. However, there is marked shrinkage under the upper limit scenario. That scenario even generates rate crossovers for males ages 45-54 years and females ages 85 years and older. Suicide data appear relatively more deficient for black females than for black males. Racial data disparities are minimal for youth and young adults, and maximal for middle-aged males and the oldest and younger middle-aged females. Results strongly indicate greater susceptibility of medico-legal authorities to misclassify black suicides than white suicides. To demystify the racial suicide paradox, research is needed on medical histories and other biographical information that are accessible by the authorities in equivocal cases. To meet the standards of evidence-based medicine and public health, high-quality suicide data are an imperative for risk group delineation; risk factor identification; policy formulation; program planning, implementation, and evaluation; and ultimately, effective prevention.

   HOMICIDE; EFFICACY; HOME; AVAILABILITY; ASSOCIATION
AB On an average day in the USA more than 100 Americans die by suicide-half use firearms. Suicide rates overall and by firearms are higher, on average, in states where household firearm ownership is more common. In general this means in states where a greater proportion of the population lives in rural areas. The current ecological study focuses on the relation between measures of household firearm prevalence and suicide mortality in urban areas (metropolitan statistical areas and divisions) using survey-based measures of firearm ownership. Suicide rates (1999-2010) for metropolitan statistical areas that are comprised of large US cities come from death certificate records; rates of household firearm ownership come from the 2002 and 2004 Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System. Higher rates of firearm ownership are strongly associated with higher rates of overall suicide and firearm suicide, but not with non-firearm suicide. Stratification by gender, age and race did not materially affect the association between firearms and suicide. This study provides evidence consistent with previous case-control work and extends evidence from previous state-and region-level ecological studies that firearms in the home impose suicide risk above and beyond baseline.

AB Purpose: The aim was to assess the associations of antibullying U.S. state statutes that enumerate sexual orientation with exposure to bullying and other stressors and with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in sexual minority and non sexual minority youth. Methods: We analyzed data from the 2015 national school-based Youth Risk Behavior Survey, representative of 9th through 12th grade students attending public and private schools in the United States. We reviewed each state's antibullying statutes and classified them on enumeration. Results: Antibullying state laws that enumerate sexual orientation were associated with lower risk for suicide attempts and serious attempts requiring medical attention and lower risk for forced sexual intercourse. They were also associated with feeling safe at school or on the way to or from school. Results did not differ by sexual orientation. Conclusions: Enumeration of sexual orientation was associated with reduced stressors and suicide attempts, but it is insufficient to remove significant disparities based on sexual orientation. Additional policies and practices are required to address persistent sexual orientation disparities in exposure to bullying and suicidal behavior.

ID UNITED-STATES; MORTALITY; DRINKING; LEVEL; RISK; AGE
AB The aim of this paper was to estimate how suicide rates in the United States are affected by changes in per capita consumption during the postwar period. The analysis included Annual suicide rates and per capita alcohol consumption data (total and beverage specific) for the period 1950-2002. Gender- and age-specific models were estimated using the Box-Jenkins technique for time series analysis. No significant estimate was found for males. For females the total alcohol estimate (0.059) was significant at the 10% level whereas the spirits estimate was significant with an effect of 0.152. The results imply that a change in U.S. per capita consumption would result in a change in female suicide rates, whereas the male rates would not be affected.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test a strategy for quantifying incidence of nurse suicide using San Diego County data as a pilot for national investigation.
   BACKGROUND: Worldwide, 1 person dies by suicide every 40 seconds; more than 1 000 000 suicides occur yearly. Suicide rates for nurses in the United States have not been evaluated. This methodological article tested a strategy to identify incidence of nurse suicide compared with those of physicians and the general public.
   METHOD: Deidentified San Diego County Medical Examiner data from 2005 to 2015 were analyzed with a descriptive epidemiologic approach.
   RESULTS: Overall RN (18.51) and physician (40.72) incidences of suicide per 100 000 person-years were higher than the San Diego general population, excluding nurses (15.81) normalized to 100 000 person-years.
   CONCLUSIONS: Establishing incidence of nurse suicide is confounded by variation in reporting mechanisms plus incomplete availability of nurse gender data. Relatively small outcome numbers compared with the general population may underestimate results. Research using a larger sample is indicated. Nurse executives may decrease risk by proactively addressing workplace stressors.

AB Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death overall and the second leading cause of death for youth ages fifteen to twenty-four years old (Drapeau and McIntosh 2016). In 2015, 44,193 people died by suicide in the United States, and 5,900 of these deaths were youth between the ages of ten and twenty-four (Drapeau and McIntosh 2016). Each one of these deaths leaves behind a range of people who mourn the loss. Historically in the United States, the people left behind were referred to as suicide survivors, although recently the term has changed to suicide loss survivors. In this paper, we aim to describe research on suicide loss survivors, examine how many people are exposed to and affected by suicide, discuss the wide variety of people who are affected by suicide, and identify the ways in which suicide bereavement is unique. We then introduce the reader to the story of John Smith to illustrate the variety of children and adults who are exposed to a suicide in their family or community. The vignette examines the range of responses to suicide death and how responses vary not just on kinship but on the nature and perceptions of the relationship. Finally, the paper also includes clinical implications and considerations for clinicians working with those who have been affected by suicide death.

AB Background: Worldwide, the suicide rate is decreasing. To examine changes in the rates of completed suicide in the Mexican population from 2003 to 2012, we analyzed these changes according to: (i) the method of suicide; (ii) age group and (iii) gender. Methods: The data analyzed were obtained from governmental organizations from the State of Tabasco, Mexico. The data provided 1836 cases of subjects born and residing in Tabasco, who completed suicide in this state. Results: Suicide by hanging was a common choice of suicide method for Mexicans. The rate of suicide by hanging increased from 5.80 to 6.49 per 100,000 persons between 2003 and 2012, a rate percentage increase of 11.89%. Conclusions: Hanging was found to be the most common choice of suicide in the Mexican population, probably because the materials required are easily available and the method does not require complicated techniques, especially in the 55-64 age group. Strategies for prevention and intervention should be developed for the Mexican population considering suicide rates by age group and gender.

AB Objectives. This article examines the effect of election outcomes on suicide rates by combining the theory of social integration developed by Durkheim with the models of rational choice used in economics. Methods. Theory predicts that states with a greater percentage of residents who supported the losing candidate would tend to exhibit a relative increase in suicide rates. However, being around others who also supported the losing candidate may indicate a greater degree of social integration at the local level, thereby lowering relative suicide rates. We therefore use fixed-effects regression of state suicide rates from 1981 to 2005 on state election outcomes during presidential elections to determine which effect is stronger. Results. We find that the local effect of social integration is dominant. The suicide rate when a state supports the losing candidate will tend to be lower than if the state had supported the winning candidate-4.6 percent lower for males and 5.3 percent lower for females. Conclusion. Social integration works at many levels; it not only affects suicide risk directly, but can mediate other shocks that influence suicide risk.

AB IMPORTANCE The increasing legalization of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide worldwide makes it important to understand related attitudes and practices.
   OBJECTIVE To review the legal status of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide and the available data on attitudes and practices.
   EVIDENCE REVIEW Polling data and published surveys of the public and physicians, official state and country databases, interview studies with physicians, and death certificate studies (the Netherlands and Belgium) were reviewed for the period 1947 to 2016. FINDINGS Currently, euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide can be legally practiced in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Colombia, and Canada (Quebec since 2014, nationally as of June 2016). Physician-assisted suicide, excluding euthanasia, is legal in 5 US states (Oregon, Washington, Montana, Vermont, and California) and Switzerland. Public support for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in the United States has plateaued since the 1990s (range, 47%-69%). In Western Europe, an increasing and strong public support for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide has been reported; in Central and Eastern Europe, support is decreasing. In the United States, less than 20% of physicians report having received requests for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide, and 5% or less have complied. In Oregon and Washington state, less than 1% of licensed physicians write prescriptions for physician-assisted suicide per year. In the Netherlands and Belgium, about half or more of physicians reported ever having received a request; 60% of Dutch physicians have ever granted such requests. Between 0.3% to 4.6% of all deaths are reported as euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide in jurisdictions where they are legal. The frequency of these deaths increased after legalization. More than 70% of cases involved patients with cancer. Typical patients are older, white, and well-educated. Pain is mostly not reported as the primary motivation. A large portion of patients receiving physician-assisted suicide in Oregon and Washington reported being enrolled in hospice or palliative care, as did patients in Belgium. In no jurisdiction was there evidence that vulnerable patients have been receiving euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide at rates higher than those in the general population.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are increasingly being legalized, remain relatively rare, and primarily involve patients with cancer. Existing data do not indicate widespread abuse of these practices.

AB Homicide-suicide is the phenomenon in which an individual kills 1 or more people and commits suicide. Research on homicide-suicide has been hampered by a lack of an accepted classification scheme and reliance on media reports. Mass murder-suicide is gaining increasing attention particularly in the United States. This article reviews the research and literature on homicide-suicide, proposing a standard classification scheme. Preventive methods are discussed and sociocultural factors explored. For a more accurate and complete understanding of homicide-suicide, it is argued that future research should use the full psychological autopsy approach, to include collateral interviews.

AB In this ecological study, we attempt to quantify the extent to which differences in homicide and suicide death rates between three countries, and among states/provinces within those countries, may be explained by differences in their social, economic, and structural characteristics. We examine the relationship between state/province level measures of societal risk factors and state/province level rates of violent death (homicide and suicide) across Australia, Canada, and the United States. Census and mortality data from each of these three countries were used. Rates of societal level characteristics were assessed and included residential instability, self-employment, income inequality, gender economic inequity, economic stress, alcohol outlet density, and employment opportunities). Residential instability, self-employment, and income inequality were associated with rates of both homicide and suicide and gender economic inequity was associated with rates of suicide only. This study opens lines of inquiry around what contributes to the overall burden of violence-related injuries in societies and provides preliminary findings on potential societal characteristics that are associated with differences in injury and violence rates across populations.

AB Objective: To empirically assess the impact of firearm regulation on male suicides.
   Method: A negative binomial regression model was applied by using a panel of state level data for the years 1995-2004. The model was used to identify the association between several firearm regulations and male suicide rates.
   Results: Our empirical analysis suggest that firearms regulations which function to reduce overall gun availability have a significant deterrent effect on male suicide, while regulations that seek to prohibit high risk individuals from owning firearms have a lesser effect.
   Conclusions: Restricting access to lethal means has been identified as an effective approach to suicide prevention, and firearms regulations are one way to reduce gun availability. The analysis suggests that gun control measures such as permit and licensing requirements have a negative effect on suicide rates among males. Since there is considerable heterogeneity among states with regard to gun control, these results suggest that there are opportunities for many states to reduce suicide by expanding their firearms regulations.

AB Background: Approximately 30000 people die annually by suicide in the United States. Although 60% of suicides occur during a mood disorder, mostly untreated, little is known about the relationship between antidepressant medication use and the rate of suicide in the United States.
   Objective: To examine the association between antidepressant medication prescription and suicide rate by analyzing associations at the county level across the United States.
   Design: Analysis of National Vital Statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
   Setting: All US counties.
   Participants: All US individuals who committed suicide between 1996 and 1998.
   Main Outcome Measures: National county-level suicide rate data are broken down by age, sex, income, and race for the period of 1996 to 1998. National county-level antidepressant prescription data are expressed as number of pills prescribed. The primary, outcome measure is the suicide rate in each county,expressed as the number of suicides for a given population size.
   Results: The overall relationship between antidepressant medication prescription and suicide rate was not significant. Within individual classes of antidepressants, prescriptions for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other new-generation non-SSRI antidepressants (eo. nefazodone hydrochloride, mirtazapine, bupropion hydrochloride, and venlafaxine hydrochloride) are associated with lower suicide rates (both within and between counties). A positive association between tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) prescription and suicide rate was observed. Results are adjusted for age, sex. race. income, and county-to-county variability in suicide rates. Higher suicide rates in rural areas are associated with fewer antidepressant prescriptions, lower income. and relatively more prescriptions for TCAs.
   Conclusions: The aggregate nature of these observational data preclude a direct causal interpretation of the results. A high number of TCA prescriptions may be a marker for those counties with more limited access to quality menial health care and inadequate treatment and detection of depression: which in turn lead to increased suicide rates. By contrast. increases in prescriptions for SSRIs and other new-generation non-SSRIs are associated with lower suicide rates both between and within counties over time and may reflect antidepressant efficacy, compliance, a better quality of menial health care, and low toxicity in the event of a suicide attempt by overdose.

AB The tenth leading cause of death in the United States in 2009 was suicide. Emile Durkheim demonstrated that suicide can be studied as a social phenomenon. However, sociologists have been oddly silent on the subject in recent years. Research that has been done by sociologists on suicide has examined the role social capital plays in reducing suicide. However, Richard Florida has argued that today communities are not developing around social capital, but instead moving toward his creative capital model. No study has been done examining the association between creative capital and suicide. This analysis examined what developing around a creative capital model means for suicide. The findings demonstrate that there is a positive association between creative capital and suicide. The current analysis should give pause to communities attempting to develop around the creative capital model.

SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
ID UNEMPLOYMENT; IMPACT; RATES
AB This empirical study commemorates Durkheim's contribution to suicidology by reviewing his own and his followers' formulation of the relationship between the business cycle and suicide. Three distinctive sociological theories of suicide, including Durkeim's, were identified to link the suicide rate to the socioeconomic environment of the society. A real-income hypothesis of suicide was developed to capture (a) the positive impact of the economy on suicide, (b) the curvilinear impact of the economy on suicide implied by Durkheim's proposition, and (3) the interplay of both economic and sociological variables on suicide. Another implication from the reformulation is that there may exist a positive natural rate of suicide for anl:society. These two hypothesis were tested using the 1990 census data for the continental states of the United States. Some conclusions and suggestions were drawn for future research.

AB Background: Firearm-related suicides comprise over two-thirds of gun-related violence in the United States, and gun laws and policies remain under scrutiny, with many advocating for revision of the regulatory map for lawful gun ownership, aiming at restricting access and distribution of these weapons. However, the quantitative relationship between how strict gun laws are and the incidence of firearm violence with their associated mortality is largely unknown. We therefore, sought to explore the impact of firearm law patterns among states on the incidence and outcomes of firearm-related suicide attempts, utilizing established objective criteria.
   Methods: The National Inpatient Sample for the years 1998-2011 was queried for all firearm-related suicides. Discharge facilities were stratified into five categories (A, B, C, D, and F, with A representing states with the most strict and F representing states with the least strict laws) based on the Brady Campaign to prevent Gun Violence that assigns scorecards for every state. The primary outcomes were suicide attempts and in-hospital mortality per 100,000 populations by Brady state grade.
   Results: During the 14-year study period, 34,994 subjects met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 42.0 years and 80.1% were male. A handgun was utilized by 51.8% of patients. The overall mortality was 33.3%. Overall, 22.0% had reported psychoses and 19.3% reported depression. After adjusting for confounding factors and using group A as reference, there were higher adjusted odds for suicide attempts for patients admitted in group C, D, and F category states (1.73, 2.09, and 1.65, respectively, all P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Firearm-related suicide attempt injuries are more common in states with less strict gun laws, and these injuries tend to be associated with a higher mortality. Efforts aimed at nationwide standardization of firearm state laws are warranted, particularly for young adults and suicide-prone populations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI How Does Legalization of Physician-Assisted Suicide Affect Rates of
   Suicide?
SO SOUTHERN MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE physician-assisted suicide; suicide; Oregon; Washington
ID COHORT; LAWS; AGE
AB Objectives Several US states have legalized or decriminalized physician-assisted suicide (PAS) while others are considering permitting PAS. Although it has been suggested that legalization could lead to a reduction in total suicides and to a delay in those suicides that do occur, to date no research has tested whether these effects can be identified in practice. The aim of this study was to fill this gap by examining the association between the legalization of PAS and state-level suicide rates in the United States between 1990 and 2013.
   Methods We used regression analysis to test the change in rates of nonassisted suicides and total suicides (including assisted suicides) before and after the legalization of PAS.
   Results Controlling for various socioeconomic factors, unobservable state and year effects, and state-specific linear trends, we found that legalizing PAS was associated with a 6.3% (95% confidence interval 2.70%-9.9%) increase in total suicides (including assisted suicides). This effect was larger in the individuals older than 65 years (14.5%, CI 6.4%-22.7%). Introduction of PAS was neither associated with a reduction in nonassisted suicide rates nor with an increase in the mean age of nonassisted suicide.
   Conclusions Legalizing PAS has been associated with an increased rate of total suicides relative to other states and no decrease in nonassisted suicides. This suggests either that PAS does not inhibit (nor acts as an alternative to) nonassisted suicide, or that it acts in this way in some individuals but is associated with an increased inclination to suicide in other individuals.

AB Both intoxication and chronic heavy alcohol use are associated with suicide. There is extensive population-level evidence linking per capita alcohol consumption with suicide. While alcohol policies can reduce excessive alcohol consumption, the relationship between alcohol policies and suicide warrants a critical review of the literature. This review summarizes the associations between various types of alcohol policies and suicide, both in the United States and internationally, as presented in English-language literature published between 1999 and 2014. Study designs, methodological challenges, and limitations in ascertaining the associations are discussed. Because of the substantial between-states variation in alcohol policies, U.S.-based studies contributed substantially to the literature. Repeated cross-sectional designs at both the ecological level and decedent level were common among U.S.-based studies. Non-U.S. studies often used time series data to evaluate pre-post comparisons of a hybrid set of policy changes. Although inconsistency remained, the published literature in general supported the protective effect of restrictive alcohol policies on reducing suicide as well as the decreased level of alcohol involvement among suicide decedents. Common limitations included measurement and selection bias and a focus on effects of a limited number of alcohol policies without accounting for other alcohol policies. This review summarizes a number of studies that suggest restrictive alcohol policies may contribute to suicide prevention on a general population level and to a reduction of alcohol involvement among suicide deaths.

AB Objectives: To compare 12-year suicide-specific mortalities of 3 different injury cohorts, identify the risk factors for suicide mortality after spinal,cord injury (SCI), and investigate whether suicide mortality is higher among those with SCI than in the general population.
   Design: Retrospective cohort study.
   Setting: United States hospitals (n=28) designated as SCI Model Systems.
   Participants: Participants (N=31,339) injured between January 1, 1973, and December 31, 1999.
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measure: Suicide death after SCI.
   Results: The crude annual suicide mortality rate during the first 12 years after SCI was 91 per 100,000 person-years for 1973 to 1979 injury cohort, 69 per 100,000 person-years for 1980 to 1989 injury cohort, and 46 per 100,000 person-years for 1990 to 1999 injury cohort. Suicide mortality was associated with race, injury severity, and years since injury. The standardized mortality ratios for the 3 cohorts were 5.2, 3.7, and 3.0, respectively.
   Conclusions: Suicide mortality among those with SCI decreased over 3 injury cohorts, but it still remained 3 times higher than that of the general population. (C) 2014 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine

AB Suicide is a leading cause of death among youth and emerging adults in the USA. Because youth suicide imposes serious burdens and has profound implications, federal priorities include suicide prevention training among school personnel, in part, because school personnel can assume an important role in suicide prevention given their work with youth. Many states now have policies for school personnel suicide prevention training, in response to federal priorities encouraging the establishment of suicide prevention training requirements among school personnel. However, because federal priorities do not specifically define these training requirements, there is considerable variation in state-level policy and practice. Consequently, state-level youth suicide rates are examined in relation to variable state policies, to explore how suicide rates may differ as a function of variable policies, in order to determine if particular policies or practices are correlated with greater harm or benefit to youth. Statistical analyses suggest that state-level policies are not strongly correlated with rates of youth suicide, indicating that current policies have not had significant impact on youth suicide. Alternatively, statistical analyses suggest that rates of youth suicide are correlated with youth population percentages per state and rural areas. Five important policy and training considerations are discussed relating to training duration, training frequency, training content, application of skills, and inclusion of technology. These five policy and training considerations outline specific issues that should be considered when developing state requirements for suicide prevention training among school personnel, including the creation of precise definitions and rigorous standards, review of the evidence base around training approaches, and the creation of standards around evaluation of training programs. Further exploring these five particular policy and training considerations will increasingly unite federal priorities and state-specific youth suicide prevention efforts, which may more effectively moderate rates of youth suicide.

AB Using pooled cross-sectional time-series data for the 50 U.S. states over a 25-year period, this article examines how well four conceptual groups of social correlates-demographic, economic, social, and cultural factors-are associated with the 1976-2000 patterns in overall suicide rates and suicide by firearms and other means. Unlike past research that typically considers only one dimension, this analysis differentiates between spatial and temporal variation in suicide rates to determine whether and how social correlates operate differently in these two contexts. Results indicate that suicide rates correspond closely to social correlates. Within U.S. states, lower overall suicide rates between 1976 and 2000 were associated with demographic change (e.g., larger numbers of foreign-born) as well as with fewer numbers of Episcopalians. Across U.S. states, variation in overall suicide rates over the period was related to demographic (percentage male), economic (per capita income), social (percentage divorced), and cultural (alcohol consumption and gun ownership) factors. However, findings differ importantly by type of suicide, and across time and space. Reasons for these distinct patterns are discussed.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to explore correlates of the use of firearms to commit suicide. Methods: A national sample of psychiatric patients discharged from Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers was followed from the time of discharge until December 1999. The study explores state-level measures as correlates of overall suicide and suicide by firearm, controlling for individual sociodemographic characteristics and psychiatric diagnosis. The outcomes of interest were completed suicide and suicide by firearm. Results: Patients who were male, Caucasian, and who had a diagnosis of substance abuse or post-traumatic stress disorder were significantly more likely to use a firearm than another means to commit suicide. Multivariable models indicated that veterans living in states with lower rates of gun ownership, more restrictive gun laws, and higher social capital were less likely to commit suicide with a firearm. Conclusions: Gun ownership rates, legislation, and levels of community cohesiveness are significantly associated with the likelihood of psychiatric patients committing suicide with a gun.

AB Previous studies have investigated spatial patterning and associations of area characteristics with suicide rates in Western and Asian countries, but few have been conducted in the United States. This ecological study aims to identify high-risk clusters of suicide in Ohio and assess area level correlates of these clusters. We estimated spatially smoothed standardized mortality ratios (SMR) using Bayesian conditional autoregressive models (CAR) for the period 2004 to 2013. Spatial and spatio-temporal scan statistics were used to detect high-risk clusters of suicide at the census tract level (N = 2952). Logistic regression models were used to examine the association between area level correlates and suicide clusters. Nine statistically significant (p < 0.05) high-risk spatial clusters and two space-time clusters were identified. We also identified several significant spatial clusters by method of suicide. The risk of suicide was up to 2.1 times higher in high-risk clusters than in areas outside of the clusters (relative risks ranged from 1.22 to 2.14 (p < 0.01)). In the multivariate model, factors strongly associated with area suicide rates were socio-economic deprivation and lower provider densities. Efforts to reduce poverty and improve access to health and mental health medical services on the community level represent potentially important suicide prevention strategies.

   STATISTICS; PREVENTION
AB Objective: The aim of this study is to compare Canadian suicide rates with other external causes of death to examine potential poisoning misclassifications as a contributor to suicide underreporting.
   Method: The study used Statistics Canada mortality data from 2000 to 2011 to calculate sex-and age-specific ratios by external cause of injury codes.
   Results: The overall Canadian suicide rate, as well as the poisoning suicide rate, declined over the study timeframe by an average annual percentage change (AAPC) of 1.0% each year. However, unintentional and undetermined poisonings increased significantly during the timeframe. Unintentional poisoning mortality (primarily narcotics and hallucinogens, including opioids) increased in proportion to suicides for both sexes, although females were consistently higher. The undetermined death to suicide ratio was higher and increasing for females. Poisonings of undetermined intent increased over time to comprise 47% to 80% of the undetermined death category for males and females combined.
   Conclusions: Canadian poisoning suicide rates declined, in contrast to rising unintentional and undetermined poisoning mortality rates. This trend is similar to that of the United States, supporting the hypothesis that misclassification of poisoning deaths may also be an issue in Canada.

AB This study examined whether substance use disorders (SUD) and poverty predicted first-time suicide ideation or attempt in United States national data. Respondents without prior histories of suicide ideation or attempt at Wave 1 of the NESARC (N = 31,568) were analyzed to determine the main and interactive effects of SUD and poverty on first-time suicide ideation or attempt by Wave 2, 3 years later. Adjusted for controls, poverty (AOR = 1.35, CI = 1.05-1.73) and drug use disorders (AOR = 2.10, CI = 1.07-4.14) independently increased risk for first-time suicide ideation or attempt at Wave 2. SUD and poverty did not interact to differentially increase risk for first-time suicide ideation or attempt, prior to or after adjustment for controls. This study reinforces the importance of SUD and poverty in the risk for first-time suicide ideation or attempt. Public health efforts should target messages to drug users and the impoverished that highlight their increased risk for first-time suicide.

AB Background: In the United States, only motor vehicle crashes and cancer claim more lives among children than do firearms. This national study attempts to determine whether firearm prevalence is related to rates of unintentional firearm deaths, suicides, and homicides among children.
   Methods: Pooled cross-sectional time-series data (1988-1997) were used to estimate the association between the rate of violent death among 5-14 year olds and four proxies of firearm availability, across states and regions.
   Results: A statistically significant association exists between gun availability and the rates of unintentional firearm deaths, homicides, and suicides. The elevated rates of suicide and homicide among children living in states with more guns is not entirely explained by a state's poverty, education, or urbanization and is driven by lethal firearm violence, not by lethal nonfirearm violence.
   Conclusion: A disproportionately high number of 5-14 year olds died from suicide, homicide, and unintentional firearm deaths in states and regions where guns were more prevalent.

ID FLUOXETINE TREATMENT; MAJOR DEPRESSION; BEHAVIOR; TRENDS; RISK
AB Background: Regulatory agencies in the United Kingdom and the United States have recently issued warnings about a possible link between suicidal ideation and attempts and the use of paroxetine in a pediatric patient population. The objective of this study was to determine the proportion of youth suicides that tested positive for paroxetine or other antidepressants in medical examiner toxicologic testing in New York City from 1993 through 1998, the first 6 years that paroxetine was available in the United States.
   Method. Subjects in this medical examiner surveillance study were suicides less than 18 years of age. Serum toxicology was examined for paroxetine and other antidepressants.
   Results: There were 66 suicides among persons under 18 years of age in the years 1993 through 1998. Toxicology was tested in 58 (87.9%) of the 66 suicides, and 54 (81.8%) had injury-death intervals of 3 days or less. None of the victims had paroxetine detected in their blood obtained at the time of autopsy. Imipramine was detected in 2 victims and fluoxetine in another 2.
   Conclusion: Despite regulatory concerns, none of the autopsies of youth suicides in New York City detected paroxetine in the victims, although other antidepressants were detected in 4 victims. However, in the vast majority of the youth suicides, there was no evidence of antidepressant use immediately prior to death.

AB The National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) is a United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) database of violent deaths from 2003 to the present. The NVDRS collects information from 32 states on several types of violent deaths, including suicides, homicides, homicides followed by suicides, and deaths resulting from child maltreatment or intimate partner violence, as well as legal intervention and accidental firearm deaths. Despite the availability of data from police narratives, medical examiner reports, and other sources, reliably finding the cases of murder-suicide in the NVDRS has proven problematic due to the lack of a unique code for murder-suicide incidents and outdated descriptions of case-finding procedures from previous researchers. By providing a description of the methods used to access to the NVDRS and coding procedures used to decipher these data, the authors seek to assist future researchers in correctly identifying cases of murder-suicide deaths while avoiding false positives.

TI Suicide Typologies in the United States Air Force: A Hierarchical
   Cluster Analysis
SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective This study describes characteristics of United States Air Force (USAF) suicide decedents and determines subgroups.
   Method Retrospective review of demographic, psychiatric, event-related, and psychosocial variables for USAF suicide decedents in the Suicide Event Surveillance System database was conducted between February 1999 and July 2009 (N = 376). Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to determine initial clusters and cluster centroids.
   Results Analyses identified three clusters. Cluster 1 (n = 149) individuals were mostly single or divorced, E-1-E-6 rank, living alone, and less likely to have psychiatric disorder diagnoses or engage with most helping resources. Cluster 2 (n = 126) decedents were mostly married, living with a partner, higher ranking, and least likely to communicate suicide intent. Cluster 3 (n = 101) individuals were mostly E-4-E-6 rank, with the highest rates of most psychiatric diagnoses, previous suicide-related events, engagement with multiple helping resources, communication of intent, and psychosocial precipitants. Clusters differed significantly in marital status, rank, psychiatric diagnoses, precipitants, service utilization, previous suicide-related events, risk factors, communication of intent, location and method of death, and residential status.
   Conclusions This study identifies empirically based suicide typologies within a military decedent sample. While further research and replications of findings are needed, these typologies have clinical and policy implications for military suicide prevention.

AB Objective: Studies show incarcerated youth are at increased risk for suicidal behavior, yet little is known about factors associated with suicide for this population. Using a nationally representative sample, this study examined characteristics and precipitating circumstances of suicide in incarcerated youth decedents compared with youth suicide decedents in the general population.
   Method: Data were analyzed for suicide decedents 10- to 24-years-old (N = 10,126) in the United States from 2003 through 2012 from the National Violent Death Reporting System. Logistic regression compared precipitating circumstances of suicide for incarcerated youth decedents and those not in custody. Details on suicide deaths in detained youth were captured from coroner/medical examiner and law enforcement reports associated with each incident.
   Results: Most youth suicide decedents were older, white, and male regardless of incarceration status. Incarcerated youth suicide decedents were more likely to die by hanging, strangulation, or suffocation and less likely to disclose suicide intent, leave a suicide note, or exhibit depressive symptoms compared with those not in custody. Additional risk factors for suicide were not significantly different between youth decedents in custody and those not in custody, suggesting that unique aspects of the incarceration environment could be associated with an increased risk of suicide.
   Conclusion: Study findings highlight the need for early suicide risk detection and developmentally relevant interventions tailored for youth in correctional settings. Future efforts should include evaluation studies to support suicide prevention programs designed for incarcerated youth and research that examines distinctive factors associated with suicidal behavior in custody.

AB Gunshot deaths in children less than 17 years of age from Adelaide, SA, Australia (1969-2005) and from San Diego County, CA, United States (1988-2005) were compared. Forty-two pediatric gunshot fatalities occurred in South Australia (1.1 cases/year; M:F = 30:12). There were 6 accidents (14%), 14 suicides (33%), and 22 homicides (52%). In San Diego there were 185 cases (c.10 cases/year; M:F = 148:37). There were 6 accidents (3%), 42 suicides (23%), 130 homicides (70%), and 7 undetermined cases (4%). The incidence of homicide was significantly higher in San Diego County compared to Adelaide (p < 0.001), with a higher proportion of murder-suicides occurring in Adelaide. There were markedly more accidents and suicides involving males in Adelaide and a far higher number of male homicide victims in San Diego County compared to females. Rifles of 0.22-caliber were preferred weapons in South Australia, compared to handguns in San Diego County.

DE suicide; hydrogen sulfide; asphyxia
ID DEATH
AB This presentation will address the recent rise of suicide deaths resulting from the asphyxiation by hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas.
   Hydrogen sulfide poisoning has been an infrequently encountered cause of death in medical examiner practice. Most H2S deaths that have been reported occurred in association with industrial exposure.
   More recently, H2S has been seen in the commission of suicide, particularly in Japan. Scattered reports of this phenomenon have also appeared in the United States.
   We have recently observed 2 intentional asphyxial deaths in association with H2S. In both cases, the decedents committed suicide in their automobiles. They generated H2S by combining a sulfide-containing tree spray with toilet bowl cleaner (with an active ingredient of hydrogen chloride acid). Both death scenes prompted hazardous materials team responses because of notes attached to the victims' car windows indicating the presence of toxic gas. Autopsy findings included discoloration of lividity and an accentuation of the gray matter of the brain. Toxicology testing confirmed H2S exposure with the demonstration Of high levels of thiosulfate in blood.
   In summary, suicide with H2S appears to be increasing in the United States.

AB Objective: many mass murderers appear to care more about harming others than they do about protecting themselves, and they often commit suicide or refuse to surrender and are killed by police. The present study offers the first in-depth investigation of differences between mass murderers who live and die as a direct result of their offenses. Method: data on 308 offenders in the United States from January 2006 to May 2014 are subjected to quantitative analysis, including logistic regression. Results: findings suggest that those who die are older, less likely to have co-offenders, and more likely to commit public mass killings or family killings, which corresponds with Durkheim's theories of suicide in numerous ways. Conclusion: ultimately, several specific improvements in suicide prevention strategies could potentially help to reduce the prevalence of these high-fatality crimes.

AB This study sought to examine psychiatric and childhood traumatic event correlates of multiple suicide attempts (MSA) compared with single suicide attempts (SSA) in 2 nationally representative samples of the United States general population. Data came from the National Comorbidity Survey (n = 5,401; age 18-54; response rate 82.4%) and the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (n 4,083; age 18-54; response rate = 70.9%). Multiple logistic regressions were used to compare individuals with MSA to those with a SSA on the variables of interest after adjusting for sociodemographic variables. Individuals with a history of MSA had significantly higher odds of experiencing several traumatic events in childhood in the 2 surveys. Most notably, comorbidity of 3 or more mental disorders and the presence of at least I anxiety disorder distinguished individuals with MSA from those with a SSA in both surveys, suggesting the potential importance of these variables in association with multiple suicide attempts.

AB This paper empirically analyses whether worker discouragement is linked to suicide in the United States. This paper argues that discouraged workers might translate their frustration into alcohol or drug consumption rather than committing suicide directly. Based on the linear Granger causality test, this study finds that changes in the number female unemployed workers help to predict changes in female suicide patterns. A 1 % increase in growth in the male unemployment rate with age (45-54) will lead to a 2.8 % increase in the growth of male alcohol-induced deaths. This study finds a nonlinear causality from the female unemployment with age (25-34, 45-54, 50 and over) to drug-induced deaths. These findings suggest the importance of providing treatment for the jobless to reduce the risk for excessive alcohol consumption, drug misuse and suicidal behavior.

AB The attitudes of the general public and lawmakers toward suicide can influence the degree to which suicide prevention is prioritized in public policymaking. In this study, we compared the attitudes of urban residents, lawmakers, and community mental health workers toward suicide. Urban residents (N = 501) were surveyed through a telephone interview, while self-reported questionnaire was administered by lawmakers (N = 156) and community mental health workers (N = 121) through office visit and post, respectively. We used the Suicide Opinion Questionnaire to measure attitudes toward suicide in all three samples. Both the general public and legislators had insufficient knowledge and more permissive and uncaring attitudes toward suicide, whereas community mental health workers were more inclined to have sufficient knowledge of suicide and more intolerant and caring attitudes towards suicide. Therefore, lawmakers and the general public require education on suicide and suicide prevention, which may help lower South Korea's high suicide rate ranking among the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development member states.

AB We hypothesized that in individualistic cultures, individualism predicts positive attitudes toward assisted death, whereas authoritarianism is negatively associated with favorable views of this issue. Study I confirmed this hypothesis in a Polish sample (n = 100). Study 2, using a German sample (n = 102), found the predicted relationships only for forms of assisted death that involved the individual self-determination of a terminally ill patient. In Study 3 (n = 72), we found experimental evidence that priming individualistic aspects of the self-concept results in more favorable views of physician-assisted suicide. Using a representative sample (n = 1158), Study 4 found that across the United States, regional levels of individualism are reflected in corresponding patterns of support for assisted suicide. Our research confirms that individualism shapes positive views of assisted suicide, The discussion focuses on assisted suicide as a cultural phenomenon and explores the implications of growing levels of individualism for public opinion and policy on assisted suicide.

AB Tremendous debate surrounds the acceptability of physician-assisted suicide in the United States. Progress requires carefully mapping the relationship of this practice to termination of life-sustaining treatment, appropriate pain relief and palliative care, and euthanasia. Arguments that have been offered in favor of permitting physicians to aid suicide include the importance of patient autonomy, the claim that patients need this option to cope with symptoms at the end of life, and the assertion that practices already accepted involve intentionally ending life. Arguments that have been offered against include the potential for abuse, the claim that forbidding intentional killing is essential to the ethics of medicine, and the assertion that patients can be provided good and humane care at the end of life without assisting suicide. Addressing the demand for physician-assisted suicide requires improvement in end-of-life care and continued discussion attentive to emerging empirical data.

AB Objective: To assess the socioeconomic predictors of suicide risk among cancer patients in the United States.
   Methods: Cancer patients available within Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database who were diagnosed between 2000-2010 have been reviewed. Linkage analysis to Census 2000 SF files was conducted to determine area-based socioeconomic attributes. Observed/ Expected ratios were calculated for the overall cohort as well as for clinically and socioeconomically defined subgroups. "Observed" is the number of observed completed suicide cases in the studied cohort; while "Expected" is the number of completed suicide cases in a demographically similar cohort within the United States and within the same period of time.
   Results: The current study reviews a total of 3,149,235 cancer patients (diagnosed 2000-2010) within the SEER database. Regarding socioeconomic county attributes, higher risk of suicide seems to be associated with lower educational attainment (O/E for counties with > 20% individuals with less than high school education: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.35-1.47), poverty rates (O/E for counties with > 5% individuals below poverty line: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.34-1.43), unemployment rates (O/E for counties with > 5% families below poverty line: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.31-1.41) and less people living in urban areas (O/E for counties with <= 50% individuals living in urban areas: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.50-1.77). On the other hand, risk of suicide seems to be inversely related to a higher representation of foreign-born individuals (O/E for counties with <= 5% foreign-born individuals: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.47-1.65); and inversely related to a higher representation with recent immigrants to the US (O/E for counties with <= 5% recent immigrants: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.29-1.38).
   Conclusions: Cancer patients living in a socioeconomically vulnerable environment (lower educational status, poverty, and unemployment) seem to have higher suicide risk compared to other cancer patients.

AB Recent statistics suggest current and former United States military personnel are at a greater risk for suicide than ever before. Indeed, approximately 300 active-duty servicemen died by suicide in 2009, a population-adjusted death rate exceeding that of civilians (U.S. Department of Defense, 2010). Despite a growing body of literature highlighting the adverse consequences of men's adherence to traditional masculine norms on their physical and emotional health, little attention has been paid to the contributions of compliance with these norms on current and former male military personnel's risk for suicide. The present manuscript highlights the need for greater consideration of servicemen's adherence to norms of masculinity to better understand their suicide risk. To organize this presentation, the authors discuss how current and former servicemen's adherence to social and military injunctions for masculine behavior may contribute to an unwillingness to utilize mental health services that, in turn, exacerbates their mental health and may contribute to their risk for suicide. The authors also provide specific recommendations for gender-sensitive treatment interventions and future research.

Although competencies have been developed for mental health clinicians in assessing and managing suicide risk, there are no standard competencies for PMH nurse generalists. Widely accepted nursing practices do not meet suicide-specific standards of care or evidence-based criteria. Although both the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education Essentials for Baccalaureate Education and the Quality and Safety Education for Nurses competencies stress the necessity for comprehensive assessment, safe clinical practices, patient-centered care, evidence-based interventions, and interprofessional communication and collaboration, there are no specific requirements for suicide prevention training in educational and clinical programs. The American Psychiatric Nurses Association has an opportunity to provide leadership in developing, implementing, and evaluating competency-based training for nurses and partner with the national effort to increase the competencies in suicide prevention in the behavioral health workforce.

TI Suicide and Prescription Rates of Intranasal Corticosteroids and

ID COMORBIDITY SURVEY REPLICATION; NASAL CORTICOSTEROIDS; CYTOKINE

AB Objective: To estimate the relationship between antiallergy drug prescription rates and suicide across the United States and over time. The relationship between allergy, allergens, and suicidal behavior and suggestions of a possible immune mediation led us to hypothesize that intranasal corticosteroids, known to reduce local airway production of T-helper cell type 2 cytokines, may be associated with reduced risk of suicide relative to antihistamines, which only secondarily affect cytokine production.
   Method: The authors evaluated the relationship of suicide rates at the county level in the United States (N=120,076 suicides) with prescriptions for intranasal corticosteroids and nonsedating antihistamines, in interaction with antidepressant prescriptions and other socioeconomic variables, for the period from 1999 to 2002. Suicide rate data were derived from state vital record systems based on local death certificate registries, and county-level allergy and antidepressant prescription data were obtained from IMS Health Incorporated (Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania).
   Results: The prescription volume of intranasal corticosteroids was associated with a lower suicide risk (P=.0004), while that of antihistamines was associated with a modestly greater suicide risk (P=.0001). Adjustment for antidepressant prescriptions did not affect these relationships.
   Conclusions:This is the first study, to our knowledge, to find a possible association between completed suicide and medications for allergic rhinitis and also the first report of an association of intranasal corticosteroid use with a lower suicide rate. This association should be considered preliminary and deserving of further investigation.

AB Suicide ideation and behavior among U.S. Hispanics has increased notably in the last decade, especially among youth. Suicide risk increases across generations of Hispanics, with risk greatest amongst U.S.-born Hispanics. Acculturative stress has been linked to increased risk for suicide ideation, attempts, and fatalities among Hispanics. Acculturative stress may increase suicide risk via disintegration of cultural values (such as familism and religiosity) and social bonds. Culturally-tailored prevention efforts are needed that address suicide risk among Hispanics. We propose a conceptual model for suicide prevention focused on augmenting cultural engagement among at risk Hispanics.

AB African American women have lower suicide rates than other women and men in the United States They may possess suicide buffers including social support, religiosity, negative attitudes regarding suicide acceptability, and African American culture. To examine the relationships buffers may have with suicide ideation, 300 African American female college students completed measures of suicide ideation and buffers. Three variables accounted for a significant and unique portion of the variance in suicide ideation: family support, a view that suicide is unacceptable, and a collaborative religious problem-solving style. The identification of these factors may help in the assessment, prevention, and intervention of suicide for African American women and other women and men.

AB A global health crisis exists surrounding suicide. In the United States, suicide rates have increased by nearly 30% in most states since 1999. Although the suicide rate among Hispanic Americans is significantly lower than non-Hispanic Whites, reasons for the lower rate are unclear. Current literature suggests that the lower rate may be due to underreporting, a lack of suicide screening and a number of complex social issues, including the stigma surrounding suicide in Hispanic culture. Health care provider attitudes toward suicidal individuals may also negatively affect mental health outcomes. This brief report focuses on suicide as a public health concern, addresses key issues arising from the phenomenon, and provides a perspective on health care providers' attitudes toward suicide. Recommendations for future research, as well as implications for clinical practice and policy, are suggested.

AB The relationship between firearm ownership and suicide is well documented. This study hypothesized that how soldiers store their firearms would moderate the relationship between suicidal ideation and the self-reported likelihood of engaging in a future suicide attempt, and that this relationship would be explained by fearlessness about death. There were 432 military personnel (91.3% men, 74.2% White, M-age = 27.60) who endorsed current ownership of a private firearm and who were recruited from a military base in the southeastern United States (94.5% National Guard). Firearm storage moderated the relationship between suicidal ideation and the self-reported likelihood of engaging in a future suicide attempt, but this relationship was not explained by fearlessness about death. Individuals who reported keeping their firearms loaded and stored in an unsecure location exhibited higher mean levels of fearlessness about death. Findings highlight the need for research examining contributors to suicide risk in the context of firearm storage, and provide support for suicide prevention efforts involving restricting means.

AB Suicide-related outcomes are a major public health challenge in communities of color in the United States. To address these challenges, this Major Contribution makes theoretical, empirical, and practice-related contributions to scholarship on suicide-related outcomes among people of color. In this article, the authors present a new framework to conceptualize previous suicidology scholarship, address existing literature gaps, and inform counseling psychologists' future work on suicide-related outcomes in U.S. communities of color. The framework consists of three components and nine principles that highlight the types of constructs, populations, and preventive interventions that should be emphasized in theory, research, and practice addressing suicide-related outcomes in communities of color. The authors explain why suicide-related outcomes in communities of color deserve attention, describe the framework, and discuss implications of the framework for future practice and training. It is hoped that this framework can serve as a resource and impetus for new paradigms of suicidology work in communities of color.

AB BackgroundThe management of pain patients with analgesics is challenging, with one of the risks being overdose with prescribed medications and death. In this study, we examined relationships between pain and pain catastrophizing, and past history of intentional overdoses and suicide attempts.
   MethodUsing a cross-sectional approach and a self-report survey methodology, we examined 239 consecutive internal medicine outpatients in the United States. We inquired about pain today, over the past month, and over the past year; and assessed pain catastrophizing with the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), past histories of intentional overdoses, and suicide attempts.
   ResultsThere were statistically significant relationships between all of the pain variables, as well as PCS scores, and history of intentional overdoses. There were also statistically significant relationships between all of the pain variables, as well as PCS scores, and history of suicide attempts.
   ConclusionsAlthough we cannot discern causal relationships, findings indicate that patients with pain complaints and pain catastrophizing have a greater likelihood of having past histories of intentional overdoses and suicide attempts. We discuss the potential implications of these findings.

AB This study examined the association between state-specific firearm control policies and firearm suicide rates among men after adjusting for state-level demographics. This cross-sectional study used state-level mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System and the Brady Campaign State Scorecard in 2017. An age-stratified (15-24 years, 25-44 years, 45-64 years, and >= 65 years) multivariable analysis was conducted to identify gun control policies that are associated with firearm suicide rates among men in each age group. Results indicate that the associations of specific firearm control policies and firearm suicide rates differ across the age span. In particular, more policies (for example, dealer regulations and waiting periods) are negatively associated with firearm suicide rate among men 15 to 24 years of age. The findings underscore the importance of designing gender- and age-specific policy advocacy programs directed at lowering the rate of firearm suicide. This study also suggests that California, known for its innovative gun safety legislation efforts, could serve as a model for other states starting preventive programs to reduce the firearm suicide rate. Implications of the findings for social work practice are discussed.

AB The recent economic recession has led to increases in suicide, but whether US state unemployment insurance programs ameliorate this association has not been examined. Exploiting US state variations in the generosity of benefit programs between 1968 and 2008, we tested the hypothesis that more generous unemployment benefit programs reduce the impact of economic downturns on suicide. Using state linear fixed-effect models, we found a negative additive interaction between unemployment rates and benefits among the US working-age (20-64 years) population (beta = -0.57, 95% confidence interval: -0.86, -0.27; P < 0.001). The finding of a negative additive interaction was robust across multiple model specifications. Our results suggest that the impact of unemployment rates on suicide is offset by the presence of generous state unemployment benefit programs, though estimated effects are small in magnitude.

AB This article focuses on intimate partner killings to address the question of why some killers subsequently commit suicide whereas others do not. Utilizing Blackian theories of conflict management and Manning's theory of suicide, it advances hypotheses about when intimate partner conflict will result in homicide-suicide rather than homicide alone. These hypotheses propose that differing amounts of status superiority and relational distance predict and explain different patterns of lethal violence. The hypotheses are illustrated and supported with data taken from a study of intimate partner homicides in the state of West Virginia. The article concludes by arguing for a micro-structural model that addresses suicide, homicide, and homicide-suicide.

AB Firearms account for most self-harm deaths, and many more Americans kill themselves with a firearm each year than are murdered with one. Mental illness is an important risk factor for firearm suicide. While the literature focuses on firearm safety, little is understood about how the supply of behavioral health treatment services can reduce firearm suicide. We evaluated whether states with greater behavioral health treatment capacity have lower firearm suicide rates, examining variation across the United States and over time. The mean adjusted firearm suicide rate rose from 6.74 per 100,000 people in 2005 to 7.89 per 100,000 in 2015-a 17.1 percent increase. We found a significant independent inverse relationship between greater behavioral health treatment capacity and the firearm suicide rate. We show that across all states, on average, a 10.0 percent relative increase in behavioral health workers per state was associated with a modest 1.2 percent relative reduction in the adjusted firearm suicide rate. Given this finding, we discuss whether firearm control initiatives might offer a greater protective effect for reducing firearm suicide, compared to the protective effect of increasing behavioral health treatment capacity.

AB We exploit within-state variation across time in both the existence and length of statutory delays both explicit wait periods and delays created by licensing requirements - between the purchase and delivery of a firearm to examine the effect of purchase delays on homicides and suicides. We find that the existence of a purchase delay reduces firearm-related suicides by between 2% and 5% with no statistically significant increase in non-firearm suicides. Purchase delays are not associated with statistically significant changes in homicide rates.

   MethodsA cross-sectional model of suicide rates is estimated with weighted least squares, using direct survey measures of gun prevalence.
   Results and ConclusionPrior macro-level research is afflicted by the use of small samples of large heterogeneous units, invalid measures of gun prevalence, and few controls for confounders. The methodologically soundest prior research indicates that gun prevalence affects rates of gun suicides, but not total suicides. The new analysis likewise finds no significant effect of gun prevalence on total suicide rates.

AB Objective: To examine the prevalence and correlates of attempting suicide in the past 12 months among adults with past-year suicidal ideation in the United States.
   Method: Data were from 229,600 persons aged 18 years or older who participated in the 2008-2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Among them, 12,300 reported having past-year suicidal ideation, and over 2,000 of those reported attempting suicide within the past 12 months prior to survey interview. Descriptive analyses and pooled and stratified (by suicide plan and major depressive episode [MDE]) multivariate logistic regression models were applied. Major depressive episode was based on assessments of individual diagnostic criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV).
   Results: Among persons aged 18 years or older in the United States, 3.8% reported having suicidal ideation in the past 12 months. Among past-year suicidal ideators, 13.2% attempted suicide in the past 12 months. The prevalence of past 12-month suicide attempt among past-year ideators with MDE was higher than among those without MDE (14.1% vs 12.0%). Past 12-month suicide attempt was more common among ideators with a suicide plan than among ideators without a plan (37.0% vs 3.7%). However, the prevalence of suicide attempt was higher among ideators with a plan but without MDE than among ideators with a plan and MDE (42.1% vs 32.9%). Compared with ideators without a plan, ideators with a plan had a higher (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47-3.45) suicide attempt risk among those without MDE (AOR = 22.4; 95% CI, 16.55-30.27) than among those with MDE (AOR = 10.7; 95% CI, 7.91-14.49).
   Conclusions: Among adult suicidal ideators, factors associated with their progression from ideation to suicide attempt may vary by their suicide plan and major depression status. Focusing attention on high-risk subgroups may be warranted. (C) Copyright 2015 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB The question of a physician's involvement in aid in dying (or "assisted suicide") is being debated across the country. This article adopts no one position because its authors hold contrasting views. It aims instead to articulate the strongest arguments in favor of aid in dying and the strongest arguments opposed. It also addresses relevant terminology and reviews the history of its legalization in the United States.

AB This study investigated the role of gender, family cohesion, religiosity, and negative suicide attitudes as potential determinants of cultural differences in suicide ideation among 375 college students from Ghana and the United States. Significant cultural differences were found for suicide ideation, family closeness, religiosity, and negative suicide attitudes. Family cohesion and negative attitudes were significant predictors for both cultural groups. Gender was a significant determinant for suicide ideation among Ghanaians, but not Americans; religiosity was not a significant determinant for either group. More extensive research on sociocultural influences on suicide, especially among countries in which suicide is underreported or not documented, is encouraged.

For example, in the United States, although suicide is the tenth leading cause of death among Americans overall, it is the second leading cause of death among young people ages 15-24 and the third leading cause of death among those ages 10-14. Because children and adolescents spend so much time in them, schools are ideal focal points for focused suicide prevention efforts.

AB Objectives. We examined mental health treatment patterns among adults with suicide attempts in the past 12 months in the United States.
   Methods. We examined data from 2000 persons, aged 18 years or older, who participated in the 2008 to 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health and who reported attempting suicide in the past 12 months. We applied descriptive analyses and multivariable logistic regression models.
   Results. In adults who attempted suicide in the past year, 56.3% received mental health treatment, but half of those who received treatment perceived unmet treatment needs, and of the 43.0% who did not receive mental health treatment, one fourth perceived unmet treatment needs. From 2008 to 2012, the mental health treatment rate among suicide attempters remained unchanged. Factors associated with receipt of mental health treatment varied by perceived unmet treatment need and receipt of medical attention that resulted from a suicide attempt.
   Conclusions. Suicide prevention strategies that focus on suicide attempters are needed to increase their access to mental health treatments that meet their needs. To be effective, these strategies need to account for language and cultural differences and barriers to financial and treatment delivery.

AB Applying a fixed-effects panel analysis to a 1979-2004 panel data of the U.S. states, this essay re-examines the link between labor markets and suicides in the United States. By disaggregating the analysis across genders and three different age groups (20-34, 35-64, and 65+) and analyzing several other labor market indicators besides overall unemployment rates, the essay finds that deteriorations in labor markets is associated with hikes in suicide rates of only men and women between 35 and 64 years of age. In other words, higher group-specific unemployment rates, larger deviations of unemployment rates from their group-specific trends, and larger variance in the overall unemployment rates are all associated with higher suicide rates of adults aged 35-64, or prime working-age adults. These findings suggest that the mental wellbeing of prime working-age adults is more dependent on labor market conditions than people in other age groups. Therefore, during period when prime working-age adults are facing unfavorable labor market conditions, U.S. suicide prevention programs must especially target this group of population.

AB Suicide is a serious public health problem. Statistics indicate that suicide is the ninth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for nearly 31,000 deaths [1]. It is also the third leading cause of death among persons aged 15 to 24 [1]. On the average, 85 Americans kill themselves each day. The highest rate of completed suicide is among older white men (>85 years old). White men committed 73% of all suicides in 1997 [1]. About 500,000 individuals require emergency treatment as a result of suicide attempts [2]. Despite the prevalence of completed suicides in men, women are more likely to make attempts.
   Predictably, most suicides involve firearms across the life span; approximately 79% of all firearm suicides are committed by white men [3]. Firearms accounted for approximately three of every five suicides (58%) in 1997, followed by poisoning (18%), strangulation (15%), and cutting (1%). The easy access to firearms in the home of high-risk individuals seems to have increased markedly their risk for suicide [1-3].
   Although the exact cause of suicide is obscure, approximately 31,000 people in the United States commit suicide annually. Of this number, 90% have a mental disorder, and most have a depressive illness [4,5]. The most common mental disorders associated with global suicides are depressive illness, alcoholism, and personality disorder [5-8]. Suicide attempts or gestures reflect expressions of extreme emotional pain and distress that must be assessed and taken seriously, rather than being discounted as manipulative gestures or bids for attention.
   This article overviews multiple, interacting causes and risk factors that result in suicide among older adults and children and adolescents. The article also focuses on the nurse's role in prevention, assessment and implementation of evidence-based treatment planning for the suicidal patient.

AB Suicide is 1 of the top 3 leading causes of death in the pediatric population and a serious public health concern. There are evidence-based screening tools for suicide in the pediatric population; however, predicting suicide risks can be a difficult task. The emergency department is an essential source of mental health care for youths and can serve as an important opportunity for suicide screening and subsequent targeted interventions and resource management. More research is needed in emergency department-based screening algorithms and evidence-driven interventions in the pediatric population.

AB Objective
   A paucity of corroborative psychological and psychiatric evidence may be inhibiting detection of drug intoxication suicides in the United States. We evaluated the relative importance of suicide notes and psychiatric history in the classification of suicide by drug intoxication versus firearm (gunshot wound) plus hanging/suffocation - the other two major, but overtly violent methods.
   Methods
   This observational multilevel (individual/county), multivariable study employed a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) to analyze pooled suicides and undetermined intent deaths, as possible suicides, among the population aged 15 years and older in the 17 states participating in the National Violent Death Reporting System throughout 2011-2013. The outcome measure was relative odds of suicide versus undetermined classification, adjusted for demographics, precipitating circumstances, and investigation characteristics.
   Results
   A suicide note, prior suicide attempt, or affective disorder was documented in less than one-third of suicides and one-quarter of undetermined deaths. The prevalence gaps were larger among drug intoxication cases than gunshot/hanging cases. The latter were more likely than intoxication cases to be classified as suicide versus undetermined manner of death (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 41.14; 95% CI, 34.43-49.15), as were cases documenting a suicide note (OR, 33.90; 95% CI, 26.11-44.05), prior suicide attempt (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 2.11-2.77), or depression (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.38 to 1.88), or bipolar disorder (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.10-1.81). Stratification by mechanism/cause intensified the association between a note and suicide classification for intoxication cases (OR, 45.43; 95% CI, 31.06-66.58). Prior suicide attempt (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 2.19-3.18) and depression (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.17-1.87) were associated with suicide classification in intoxication but not gunshot/hanging cases.
   Conclusions
   Without psychological/psychiatric evidence contributing to manner of death classification, suicide by drug intoxication in the US is likely profoundly under-reported. Findings harbor adverse implications for surveillance, etiologic understanding, and prevention of suicides and drug deaths.

AB This article describes trends in suicide attempt visits to emergency departments in the United States (US). Data were obtained from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey using mental-health-related ICD-9-CM, E and V codes, and mental-health reasons for visit. From 1992 to 2001, mental-health-related visits increased 27.5% from 17.1 to 23.6 per 1000 (p <.001). Emergency Department (ED) visits for suicide attempt and self injury increased by 47%, from 0.8 to 1.5 visits per 1000 US population (p(trend) =.04). Suicide-attempt-related visits increased significantly among males over the decade and among females from 1992/1993 to 1998/1999. Suicide attempt visits increased in non-Hispanic whites, patients under 15 years or those between 50-69 years of age, and the privately insured. Hospitalization rates for suicide attempt-related ED visits declined from 49% to 32% between 1992 and 2001 (p =.04). Suicide attempt-related visits increased significantly in urban areas, but in rural areas suicide attempt visits stayed relatively constant, despite significant rural decreases in mental-health related visits overall. Ten-year regional increases in suicide attempt-related visits were significant for the West and Northeast only. US emergency departments have witnessed increasing rates of ED visits for suicide attempts during a decade of significant reciprocal decreases in postattempt hospitalization. Emergency departments are increasingly important sites for identifying, assessing and treating individuals with suicidal behavior.

AB Suicide is an important public health concern requiring ongoing research to understand risk factors for suicide ideation. A dual-frame, random digit dial survey was utilized to identify demographic and suicide-related factors associated with suicide ideation in a statewide sample of 1,736 adults. The PH-Q 9 Depression scale suicide ideation question was used to assess current suicide ideation in both the full sample and suicide exposed sub-sample. Being non-married and having previous suicide exposure were separately associated with higher risks of suicide ideation in the full sample. Being male, having increased suicide exposures, and having increased perceptions of closeness to the decedent increased risks, while older age decreased risks for the suicide exposed. Implications for future screening and research are discussed.

AB The purpose of the study was to assess the impact of immigration on suicide. An unmatched case-control design was employed. Data on cases were obtained on suicides in Riverside County, California, 1998 to 2001. Information on controls was obtained from the 2000 Census. Immigration increased suicide risk. Immigrant divorced persons were over 2 times more likely to commit suicide than natives. Single immigrants were nearly 2.6 times more likely to kill themselves than the native born. Shorter duration of residence was associated with higher suicide risk. Integration of immigrants in receiving societies is important for decreasing suicide. Policies aimed at reducing suicide should target more recent immigrants.

TI The Differentiating Role of State and Trait Hopelessness in Suicidal
   Ideation and Suicide Attempt
SO ARCHIVES OF SUICIDE RESEARCH

DT Article
DE state and trait hopelessness; suicidal ideation; suicide attempt
ID SCALE; RISK
AB With suicide being a leading cause of death in the United States, research must aim to increase efficacious prevention methods. The purpose of the present study was to gain greater understanding of the difference between suicidal ideation and suicide attempt. Previous research emphasizes the role of hopelessness in attempts and ideation (Bagge, Lamis, Nadorff, & Osman, 2014). Yet while hopelessness offers predictive value to suicide attempt, it fails in discriminating between suicide attempters and suicide ideators. Thus the goal was to examine the possible influence of different types of hopelessness on suicidal ideation and attempt. The experience of hopelessness as a temporary feeling, or state, versus as an enduring emotion, or trait, was examined in this study. The State-Trait Hopelessness Scale and 4 suicidal thought and suicidal behavior questions were assessed. Results of logistic regression analysis supported the hypothesis that state and trait hopelessness were differentially associated with ideation and attempt. While trait hopelessness was significantly positively associated with responses to all 4 suicidality questions (p's<0.001), state hopelessness was only positively related to responses to 1 ideation question (p<0.01). In all, these results point to the importance of understanding the role of different types of hopelessness in differentiating suicidal ideation and attempt.

AB Sabic, Hana, Brent Kious, Danielle Boxer, Colleen Fitzgerald, Colin Riley, Lindsay Scholl, Erin McGlade, Deborah Yurgelun-Todd, Perry F. Renshaw, and Douglas G. Kondo. Effect of altitude on veteran suicide rates. High Alt Med Biol. 00:000-000, 2019. Aims: Suicide rates in the general population in the United States are correlated with altitude. To explore factors contributing to suicide among military veterans, we examined the relationship between veteran state-level suicide rates and altitude for 2014, including firearm-related and nonfirearm-related rates. Methods: Pearson's coefficients were calculated for altitude and each outcome. Mixed linear models were used to determine the association between suicide and altitude while adjusting for demographic confounds. Results: State mean altitude was significantly correlated with total veteran suicide rate (r = 0.678, p < 0.0001), veteran firearm-related suicide rate (r = 0.578, p < 0.0001), and veteran nonfirearm suicide rate (r = 0.609, p < 0.0001). In mixed models, altitude was significantly correlated with total veteran suicide rate (beta = 0.331, p < 0.05), veteran firearm suicides (beta = 0.282, p < 0.05), and veteran nonfirearm suicides (beta = 0.393, p < 0.05). Conclusion: This study adds to evidence linking altitude and suicide rates, arguing for additional research into the relationship between altitude and suicide among veterans.

AB Cultures of honor facilitate certain forms of interpersonal violence. The authors suggest that these cultures might also promote values and expectations that could heighten suicide risk, such as strict gender-role standards and hypersensitivity to reputational threats, which could lead people living in such cultures to consider death as an option when failure occurs or reputation is threatened sufficiently. Study 1 shows that, controlling for a host of statewide covariates, honor states in the United States have significantly higher male and female suicide rates than do nonhonor states, particularly in nonmetropolitan areas among Whites. Study 2 shows that statewide levels of antidepressant prescriptions (an indicator of mental health resource utilization) are lower in honor states, whereas levels of major depression are higher, and statewide levels of depression are associated with suicide rates only among honor states. Finally, Study 3 shows that individual endorsement of honor ideology is positively associated with depression.

AB OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the views of physicians and physician leaders toward the legalization of physician-assisted suicide.
   DESIGN: Confidential mail questionnaire.
   PARTICIPANTS: A nationwide random sample of physicians of all ages and specialties, and all members of the American Medical Association (AMA) House of Delegates as of April 1996.
   MEASUREMENTS: Demographic and practice characteristics and attitude toward legalization of physician-assisted suicide.
   MAIN RESULTS: Usable questionnaires were returned by 658 of 930 eligible physicians in the nationwide random sample (71%) and 315 of 390 eligible physicians in the House of Delegates (81%). In the nationwide random sample, 44.5% favored legalization (16.4% definitely and 28.1% probably), 33.9% opposed legalization (20.4% definitely and 13.5% probably). and 22% were unsure. Opposition to legalization was strongly associated with self-defined politically conservative beliefs, religious affiliation, and the importance of religion to the respondent (P < .001). Among members of the AMA House of Delegates, 23.5% favored legalization (7.3% definitely and 16.2% probably), 61.6% opposed legalization (43.5% definitely and 18.1% probably), and 15% were unsure; their views differed significantly from those of the nationwide random sample (P < .001). Given the choice, a majority of both groups would prefer no law at all, with physician-assisted suicide being neither legal nor illegal.
   CONCLUSIONS: Members of the AMA House of Delegates strongly oppose physician-assisted suicide, but rank-and-file physicians show no consensus either for or against its legalization. Although the debate is sometimes adversarial, most physicians in the United States are uncertain or endorse moderate views on assisted suicide.

   COMMUNITY; SCOTLAND; STATES; RATES
AB Objective: This study explores suicide rates as a quality measure and identifies risk factors for suicide among psychiatric inpatients.
   Method: Data from a prospective mortality study of psychiatric inpatients from 128 U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals throughout the United States were utilized to examine the relationship of death by suicide to patient-level sociodemographic, clinical, and mental health service delivery characteristics, as well as to facility-level measures of service delivery. Data were collected on all patients discharged with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, major depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, or bipolar disorder (N = 121,933) between 1994 and 1998.
   Results: There were 481 suicides in the study sample. Several variables were associated with higher risk for suicide risk, including length of stay less than 14 days, poorer continuity of care, and lack of readmission within 6 months. These variables were significant even after adjustment for state suicide rates, the proportion of members of racial minority groups in the state population, and state-level social capital.
   Conclusions: Suicide rates are not likely to be a useful indicator of the quality of mental health care because of the instability of suicide rates, difficulty collecting data, and the lack of association between suicide and facility quality of care. The lack of association with facility-level variables suggests that systemic changes in these performance measures would be unlikely to significantly reduce suicide rates.

Untreated or undertreated depression poses a significant risk for suicide. Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. The emergency room provides an essential opportunity to screen for depression as well as suicide and to provide important and evidence-based interventions.

Thirty-four percent of these suicides were firearm-related. Finland led the participating nations in total and firearm-related suicide rates. An association was found between divorce rates and youth suicide rates, firearm-related suicide among youths, and suicide rates among young males. For a smaller sample of countries, an association was found between firearm availability and firearm-related suicide rates among youths and suicide rates among young males.

AB Suicide continues to be a serious public health problem. In response to this problem, a myriad of suicide prevention programs have been developed and employed across the United States. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of many of these programs is unknown because they have not been evaluated using rigorous methods. The Evidence-Based Practices Project (EBPP) for suicide prevention was created in 2002 to identify and promote evidence-based suicide prevention programs. In this paper the process and outcomes of the initial EBPP project within the context of the broader evidence-based movement are described, and the EBPPs creation of a best practice registry for suicide prevention is previewed.

AB Suicide among college students has received increased national attention over the past few decades, partly due to the publicity regarding high-profile suicide events on college campuses throughout the United States and its territories. Currently, suicide is identified as the second-leading cause of death in college students. Due to federal legislation such as the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act of 2004, many college campuses have been able to establish suicide prevention programs. This article describes how a psychiatric nurse faculty member successfully established a comprehensive suicide prevention program that was initially supported by grant funds from the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act.

AB Background: Despite decades of research, the rate of death from suicide is rising in the United States. Suicide is a complex and multifactorial phenomenon and, to date, no validated biomarkers that predict suicidal behavior have been identified. Only one FDA-approved drug to prevent suicide exists, and it is approved only for patients with schizophrenia. Although anti-suicide psychotherapeutic techniques exist, treatment takes time, and only preliminary data exist for rapid-acting therapies.
   Discussion: While more research into suicidal ideation and acute suicidal behavior is clearly needed, this research is fraught with both practical and ethical concerns. As a result, many investigators and bioethicists have called for restrictions on the types of research that individuals with suicidal behavior can participate in, despite the fact that the available empirical evidence suggests that this research can be done safely. This manuscript presents background information on the phenomenology of suicide, discusses the current state of treatment and prevention strategies, and reviews the practical and ethical issues surrounding suicide research in the context of available empirical data.
   Summary: Currently, the causes of suicide are poorly understood, in part due to the fact that very few studies have investigated the acute suicidal crisis. Although some biomarkers for predicting risk have been developed, none have been sufficiently validated. The most successful current interventions involve means restriction. However, while numerous hurdles face researchers, these are not insurmountable. The available evidence suggests that research into suicide can be conducted both safely and ethically.

AB This study used Texas state vital statistics records, 2006-2015, to examine firearm use rates among 28,010 suicide decedents by residential location (urbanized vs. all others). Firearms were responsible for 44% of all teenage suicides and 76-90% and 50-60% of suicides of men and women aged 60 + years, respectively, and firearm use rates remained steady for both genders during the study period. Logistic regression analysis showed a significantly higher firearm use rate (AOR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.28-1.42) among decedents who resided in nonurbanized areas. Differences in firearm use rates by residential location likely reflect higher firearm ownership in smaller communities and rural than urban areas. The findings underscore the importance of community- and individual-level suicide prevention strategies.

AB Suicidology and suicide prevention are relatively new fields of study in the United States, but they have made significant progress since their beginnings. This study aimed to identify the most impactful theories in the history of science and suicidology and the most impactful events in the suicide prevention movement. These theories and events were identified through expert nomination. The most impactful theories were those of Shneidman, Durkheim, and Joiner. The most impactful events included the opening of the first suicide prevention center and hotline, the founding of the American Association of Suicidology, and national publications (e.g., National Strategy for Suicide Prevention).

AB Using a nested case-control design drawing from a larger sample of 2272 adolescents, this study examined the characteristics of adolescents from Hong Kong (n = 99) and the United States (US) (n = 60), who indicated that they had made a suicide attempt at least once in the past, compared to their equally depressed sex- and age-matched counterparts who had not attempted suicide. The cross-cultural literature suggested three hypotheses which were tested: (a) depressive symptoms would differentiate between suicide attempters compared to non-attempters less in Hong Kong and more in the US; (b) discord in interpersonal relationships would be a more important distinguishing factor in suicide attempts in Hong Kong than in the US and (c) cognitive variables such as hopelessness would be less associated with suicide attempts in Hong Kong compared to the US. There were strong similarities in the two cultures with regard to characteristics that distinguished between attempters and matched controls. Hypotheses regarding cultural differences between attempters in Hong Kong and the US were not supported. Depression, current and lifetime suicide ideation, hopelessness, poor interpersonal relationships and exposure to suicide attempters and completers distinguished attempters from controls equally in the two cultures and in both genders. These findings do not support the proposition that depression is a less relevant variable in suicide attempts in Chinese versus western groups. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose The purpose of this study was to characterize suicide rates among patients with cancer in the United States and identify patient and disease characteristics associated with higher suicide rates. Prior studies, mostly in Europe, have suggested that patients with cancer may be at increased risk for suicide, but large cohort studies comparing patients with cancer with the general population have not been performed in the United States. Methods Patients in the study were residents of geographic areas served by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program who were diagnosed with cancer from 1973 to 2002. Comparisons with the general US population were based on mortality data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. This was a retrospective cohort study of suicide in persons with cancer. Results Among 3,594,750 SEER registry patients observed for 18,604,308 person-years, 5,838 suicides were identified, for an age-, sex-, and race- adjusted rate of 31.4/100,000 person-years. In contrast, the suicide rate in the general US population was 16.7/100,000 person-years. Higher suicide rates were associated with male sex, white race, and older age at diagnosis. The highest suicide risks were observed in patients with cancers of the lung and bronchus ( standardized mortality ratio [SMR] = 5.74; 95% CI, 5.30 to 6.22), stomach (SMR = 4.68; 95% CI, 3.81 to 5.70), oral cavity and pharynx (SMR = 3.66; 95% CI, 3.16 to 4.22), and larynx (SMR = 2.83; 95% CI, 2.31 to 3.44). SMRs were highest in the first 5 years after diagnosis with cancer. Conclusion Patients with cancer in the United States have nearly twice the incidence of suicide of the general population, and suicide rates vary among patients with cancers of different anatomic sites. Further examination of the psychological experience of patients with cancer, particularly that of patients with certain types of cancer, is warranted.

AB Suicides among public safety personnel (law enforcement, firefighters, and emergency medical services) are a growing concern across departments with occupational, mental health, and fitness for duty implications. Research on this topic has mostly focused on the law enforcement community. With an alarming rate of suicides among firefighters, the Houston Fire Department (HFD) endeavored to develop a suicide prevention program to address this issue. This article captures the history of suicide within the Houston Fire Department and summarizes each phase of the HFD Suicide Prevention Program in its development, purpose, methodology, and implementation.

AB The aim of this investigation is to outline correlates of suicide ideation among LGBT individuals living in Nebraska. A community-based participatory research approach was utilized to develop a 30-minute, online anonymous survey. Almost half of the sample had seriously considered suicide at some point in their lives. Significant correlates of increased likelihood of suicide ideation are age, gender, transgender identity, income, depression, and discrimination. Suicide ideation is a serious concern for the health of LGBT Nebraskans. Steps should be taken to incorporate individuals who fall into these high-risk categories in suicide outreach programs.

AB Background: Preliminary data indicate the suicide rate in the United States military decreased in 2013, but the National Guard saw a continued increase.
   Method: We examined the utility of the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicidal behavior (IPTS) in a sample of US military personnel drawn largely from the National Guard (n = 934; 77.7% male; 59.5% white).
   Results: Results indicated the interaction of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness predicted suicidal ideation and resolved plans and preparations for suicide. In each case, risk was greatest at higher levels of both predictors. Furthermore, results indicated the interaction of thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and acquired capability for suicide predicted prior suicide attempts. In this interaction term, the relationship between suicidal desire (thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness) and suicide attempts was significant and positive only at high levels of acquired capability. All analyses were cross-sectional.
   Conclusions: Results indicate the IPTS may be useful for conceptualizing suicide risk in the National Guard. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To estimate the protective effect of storing firearms locked or unloaded, or both, on the risk of suicide by firearms among people with relatively low intention to die.
   Design and setting: Cross sectional survey. The 1993 National Mortality Followback Survey of 22 957 deaths in the United States, representing 2.2 million people, conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics.
   Participants: Decedent's next of kin answered questions regarding various aspects of decedent's life to supplement information from death certificates.
   Main results: Compared with decedents who stored their firearm unlocked or loaded, those who stored their firearms locked or unloaded, or both, were less likely to commit suicide by firearms (locked: OR=0.39, 95% CI=0.24 to 0.66; unloaded OR=0.30, 95% CI=0.18 to 0.49).
   Conclusions: This study further supports the utility of devices and practices intended to reduce the likelihood of unauthorised or impulsive use of firearms.

AB BACKGROUND: Suicide accounts for two thirds of all deaths from intentional or violence-related injury and is a leading cause of death in the United States. Patterns of suicide have been well described among high-risk groups, but few studies have compared the circumstances related to suicides across all age groups. We sought to understand the epidemiology of suicide cases in Illinois and to characterize the risks and patterns for suicide among different age groups.
   METHODS: We used suicide data collected from the Illinois Violent Death Reporting System to assess demographics, method of suicide, circumstances, and mental health status among different age groups.
   RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2010, 3,016 suicides were reported; 692 (23%) were female, and the median age (n = 3,013) was 45 years (range, 10-98 years). The most common method/weapon types were hanging/strangulation (33%), firearm (32%) and poisoning (21%). Hanging was more common (74%) among young people aged 10 to 19 years, while firearm use was more common among elderly persons age 65 years and older (55%). The percentage of victims within an age group experiencing a crisis within two weeks before committing suicide was highest among 10- to 14-year-olds, while the risk factor of having a family member or friend die in the past 5 years was highest among older victims.
   CONCLUSION: The final analysis demonstrated age-related trends in suicide in Illinois, suggesting prevention programs should tailor services by age. Copyright (C) 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

DE Honor; suicide; NVDRS

AB Personal honor is associated with culturally defined honor-norms and its loss may predicate suicide. This exploratory study aimed to identify honor-related suicides within a public health dataset and to compare them to other suicides. Honor-related suicides (n = 163) were identified from case narratives within the National Violent Death Reporting System dataset. The distribution of factors associated with honor-related suicide were compared with all other suicides (n = 54,333). Honor-related suicides were more likely associated with leaving a suicide note; discussing suicidal intent; criminal-legal, job and relationship problems; and suffering depression while being less likely to seek help for distress. They were not associated with gender or suicide method. Honor suicides were identified and appear to be most associated with public challenges to personal reputation. Implications for suicide prevention are discussed.

AB Purpose of reviewTo provide an update on recent studies on suicide prevention in indigenous populations with a focus on recently colonised indigenous peoples in Canada, the United States, Australia and New Zealand.Recent findingsThere have been several recent reviews on suicide prevention in indigenous populations with high suicide rates. However most of them describe the problem and there is little new that is available on effective interventions. One randomized controlled trial of a package of measures focusing on cultural identity in Maori who had recently self-harmed compared to usual care found little effect on suicidal behavior but it did significantly reduce presentations to hospital for any reason after one year.SummaryThe reasons for the limited evidence include a lack of ring fenced funding and a lack of research infrastructure; the problem of high rates of suicide but small numbers; and the difficulty in creating effective collaborations between researchers and communities. Potential solutions include identifying specific research funding; improving capacity in indigenous research; putting effort into accurate identification and recording of ethnicity; and thinking about the problem of suicide in recently colonised populations as a global problem to enable large scale high quality studies to take place.

TI Handgun Legislation and Changes in Statewide Overall Suicide Rates
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH

DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; FIREARMS; OWNERSHIP
AB Objectives. To examine the extent to which 4 laws regulating handgun ownership were associated with statewide suicide rate changes.
   Methods. To test between-group differences in statewide suicide rate changes between 2013 and 2014 in all 50 states and the District of Columbia with and without specific laws, we ran analyses of covariance.
   Results. We found significant differences in suicide rate changes from 2013 to 2014 in states with mandatory waiting periods and universal background checks relative to states without such laws. States with both laws differed significantly from those with neither. No significant differences in rate changes were noted for open carry restrictions or gun lock requirements.
   Conclusions. Some state laws regulating aspects of handgun acquisition may be associated with lower statewide suicide rates. Laws regulating handgun storage and carrying practices may have a smaller effect, highlighting that legislation is likely most useful when its focus is on preventing gun ownership rather than regulating use and storage of guns already acquired.
   Public Health Implications. The findings add to the increasing evidence in support of a public health approach to the prevention of suicide via firearms, focusing on waiting periods and background checks.

AB Suicide is a significant issue in the United States and worldwide, and its prevention is a public health imperative. Primary care practices are an important setting for suicide prevention, as primary care providers have more frequent contact with patients at risk for suicide than any other type of health-care provider. The Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, in partnership with the Suicide Prevention Resource Center, has developed a Suicide Prevention Toolkit and an associated training curriculum. These resources support the education of primary care providers in evidence-based strategies for identifying and treating patients at risk for suicide. The application of this curriculum to post-graduate medical training is presented here.

AB ObjectiveCancer can trigger psychological distress, which may be associated with risk of suicide. We explored precipitating circumstances of suicides among decedents with and without a history of cancer.
   MethodsCoroner or medical examiner and law enforcement narratives of adult suicides were coded from 17 participating states in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Violent Death Reporting System during 2004 to 2013. Bivariate and multivariate analyses examined associations between cancer history and factors that precipitated suicide.
   ResultsOf 90581 suicides, 4182 decedents (4.6%) had a history of cancer. Significantly more decedents with a history of cancer (versus without) were male, non-Hispanic white, married, veterans, and aged 55 or older (P<.001). Decedents with a history of cancer were more likely to die of suicide by firearm and less likely to die of suicide by suffocation compared to poisoning. In matched case analyses controlling for demographic and recent circumstances, fewer decedents with a history of cancer had mental health problems, history of suicide attempts, alcohol use problems, intimate partner problems, financial problems, job problems, and recent crisis.
   ConclusionsFindings highlight the potential to identify high-risk populations for suicide prevention in clinical practice.

AB Investigations of lethal violence in the United States have primarily focused on Whites and/or African Americans, generally ignoring American Indians. Interestingly, statistics indicate that homicide and suicide rates among American Indians are often higher than other racial/ethnic groups within the United States. In an attempt to understand these lethal violence patterns, the current study utilizes the integrated model of suicide and homicide to investigate the structural and cultural factors that contribute to the production and/or direction of American Indian lethal violence. Using data from the Indian Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the U.S. Census Bureau, a modified lethal violence count (LVC) is used to examine the production of lethal violence among American Indians within U.S. counties as well as the suicide-homicide ratio (SHR) to unravel the etiological underpinnings of lethal violence. Findings indicate partial support for the integrated model with economic conditions and family disruption influencing these patterns of lethal violence.

AB This article provides 12-month prevalence rates of youth exposure to websites which encourage self-harm or suicide and examines whether such exposure is related to thoughts of self-harm and thoughts of suicide in the past 30 days. Data were collected via telephone from a nationally representative survey of 1560 Internet-using youth, ages 10-17 residing in the United States. One percent (95% CI: 0.5%, 1.5%) of youth reported visiting a website that encouraged self-harm or suicide. Youth who visited such websites were seven times more likely to say they had thought about killing themselves; and 11 times more likely to think about hurting themselves, even after adjusting for several known risk factors for thoughts of self-harm and thoughts of suicide. Given that youth thinking about self-harm and suicide are more likely to visit these sites, they may represent an opportunity for identification of youth in need of crisis intervention.

AB Objectives: (1) To quantify lethality of firearms relative to other suicide methods, (2) to quantify the extent to which suicide mortality may be reduced by limiting access to firearms.
   Methods: Data on suicides and hospitalised para-suicides that occurred in the state of Illinois from 1990 to 1997 were combined. Total number of episodes for each suicide method was estimated as the sum of the number of suicides and the number of para-suicides for that method. Gender and suicide method were used as proxies for intention to die, and estimated lethality of suicide methods within method-gender groups (for example, male firearm users). Logistic regression was used to quantify the lethality of firearms relative to other suicide methods. Excess mortality associated with the use of firearms was estimated by conservatively assuming that in the absence of firearms the next most lethal suicide method would be used.
   Results: From January 1990 to December 1997, among individuals 10 years or older in the state of Illinois, there were 37 352 hospital admissions for para-suicide and 10 287 completed suicides. Firearms are the most lethal suicide method. Episodes involving firearms are 2.6 times (95% CI 2.1 to 3.1) more lethal than those involving suffocation-the second most lethal suicide method. Preventing access to firearms can reduce the proportion of fatal firearms related suicides by 32% among minors, and 6.5% among adults.
   Conclusions: Limiting access to firearms is a potentially effective means of reducing suicide mortality.

AB Rates of suicide and associated costs are high and increasing in the United States. From 1999 through 2014, the age-adjusted suicide rate increased 24%, with the pace of increase being greater since 2006. American Indian and Alaska Native persons have significantly lower rates of suicides than other ethnic groups as elders despite experiencing some of the highest rates during adolescence. This article examines literature pertaining to suicide rates in American Indian and Alaska Native communities and proposes a framework for understanding their lower rates of suicide as elders. Such understanding offers opportunities for developing strategies for suicide prevention across lifespan.

AB Objectives. To assess whether the use of firearms explains rural-urban differences in suicide rates.
   Methods. We performed a retrospective analysis on all 6196 well-characterized adult suicides in Maryland from 2003 through 2015. We computed rate ratios by using census data and then stratified by sex, with adjustment for age and race.
   Results. Suicide rates were higher in rural compared with urban counties. However, the higher rural suicide rates were limited to firearm suicides (incident rate ratio [IRR] = 1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.20, 2.31). Nonfirearm suicide rates were not significantly higher in rural settings. Furthermore, 89% of firearm suicides occurred in men and the higher rural firearm suicide rate was limited to men (IRR = 1.36; 95% CI = 1.09, 1.69). Women were significantly less likely to complete suicide in rural areas (IRR = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.43, 0.94), regardless of method.
   Conclusions. Malefirearmuse drives the increased rate of suicide in rural areas. The opposite associations between urbanicity and suicide in men and women may be driven by the male preference for firearms as a method for committing suicide.

AB Religion impacts suicidality. One's degree of religiosity can potentially serve as a protective factor against suicidal behavior. To accurately assess risk of suicide, it is imperative to understand the role of religion in suicidality. PsycINFO and MEDLINE databases were searched for published articles on religion and suicide between 1980 and 2008. Epidemiological data on suicidality across four religions, and the influence of religion on suicidality are presented. Practice guidelines are presented for incorporating religiosity into suicide risk assessment. Suicide rates and risk and protective factors for suicide vary across religions. It is essential to assess for degree of religious commitment and involvement to accurately identify suicide risk.

AB Homicides followed by the suicide of the perpetrator constitute a serious form of interpersonal violence. Until now no study has directly compared homicide-suicides to other violent deaths from multiple countries, allowing for a better understanding of the nature of these violent acts. Using country-specific data, this study describes and compares the incidence and patterns of homicide-suicide as well as the relationship between homicide-suicide, homicide, suicide and domestic homicide in the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United States. The results indicate that cross-nationally, homicide-suicides are more likely than other types of lethal violence to involve a female victim, multiple victims, take place in a residential setting and to be committed by a firearm. Although homicide-suicides display many similarities across the different countries, differences exist regarding age and the use of firearms in the offence. This study indicates that homicides followed by suicides differ from both homicides and suicides in similar ways internationally. Cross-national differences in the availability of firearms may explain the international variation of homicide-suicide rates and patterns. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI States' spending for public welfare and their suicide rates, 1960 to
   1995: What is the problem?
SO JOURNAL OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASE
LA English
DT Article
ID MARITAL-STATUS; SOCIAL INTEGRATION; UNITED-STATES; DISSOLUTION; DIVORCE
AB Drawing on Durkheim's theory of social integration, this discussion reports on findings from a pooled time-series analysis of states' spending for public welfare and their suicide rates, controlling for states' divorce rates, population change rates, population density, unemployment rates, sex ratio, and racial composition. The analysis spans a 35-year period, 1960 to 1995, at six different data points: 1960, 1970, 1980, 1985, 1990, and 1995. The major hypothesis was that states' suicide rates would increase with decreases in per capita spending for public welfare, controlling for the variables listed above in three different models and using OLS to analyze the data. In the basic model, states' spending for public welfare showed no relationship to states' suicide rates; in the second model that controlled for data year and in the third model that controlled for both data year and state, its relationship was significant, but in a negative direction. Suicide rates increased in states that reduced their per capita expenditures for public welfare during the observational period. Of all the variables, the influence of divorce on suicide was the most persistent and pronounced, followed by the percentage of whites in states' populations. Whether the findings reflect an increase in the unendurable psychological pain associated with suicide, or the weakening of ties that bind individuals to each other and to the larger society (as measured by states' divorce rates and per capita expenditures for public welfare), or the vulnerabilities associated with race, states can help counter suicide trends and such negative influences as divorce as evidenced by states that spend more for public welfare and have lower suicide rates. Given that clinicians work with people experiencing the unendurable psychological pain associated with suicide, the findings from these analyses have relevance for their practice.

AB Combined murder-suicide is defined as homicide(s) followed by the perpetrator's suicide within 1 week of the homicide(s). This phenomenon is observed worldwide with generally similar incidence rates. The authors report data from New Hampshire, a population distinguished from those in previous United States studies by its location, racial homogeneity, nonurban character, and low homicide rate. Sixteen murder-suicide events occurred in New Hampshire between October 1995 and October 2000. This represents an incidence of 0.26 per 100,000 person-years, a rate similar to previously reported values. Murder-suicide events accounted for 14.7% of all homicides in the state, higher than previous studies but not unexpected in view of the state's lower homicide rate. Most perpetrators were male (94%), and most victims were female (88%), often in a spousal or consortial relationship. Firearms accounted for the majority of deaths. Various cofactors are examined, and a comparison of two recently proposed classification systems is discussed.

AB Mental health laws limiting involuntary admission to psychiatric hospitals to those assessed to be dangerous or at risk of harm to themselves or others (obligatory dangerousness criteria, ODC) have been introduced in almost every jurisdiction in the United States of America. Some mentally ill patients, who might have been admitted for treatment under previous laws, but who were not admitted because they were not considered 'dangerous', could subsequently have committed suicide. In order to investigate whether or not suicide rates increased after the introduction of ODC, we examined suicide statistics from 48 states and the District of Columbia.
   We aligned suicide statistics according to the year in which ODC were introduced in each jurisdiction. We then examined suicide rates in the 15 years before and after the introduction of ODC and trends in national and state suicide rates between 1960 and 1990. Meta-analysis was used to examine differences in suicide rates in the year immediately before and in the year immediately after the introduction of ODC.
   Between 1968 and 1977, the decade in which ODC were introduced in the majority of jurisdictions, national suicide rates increased from under 11 per 100,000 per annum to over 12.5 per 100,000 per annum. The increase in many jurisdictions occurred in the years immediately before the introduction of ODC. The introduction of ODC was associated with a non-significant increase in suicide rates in the 49 jurisdictions. There was a significant increase in suicide rates after the introduction of ODC in the 19 jurisdictions that introduced ODC prior to 1976.
   The introduction of ODC might have contributed to increased suicide rates prior to 1976. However, a simpler explanation for the finding is that national suicide rates were rising for other reasons in the same period. We did not find an increase in suicide rates in the jurisdictions where ODC mental health laws were introduced after 1976. Hence, the findings of this study do not support the conclusion that ODC laws have a measurable impact on suicide rates.

Several countries had an obvious decline in firearm suicides: Norway, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia; and New Zealand. Multilevel modeling of longitudinal data confirmed the effect of the proportion of households owning firearms. Legislation and regulatory measures reducing the availability of firearms in private households can distinctly strengthen the prevention of firearm suicides.

AB Research from the United Kingdom has suggested differential risk factors for suicide among South Asians when compared with the general population. Studies in the United Kingdom have found higher risk related to gender, marital status, and religion. It has been unknown how such demographic variables, acculturative stress, and lower rates of help-seeking influence rates of suicide among South Asians in the United States. In this study, a community sample of South Asians in the United States (n = 524) were asked to complete a demographic questionnaire and validated measures for levels of acculturation, help-seeking, and beliefs about reasons for living via web-based survey. South Asians' scores on the Reasons for Living Inventory (RFL) were significantly higher than the normative population across all subscales except the Survival and Coping Beliefs subscales. Demographic variables significantly related to RFL scores included gender (men with higher RFL scores), age (younger individuals with lower RFL scores), country of origin (those from India with lower RFL scores), education level (lower RFL scores in those with higher education levels), and income (those with lower incomes having lower RFL scores). Help-seeking attitudes were also significantly related to RFL scores. As a whole, the findings are consistent with U.K.-based studies and provide valuable comparative data on a U.S.-based sample.

AB As a public health problem, suicidal behavior demands a community-level response, including government action. We aimed to test whether support for suicide prevention in the United States has been independent from political party affiliation (Democrat and Republican). Actions from both political parties have supported suicide prevention efforts. The only differences in support based on party affiliation showed greater support from the Democrat Party in one instance, and the Republican Party in the other. The results were consistent with the hypothesis that degree of support for suicide prevention cannot be predicted solely by political party.

The present work considers instead the level of demonstrated happiness and unhappiness within groups, the latter proxied by the conditional probability of suicide within groups having a college education and those without. Those with college are not happier for it, in these terms, and actually have slightly higher rates of suicide than those without college, based on a recent US data.

AB A number of recent studies have allayed fears about antidepressants precipitating suicidal behaviour in young people. Indeed, antidepressants appear to be conspicuous by their absence of use in young people who die by suicide.
   Furthermore, there is concern that the reduced prescribing of antidepressants to young people may be associated with an increase in youth suicide in the United States.
   Although not first-line treatment, antidepressants should not be denied young people if psychosocial and cognitive behavioural therapies are not effective for major depression.

AB Objectives. We analyzed urban-rural differences in intentional firearm death. Methods. We analyzed 584629 deaths from 1989 to 1999 assigned to 3141 US counties, using negative binomial regressions and an 11-category urban-rural variable.
   Results. The most urban counties had 1.03 (95% confidence interval [Cl]=0.87, 1.20) times the adjusted firearm death rate of the most rural counties. The most rural counties experienced 1.54 (95% Cl = 1.29, 1.83) times the adjusted firearm suicide rate of the most urban. The most urban counties experienced 1.90 (95% Cl = 1.50, 2.40) times the adjusted firearm homicide rate of the most rural. Similar opposing trends were not found for nonfirearm suicide or homicide.
   Conclusions. Firearm suicide in rural counties is as important a public health problem as firearm homicide in urban counties. Policymakers should become aware that intentional firearm deaths affect all types of communities in the United States.

AB According to the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates for the year 2020, approximately 1.5 million people will commit suicide, and at least 10 times that many will make an attempt. This paper offers a brief overview of the current state of the epidemiology of suicide, a burgeoning public health problem. The information provided is based in large measure on reports of suicide mortality from 130/193 countries. In order to contextualize these data, this paper explores the contribution of both individual and sociocultural factors that influence suicidal behavior, from which much has been learned. Outlining the history of attempts by international and national organizations like WHO, United Nations, member states in the European community and other countries to regularize identification and suicide reporting procedures, this paper also demonstrates that serious knowledge gaps remain. Minimal requirements for successful evidence-based interventions are presented. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB In line with previous research on suicide and social contagion, there has been widespread speculation that mass killingswhich often involve suicidal offendersare socially contagious for up to 14days. This study tested these claims by making comparisons (i) between observed chronological clusters of mass killings in the United States from 2006 to 2013 and clusters in 500 simulations containing 116,000 randomly generated dates, and then (ii) between observed mass killings receiving varying levels of public attention. No evidence of short-term contagion was found, although longer term copycat effects may exist. Further scholarly and policy implications are discussed.

AB Introduction: Suicide rates and the proportion of alcohol-involved suicides rose during the 2008-2009 recession. Associations between county-level poverty, foreclosures, and unemployment and suicide rates and proportion of alcohol-involved suicides were investigated.
   Methods: In 2015, National Violent Death Reporting System data from 16 states in 2005-2011 were utilized to calculate suicide rates and a measure of alcohol involvement in suicides at the county level. Panel models with year and state fixed effects included county-level measures of unemployment, foreclosure, and poverty rates.
   Results: Poverty rates were strongly associated with suicide rates for both genders and all age groups, were positively associated with alcohol involvement in suicides for men aged 45-64 years, and negatively associated for men aged 20-44 years. Foreclosure rates were negatively associated with suicide rates for women and those aged >= 65 years but positively related for those aged 45-64 years. Unemployment rate effects on suicide rates were mediated by poverty rates in all groups.
   Conclusions: Population risk of suicide was most clearly associated with county-level poverty rates, indicating that programs addressing area poverty should be targeted for reducing suicide risk. Poverty rates were also associated with increased alcohol involvement for men aged 45-64 years, indicating a role for alcohol in suicide for this working-aged group. However, negative associations between economic indicators and alcohol involvement were found for four groups, suggesting that non-economic factors or more general economic effects not captured by these indicators may have played a larger role in alcohol-related suicide increases.

AB A seasonal suicide peak in spring is highly replicated, but its specific cause is unknown. We reviewed the literature on suicide risk factors which can be associated with seasonal variation of suicide rates, assessing published articles from 1979 to 2011. Such risk factors include environmental determinants, including physical, chemical, and biological factors. We also summarized the influence of potential demographic and clinical characteristics such as age, gender, month of birth, socioeconomic status, methods of prior suicide attempt, and comorbid psychiatric and medical diseases. Comprehensive evaluation of risk factors which could be linked to the seasonal variation in suicide is important, not only to identify the major driving force for the seasonality of suicide, but also could lead to better suicide prevention in general.

AB This study investigated the cross-cultural relevance and validity of the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (ITS) utilizing young adult samples from South Korea (n=554) and the United States (U.S.; n=390). To examine the ITS, all participants completed self-report questionnaires measuring Thwarted Belongingness, Perceived Burdensomeness, and Capability for Suicide. We examined whether each construct significantly predicted the severity of suicidal risk in both samples. We also determined whether the strength of the effects of Thwarted Belongingness and Perceived Burdensomeness on suicidal ideation differed between the two samples due to the greater degree of importance placed on interpersonal relationships in collectivistic cultures such as South Korea. Structural equation modeling was used to examine these hypotheses. Thwarted Belongingness, Perceived Burdensomeness, and Capability for Suicide significantly predicted elevated suicidal risk. However, there were no significant differences in the paths from Thwarted Belongingness or Perceived Burdensomeness to suicide risk between the South Korean and U.S. samples. These findings support the cross-cultural relevance and applicability of the ITS, whereby Thwarted Belongingness and Perceived Burdensomeness serve as indicators of suicide risk in both Western (U.S.) and East Asian (Korean) samples.

AB Objective: Previous studies have suggested that suicide rates are elevated among cancer patients relative to the general population. In this analysis, we comprehensively evaluated characteristics associated with higher suicide rates among patients with cancers of the digestive system.
   Methods: Using the United States Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we identified all patients diagnosed with digestive system cancers during 2000 to 2014. Patients were classified as having died of suicide if their cause of death in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results was listed as "suicide and self-inflicted injury." Suicide rates were compared to age-, sex-, and race-adjusted rates in the general population.
   Results: A total of 881 suicides were identified among 856 293 patients diagnosed with digestive system cancers. The suicide rate in this population was 32.8 per 100 000 person-years and was nearly twice that in the general population (standardized mortality ratio [SMR] = 1.91; 95% CI, 1.79-2.04). Suicide rates were significantly elevated for all cancer sites but were highest for esophageal (SMR = 5.03), pancreatic (SMR = 5.28), stomach (SMR = 2.84), and liver (SMR = 2.14) cancers. Standardized mortality ratios for suicide were highest within the first 5 years of diagnosis and increased with age at diagnosis for all sites except colon and stomach.
   Conclusions: Patients with cancers of the digestive system have a higher incidence of suicide than the general population. Suicide rates among esophageal and pancreatic cancer patients are more than 5 times general population rates. The involvement of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals may be a critical component of cancer care for these high-risk patient subgroups.

AB The compilation of all suicidal causes of death attained the third highest ranking of mortality between the ages of 15 and 24 following unintentional deaths and homicide in the United States, accounting for approximately 4000 deaths in 2002. A variety of biopsychosocial factors may contribute to adolescent suicidal behavior, including psychiatric disorders, risk-taking behaviors, and lack of a cohesive family unit. The authors conducted a 10-year (1993-2002) retrospective review of 108 Medical Examiner cases of suicide ages 11-17 and 358 cases ages 18-24 in Kentucky, which represents two thirds of the Coroner cases in the state. The majority of victims were male and Caucasian. The major causes of death were the same for the two age groups, specifically, firearm injury (72.2% and 70.7%), hanging (22.2% and 18.7%), and drug intoxication (2.8% and 5.3%). An integrated Coroner-Medical Examiner system profits in the public health arena by providing collaborative research data for policy decisions. The prevalence of youth suicide by firearm should prompt further discussion regarding ways to better identify high-risk adolescents and young adults and restrict pediatric access to unsecured household firearms.

AB Suicide is a serious but preventable public health issue. Several previous studies have revealed a positive association between altitude and suicide rates at the county level in the contiguous United States. We assessed the association between suicide rates and altitude using a cross-county ecological study design. Data on suicide rates were obtained from a Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS), maintained by the U.S. National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC). Altitude data were collected from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). We employed an ordinary least square (OLS) regression to model the association between altitude and suicide rates in 3064 counties in the contiguous U.S. We conducted a geographically weighted regression (GWR) to examine the spatially varying relationship between suicide rates and altitude after controlling for several well-established covariates. A significant positive association between altitude and suicide rates (average county rates between 2008 and 2014) was found in the dataset in the OLS model (R-2 = 0.483, p < 0.001). Our GWR model fitted the data better, as indicated by an improved R2 (average: 0.62; range: 0.21-0.64) and a lower Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) value (13,593.68 vs. 14,432.14 in the OLS model). The GWR model also significantly reduced the spatial autocorrelation, as indicated by Moran's I test statistic (Moran's I = 0.171; z = 33.656; p < 0.001 vs. Moran's I = 0.323; z = 63.526; p < 0.001 in the OLS model). In addition, a stronger positive relationship was detected in areas of the northern regions, northern plain regions, and southeastern regions in the U.S. Our study confirmed a varying overall positive relationship between altitude and suicide. Future research may consider controlling more predictor variables in regression models, such as firearm ownership, religion, and access to mental health services.

AB Objective: Prior research has suggested an association between suicide and certain occupations. The aim of the present study was to report on suicide rates in selected occupations in Queensland (QLD).
   Method: Suicide mortality data from the QLD Suicide Register and population data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics were obtained for the period 1990-2006. Suicide rates were calculated for each occupational group and compared to rates within the general population (15-64 year age group) and the employed population of QLD.
   Results: There was significantly higher risk of suicide for male subjects in the agricultural, transport and construction sectors of QLD. High suicide rates were also found in female nurses, artists, agricultural workers and cleaners, while education professionals (of both genders) appeared at lower risk.
   Conclusions: The significantly higher suicide rates for employees of the agriculture, construction, and transport industries indicate a need for further research into the occupation-specific conditions and individual or other social-environmental factors that may accentuate suicide risk within these professions.

TI Are Suicide Note Writers Representative of All Suicides? Analysis of the
   National Violent Death Reporting System
SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
AB While suicide notes can offer insights into the causes of suicide and clues for prevention, there is disagreement regarding the degree to which note leavers are representative of the general population of suicides. Previous relevant research on the United States is marked by a series of limitations: small local samples, an over focus on demographic constructs, and lack of multivariable analysis. This study uses a large national sample, a wide range of predictor variables, and multivariable statistical techniques to estimate more reliable similarities and differences between note leavers and other suicides. All data are taken from the National Violent Death Reporting System, which covers 17 states. A total of 9,048 note writers were compared to 21,522 other suicides in terms of 39 variables. In both bivariable (32/39 variables) and multivariable analyses (30/39 variables), note leavers differed from other suicides in most demographic variables, stressful life events, psychiatric issues, and methods of suicide. The national evidence suggests that caution be exercised in generalizing patterns found among writers of suicide notes to suicides in general. This is the first analysis of suicide notes using US data on the issue.

TI State Firearm Laws and Interstate Firearm Deaths From Homicide and

   County
SO JAMA INTERNAL MEDICINE
LA English

AB IMPORTANCE Firearm laws in one state may be associated with increased firearm death rates from homicide and suicide in neighboring states.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether counties located closer to states with lenient firearm policies have higher firearm death rates.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross- sectional study of firearm death rates by county for January 2010 to December 2014 examined data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for firearm suicide and homicide decedents for 3108 counties in the 48 contiguous states of the United States.
   EXPOSURES Each county was assigned 2 scores, a state policy score (range, 0-12) based on the strength of its state firearm laws, and an interstate policy score (range, -1.33 to 8.31) based on the sum of population-weighted and distance-decayed policy scores for all other states. Counties were divided into those with low, medium, and high home state and interstate policy scores.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES County-level rates of firearm, nonfirearm, and total homicide and suicide. With multilevel Bayesian spatial Poisson models, we generated incidence rate ratios (IRR) comparing incidence rates between each group of counties and the reference group, counties with high home state and high interstate policy scores. RESULTS Stronger firearm laws in a state were associated with lower firearm suicide rates and lower overall suicide rates regardless of the strength of the other states' laws. Counties with low state scores had the highest rates of firearm suicide. Rates were similar across levels of interstate policy score (low: IRR, 1.34; 95% credible interval [CI], 1.11-1.65; medium: IRR, 1.36, (95% CI, 1.15-1.65; and high: IRR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.20-1.73). Counties with low state and low or medium interstate policy scores had the highest rates of firearm homicide. Counties with low home state and interstate scores had higher firearm homicide rates (IRR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.02-1.88) and overall homicide rates (IRR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.03-1.67). Counties in states with low firearm policy scores had lower rates of firearm homicide only if the interstate firearm policy score was high.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Strong state firearm policies were associated with lower suicide rates regardless of other states' laws. Strong policies were associated with lower homicide rates, and strong interstate policies were also associated with lower homicide rates, where home state policies were permissive. Strengthening state firearm policiesmay prevent firearm suicide and homicide, with benefits that may extend beyond state lines.

TI BMI and Rates of Suicide in the United States: An Ecological Analysis
SO OBESITY

   ASSOCIATION; HOMICIDE; OBESITY; DEATHS; AVAILABILITY; POPULATION
AB BMI has been inversely associated with risk of completed suicide in several cohort studies, but putative mechanisms for this association and its generalizability throughout the United States are uncertain. We ascertained recent population-based, state-level data on rates of obesity, completed suicide (by method), firearm ownership, smoking, major depression, income, education, white race, and nonmetropolitan residence, compiled from federal agencies and surveys, and determined the adjusted population-weighted correlations of statewide obesity rates with measures of completed and attempted suicide. Statewide prevalence of obesity was strongly inversely correlated with age-adjusted suicide rate (multivariable-adjusted r = -0.66; P < 0.001). The correlation was somewhat stronger for rates of nonfirearm-related (r = -0.75; P < 0.001) than firearm-related suicides (r = -0.53; P < 0.001), and was of similar magnitude as the positive correlations of firearm prevalence with suicide rate (r = 0.75; P < 0.001) or of obesity with prevalence of diabetes (r = 0.41; P = 0.006). In analyses of fatal and nonfatal suicidal acts, obesity rates were inversely correlated with rates of suicidal acts using firearms (r = -0.53; P = 0.02) and suffocation (r = -0.76; P < 0.001) but not other methods. Obesity rates were also inversely correlated with the case-fatality ratios of acts using poisoning (r = -0.51; P = 0.01). Thus, statewide rates of obesity are strongly inversely correlated with rates of completed suicide in multivariable analyses, a finding that appears to relate to fewer attempts by suffocation and a lower case-fatality ratio for poisonings, although the mechanism for the inverse correlation with firearm-related suicides requires further elucidation.

ID SELF-INJURY; MILITARY; THERAPY; PREVENTION; RELIABILITY; VALIDITY;
   IDEATORS; REASONS; SAMPLE; TRIAL
AB Cross-sectional and retrospective studies indicate that a primary motive for suicidal behavior among United States soldiers is the desire to alleviate or reduce emotional distress. This is also the aim of psychological services designed to prevent suicidal behavior. The prospective association of emotion relief (and other) motives with future suicidal behavior has yet to be examined, however. In a high-risk sample of 97 active duty soldiers presenting for an emergency behavioral health appointment, suicide motives were examined and compared between those with and without a history of suicide attempts. Results indicated that soldiers with a history of suicide attempts reported significantly more emotion relief (i.e., reducing or avoiding negative emotional states) and feeling generation (i.e., creating positive emotional states) motives. Feeling generation motives were positively correlated with severity of suicide ideation, hopelessness, depression, and posttraumatic stress, especially among those with a prior suicide attempt. Among soldiers with no previous suicide attempts, emotion relief motives were associated with significantly increased risk for suicide attempt during the 6-month follow-up assessment. Among soldiers with a prior attempt, emotion relief motives were not associated with later suicide attempts. Results provide preliminary evidence suggesting the desire to reduce or avoid negative emotional states may facilitate the emergence of a first suicide attempt among treatment-seeking Soldiers.

TI Effects of changes in permit-to-purchase handgun laws in Connecticut and

SO PREVENTIVE MEDICINE

ID ACCESS
AB Objective. In 2013, more than 40,000 individuals died from suicide in the United States. Restricting access to lethal means has the potential to prevent suicide, as suicidal thoughts are often transient. Permit-to-purchase (PTP) laws for handguns could potentially reduce suicides by making it more difficult for persons at risk of suicide to purchase a handgun.
   Methods. We used a quasi-experimental research design with annual, state-level suicide data to evaluate changes to PTP laws in Connecticut and Missouri. Data were analyzed for 1981-2012. We used synthetic control modeling as the primary method to estimate policy effects. This methodology provided better prediction of pre-PTP-law-change trends in the two states with PTP law changes than econometric models and is thus likely to provide more accurate estimates of policy effects.
   Results. The synthetic control model estimated a 15.4% reduction in firearm suicide rates associated with Connecticut's PTP law. Missouri's PTP law repeal was associated with a 16.1% increase in firearm suicide rates. Evidence that PTP laws were associated with non-firearm suicide rates was mixed in Connecticut and negative in Missouri.
   Conclusion. The findings are consistent with prior research linking firearm availability to increased risk of suicide and lower suicide risks associated with PTP handgun laws. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT VISITS; UNITED-STATES; TEMPERATURE; ENGLAND;

AB Background: Suicide attempts by self-poisoning utilizing prescription opioids account for more than half of prescription drug abuse and misuse emergency calls received by poison centers. Additionally seasonal suicidal behavior using other means is a commonly replicated finding. We hypothesized seasonal behavior would exist in individuals using opioid medication as a suicide means, and that this pattern would change at different latitudes in the United States.
   Methods: We used a harmonic regression strategy to investigate sinusoidal seasonal variations of suicidal behavior utilizing prescription opioids, and to contrast changes in seasonal behavior by latitude within the United Stares. Further, we investigated associations between suicide frequency utilizing opioid medication and frequency of dispensed opioid prescriptions.
   Results: Seasonal patterns were identified; overall, all harmonic terms were significant (p < 0.05). Interaction terms of harmonic by latitude and harmonic by gender also were significant (p < 0.05). After stratification, females had significant harmonic terms at all latitudes. A changing peak time period with latitude also was observed, such that the peak appeared later at more southern latitudes. Additionally, increased dispensed prescriptions rates per population were associated with increased suicidal behavior utilizing prescription opioids.
   Limitations: This study has limitations due to its ecological nature and to missing data that may inform our understanding of suicide risk factors, such as marital status and socio-economic status.
   Conclusion: Suicidal behavior with prescription opioids follows a seasonal pattern that changes with latitude within the United States. Further, increased accessibility may contribute to increased suicidal attempt rates utilizing prescription opioids. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

AB There have been few reports on the effect of suicide death on family members' attitudes toward suicide. lit order to estimate the extent to which suicide death affects attitudes toward suicide among family members of suicides, data of 264 informants from a case-control psychological autopsy study were analyzed. The results showed that there were no significant differences in attitudes toward suicide, measured by the General Social Survey's (GSS) four questions, between informants of suicides and informants of living controls, between family members of suicides and family members of living controls, or between family members of suicides and non-family members of suicides. Our findings did not support the hypothesis that suicide death affects the attitudes toward suicide in suicides' family members. However, some factors were found to be related to the pro-suicide attitudes measured by the four questions included in the GSS.

AB This study examined the relationship of 16 variables with homicide, suicide, and unintentional firearm deaths. This cross-sectional analysis, using adjusted partial correlation coefficients, found that state-level firearm homicide rates significantly varied by the prevalence of firearms and by percent of the population which was African American. Whereas, state-level variations in firearm suicide mortality significantly varied by firearm prevalence, per capita alcohol consumption, percent of the population which was African American, and level of urbanization. None of the variables were significantly (pless than or equal to.05) related to state-level variations in unintentional firearm mortality. Furthermore, state gun laws had only a limited effect on firearm-related homicide deaths. Although the current study cannot determine causation, firearm mortality in its various forms is most commonly related to the prevalence of firearms and the percent of the population that is African American.

AB Objectives
   (1) To test whether public psychiatric bed reduction may increase suicide rates; (2) to investigate whether the supply of private hospital psychiatric beds-separately for not-for-profit and for-profit-can substitute for public bed reduction without increasing suicides; and (3) to examine whether the level of community mental health resources moderates the relationship between public bed reduction and suicide rates.
   Methods
   We examined state-level variation in suicide rates in relation to psychiatric beds and community mental health spending in the United States for the years 1982-1998. We categorize psychiatric beds separately for public, not-for-profit, and for-profit hospitals.
   Principal Findings
   Reduced public psychiatric bed supply was found to increase suicide rates. We found no evidence that not-for-profit or for-profit bed supply compensates for public bed reductions. However, greater community mental health spending buffers the adverse effect of public bed reductions on suicide. We estimate that in 2008, an additional decline in public psychiatric hospital beds would raise suicide rates for almost all states.
   Conclusions
   Downsizing of public inpatient mental health services may increase suicide rates. Nevertheless, an increase in community mental health funding may be promising.

TI Variable Classification of Drug-Intoxication Suicides across US States:
   A Partial Artifact of Forensics?
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID OF-DEATH ANALYSIS; UNITED-STATES; UNDETERMINED DEATHS; MEDICAL
   EXAMINERS; PUBLIC-HEALTH; MORTALITY; CORONERS; MISCLASSIFICATION;
   TRENDS; COMORBIDITY
AB Background
   The 21st-century epidemic of pharmaceutical and other drug-intoxication deaths in the United States (US) has likely precipitated an increase in misclassified, undercounted suicides. Drug-intoxication suicides are highly prone to be misclassified as accident or undetermined. Misclassification adversely impacts suicide and other injury mortality surveillance, etiologic understanding, prevention, and hence clinical and public health policy formation and practice.
   Objective
   To evaluate whether observed variation in the relative magnitude of drug-intoxication suicides across US states is a partial artifact of the scope and quality of toxicological testing and type of medicolegal death investigation system.
   Methods
   This was a national, state-based, ecological study of 111,583 drug-intoxication fatalities, whose manner of death was suicide, accident, or undetermined. The proportion of (nonhomicide) drug-intoxication deaths classified by medical examiners and coroners as suicide was analyzed relative to the proportion of death certificates citing one or more specific drugs and two types of state death investigation systems. Our model incorporated five sociodemographic covariates. Data covered the period 2008-2010, and derived from NCHS's Multiple Cause-of-Death public use files.
   Results
   Across states, the proportion of drug-intoxication suicides ranged from 0.058 in Louisiana to 0.286 in South Dakota and the rate from 1 per 100,000 population in North Dakota to 4 in New Mexico. There was a low correlation between combined accident and undetermined drug-intoxication death rates and corresponding suicide rates (Spearman's rho =0.38; p<0.01). Citation of 1 or more specific drugs on the death certificate was positively associated with the relative odds of a state classifying a nonhomicide drug-intoxication death as suicide rather than accident or undetermined, adjusting for region and type of state death investigation system (odds ratio, 1.062; 95% CI, 1.016-1.110). Region, too, was a significant predictor. Relative to the South, a 10% increase in drug citation was associated with 43% (95% CI, 11%-83%), 41% (95% CI, 7%-85%), and 33% (95% CI, 1%-76%) higher odds of a suicide classification in the West, Midwest, and Northeast, respectively.
   Conclusion
   Large interstate variation in the relative magnitude of nonhomicide drug-intoxication deaths classified as suicide by medical examiners and coroners in the US appears partially an artifact of geographic region and degree of toxicological assessment in the case ascertainment process. Etiologic understanding and prevention of drug-induced suicides and other drug-intoxication deaths first require rigorous standardization involving accurate concepts, definitions, and case ascertainment.

AB Despite well-documented increases in completed suicides among children, accurate knowledge of the characteristics of these suicides is very limited. The aim of this study was to investigate general characteristics of suicide among children and adolescents in the province of Istanbul and to evaluate obtained results in the light of the literature. Data were collected from autopsy records of the Morgue Department of Institute of Forensic Medicine, Istanbul. General characteristics of completed suicides among children and adolescents between 2001 and 2005 were retrospectively reviewed. The study included 176 suicides aged 9-19 years. The overwhelming majority of the suicides (92%) were aged 15-19 years. More than half of the suicides (60%) were male. The most frequent means of suicide was hanging (55%) followed by firearms (20%) and jump or descent from height (15%).

AB Our laboratory was interested in epidemiological and toxicological findings from air-craft-assisted pilot suicides. Between 1993-2002 there were 3,648 fatal aviation accidents. The NTSB determined that 16 were aircraft-assisted suicides; 15 from intentional crashing of an aircraft and 1 from exiting the aircraft while in-flight. All pilots involved in these aircraft-assisted suicides were male, with a median age of 40 years. Seven of the 14 pilots for which specimens were available were positive for disqualifying substances. Based on the few cases conclusively attributed to suicide, death by the intentional crashing of an aircraft appears to be an infrequent and uncommon event.

AB According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide is the second leading cause of death in American teenagers, and is a growing public health concern. This study uses multivariable logistic regression to investigate the independent relationship between suicide ideation and sleep duration in teenagers using the 2015 Youth Behavior Risk Surveillance Study, controlling for demographic, behavioral, and other factors found to be associated. Sleep durations of 4-5 hours and 6-7 hours per night were associated with approximately 75-80% and 20-40% increased adjusted odds of suicide ideation, as compared to teens sleeping the recommended 8 hours or more, and should be considered as a potential important indicator for adolescent suicidal ideation in primary-care screens.

DE homicide; suicide; violence; social theory
ID UNITED-STATES
AB In this paper, we provide a narrative review of the theoretical discourse and empirical research on the relationship between homicide and suicide. Understanding of homicide and suicide has evolved from religious condemnation during the Middle Ages, to medicalization in the 1800s, and socialization in the 1900s. There is a long historical tradition of treating homicide and suicide as a single phenomenon. Contemporary thought, the stream analogy, posits that homicide and suicide are acts of violence differentiated only by the direction of aggression. Empirical research has provided modest evidence supporting the stream analogy theory. A more comprehensive framework that incorporates cultural domains is needed to advance the research field on homicide and suicide.

ID UNITED-STATES; STATISTICS; MORTALITY; ADEQUACY; DEATHS
AB Objectives. This study investigated the effect of misclassification of accidental deaths and undetermined deaths on age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-specific adolescent suicide rates from 1979 through 1994.
   Methods. Official mortality data were used to present suicide mortality trends. Two estimates of misclassified suicides in other death categories were applied to calculate "corrected" trends of adolescent suicide.
   Results. The corrected trends showed a downward adjustment for Black adolescent males and young adolescents. This result does not, however, substantially alter the trend toward a recent increase in suicide in these groups.
   Conclusions. Despite misclassification, the true direction of trends in adolescent suicide is reflected in recent official:data. However, suicide rates should continuously be tested for misclassification, mainly in populations with proportionately high accidental and undetermined death rates.

AB The United States military began to experience a steady increase in suicide rates across all service branches at the inception of the wars in Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003). As the number of suicide deaths increased, so did the number of affected survivors who seek postvention support. Unique issues that accompany suicide death may expose survivors to a more distressing and complicated grief process. Peer support has clinically been observed to be widely utilized by suicide loss survivors. This article explores unique issues accompanying military suicide loss, potential benefits of postvention peer-based support, clinical considerations, and future directions.

AB Only a small fraction of suicide attempts are fatal. Nonfatal attempts might elicit resources and care from others, enhancing economic prospects for those who survive. I expand the standard utility-maximizing model of suicide to include a nontrivial probability of survival and the possibility that the utility function may be affected by the suicide attempt. This expanded model predicts that suicide attempts are more likely when future income may be positively affected by the attempt, conditional on survival. Data from the National Comorbidity Survey show that ex post, individuals who made a suicide attempt had higher incomes than peers who seriously considered suicide but who never made a suicide attempt. Moreover, those who reported making the most serious attempts experienced the largest subsequent effects on income.

AB Firearms are utilized in approximately half of all US suicides, making them a serious public health concern and a target of suicide prevention efforts. Practical capability influences the transition from suicidal ideation to action and is particularly relevant to firearm suicide. Firearm ownership, experience using firearms, unsafe firearm storage, and high cultural acceptability of firearms increase risk for death by firearm suicide. Means safety strategies, which emphasize the reduction of practical capability for suicide through the limitation of access to and safe storage of firearms, are effective in preventing suicide and include interventions such as lethal means counseling, firearm legislation, and promoting safe storage practices. Public health interventions aimed at reducing firearm suicide are critical topics for continued research.

AB Suicide rates and risk and protective factors vary across religions. There has been a significant increase in research in the area of religion and suicide since the article, "Religion and Suicide," reviewed these issues in 2009. This current article provides an updated review of the research since the original article was published. PsycINFO, MEDLINE, SocINDEX, and CINAHL databases were searched for articles on religion and suicide published between 2008 and 2017. Epidemiological data on suicidality and risk and protective factors across religions are explored. Updated general practice guidelines are provided, and areas for future research are identified.

AB The current study aimed to address the discrepancy between suicide rates in the military and general population by comparing facets of the interpersonal theory of suicide between civilians with multiple suicide attempts and U.S. military personnel. Military personnel exhibited higher levels of capability for suicide but lower levels of perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness than civilian multiple attempters. When comparing only personnel endorsing ideation and civilian multiple attempters, the significant difference for capability remained, but the differences for perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness became nonsignificant. Results suggest the emergence of ideation places personnel at a greater risk for suicide than many civilian multiple attempters.

The distribution of suicide rates from 1991-1994 in the United States for people of different status categories of age, gender, education, marital status, and race/ethnicity is compared to the distribution of the population in these same status categories. The distribution of suicide rates for the status configurations analyzed herein differ significantly from the population distribution for these same status configurations. Gibbs and Martin's theory accurately describes variation in suicide rates.

ID VIOLENCE
AB This article uses national data on prisons in the United States to examine the effects of deprivation, overcrowding, and their interaction on the likelihood of prison suicide. Our central argument is that overcrowding is a pivotal feature of prison environments that conditions the effects of deprivation. Findings provide substantial support for this hypothesis. For example, at low levels of overcrowding, minimum-security facilities evidence a lower probability of prison suicide, but at high levels, they are as likely to experience a suicide as their medium- and maximum-security counterparts. Theoretical and policy implications of the findings art discussed.

AB Clinical and some epidemiological data conflict concerning the likelihood of suicide attempt in individuals with panic disorder (PD). The purpose of this study was to illuminate the panic disorder-suicide attempt association in the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS; R. C. Kessler et al., 1994). Specifically, suicide attempt histories of those 5,872 respondents answering "yes" or "no" to the suicide attempt question were regressed against lifetime diagnostic histories. Lifetime PD history, in the presence of other disorders, was unrelated to elevated risk of suicide attempt and did not account for additional variance. PD respondents who had made a suicide attempt were characterized by comorbidity. Epidemiological respondents with lifetime histories of PD alone are not at heightened risk for self-reported suicide attempt.

DE assisted suicide; euthanasia; international; suicide
AB Suicide, assisted suicide and euthanasia are elusive and controversial issues worldwide. To discuss such issues from only one perspective may be limiting. Therefore, this paper was written by authors from various regions, each of whom has been asked to reflect on the issues. The countries/cultures are: Australia, China, Cuba, Ireland, India, Japan, Russia, South Africa, The Netherlands, North America (Turtle Island) and United States. Historically and today, suicide is viewed differently. Assisted suicide and euthanasia are equally seen from multifarious perspectives. Highlighting development in the Netherlands, Australia's Northern Territory and Japan (ie. the famous Yamanouchi Case), the review shows growing re-examination of the right to die. There appear, however, to be no uniform legal and ethical positions. Further debate and discussion globally is needed to avoid myopic perspectives.

TI Antidepressants and suicide risk in the United States, 1985-1999

DT Article
ID AFFECTIVE-DISORDERS; CLINICAL ASPECTS; NATIONAL TRENDS; SAN-DIEGO;
   PREVENTION; DEPRESSION; ASSOCIATION; COMORBIDITY; UNEMPLOYMENT;
   MORTALITY
AB Background: The role of antidepressants in suicide prevention is a major public health question. An association was hypothesized between the increase in the use of non-tricyclic antidepressant medications in the United States and the decline in the suicide rate during the years 1985-1999.
   Method: The relationships between the suicide, antidepressant prescription, unemployment, and alcoholic beverage consumption rates were studied using generalized linear models. Suicide rates by antidepressant overdose were compared in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).
   Results: From 1985 to 1999, the suicide rate fell 13.5%, with a greater decline among women, and antidepressant prescription rates increased over 4-fold, with the increase mostly due to SSRIs. Prescription rates for SSRIs and other second-generation antidepressants were both inversely associated with suicide rates (p = .03 and p = .02, respectively). In a multivariable analysis adjusting for unemployment and alcoholic beverage consumption rates, SSRI antidepressant prescription rates remained inversely associated with the national suicide rate (p = .03). Females received twice as many antidepressant prescriptions compared with males. The commonest prescription indication was mood disorders, the condition most often associated with suicide. SSRIs were associated with a lower risk of suicide by antidepressant overdose compared with TCAs.
   Conclusion: The decline in the national suicide rate (1985-1999) appears to be associated with greater use of non-tricyclic antidepressants. Treatment of a greater proportion of mood disorders with SSRIs and other second-generation non-tricyclic antidepressants may further reduce the suicide rate. Controlled studies of the antisuicidal properties of antidepressants are needed in high-risk depressed patient populations.

AB Background & AimsDepression is common in patients with liver disease. Moreover, alcohol use is intricately linked with both major depression and liver disease, and has also been linked with suicidal behaviours, suggesting that the alcohol use may have an intermediate role in the relationship between liver disease and major depression or suicidal behaviours. This study presents nationally representative data on the prevalence of major depression in patients with liver disease in the United States and its association with suicide attempts.
   MethodsData were drawn from the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). The NESARC is a survey of 43093 adults aged 18years and older in the United States. Medically recognized liver diseases were self-reported, and diagnoses of major depression were based on the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule-DSM-IV version.
   ResultThe prevalence of liver disease was estimated at 0.7%. Respondents with a liver disease reported 12-month rates of major depression (17.2%) that were significantly higher than among respondents without liver disease (7.0%; Adjusted OR:2.2; CI: 1.2-4.1). Lifetime rates of suicide attempts among participants with a major depression were also higher in participants with a liver disease (33.2%) than among respondents without liver disease (13.7%; OR: 3.1; CI: 1.3-7.6).
   ConclusionsLiver diseases are associated with major depression and suicide attempts among adults in the community. Adjustment for the amount of alcohol used or sociodemographical factors did not explain the observed association of liver disease with both major depression and suicide attempts.

AB Suicide behaviors (ideation, attempts, and completions) are unfortunately common in patients with bipolar disorder. It is estimated that 25 to 50% attempt suicide at least once during their lifetime, and 6% to 19% complete suicide. Risk factors include a family history of suicide, previous suicide attempts, younger age of onset, comorbid psychiatric illnesses, and psychological constructs like hopelessness. Pharmacologic treatment may impact suicidal behaviors, either increasing vulnerability or resilience. Clinicians need to be particularly sensitive to their patient's thoughts and beliefs about death, particularly during stressful times of life or when in a depressive/mixed episode of bipolar disorder.

AB We aimed to examine the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and suicide associated with the introduction and diffusion of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Negative binomial regression was used to estimate county-level suicide rates among persons aged 25 years or older using death certificate data collated by the National Center for Health Statistics from 1968 to 2009; SES was measured using the decennial US Census. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey were used to measure SSRI use. Once SSRIs became available in 1988, a 1% increase in SSRI usage was associated with a 0.5% lower suicide rate. Prior to the introduction of SSRIs, SES was not related to suicide. However, with each 1% increase in SSRI use, a 1-standard deviation (SD) higher SES was associated with a 0.6% lower suicide rate. In 2009, persons living in counties with SES 1 SD above the national average were 13.6% less likely to commit suicide than those living in counties with SES 1 SD below the national average-a difference of 1.9/100,000 adults aged a parts per thousand yen25 years.

AB Purpose: To examine the cross-sectional associations between preteen alcohol use initiation and subsequent suicide ideation and attempts for boys and girls in a nationally representative sample of high school students.
   Methods: Analyses are computed using data from the 2005 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey, which includes a representative sample (n = 13,639) of high-school students in grades 9-12 in the United States. Cross-sectional logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the associations between early alcohol use and reports of suicide ideation and suicide attempts for boys and girls while controlling for demographic characteristics, substance use, involvement in physical fights, weapon carrying, physical abuse by dating partner, sexual assault, and sadness.
   Results: Among study participants, 25.4% reported drinking before age 13 years. Preteen alcohol use initiation was statistically significantly associated with suicidal ideation (adjusted OR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.46-2.44) and suicide attempts (adjusted OR = 2.71, 95% CI = 1.82-4.02) relative to nondrinkers. Preteen alcohol use initiation was statistically significantly associated with suicidal ideation and attempts relative to nondrinkers for both boys and girls.
   Conclusions: Alcohol use among adolescents, particularly preteen alcohol use initiation, is an important risk factor for both suicide ideation and suicide attempts among boys and girls. Increased efforts to delay and reduce early alcohol use are needed, and may reduce suicide attempts. (C) 2007 Society for Adolescent Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB According to the World Health Organization, a major barrier to suicide prevention work is the social stigma surrounding suicide. Since clinical research has long shown that shame and guilt are often involved in suicide and suicide ideation, the present two studies explore the extent to which individuals associate shame and guilt with suicide ideation and behavior according to their cultural background. Using a scenario approach, 1,147 Americans in two separate studies read about a traumatic situation in which the target person experienced intense shame or intense guilt. A mini meta-analysis of these studies showed that all participants were more likely to link the experience of shame to suicidality than guilt. Additionally, participants from U.S. dignity states were more likely to report suicide ideation when the target experienced guilt as opposed to shame. Our findings support the notion that the centrality of the emotions of shame and guilt varies relative to the social context, which has implications on how others perceive suicide.

AB A clearer understanding of risk factors for suicidal behavior among soldiers is of principal importance to military suicide prevention. It is unclear whether soldiers who attempt suicide and those who die by suicide have different patterns of risk factors. As such, preventive efforts aimed toward reducing suicide attempts and suicides, respectively, may require different strategies. We conducted a latent class analysis (LCA) to examine classes of risk factors among suicide attempters (n = 1,433) and decedents (n = 424). Both groups were represented by three classes: (1) External/Antisocial Risk Factors, (2) Mental Health Risk Factors, and (3) No Pattern. These findings support the conceptualization that military suicide attempters and decedents represent a single population.

AB From Durkheim to Kraepelin, suicide has been recognized as a social and psychiatric ill. Among clinical scientists in the United States, interest in suicide grew substantially in the 1980's as rates among older adults increased. However, major advances in the science of mental health seem unlikely to reduce the prevalence of suicide as long as case recognition at the community level continues to be problematic. Public policy promoted to reduce social risk factors coupled with greater attention to psychopathology is the logical outgrowth from the most recent data. Differences in suicide rates by nation add weight to the argument.

AB Background To assess the prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of suicide involving acute alcohol intoxication among U.S. ethnic minorities. Methods Data were derived from the restricted 2003 to 2009 National Violent Death Reporting System. The study focused on the sociodemographic and toxicological information of 59,384 male and female suicide decedents for 16 states of the United States. Acute alcohol intoxication was defined as having a blood alcohol content (BAC) 0.08g/dl. Overall, 76% of decedents were tested for the presence of alcohol. Results The proportion of suicide decedents with a positive BAC ranged from 47% among American Indians/Alaska Natives (AIs/ANs) to 23% among Asians/Pacific Islanders (PIs). Average BAC was highest among AIs/ANs. Among those who were tested for BAC, the proportion of decedents legally intoxicated prior to suicide was as follows: Blacks, 15%; AIs/ANs, 36%; Asians/PIs, 13%; and Hispanics, 28%. Bivariate associations showed that most suicide decedents who were legally intoxicated were male, younger than 30years of age, with a high school education, not married, nonveterans, lived in metropolitan areas, and used a firearm to complete suicide. However, with the exception of Whites, most of these associations became not statistically significant in multivariate analysis. Conclusions Alcohol use and legal intoxication prior to completing suicide are common among U.S. ethnic groups, especially among men and those who are younger than 30years of age. The AI/AN group had the highest mean BAC, the highest rate of legal intoxication and decedents who were particularly young. Suicide prevention strategies should address alcohol use as a risk factor. Alcohol problems prevention strategies should focus on suicide as a consequence of alcohol use, especially among AI/AN youth and young adults.

ID UNITED-STATES; CHRONIC PAIN; HEALTH
AB Suicide among inpatients can be devastating for other patients and hospital staff. Studies show that cases of inpatient suicides in general hospitals receive less attention than inpatient suicides in psychiatric hospitals. Studies on cases of inpatient suicide in general hospitals are usually in the form of case reports or case series, and potential suicide risk factors are unknown. Many significant differences are reported between inpatient suicides in general hospitals and inpatient suicides in psychiatry clinics. Here we report two cases of completed suicide after jumping from a height while receiving inpatient treatment at a University Hospital. As serious physical illnesses are frequently accompanied by psychiatric disorders that increase suicide risk, measures should be taken to prevent inpatient suicides in hospitals admitting patients with physical illnesses. Hospitals should keep regular records about inpatients who attempt or commit suicide during their treatment in the hospital or during treatment breaks, because this would provide valuable data to examine and prevent cases of inpatient suicide.

ID UNITED-STATES; RISK; DEPRESSION; BEHAVIORS; FIBROMYALGIA; PREVALENCE;
   THOUGHTS; IDEATION; DISEASE; IMPACT
AB Background: More than 25 million adults in the United States have chronic pain. Chronic pain has been associated with suicidality, but previous studies primarily examined nonfatal suicidal behaviors rather than suicide deaths associated with chronic pain or the characteristics of such deaths.
   Objective: To estimate the prevalence of chronic pain among suicide decedents in a large multistate sample and to characterize suicide decedents with and without chronic pain.
   Design: Retrospective analysis of National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) data. The NVDRS links death certificate, coroner or medical examiner, and law enforcement data collected by investigators, who often interview informants who knew the decedent to gather information on precipitating circumstances surrounding the suicide. Information is abstracted by using standard coding guidance developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
   Setting: 18 states participating in the NVDRS.
   Participants: Suicide decedents with and without chronic pain who died during 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2014.
   Measurements: Demographic characteristics, mechanism of death, toxicology results, precipitating circumstances (mental health, substance use, interpersonal problems, life stressors), and suicide planning and intent.
   Results: Of 123 181 suicide decedents included in the study, 10 789 (8.8%) had evidence of chronic pain, and the percentage increased from 7.4% in 2003 to 10.2% in 2014. More than half (53.6%) of suicide decedents with chronic pain died of firearm-related injuries and 16.2% by opioid overdose.
   Limitation: The results probably underrepresent the true percentage of suicide decedents who had chronic pain, given the nature of the data and how they were captured.
   Conclusion: Chronic pain may be an important contributor to suicide. Access to quality, comprehensive pain care and adherence to clinical guidelines may help improve pain management and patient safety.

AB Objective: To explore whether recent declines in household firearm prevalence in the United States were associated with changes in rates of suicide for men, women, and children.
   Methods: This time series study compares changes in suicide rates to changes in household firearm prevalence, 1981-2002. Multivariate analyses adjust for age, unemployment, per capita alcohol consumption, and poverty. Regional fixed effects controlled for cross sectional, time invariant differences among the four census regions. Standard errors of parameter estimates are adjusted to account for serial autocorrelation of observations over time.
   Results: Over the 22 year study period household firearm ownership rates declined across all four regions. In multivariate analyses, each 10% decline in household firearm ownership was associated with significant declines in rates of firearm suicide, 4.2% (95% CI 2.3% to 6.1%) and overall suicide, 2.5% (95% CI 1.4% to 3.6%). Changes in non-firearm suicide were not associated with changes in firearm ownership. The magnitude of the association between changes in household firearm ownership and changes in rates of firearm and overall suicide was greatest for children: for each 10% decline in the percentage of households with firearms and children, the rate of firearm suicide among children 0-19 years of age dropped 8.3% (95% CI 6.1% to 10.5%) and the rate of overall suicide dropped 4.1% (2.3% to 5.9%).
   Conclusion: Changes in household firearm ownership over time are associated with significant changes in rates of suicide for men, women, and children. These findings suggest that reducing availability to firearms in the home may save lives, especially among youth.

AB Annual suicide figures are critical in identifying trends and guiding research, yet challenges arising from significant lags in reporting can delay and complicate real-time interventions. In this paper, we utilized Google Trends search volumes for behavioral forecasting of national suicide rates in Ireland between 2004 and 2015. Official suicide rates are recorded by the Central Statistics Office in Ireland. While similar investigations using Google trends data have been carried out in other jurisdictions (e.g., United Kingdom, United Stated of America), such research had not yet been completed in Ireland. We compiled a collection of suicide- and depression-related search terms suggested by Google Trends and manually sourced from the literature. Monthly search rate terms at different lags were compared with suicide occurrences to determine the degree of correlation. Following two approaches based on vector autoregression and neural network autoregression, we achieved mean absolute error values between 4.14 and 9.61 when incorporating search query data, with the highest performance for the neural network approach. The application of this process to United Kingdom suicide and search query data showed similar results, supporting the benefit of Google Trends, neural network approach, and the applied search terms to forecast suicide risk increase. Overall, the combination of societal data and online behavior provide a good indication of societal risks; building on past research, our improvements led to robust models integrating search query and unemployment data for suicide risk forecasting in Ireland.

TI Surveillance of completed suicide in the Department of the Navy
SO MILITARY MEDICINE

DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES-ARMY; PERSONNEL; POPULATION
AB In 1999, the Department of the Navy (DoN) began a suicide surveillance program using the DoN Suicide Incident Report (DONSIR) to collect data on completed suicides in the Navy and Marine Corps. The DONSIR significantly advances the capability of DoN to track and analyze data on completed suicides over time. The long-term goal of this program is to improve suicide prevention by identifying and modifying military-specific risk factors. A DONSIR has been completed on 98% of the 200 DoN suicides that occurred from 1999 to 2001. Most DoN suicides occurred outside the military work environment and involved the use of a firearm. Most decedents were men, had experienced a recent relationship problem, and did not use any military support services in the 30 days before suicide. Results suggest that the promotion of support services may improve the effectiveness of DoN suicide prevention.

AB Cultural and economic patterns from 130 sociological works on suicide from 1981 to 1995 are reviewed in this article. The traditional Durkheimian perspective on suicide was often questioned by research on the impact of the mass media, alcohol, class, modernization, religion, and politics. Major theoretical developments included the application of differential identification theory to Phillips's model of copycat suicide, the application of criminology's opportunity theory to suicide, and new explanations for the link between alcohol and the social suicide rate. Explanations are reviewed for the major new suicide trend: after half a century of convergence, male and female suicide rates are diverging. Finally, the review notes patterns of continued stability in suicide research findings in areas such as racial differences and economic strain.

AB Background: The major suicide method in rural China today is ingestion of agricultural pesticides.
   Aim: This study is to investigate the characteristics of Chinese rural young suicides who died of pesticide ingestion.
   Methods: A sample of 392 suicides from rural China was studied using the psychological autopsy method, and data were analysed for demographic characteristics, the suicide method used, mental disorder and psychological characteristics.
   Results: Suicides by pesticide ingestion were enacted more because of impulsiveness and tended to demonstrate less mental illness than those suicides using other means in rural China.
   Conclusions: Accessibility, high toxicity and lethality of the pesticides were risk factors for the suicides of people without a mental disorder in rural China. The use of pesticides is a rational choice and the safe storage of these kinds of farming chemicals should be controlled to prevent certain suicides.

AB Objective. To develop a risk index of suicide attempts in the last 12 months among people with suicide ideation. Materials and methods. Cross-sectional study. Data came from the National Addictions Survey 2008. The risk index was made up by age, marital status, religion, occupation, area of the country in which they live, immigrant to the United States, alcohol and drug consumption, depression symptoms, behavioral problems and a history of sexual abuse. Results. We found a monotonic relationship between the increase in risk factors and the existence of a plan and the risk, with an odds ratio over 2.07 up to 152.19. The area under the curve is quite high, with a value of 0.844, very close to 1. Conclusion. The use of this index may help prevent patients from further developing their suicide ideation process and may prevent a suicide attempt of uncertain consequences, including death.

AB Purpose: Seattle-inspired rock and roll superstar Chris Cornell died by suicide in May 2017. In the northern hemisphere, May represents the peak of the widely replicated but still unexplained seasonal spring rhythm in suicide. Years earlier, Cornell had suffered openly from recurrent bouts of severe depression, and his early musical lyrics do indeed suggest an enduring sensitivity to the vicissitudes of depressed and suicidal states. Cornell's most famous song, Black Hole Sun, suggests a mixed mood state, the incidence of which also peaks in the spring. The present work explores Cornell's May suicide from a chronobiologic perspective. Methods: Review of Cornell's lyrics and literature on suicide. Results: Cornell's lyrics contain clear indicators of mixed depressive and seasonal imagery, highlighting 3 fundamental axioms of suicidology: (1) the yearly suicide rhythm peaks in May in the northern hemisphere, (2) mixed depressive states are particularly lethal, and (3) the suicide risk increases dramatically when recovering from depression and mood turns mixed. Conclusions: Cornell, in his life and music, left us with a novel and important hypothesis about the spring seasonality of suicide, namely, that the yearly suicide risk becomes maximal when winter turns to spring and there emerges a deadly mixed mood state under a May photoperiod, i.e., the suicide risk is maximal when a Black Hole Sun occurs in May. It is hoped that Cornell's legacy and sensitive hypothesis inspire research into the etiology and treatment of the spring seasonality of suicide risk and mixed mood states. Limitations: The Cornell hypothesis was formulated based in part on several speculative inferences regarding the course of his functioning just prior to his suicide.

AB Background Among American Indians/Alaskan Natives (AI/ANs), suicides are disproportionately high among those younger than 40 years of age. This paper examines suicide and alcohol intoxication (postmortem BAC >= 0.08 g/dl) by age among Whites and AI/ANs to better understand the reasons for the high rate of suicide among AI/ANs for those younger than 40. Methods Data come from the restricted 2003 to 2016 National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), with postmortem information on 79,150 White and AI/AN suicide decedents of both genders who had a BAC test in 32 states of the United States. Results Among Whites, 39.3% of decedents legally intoxicated are younger than 40 years of age, while among AI/ANs the proportion is 72.9% (p < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression with data divided by age shows that in the 18 to 39 age group, AI/ANs are about 2 times more likely than Whites to have a postmortem BAC >= 0.08. Veteran status compared to nonveteran, and history of alcohol problems prior to suicide were also associated with BAC >= 0.08. Suicide methods other than by firearm and a report of the presence of 2 or more suicide precipitating circumstances were protective against BAC >= 0.08. Results for the age group 40 years of age and older mirror those for the younger group with 1 exception: Race/ethnicity was not associated with BAC level. Conclusions The proportion of suicide decedents with a BAC >= 0.08 is higher among AI/ANs than Whites, especially among those 18 to 39 years of age. However, acute alcohol intoxication does not fully explain differences in suicide age structure between AI/ANs and Whites.

AB Background: There is a well-known association between perception of poor physical health and higher rates of physical and psychological morbidity. However, little is known about the possible link between perception of health and suicidality. Aims: The study examines the relationship between perception of poor health and suicidal ideation and suicide attempt among adults in the community. Methods: Data were drawn from the National Comorbidity Survey (n = 5,877), a representative sample of individuals 15-54 years of age in the United States. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to determine the relationship between perception of poor health and the likelihood of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt. Sociodemographic characteristics, comorbid mental disorders, and physical illnesses were adjusted for in the final model. Results: Perception of poor health was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of suicidal ideation (OR = 2.14 (1.36, 3.35) and suicide attempt (OR = 2.03 (1.06, 3.91)), which persisted after adjusting for differences in sociodemographic characteristics, mental disorders, and self-reported physical illnesses. Conclusions: Our findings provide initial evidence that perception of poor health is associated with a significantly increased likelihood of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt among adults in the community.

AB Military psychiatric inpatients with and without a lifetime history of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), combined with a history of at least one suicide attempt, were compared on suicide ideation severity, number of suicide attempts, and Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide variables. Data were derived from baseline assessments performed in a psychotherapy randomized controlled trial. Lifetime history of NSSI and lifetime number of suicide attempts were assessed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS; Posner et al., 2011). Individuals with versus without a combined lifetime history of attempted suicide and NSSI showed significant elevations on thwarted belongingness and acquired capability for suicide. No significant between-group differences were found on perceived burdensomeness, frequency, duration, and controllability of suicide ideation, or number of lifetime suicide attempts. A history of NSSI, above and beyond attempted suicide, appears to increase service members' social alienation and acquired capability for suicide.

AB Refugee agencies noticed a high number of suicides among Bhutanese refugees resettled in the United States between 2009 and 2012. We aimed to estimate prevalence of mental health conditions and identify factors associated with suicidal ideation among Bhutanese refugees. We conducted a stratified random cross-sectional survey and collected information on demographics, mental health conditions, suicidal ideation, and post-migration difficulties. Bivariate logistic regressions were performed to identify factors associated with suicidal ideation. Prevalence of mental health conditions were: depression (21 %), symptoms of anxiety (19 %), post-traumatic stress disorder (4.5 %), and suicidal ideation (3 %), significant risk factors for suicidal ideation included: not being a provider of the family; perceiving low social support; and having symptoms of anxiety and depression. These findings suggest that Bhutanese refugees in the United States may have a higher burden of mental illness relative to the US population and may benefit from mental health screening and treatment. Refugee communities and service providers may benefit from additional suicide awareness training to identify those at highest risk.

AB Background: The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned about the increased suicidality risk associated with the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and venlafaxine in children and adolescents. Objectives: To critically appraise the available evidence supporting the FDA Black box warning concerning to the use of antidepressants in child and adolescents. Methods: A critical review of articles in Medline/PubMed and SciELO databases regarding the FDA Black box warning for antidepressants, and the impact of FDA warnings on antidepressant prescriptions and suicide rates. Results: The warning was based on surveys that did not report either cases of suicide nor a significant difference supporting an increased suicidality rate. The concept was defined in an ambiguous way and there is currently more available evidence to support such definition. The use of SSRI and venlafaxine has been associated to lower suicidality rates, but the prescription fall due to the warning increased suicide rates. Discussion: Suicidality is an inherent feature of depressive disorders so it would be desirable to consider how much of the phenomenon may be attributed to antidepressants per se. It would be appropriate to consider that suicide rates might increase also as a consequence of the warning.

AB Law Enforcement (LE) officers are considered to be at elevated risk of suicide. This study explored variables associated with LE suicide and the extent they differentiated LE suicides from those within similar occupations considered at risk - Army and Firefighters. Using a public health database of violent deaths, the US National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), the prevalence of and association between seven suicide variables (treatment for a mental health condition, Post Traumatic Stress disorder diagnosis, alcohol and substance abuse, job problems, intimate partner problems) and suicide within LE, Army and Firefighters was computed. Method of suicide and demographic characteristics were also identified. All of the suicide variables were associated with suicide in the three occupation groups. LE suicides were differentiated from Army and Firefighter suicides by being more strongly associated with job problems and suicide by females was more common. Implications for suicide prevention strategies within LE are discussed.

AB This study investigated the prevalence of suicidal behavior and psychological distress in university students across 12 nations. A total of 5,572 university students from 12 countries were surveyed about suicide ideation, suicide attempts, and psychological distress by means of a self-administered questionnaire. Almost 29% of the samples reported having contemplated suicide and 7% reported attempting suicide. Of the total sample, 51.1% scored above the General Health Questionnaire-123 cut-off points, 41.6% above the GHQ-124 cut-off points, and 33.8% scored above the GHQ-125 cut-off points. While odds of suicide ideation were elevated in Austria and the UK, reduced ORs were detected for China, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Turkey. Similarly, while odds of suicide attempt were high in Jordan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, and to some extent in Turkey, reduced ORs were observed for Austria, China, Italy, Japan and the United States. Elevated ORs for psychological distress were seen in Japan, Jordan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Turkey but reduced ORs were noted in Austria, China, Iran, Italy, and the United States. Psychological distress was strongly associated with reports of suicide ideation and attempts. Suicide ideation, suicide attempt, and psychological distress are common in university students but their rates vary depending on the sociocultural context. Due attention should be devoted to the mental health needs of young adults enrolled in higher educational institutions and more cross-cultural research is warranted to better understand the etiology of the observed intersocietal variations in suicidal behavior and psychological distress.

AB In response to recent research documenting a link between early substance use and suicidal behaviors among youth, the current study sought to examine the associations between ages of substance use initiation and suicidal behavior among students in France and the USA.
   Cross-sectional logistic regression analyses based on the 2003 European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) survey (France; n = 13,187) and the 2003 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) (United States; n = 15,136) assessed associations between early substance use initiation (i.e., alcohol, cigarette and cannabis/marijuana) and suicide ideation and attempts while controlling for potential confounders.
   Early alcohol use initiation (ORadj = 1.52; 95% CI 1.17-1.97) and early cannabis/marijuana use initiation (ORadj = 2.90; 95% CI 2.20-3.83) were associated with suicide attempt in France. Early smoking was associated with suicide attempt in both France (ORadj = 1.92; 95% CI 1.55-2.37) and the USA (ORadj = 1.53; 95% CI 1.02-2.28). Sex differences were also noted.
   The associations between substance use initiation and suicidal behaviors differed in the United States and France. These findings, placed into context, can assist the development and implementation of prevention strategies that seek to reduce the harmful consequences of early substance use among youth.

TI Adolescent Suicide Prevention: The Oklahoma Community Reaches Out
SO JOURNAL OF CONTINUING EDUCATION IN NURSING
LA English
DT Article
AB In the United States, Oklahoma currently ranks fifth in suicide attempts and ninth in suicide completion in the 10- to 24-year-old age group. Studies have shown that many teens are seen by their primary care physician within 6 weeks of their suicide attempt or completion. Building on this finding, a questionnaire focusing on what physicians and nurses knew about the warning signs and symptoms of adolescent suicide was created and distributed to area clinics. It was found that few of the health care providers were comfortable in recognizing the warning signs and symptoms of suicide. An educational program was developed focusing on the warning signs of suicide to help health care workers deal with this troubling problem. J Contin Educ Nurs 2009;40(4):177-180.

AB Family support systems have been theoretically linked to suicide risk. But no research to date has investigated the effects of detailed living arrangements on individual risk of suicide. Using data on 825,462 adults from the National Health Interview Survey Linked Mortality File reveals that living in families with stronger sources of social support and integration decreases risk of suicide. These effects persist despite controls for important individual level characteristics. Risk of suicide decreases for persons in married as well as unmarried families when children are present and risk increases for persons living with unrelated adults. These results reveal the structural importance of family formation on the social integrative forces that contribute to an individual's risk of suicide.

AB Studies have documented a link between gun ownership and suicide, but little is known about characteristics of those most likely to use a gun in a suicide attempt rather than alternative methods. We examined which factors differentiate suicide decedents who died using a gun from those who died by other methods. We further examined whether such findings are consistent within the subcomponent of our larger sample comprised entirely of gun owning suicide decedents. Data reflect 267 suicide decedents, with data provided by individuals who identified as having lost someone to suicide (loss survivors). Within the full sample, a higher proportion of gun-owning and male suicide decedents died by firearm. Further, individuals who bad previously discussed suicide or engaged in one or more non-lethal suicide attempts were less likely to die by suicide using a gun. Within the subsample of gun owning suicide decedents, a greater proportion of decedents who stored guns at home and in unsecure locations died from self-inflected gunshot wounds. These findings add clarity to the relationship between firearm ownership and death by suicide at the individual level. Furthermore, these findings are consistent with the notion that means safety implementation may represent a vital suicide prevention tool.

   VIOLENCE
AB This Article is the first to empirically analyze the impact of tort liability on suicide. Counter-intuitively, our analysis shows that suicide rates increase when potential tort liability is expanded to include psychiatrists-the very defendants who would seem best able to prevent suicide. Using a fifty-state panel regression for 1981 to 2013, we find that states which allowed psychiatrists (but not other doctors) to be liable for malpractice resulting in suicide experienced a 9.3% increase in suicides. On the other hand, and more intuitively, holding non-psychiatrist doctors liable decreases suicide by 10.7%. These countervailing effects can be explained by psychiatrists facing liability choosing not to work with patients at high risk for suicide, whereas other doctors do not have that ability and instead avoid liability by providing better care.
   The Article makes important contributions to the law of proximate cause and to the more general phenomenon of regulatory avoidance. Traditionally, one could not be liable for malpractice that caused another's suicide-the suicide was considered a superseding and intervening cause. About half of states retain the old common law rule. Others have created exceptions for psychiatrists only or for all doctors, and some have abandoned the old rule entirely. Our findings suggest that expanding liability for psychiatrists may have an adverse effect. Accordingly, this Article suggests that the best policy might be to retain or revive the traditional no-liability-for-suicide rule for mental health specialists. The implications are enormous: over 40,000 people in the United States die each year from suicide.

ID UNITED-STATES; GENETICS; IDEATION; TRENDS; RISK; MEN
AB Genetically informative samples can address hereditary and experiential influences on suicide-related behaviors. The frequency of suicide-related behaviors was compared in twins from two survivor groups: (1) those whose co-twins' deaths were suicides (monozygotic [MZ]: n = 47; dizygotic [DZ]: n = 31.), and (2) those whose co-twins' deaths were nonsuicides (MZ: n = 347; DZ: n = 170). The frequency of suicide attempts among suicide survivors was significantly higher in MZ than DZ twins, while the frequency of suicide attempts among nonsuicide twin survivors did not differ between MZ and DZ twins. Twin concordance for suicide attempts more likely reflects a genetic predisposition than a behavioral reaction to the loss.

AB Persons with Parkinson's disease (PwP) have many known risk factors for suicide and suicidal ideation (SI). Despite this, there is limited understanding of suicidality in this population. We conducted a systematic review to synthesise the available literature on suicidality in PwP and highlight areas for potential intervention and further research. We identified 116 articles discussing SI, suicidal behaviours, suicide attempts and/or fatal suicide in PwP. These articles describe prevalence, suicide methods, risk factors for suicide and SI and treatment of suicidality. In this review, we summarise the current literature and provide suggestions for how clinicians can identify and treat PwP who are at risk for suicide, for example, through aggressive treatment of depression and improved screening for access to lethal means.

AB Background: Suicide rates are higher in rural areas. It has been hypothesized that inadequate access to care may play a role, but studies examining individual decedent characteristics are lacking. Aims: We sought to characterize the demographic, socioeconomic, and mental health features of individual suicide decedents by urban-rural residence status. Method: We analyzed suicides in 16 states using 2006-2008 data from the National Violent Death Reporting System and examined associations between decedent residence type and suicide variables with separate logistic regressions adjusted for age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Results: Of 17,504 analyzed suicides, 78% were in urban, 15% in rural adjacent, and 8% in rural nonadjacent locations. Rural decedents were less likely than urban decedents to have a mental health diagnosis or mental health care, although the prevalence of depressed moods appeared similar. Most suicides were by firearm, and rural decedents were more likely than urban decedents to have used a firearm. Conclusion: Rural decedents were less likely to be receiving mental health care and more likely to use firearms to commit suicide. A better understanding of geographic patterns of suicide may aid prevention efforts.

   INTENT; RATES; RISK
AB Background: Suicide claims over one million lives worldwide each year. In the United States, 1 per 10,000 persons dies from suicide every year, and these rates have remained relatively constant over the last 20 years. There are nearly 25 suicide attempts for each suicide, and previous self-directed violence is a strong predictor of death from suicide. While many studies have focused on suicides, the epidemiology of non-fatal self-directed violence is not well-defined.
   Objective: We used a nationally representative survey to examine demographics and underlying psychiatric disorders in United States (US) hospitalizations with non-fatal self-directed violence (SDV).
   Method: International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision (ICD-9) discharge diagnosis data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) were examined from 1997 to 2006 using frequency measures and adjusted logistic regression.
   Results: The rate of discharges with SDV remained relatively stable over the study time period with 4.5 to 5.7 hospitalizations per 10,000 persons per year. Excess SDV was documented for females, adolescents, whites, and those from the Midwest or West. While females had a higher likelihood of self-poisoning, both genders had comparable proportions of hospitalizations with SDV resulting in injury. Over 86% of the records listing SDV also included psychiatric disorders, with the most frequent being affective (57.8%) and substance abuse (37.1%) disorders. The association between psychiatric disorders and self-injury was strongest for personality disorders for both males (OR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.3-3.4) and females (OR = 3.8; 95% CI = 2.7-5.3).
   Conclusion: The NHDS provides new insights into the demographics and psychiatric morbidity of those hospitalized with SDV. Classification of SDV as self-injury or self-poisoning provides an additional parameter useful to epidemiologic studies.

DE Inmate; Suicide; Prevention; Beyond the quick-fix
ID PRISON
AB Data from a recent national study of inmate suicides indicates that the suicide rate in county jails throughout the United States has steadily decreased. Despite this progress, the author argues that rather than developing and maintaining comprehensive policies and practices, policymakers and correctional administrators appear preoccupied with the notion that suicides can only be prevented when inmates are on suicide precautions. Measures such as closed-circuit television monitoring, suicide-resistant jail cells, safety smocks, and new technology are popular tools to keep certain inmates safe. There is more to suicide prevention than simply observing suicidal inmates and waiting for them to attempt suicide. The author argues that suicides are prevented and suicide rates reduced when correctional facilities provide a comprehensive array of programming that identifies suicidal inmates who are otherwise difficult to identify, ensures their safety on suicide precautions, and provides a continuity of care throughout confinement.

ID CONNECTICUT; MISSOURI; VIOLENT; COSTS; RISK; LAW
AB Background: In 2016, firearms killed 38,658 people in the United States. Federal law requires licensed gun dealers, but not private parties, to conduct background checks on prospective firearm purchasers with the goal of preventing prohibited persons from obtaining firearms. Our objective was to estimate the effect of the repeal of comprehensive background check law-srequiring a background check for all handgun sales, not just sales by licensed dealers-on firearm homicide and suicide rates in Indiana and Tennessee.
   Methods: We compared age-adjusted firearm homicide and suicide rates, measured annually from 1981 to 2008 and 1994 to 2008 in Indiana and Tennessee, respectively, to rates in control groups constructed using the synthetic control method.
   Results: The average rates of firearm homicide and suicide in Indiana and Tennessee following repeal were within the range of what could be expected, given natural variation (differences = 0.7 firearm homicides and 0.5 firearm suicides per 100,000 residents in Indiana and 0.4 firearm homicides and 0.3 firearm suicides per 100,000 residents in Tennessee). Sensitivity analyses resulted in similar findings.
   Conclusion: We found no evidence of an association between the repeal of comprehensive background check policies and firearm homicide and suicide rates in Indiana and Tennessee. In order to understand whether comprehensive background check policies reduce firearm deaths in the United States generally, more evidence on the impact of such policies from other states is needed.

ID UNITED-STATES; PATTERNS
AB Contrary to Durkheim's idea about suicide during wartime, the Netherlands had high suicide rates in 1940 and 1945. To explain these findings, we propose the social integration theory, according to which, people who expect to be excluded from society are more likely to commit suicide. We examine this idea using individual-level data on suicide in the Netherlands during the Second World War, assuming that Jews expected to be excluded by the occupying German forces, whereas political delinquents expected punishment after the war. In support of our theory, we found high suicide rates among Jews at the beginning of the war and high suicide rates among political delinquents when the Netherlands was liberated. These findings support the proposed theory and call for refinement of Durkheim's ideas.

SO UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO MEDICAL JOURNAL

DT Article
ID SUICIDE RATES; UNITED-STATES; CARE
AB Donald Trump's aggressive stance on trade has led to heavy tariffs on US agricultural products. This has exposed American farmers to a high amount of volatility and work stress. Suicides in America have drastically increased since the late 1990's, and agriculture has been one of the hardest-hit industries with suicide rates far above the national average. The added stress of Trump's trade war has the potential to exacerbate the growing rates of depression and suicide among farmers and agricultural workers. The Trump administration's attempt to case the strain on farmers with simple monetary compensation has been heavily criticized for its short-sighted nature, and pundits highlight the need for a long-term solution. However, this issue is not limited to the United States and has been observed in several countries around the world, and none have yet identified an effective resolution. A greater response is needed by federal governments to aid farmers and stabilize agricultural markets, as national advocacy groups struggle to provide essential resources to those in need and improve the rates of suicide and depression among farmers.

AB Using the fifth release of the National Longitudinal Mortality Survey, I examine the role of educational attainment and self-reported health on 6- and 11-year suicide mortality risk in the United States. I first replicate the original results reported by Hamermesh and Soss. . Then, augmenting the Hamermesh model with initial educational attainment and self-reported health status, I find that years of education significantly raises suicide mortality risk in the US after controlling for initial self-reported health. This result is robust to regression specification, replication and the inclusion of covariates.

   SUICIDE; DISPARITIES
AB OBJECTIVES: Examine fatal and nonfatal firearm injuries among children aged 0 to 17 in the United States, including intent, demographic characteristics, trends, state-level patterns, and circumstances.
   METHODS: Fatal injuries were examined by using data from the National Vital Statistics System and nonfatal injuries by using data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System. Trends from 2002 to 2014 were tested using joinpoint regression analyses. Incident characteristics and circumstances were examined by using data from the National Violent Death Reporting System.
   RESULTS: Nearly 1300 children die and 5790 are treated for gunshot wounds each year. Boys, older children, and minorities are disproportionately affected. Although unintentional firearm deaths among children declined from 2002 to 2014 and firearm homicides declined from 2007 to 2014, firearm suicides decreased between 2002 and 2007 and then showed a significant upward trend from 2007 to 2014. Rates of firearm homicide among children are higher in many Southern states and parts of the Midwest relative to other parts of the country. Firearm suicides are more dispersed across the United States with some of the highest rates occurring in Western states. Firearm homicides of younger children often occurred in multivictim events and involved intimate partner or family conflict; older children more often died in the context of crime and violence. Firearm suicides were often precipitated by situational and relationship problems. The shooter playing with a gun was the most common circumstance surrounding unintentional firearm deaths of both younger and older children.
   CONCLUSIONS: Firearm injuries are an important public health problem, contributing substantially to premature death and disability of children. Understanding their nature and impact is a first step toward prevention.

AB Population rates of suicidal ideation, suicide plans or attempted suicide from three independent multinational epidemiological surveys (the WHO/EURO and WHO SUPRE-MISS studies and a third one) were not significantly associated with national IQ figures. This result conflicts with previous evidence from cross-national studies (by Lester and by Voracek) of a positive ecological correlation between level of national intelligence and rates of completed suicide. Across nations, the indicators for the prevalence of suicidal behavior also lacked close correspondence with suicide rates, which may be due to the higher unreliability of assessing covert suicidal behavior (suicide ideas, thoughts, plans, and, to a lesser extent, also suicide attempts) as compared to suicidal behavior that is indisputably overt (completed suicide). Several alternative explanations for the current nil findings are also discussed.

AB Although there has been extensive research into the epidemiology and prevention of suicide, there continues to be a paucity of research on non-fatal suicides, in particular persons not treated in hospitals following a suicide attempt. In this study, we analyzed call data from the Illinois Poison Center from 2002 to 2007, which primarily comprises of non-fatal hospitalized and non-hospitalized attempts. We analyzed 43,057 calls by persons suspected of attempting suicide. The three most common groups of substances used were analgesics, antidepressants, and sedative/hypnotics/antipsychotics. The Poisson regression model showed significant declines in calls for suspected suicides during periods of holidays and vacations, and was more pronounced among youths. This study provides a current and detailed description of substances used primarily in non-fatal suicide attempts.

AB In population studies, many risk factors are associated with suicide completion. Yet we cannot accurately predict whether any individual patient will die by suicide. Completers are a distinct population from attempters and do not necessarily present for treatment by mental health professionals. Research on suicide prevention has yielded some promising findings but has not shown that interventions produce definitive results. The strongest evidence for successful prevention derives from reducing access to means. A population-based strategy may be more effective than a high-risk strategy focusing on patients with suicidal ideas or attempts. Much more research is needed before developing effective suicide prevention programs.

AB Suicide and suicide attempts by children and adolescents continue to be a major public health problem in the United States. Major risk factors include a previous suicide attempt, a mood disorder, a family history of suicide, a parental psychiatric disorder, and a history of sexual abuse. Genetic vulnerability appears to be a factor as well. Efforts to prevent subsequent attempts at suicide have not generally been successful, and many children and adolescents are not receiving treatment for the mood disorders and other psychiatric conditions that are risk factors. Evaluation of suicide risk should be carried out through multiple informants, not simply the adolescent or the parents, although a thorough clinical interview of the adolescent is essential.

AB Suicidal behaviors among adolescents in the United States are the second leading cause of death and has been steadily increasing over the years. Although access to and possession of a weapon may facilitate the transition from suicidal ideation to a suicide attempt, few studies have examined the association between weapon carrying and suicide attempts among adolescents. The objective of this study was to examine the association between weapon carrying on school property and suicide attempt among adolescents. Data for this study came from the 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System. A sample of 14,547 adolescents aged 14-18 years old (50.5% female) was analyzed using logistic regression. Of the 14,547 adolescents, 4% carried a weapon on school property, and 7.7% attempted suicide during the past 12 months. In the multivariate logistic regression, adolescents who reported carrying a weapon on school property had more than double the odds of attempting suicide when compared to their counterparts who did not carry a weapon on school property. Other significant predictors of suicide attempt include sexual minority, history of forced sexual intercourse, school bullying and cyberbullying victimization, feeling sad or hopeless, and substance use. Examining the association between weapon carrying and suicide attempt among adolescents would contribute to early identification of adolescents who are likely to engage in suicidal behaviors.

AB Research on homicides followed by suicides has largely relied on very localized samples and relatively short time spans of data. As a result, little is known about the extent to which patterns within cases of homicide-suicides are geographically specific. The current study seeks to help fill this gap by comparing twenty years of homicide- suicide data for Sweden and a large U.S. county. Although some of the underlying patterns in the two countries are similar (e.g., decreasing rates), a number of important differences emerge, particularly with respect to incidence, weapons used, perpetrator age, and relationship of the perpetrator to the victim.

AB Objective: To compare suicide rates and characteristics in East Asian and Western countries.
   Method: Data from five East Asian jurisdictions and five English-speaking Western countries were obtained from national offices responsible for collection of statistics. Data were graphed to demonstrate differences between East Asian and Western age patterns of suicide. Relevant literature was reviewed, including observations concerning suicide rates in various non-English-speaking European countries.
   Results: Age patterns and rates of suicide differ between East and West and across time, but with Japan's and the United States patterns progressively becoming more similar.
   Conclusions: Sociocultural factors affect suicide patterns and rates; choice of method and cohort effects affect rates. Strategies for prevention of suicide should give attention to culture-related precipitants of suicide.

AB Purpose
   This study examined trends in the suicide rates of persons with foreign background in Japan.
   Methods
   Using the nationwide death records in the Vital Statistics of Japan, we first reported the age-adjusted suicide rates of 8 foreign nationals (Brazil, China, Korea, Peru, the Philippines, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States) in Japan by sex from 1980 to the mid-2010s. We also computed rate ratios to compare the suicide rate of each group with those of the Japanese population. Second, we focused on Koreans, who had the highest suicide rate in Japan. We compared the suicide rates of Koreans in Japan with Koreans in South Korea to examine whether their suicide rates were more closely related to those of their country of origin or those of their host country.
   Results
   We found that the suicide rates of Koreans and Chinese in Japan were similar to or higher than those of Japanese, while other groups tended to show lower suicide rates. Most notably, Koreans displayed consistently high suicide rates from 1980 to the mid-2010s, which were nearly twice as high as those of the Japanese population. Korean males and females in Japan had higher suicide rates than those in South Korea.
   Conclusions
   Immigrants in Japan were not necessarily influenced by the suicide rates of the host country. The high suicide rates among Korean residents in Japan might be explained by various disadvantages and adversities that they face in Japan.

AB It is axiomatic that the goal of suicide prevention is the prevention of suicide. Yet in spite of significant efforts to this end since the middle of the last century, and most notably in the last decade, the rate of suicide in the U.S. has not declined; rather, it has increased. To address this issue, Suicide Awareness Voices of Education (SAVE) brought together leading prevention specialists from other public health problems where successes have been achieved, representatives from countries where suicide rates have declined, and U.S. based suicide prevention researchers and program directors, to "think outside the box" and propose innovative, scalable approaches that might better drive success in achieving desired results from U.S. suicide prevention efforts. The recommendations should challenge our preconceptions and force us outside our own mental constraints to broaden our perspectives and suggest catalysts for real change in suicide prevention.

AB Objective: Death by suicide is a serious and growing public health concern in the United States. This noncontrolled, naturalistic study examined professionals' knowledge about suicide and confidence in working with suicidal individuals, comparing those who had received either of two gatekeeper trainings-Question, Persuade, and Refer (QPR) or Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST)-or other suicide-relevant training or no training.
   Methods: Participants (N=16,693) were individuals in various professional roles in the field of behavioral health care in Indiana, Kentucky, NewYork, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah. Participants completed a survey assessing suicide knowledge and skills confidence.
   Results: Most participants (52.9%) reported no previous suicide prevention or assessment training. Individuals with suicide-relevant training demonstrated greater suicide knowledge and confidence than those with no such training. Among those who had received any training, no differences were found in suicide knowledge; however, individuals who had received ASIST reported greater confidence in working with suicidal individuals, compared with those who had received other training. Professional role and prior experience with a client who had died by suicide had significant positive relationships with suicide knowledge and confidence. Regional differences emerged between states and are examined within the context of statewide suicide prevention initiatives.
   Conclusions: Increasing access to and incentives for participating in suicide-relevant training among behavioral health care staff may foster a more knowledgeable and confident group of gatekeepers. Future research should examine whether increases in knowledge and confidence among staff translate into actual changes in practice that help protect and serve at-risk individuals.

AB Background The relationship between homicide and suicide has been studied extensively, but with conflicting results. The primary objective of this study was to examine the correlation between homicide and suicide rates in a large cross-sectional sample of UN member states.
   Methods The study used age-standardized data on homicide and suicide for 65 international locales compiled by the World Health Organization. Weighted correlation coefficients between homicide and suicide rates were computed by sex, income level, and geographic region.
   Results The overall correlation between homicide and suicide rates was weak and statistically insignificant (rho = -0.08, P = 0.5178). However, when analysed by geographic region the data revealed two distinct patterns: homicide and suicide rates were positively correlated in European countries (rho = 0.89, P < 0.0001), but negatively correlated in the Asia Pacific Region (rho = -0.97, P < 0.0001), and the Americas (rho = -0.62, P < 0.005).
   Conclusions The strength and direction of the relationship between homicide and suicide vary significantly with geographic region. The divergent geographic patterns in the relationship between homicide and suicide might be due to regional differences in social and cultural variables.

AB Background: The extent to which differences in homicide and suicide rates in black versus white men vary by U.S. state is unknown.
   Objective: To compare the rates of firearm and nonfirearm homicide and suicide in black and white non-Hispanic men by U.S. state and to examine whether these deaths are associated with state prevalence of gun ownership.
   Design: Surveillance study.
   Setting: 50 states and the District of Columbia, 2008 to 2016. Cause-of-death data were abstracted by using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's WONDER (Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research) database.
   Participants: Non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white males, all ages.
   Measurements: Absolute rates of and rate differences in firearm and nonfirearm homicide and suicide in black and white men.
   Results: During the 9-year study period, 84 113 homicides and 251 772 suicides occurred. Black-white differences in rates of firearm homicide and suicide varied widely across states. Relative to white men, black men had between 9 and 57 additional firearm homicides per 100 000 per year, with black men in Missouri, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Pennsylvania having more than 40 additional firearm homicides per 100 000 per year. White men had between 2 fewer and 16 more firearm suicides per 100 000 per year, with the largest inequalities observed in southern and western states and the smallest in the District of Columbia and densely populated northeastern states.
   Limitations: Some homicides and suicides may have been misclassified as deaths due to unintentional injury. Survey data on state household gun ownership were collected in 2004 and may have shifted during the past decade.
   Conclusion: The large state-to-state variation in firearm homicide and suicide rates, as well as the racial inequalities in these numbers, highlights states where policies may be most beneficial in reducing homicide and suicide deaths and the racial disparities in their rates.

AB This article examines how suicides influence suicide risks of others within two interaction domains: the family and the workplace. A distinction is made between dyad-based social-interaction effects and degree-based exposure effects. A unique database including till individuals who ever lived in Stockholm during the 1990s is analyzed. For about 5.6 years on average, 1.2 million individuals are observed, and 1, 116 of them commit suicide. Controlling for other risk factors, men exposed to a suicide in the family (at work) are 8.3 (3.5) times more likely to commit suicide than non-exposed men. The social-interaction effect thus is larger within the family domain; yet work-domain exposure is more important for the suicide rate because individuals are more often exposed to suicides of coworkers than family members.

AB Attempted suicide is known to be an important risk factor of committed suicide. Past studies of the relationship of attempted suicide with mental disorders have shown that it is most closely related to depression. The objective of the present study was to clarify characteristics of depression and measures to prevent committed suicide by comparing depression with other mental disorders. The patients with depression were significantly more often aged, males, married, and used methods other than poisoning by solids or liquids compared with patients with other mental disorders. Particularly, the major risk factors of attempted suicide (i.e. a younger age and the female gender), did not apply to our depressed patients. These results suggest that approaches such as intensive psychiatric treatment may lead to the prevention of committed suicide in older male patients with depression who have attempted suicide.

AB Background Few controlled studies have examined possible gender differences in risk factors for suicide. This paper examined the associations of certain risk factors with suicide among males and females aged 15-64, and the variation in the associations by gender. Methods A case-control study was constructed from the 1993 National Mortality Followback Survey in the United States. Information concerning age, race, education, living arrangement, marijuana use, excessive alcohol consumption, access to a firearm, depressive symptoms, and mental health service utilization was collected via death certificate and proxy respondent. Decedents between the ages of 15 and 64 who died by suicide were compared with those who died of natural causes. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the associations between risk factors and suicide in males and females. Results In comparison to those who died of natural causes, we found that marijuana use, excessive alcohol consumption, and access to a firearm increased the odds of suicide for both genders. For male decedents, the presence of depressive symptoms was more frequently reported for the suicide decedents in the 45-64 age group, and the proportion of mental health service use was higher among suicide decedents who did not complete high school. For female decedents, depressive symptoms were related to suicide in all age groups, and the use of mental health services was more frequent in the suicides of the 15-29 and 45-64 age groups. Conclusions The risk factors of marijuana use, excessive alcohol use, and firearm accessibility in the last year of life increased the odds of suicide in both genders. When compared to natural deaths, depressive symptomatology was common in female suicide decedents, whereas it was only associated with older age among male suicide decedents. The interactions of mental health service use with demographic factors suggested possible gender differences in suicide risk associated with severity of mental disorders, as well as the likelihood of treatment seeking.

AB Objectives: Previous research has suggested that medical marijuana policies lead to reductions in suicide rates. In this study, we further investigate the association between these policies and within-state changes in suicide risk.
   Methods: Data on suicide deaths (n = 662,993) from the National Vital Statistics System Multiple Cause of Death files were combined with living population data. Fixed-effects regression methods were employed to control for state differences in suicide rates and national and state secular trends. Analyses extended prior research that suggested a protective effect of medical marijuana policies by incorporating newer data and additional covariates.
   Results: After adjustment for race/ethnicity, tobacco control policies, and other covariates, we found no association between medical marijuana policy and suicide risk in the population ages 15 and older (OR= 1.000; 95% CI: 0.956,1.045; p = 0.98), among men overall (OR= 0.996; 95% CI: 0.951, 1.043; p = 0.87) or for any other age-by-sex groups.
   Conclusion: We find no statistically significant association between medical marijuana policy and suicide risk. These results contradict prior analyses which did not control for race/ethnicity and certain state characteristics such as tobacco control policies. Failure to control for these factors in future analyses would likely bias estimates of the associations between medical marijuana policy and health outcomes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Objective Accurate information about preferred suicide methods is important for devising strategies and programmes for suicide prevention. Our knowledge of the methods used and their variation across countries and world regions is still limited. The aim of this study was to provide the first comprehensive overview of international patterns of suicide methods.
   Methods Data encoded according to the International Classification of Diseases (10th revision) were derived from the WHO mortality database. The classification was used to differentiate suicide methods. Correspondence analysis was used to identify typical patterns of suicide methods in different countries by providing a summary of cross-tabulated data.
   Findings Poisoning by pesticide was common in many Asian countries and in Latin America; poisoning by drugs was common in both Nordic countries and the United Kingdom. Hanging was the preferred method of suicide in eastern Europe, as was firearm suicide in the United States and jumping from a high place in cities and urban societies such as Hong Kong Special, Administrative Region, China. Correspondence analysis demonstrated a polarization between pesticide suicide and firearm suicide at the expense of traditional methods, such as hanging and jumping from a high place, which lay in between.
   Conclusion This analysis showed that pesticide suicide and firearm suicide replaced traditional methods in many countries. The observed suicide pattern depended upon the availability of the methods used, in particular the availability of technical means. The present evidence indicates that restricting access to the means of suicide is more urgent and more technically feasible than ever.

AB The authors present a comprehensive review on U. S. Pacific Islander suicide and suicide-related behaviors to extend the knowledge and understanding of suicide and suicide-related behaviors among the indigenous peoples of the state of Hawai`i, the territories of American Samoa, Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Pacific Island Nations of Micronesia ( Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Belau [ Palau], and the Republic of the Marshall Islands). Historical, geographic, epidemiological, social, and cultural information is presented on these Pacific Island populations. Suicide behavioral data are presented for Pacific Islanders living within the U. S. and affiliated Pacific territories and nations from the existing scientific literature along with archival data and 2 epidemiological studies that assess suicidal behaviors and related psychosocial factors and measures of psychopathology among large community samples of youth in Hawai`i. The authors describe common patterns and differences among these populations, along with social-cultural practices that may explain suicide phenomenology among these U. S. indigenous peoples who-while small in numbers when compared with the total U. S. population-possess striking health disparities when compared to other populations within the U. S. and in their island homelands.

AB Several contemporary cross-national and intranational geographic studies have reported positive ecological (group-level) associations of intelligence and suicide mortality. These findings are consistent with facts from suicide research and with an evolutionary view of suicidal behavior. The present research extended these accounts cross-temporarily. Analysis of E. L. Thorndike's state-level personal quality scores and standardized birth rates of eminent persons, taken as proxy variables for regional intelligence, along with historical state suicide rates (1913-1924 and 19281932) showed that intelligence and suicide mortality across the USA were already clearly positively related during the early 20th century, suggesting time stability of the effect. Within the USA, the effect is possibly due to state differences in the ethnic composition, which correspond to both suicide rates and intelligence proxies. It is argued that the most parsimonious interpretation of these ecological findings remains that they indeed reflect individual-level effects, that a positive link between intelligence and suicide is entirely compatible with positive overall links between intelligence and health and longevity, and that the ultimate explanative background for the positive link between intelligence and suicide may be provided through the framework of Rushton's differential K theory.

AB Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, with an average of 105 suicides committed daily. The association between marital discord and 12-month prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt was studied in a population-based sample of married adults (N=1,384). Marital discord was significantly and positively associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, and these associations remained significant when controlling for demographics and 12-month prevalence of mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders. Results suggest that marital discord is an important correlate of suicidal outcomes and may be important to target in preventing and treating suicide.

AB This paper reports the characteristics of suicides which occurred during the existential and the non-existential wars in Israel. It provides a first approximation of whether the suicide patterns in each war are consistent with the findings of Morselli and Durkheim, and whether their theoretical interpretations can serve as a preliminary guideline to explaining the Israeli case, which is characterized by short periods of war, social integration during some of the non-existential wars, and a sharp rise in post-war male suicide rates following all of the existential wars. Implications for further studies on the subject in Israel and elsewhere are discussed.

AB Suicide is one of the greatest problems of maladjustment to the military environment. This chapter summarizes findings on demographic factors and main risk factors for suicide and provides a set of guidelines for improving prevention. The chapter dealing with the problem of suicidal behavior in military environment gives a recent literature review of different prevention approaches. Mostly, the model of prevention is based on screening, education of the responsible officers, training of the vulnerable risk groups, and follow-up procedures. Nowadays, the rate of suicide in the army is significantly lower with respect to past years, probably due to the implementation of specific suicide prevention programs.

AB The effect of firearm availability on suicide may differ among age groups. We used regression analysis to examine the relationship between suicide rates and household firearm ownership for four age groups in the nine census regions from 1979 to 1994, adjusting for regional divorce rates, education, unemployment, and urbanicity. Results showed that firearm ownership levels are correlated with suicide rates among 15- to 24-year-olds and 65- to 84-year-olds, but not among 25- to 64-year-olds. The findings suggest that if the relationship is causal, a 10% fall in regional firearm ownership levels would lead to a 3.0% decrease in suicide rates.

AB Objective: To analyze the scope and burden of hospitalizations for suicide attempts among elderly patients in the United States.
   Methods: The National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB, American College of Surgeons, Chicago, IL, 2002) was used for this study. It is a multistate database of hospitalizations for traumatic injury in the United States. Information on all patients reported to the database from 1995 to 2002 was analyzed. Logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors for suicide attempt in elderly patients, compared with both a younger suicidal cohort and a cohort of elderly patients injured in a motor vehicle collision (MVC). The impact of age on outcome after failed suicide attempt was also analyzed.
   Results: A total of 1,812 persons aged 65 and over were hospitalized for suicide attempts during the study period, comprising 9.5% of total hospitalizations for suicide attempts. Regression analysis demonstrated that elderly patients who attempted suicide were more likely to be male, white, to have used a firearm, and to have insurance than younger patients. They were more likely to have a psychiatric condition but less likely to have insurance than elderly patients hospitalized for MVCs. Mortality was higher for elderly patients hospitalized for suicide attempts than for younger patients who attempted suicide. Suicidal elderly were less likely to be discharged to home than either younger suicidal patients or elderly patients hospitalized after MVCs.
   Conclusions: The failed suicide attempt is an opportunity for intervention. By better understanding risk factors and outcomes of suicide attempts among elderly patients, we can identify higher risk groups and begin to tailor social service programs, psychiatric interventions, and medical care. A multimodality approach to suicide prevention for the elderly would include compassionate, appropriate, psychosocial interventions, and could be studied prospectively to analyze its impact.

AB IMPORTANCE: A recent increase in suicide in the United States has raised public and clinical interest in determining whether a coincident national increase in suicide attempts has occurred and in characterizing trends in suicide attempts among sociodemographic and clinical groups.
   OBJECTIVE: To describe trends in recent suicide attempts in the United States.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data came from the 2004-2005 wave 2 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) and the 2012-2013 NESARC-III. These nationally representative surveys asked identical questions to 69 341 adults, 21 years and older, concerning the occurrence and timing of suicide attempts. Risk differences adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity (ARDs) assessed trends from the 2004-2005 to 2012-2013 surveys in suicide attempts across sociodemographic and psychiatric disorder strata. Additive interactions tests compared the magnitude of trends in prevalence of suicide attempts across levels of sociodemographic and psychiatric disorder groups. The analyses were performed from February 8, 2017, through May 31, 2017.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Self-reported attempted suicide in the 3 years before the interview.
   RESULTS: With use of data from the 69 341 participants (42.8% men and 57.2% women; mean [SD] age, 48.1 [17.2] years), the weighted percentage of US adults making a recent suicide attempt increased from 0.62% in 2004-2005 (221 of 34 629) to 0.79% in 2012-2013 (305 of 34 712; ARD, 0.17%; 95% CI, 0.01%-0.33%; P = .04). In both surveys, most adults with recent suicide attempts were female (2004-2005, 60.17%; 2012-2013, 60.94%) and younger than 50 years (2004-2005, 84.75%; 2012-2013, 80.38%). The ARD for suicide attempts was significantly larger among adults aged 21 to 34 years (0.48%; 95% CI, 0.09% to 0.87%) than among adults 65 years and older (0.06%; 95% CI, -0.02% to 0.14%; interaction P = .04). The ARD for suicide attempts was also significantly larger among adults with no more than a high school education (0.49%; 95% CI, 0.18% to 0.80%) than among college graduates (0.03%; 95% CI, -0.17% to 0.23%; interaction P = .003); the ARD was also significantly larger among adults with antisocial personality disorder (2.16% [95% CI, 0.61% to 3.71%] vs 0.07% [95% CI, -0.09% to 0.23%]; interaction P = .01), a history of violent behavior (1.04% [95% CI, 0.35% to 1.73%] vs 0.00% [95% CI, -0.12% to 0.12%]; interaction P = .003), or a history of anxiety (1.43% [95% CI, 0.47% to 2.39%] vs 0.18% [95% CI, 0.04% to 0.32%]; interaction P =.01) or depressive (0.99% [95% CI, -0.09% to 2.07%] vs -0.08% [95% CI, -0.20% to 0.04%]; interaction P = .05) disorders than among adults without these conditions.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A recent overall increase in suicide attempts among adults in the United States has disproportionately affected younger adults with less formal education and those with antisocial personality disorder, anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and a history of violence.

AB Scholars have based their understanding of college-student suicide in the United States largely on the study of European Americans, and therefore, its relevance to making culturally informed decisions with suicidal Asian American college students is unclear. This article explores aspects of suicide assessment potentially unique to Asian American college students and discusses possible ways to handle the process of breaking confidentiality that are more sensitive to Asian American needs. First, the authors briefly review issues of confidentiality, informed consent, and standards of care. Second, they examine several aspects of Asian American college students' experiences in the United States and of Asian cultural values. Specifically, the authors review acculturation and the experience of immigration, intergenerational relationships, collectivistic cultural values, the myth of the "model minority," and perfectionism. Third, they offer culturally informed considerations for assessing suicidal risk and ways to manage breaking confidentiality. Finally, they suggest the Collaborative Assess-ment and Management of Suicidality model and the Suicide Intervention Response Inventory-2 as potentially useful tools for culturally sensitive work with Asian American college students.

AB Empirical studies and some high-profile anecdotal cases have demonstrated a link between suicidal ideation and experiences with bullying victimization or offending. The current study examines the extent to which a nontraditional form of peer aggressioncyberbullyingis also related to suicidal ideation among adolescents. In 2007, a random sample of 1,963 middle-schoolers from one of the largest school districts in the United States completed a survey of Internet use and experiences. Youth who experienced traditional bullying or cyberbullying, as either an offender or a victim, had more suicidal thoughts and were more likely to attempt suicide than those who had not experienced such forms of peer aggression. Also, victimization was more strongly related to suicidal thoughts and behaviors than offending. The findings provide further evidence that adolescent peer aggression must be taken seriously both at school and at home, and suggest that a suicide prevention and intervention component is essential within comprehensive bullying response programs implemented in schools.

AB Emerging evidence for the role of occupation in suicide risk prompted this analysis. All suicide records in New Zealand between 2001 and 2005 were reviewed. Age- and sex-adjusted suicide rates were calculated for nine major occupational groups. Rates for those not in paid work were adjusted for sex only. A total of 2,024 suicide cases were reviewed. People engaged in paid work had one-fourth of the suicide rate of the non-waged (p < 0.005). Those working in farming, fisheries, or forestry and trades had higher suicide rates than people in other occupations. Homemakers and people with office jobs had the lowest suicide rates. Occupation influenced suicide rates. The continuing disparity in suicide rates between non-waged and waged workers is of particular concern and needs to be addressed. Farmers and trades workers should be monitored more closely.

AB Despite the psychotherapeutic and pharmacotherapeutic advances in the treatment of depressive, anxiety, and psychotic disorders over the past several decades, the suicide rate in the United States has increased over the past 18 years. Medications are safer and more difficult to use in overdosing, but not necessarily more efficacious in bringing about complete remission of symptoms. The current article focuses on the theories and psychosocial and neurobiological correlates of suicide with the intent of formulating intervention strategies to prevent suicide. Particular attention is on medications that may contribute to suicidal ideation and behaviors and those that show evidence of reducing the risk of suicide.

AB This study hypothesizes that women are less likely than men to use suicide methods that disfigure the face. Gender differences in the use of suicide methods that disfigure the face were examined using medical examiner's files of 621 suicides covering a 10-year period from Summit County, Ohio in the U.S. Results showed that while firearms are the preferred method for both women and men, women were less likely to shoot themselves in the head. A series of logistic regression analyses revealed that gender, age, stressful life events and prior suicide attempts were predictors of methods that disfigure the face/head. Significant differences between men and women in correlates of suicide method emerged when the sample was split by gender. The results support the position that women who commit suicide are more likely than men who commit suicide to avoid facial disfiguration.

AB Background: The United States has experienced a significant rise in suicide. As decision makers identify how to address this national concern, healthcare systems have been identified as an optimal location for prevention.
   Objective: To compare variation in patterns of healthcare use, by health setting, between individuals who died by suicide and the general population.
   Design: Case-Control Study.
   Setting: Eight healthcare systems across the United States.
   Participants: 2674 individuals who died by suicide between 2000 and 2013 along with 267,400 individuals matched on time-period of health plan membership and health system affiliation.
   Measurements: Healthcare use in the emergency room, inpatient hospital, primary care, and outpatient specialty setting measured using electronic health record data during the 7-, 30-, 60-, 90-, 180-, and 365-day time periods before suicide and matched index date for controls.
   Results: Healthcare use was more common across all healthcare settings for individuals who died by suicide. Nearly 30% of individuals had a healthcare visit in the 7-days before suicide (6.5% emergency, 16.3% outpatient specialty, and 9.5% primary care), over half within 30 days, and > 90% within 365 days. Those who died by suicide averaged 16.7 healthcare visits during the year. The relative risk of suicide was greatest for individuals who received care in the inpatient setting (aOR = 6.23). There was both a large relative risk (aOR = 3.08) and absolute utilization rate (43.8%) in the emergency room before suicide.
   Limitations: Participant race/ethnicity was not available. The sample did not include uninsured individuals.
   Conclusions: This study provides important data about how care utilization differs for those who die by suicide compared to the general population and can inform decision makers on targeting of suicide prevention activities within health systems.

AB Older adults have the highest risk of death by suicide in the United States. Improving our understanding of the factors that lead to increased risk of suicide in older adults will greatly inform our ability to prevent suicide in this high-risk group. Two studies were conducted to test the effect of perceived burdensomeness, a component of the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide (Joiner, 2005), on suicide ideation in older adults. Further, gender was examined as a moderator of this association to determine if perceived burdensomeness exerted a greater influence on suicide ideation in males. The results of these studies suggest that perceived burdensomeness accounts for significant variance in suicide ideation, even after predictors such as depressive symptoms, hopelessness, and functional impairment are controlled. Gender did not moderate the association. The implications of these findings for treatment of older adults with suicide ideation and elevated suicide risk are discussed.

AB There is substantial evidence of detrimental psychological sequelae following disasters, including terrorist attacks. The effect of these events on extreme responses such as suicide, however, is unclear. We tested competing hypotheses about such effects by employing autoregressive integrated moving average techniques to model the impact of September 11 and the Oklahoma City bombing on monthly suicide counts at the local, state, and national level. Unlike prior studies that provided conflicting evidence, rigorous time series techniques revealed no support for an increase or decrease in suicides following these events. We conclude that while terrorist attacks produce subsequent psychological morbidity and may affect self and collective efficacy well beyond their immediate impact, these effects are not strong enough to influence levels of suicide mortality.

AB Higher rates of attempted suicide have been documented among people who identify themselves as gay, lesbian, and bisexual (LGB) compared with heterosexuals. This study sought to ascertain the association between childhood abuse and neglect and attempted suicide, comparing LGBs and heterosexuals. Childhood sexual abuse among men and childhood sexual and physical abuse among women were found to mediate the association between LGB identity and attempted suicide. The experience of childhood abuse likely plays a significant role in the relationship between LGB identity and attempted suicide, but other factors such as experience of discrimination are also important.

AB Each year in the U.S. more than 7,000 adults aged 60 years and older die of suicide and as the population ages, these numbers are expected to increase. While sex is an important predictor of older adult suicide, differences between males and females are often overlooked due to low occurrence, particularly among women. The National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) bridges this gap by providing detailed information on older adult suicide by sex in 17 US states (covering approximately 26% of the U. S. population). NVDRS data for 2007-2009 were used to characterize male (n = 5,004) and female (n = 1,123) suicide decedents aged 60 years and older, including incident characteristics and circumstances precipitating suicide. Stratification of NVDRS data by sex shows significant differences with regard to the presence of antidepressants (19% and 45% respectively), opiates (18%, 37%), and 14 precipitating circumstances concerning mental health, interpersonal problems, life stressors and a history of suicide attempts. No differences were found for alcohol problems, suicide/other death of family or friends, non-criminal legal problems, financial problems, or disclosure of intent to take their own life. The findings of this study demonstrate the value of using comprehensive surveillance data to understand sex-specific suicide circumstances so that opportunities for targeted prevention strategies may be considered.

AB Suicide is a staggering, tragic, and growing cause of death in the United States. Despite a government-led 20-year effort, the suicide rate increased by 25% between 1999 and 2014. To prevent suicide, it is essential to understand the biological factors-genetic and epigenetic-and environmental factors that underlie it. To gain this increased understanding, the equivalent of the "War on Cancer" initiative is needed. The War on Cancer initiative, which began in the 1970s, has transformed the treatments and outcomes of cancer, and the same could occur with a similar initiative on suicide. This article proposes a National Initiative to Prevent Suicide (NIPS), with the first step being the establishment of a National Suicide Database (NSD). The NSD would be established by a government-private partnership much as was done by the National Cancer Institute in the War on Cancer. The NSD would be established under the auspices of the National Institute of Mental Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Approximately $600 million are currently spent annually by taxpayers in the United States to support the medicolegal death investigation system, composed of 3137 county coroner or medical examiner offices across the country. In their investigation of deaths due to suicide, these offices collect extensive information, including biological samples, from the >40,000 deaths due to suicide that occur each year. The proposal presented in this column calls for this material to be stored in the NSD so that vetted government and public/private researchers can investigate the causes of suicide. This information will make possible the development of new methods, including laboratory evaluations, for assessing suicide risk as well as new treatments to prevent suicide. In support of this proposed new initiative, this article/proposal reviews the current medicolegal death investigation system and recent advances in our understanding of the biological basis of suicide. The time for action on this proposal is now.

AB School shootings have become more common in the United States in recent years. Yet, as media portrayals of these 'rampages' shock the public, the characterisation of this violence obscures an important point: many of these crimes culminate in suicide, and they are almost universally committed by males. We examine three recent American cases, which involve suicide, to elucidate how the culture of hegemonic masculinity in the US creates a sense of aggrieved entitlement conducive to violence. This sense of entitlement simultaneously frames suicide as an appropriate, instrumental behaviour for these males to underscore their violent enactment of masculinity.

AB Suicidal behavior and death by suicide are significant and pressing problems in the Bhutanese refugee community. Currently, Bhutanese refugees are dying by suicide at a rate nearly two times that of the general U.S. population. Proper identification of risk factors for suicide saves lives; however, if risk is underestimated due to culturally inflexible risk assessments, preventable deaths may continue to occur. In this review, we examine specific cultural factors related to psychopathology and suicide among Bhutanese refugees. To contextualize the current suicide crisis among Bhutanese refugees, we propose an integration of the interpersonal psychological theory of suicide (Joiner, 2005) and the cultural model of suicide (Chu, Goldblum, Floyd, & Bongar, 2010). We provide recommendations for preventing suicide from a systems framework and discuss practical lessons from a preliminary study designed to test a culturally responsive model of suicide in Bhutanese refugees.

AB Despite the well-documented increases in the rate of completed suicide among children, accurate knowledge of the characteristics of these suicides. is limited. We examined all suicides by children and adolescents in Diyarbakir during 1999 and 2001. All of the cases were analyzed regarding the age, sex, method and location of suicide, time of year, and predictive factors. There were 56 children aged I I through 19 years. Adolescents between 15 and 19 years of age constituted the overwhelming number (87%) of all the childhood suicides. Female children and adolescents predominated among the suicide victims (71%). The most frequent means of suicide were firearms (43%), hanging (28%), and jumping (16%), respectively. The majority of suicides occurred at the decedent's home (88%). Reasons identified were mainly psychiatric disorders, followed by troubles within the family. A prior suicide attempt or a note that was left by the decedent and elucidated the reason for the suicide was rare. There was no seasonal difference in rates of suicides.

AB Suicide rales have reached their highest documented levels in the United States with the greatest increases among indigenous youth, including Native Hawaiians. Culturally informed, effective prevention and treatment services are needed now more than ever for Native communities to heal and flourish. Multicomponent prevention and service strategies rooted in indigenous values and approaches show the most promise. Native Hawaiian communities are united around a common goal of suicide prevention, intervention and postvention, linking cultural meanings to improve understanding and guide local efforts. This paper highlights important cultural values to consider when developing and implementing suicide prevention, intervention and postvention. Strategies build upon the strengths of Native Hawaiian youth and their respective communities. Native Hawaiian sayings anchor each level and serve to organize a set of culturally informed and culturally embedded programs and approaches along the continuum of prevention, intervention and postvention. Application of indigenization to suicide prevention enhances connections to people and place, inspiring hope among Native Hawaiian youth, their families and their communities.

We tested the importance of the intent to die criterion by comparing self-injurers with intent to die, suicide attempters, and those who self-injured not to die but to communicate with others, suicide gesturers, using data from the National Comorbidity Survey (n = 5,877). Suicide attempters (prevalence = 2.7%) differed from suicide gesturers (prevalence = 1.9%) and were characterized by male gender, fewer years of education, residence in the southern and western United States; psychiatric diagnoses including depressive, impulsive, and aggressive symptoms; comorbidity; and history of multiple physical and sexual assaults. It is possible and useful to distinguish between self-injurers on the basis of intent to die.

   one's autonomy
SO REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE DIREITO
LA Portuguese
DT Article
DE Altruistic Manner; Assisted Suicide; Autonomy; Decriminalization; End of
   Life
AB This paper aims to analyse the right to assisted suicide. Assisted suicide consists of ending one's own life, following instructions from a medical doctor, which means the person causes their own death. Autonomy means self-determination, in which the person builds their life according to their own preferences. Based on the respect of one's autonomy, a capable person facing a terminal illness or an untreatable illness, which causes suffering, has the right of choosing death after receiving the necessary orientations by a physician to commit suicide. In Brazil assisted suicide is characterized as a crime of inducement, instigation or assistance to suicide, according to article 122 of the criminal code. Considering that several European countries, five states of the United States of America, Quebec and Colombia allow assisted suicide practiced according to the procedure established by the law, in respect of self-determination and taking into consideration that living is a choice and not an imposition, the practice of assisted suicide in Brazil in an exclusively altruistic manner, could be considered non culpable conduct.

TI Gun control law (Bill C-17), suicide, and homicide in Canada
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS

DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; FIREARMS VIOLENCE; RATES; IMPACT
AB Canadian Bill C-17 was implemented in 1991 to restrict the use of firearms, providing a chance to investigate the effect of firearm control laws in the use of firearms for suicide and homicide. Following Lester and Leenaars' comprehensive studies, the present study examined the use of firearms for suicide and homicide during the period prior to the bill and during the period after the passing of Bill C-17 to assess the association of the bill with rates of suicide and homicide by method. Analysis showed a significant decrease after passage of Bill C-17 in the rates of suicides and homicides involving firearms and the percentage of suicides using firearms. The analysis provides support for the position that restricting the availability of firearms as a lethal means of committing suicide and homicide may help reduce the numbers of suicides and homicides.

AB We examine the link between employment status and suicide risk using a panel of US states from 1996 to 2005 with monthly data on suicides, the duration of unemployment spells and the number of job losses associated with mass-layoff events. The use of aggregate data at the monthly level along with the distribution of unemployment duration allows us to separate the effect of job loss from the effect of unemployment duration, an important distinction for policy purposes, especially for the timing of potential interventions. Our results are consistent with unemployment duration being the dominant force in the relationship between job loss and suicide. Nevertheless, mass-layoffs may be powerful localized events where suicide risk increases shortly afterward. Implications for the design of unemployment insurance are discussed.

ID STATES; MORTALITY; PATTERNS; VIOLENCE; ACCESS; HEALTH
AB ObjectiveWe examined work-related homicides and suicides among farm operators/workers in the United States from 1992 to 2010.
   MethodsWork-related homicide and suicide cases from 1992 to 2010 were obtained from the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries. To calculate rates, denominator data on the US working population were also obtained from 2003 to 2010 Current Population Survey. Logistic regression was used to identify factors that were differentially associated with homicide and suicide.
   ResultsOver these 19 years, 171 farm operators/workers died from homicide and 230 died from suicide. When compared to rates of all workers, suicide rates were higher while homicide rates were lower among farm operators/workers. Males (OR = 6.1), whites (OR = 4.7), and 35- to 54-year-old (OR = 2.3) farm operators/workers had increased odds of suicide over homicide compared with their respective counterparts (ie, females, nonwhites, <35-year-olds). Those working in smaller farm operations with <11 employees had 1.7 times the odds of suicide over homicide.
   ConclusionsSuicide and homicide are both present in the agricultural industry, with suicide being more common than homicide. Translation of suicide prevention programs should be explored for the agricultural industry.

AB This study examines the association between the presence of drugs and alcohol at time of suicide in Hispanic versus non-Hispanic youth suicide victims in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The Medical Examiner's records of 435 persons aged 24 years or younger classified as suicides in Miami-Dade County, Florida, from 1990 to 2011 were reviewed. Hispanic youth in Miami-Dade County, Florida were 1.62 times more likely than non-Hispanic youth to have used drugs and alcohol at time of suicide (OR 1.62; 95 % CI 1.07-2.04; p = 0.049). Firearm use was significantly associated with drug and alcohol use at time of death. Use of drugs and alcohol at the time of death are important risk factors for suicide in Hispanic youth.

TI Household firearm ownership and rates of suicide across the 50 United

DT Article
ID GUN OWNERSHIP; RISK-FACTORS; ADOLESCENT SUICIDE; METROPOLITAN AREAS;
   VIOLENT DEATH; HOMICIDE; HOME; AVAILABILITY; ASSOCIATION; PREVALENCE
AB Background: The current investigation explores the association between rates of household firearm ownership and suicide across the 50 states. Prior ecologic research on the relationship between firearm prevalence and suicide has been criticized for using problematic proxy-based, rather than survey-based, estimates of firearm prevalence and for failing to control for potential psychological risk factors for suicide. We address these two criticisms by using recently available state-level survey-based estimates of household firearm ownership, serious mental illness, and alcohol/illicit substance use and dependence.
   Methods: Negative binomial regression was used to assess the relationship between household firearm ownership rates and rates of firearm, nonfirearm, and overall suicide for both sexes and for four age groups. Analyses controlled for rates of poverty, urbanization, unemployment, mental illness, and drug and alcohol dependence and abuse.
   Results: US residents of all ages and both sexes are more likely to die from suicide when they live in areas where more households contain firearms. A positive and significant association exists between levels of household firearm ownership and rates of firearm and overall suicide; rates of nonfirearm suicide were not associated with levels of household firearm ownership.
   Conclusion: Household firearm ownership levels are strongly associated with higher rates of suicide, consistent with the hypothesis that the availability of lethal means increases the rate of completed suicide.

AB The prevalence of suicide risk factors and attitudes about suicide and help-seeking among New York and Viennese adolescents were compared in order to explore possible cross-cultural differences. Viennese adolescents exhibited higher rates of depressive symptomatology than their New York counterparts and had more first-hand experience with suicidal peers. More attribution of suicide to mental illness was reported in Vienna; yet Viennese youth were less likely than New York adolescents to recognize the seriousness of suicide threats. Help-seeking patterns of Viennese adolescents were influenced by their setting a high value on confidentiality. These cross-cultural differences may reflect the limited exposure of Austrian youth to school-based suicide prevention programs. The findings highlight the need of taking the sociocultural context into consideration in the planning of youth suicide prevention strategies.

AB Suicide is the leading cause of injury-related death in the United States, and between 1999 and 2009 the greatest increases in suicide were among American Indians and Alaska Natives. The present study highlights the efforts of 1 American Indian community to prevent suicide using the public health approach as a framework. A survey was developed and administered by the community between March 2014 and July 2014 at various community events. The sample included 100 participants with a mean age of 15.62 years. Questions related to stress, suicide ideation, anxiety, self-esteem, and antisocial behaviors. Results from this study indicate that depression and stressful life events are the strongest predictors of suicide ideation among tribal youth.

AB Focusing on the reported growing use of firearms to complete suicide among African Americans, this article analyzes the 1993 National Mortality Followback Survey to examine the association of firearm suicide with race, education, geographic region, access to a firearm, depressive symptoms, and mental health service utilization on decedents aged 15 years and older. After controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical variables, the analysis indicates that African American men were twice as likely as White men to use a firearm to complete suicide. The findings suggest the importance for clinicians to screen for the presence of firearms in depressed African Americans and to reduce their access to firearms. In addition, clinicians, social workers, and public health professionals should consider racial differences in correlates of firearm suicide when designing prevention and intervention initiatives.

AB Introduction and Aims. The relationship between per capita alcohol consumption and suicide rates has been found to vary in significance and magnitude across countries. This study utilises a panel of time-series measures from the US states to estimate the effects of changes in current and lagged alcohol sales on suicide mortality risk. Design and Methods. Generalised least squares estimation utilised 53 years of data from 48 US states or state groups to estimate relationships between total and beverage-specific alcohol consumption measures and age-standardised suicide mortality rates in first-differenced semi-logged models. Results. An additional litre of ethanol from total alcohol sales was estimated to increase suicide rates by 2.3% in models utilising a distributed lag specification while no effect was found in models including only current alcohol consumption. A similar result is found for men, while for women both current and distributed lag measures were found to be significantly related to suicide rates with an effect of approximately 3.2% per litre from current and 5.8% per litre from the lagged measure. Beverage-specific models indicate that spirits is most closely linked with suicide risk for women while beer and wine are for men. Unemployment rates are consistently positively related to suicide rates. Discussion and Conclusions. Results suggest that chronic effects, potentially related to alcohol abuse and dependence, are the main source of alcohol's impact on suicide rates in the USA for men and are responsible for about half of the effect for women.

ID ADOLESCENT SUICIDE
AB Context. Little attention has been given to the role of firearms in suicide. In 1998, firearms were the leading method of committing suicide for both men and women, responsible for three times the number of suicides compared to the next leading method. Understanding the epidemiology of firearm suicide will increase awareness of firearm suicide as a major public health problem.
   Results. Rates of firearm suicide have changed little over the past two decades and have consistently exceeded rates of firearm homicide. The firearm suicide rate among men is approximately six times that of women. While firearm suicide rates are highest among the elderly, the majority (66%) of firearm suicides are among persons under 54 years of age. Firearm suicide rates among women of all ages have dropped modestly, while rates among elderly men have risen considerably. Whites have roughly twice the rate of firearm suicide as do blacks and other race/ethnicity groups. Individual-level empirical studies have consistently indicated that keeping firearms in the home is associated with an increased risk of suicide.
   Conclusions. For suicide prevention to be effective, the availability and use of firearms in suicides must be addressed.

AB Background: Concerns about the risk-benefit ratio of treatment with antidepressants in the light of recent evidence pointing to a risk of suicide induction during the course of treatment with antidepressants. These concerns have led to a series of recent studies exploring national rates of suicide and correlating these with data on antidepressant consumption. Methods: We have compared suicide rates in the Nordic countries with autopsy and ill-defined death rates, and antidepressant sales, during the period 1961 through to 2003. Results: There is a close correlation between suicide rates and both autopsy and ill-defined death rates. Conclusions: The role of autopsies and other factors in the registration of a death as a suicide appear to need further clarification. Copyright (c) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Suicide is a tragic, traumatic loss, and one of the most emotionally devastating events families, friends, and communities experience. Suicide claims more than 800,000 lives every year, and some of the highest rates of suicide in the United States and globally are among older adults. The purpose of this evidence-based guideline is to help health care providers recognize those at risk for suicide and recommend appropriate and effective secondary suicide prevention interventions. The information in this guideline is intended for health care providers who work in a variety of settings, including hospitals, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, outpatient clinics, mental health clinics, home health care, and other long-term care facilities. Assessment and preventive treatment strategies were derived by exhaustive literature review and synthesis of the current evidence on secondary prevention of late-life suicide across practice settings.

AB Antidepressant sales and suicide rates have been shown to be correlated in industrialized countries. The aim was to study the possible effects of psychotherapy utilization on suicide rates.
   We assessed the impact of antidepressant sales and psychotherapist density on suicide rates between 1991 and 2005. To adjust for serial correlation in time series, three first-order autoregressive models adjusted for per capita alcohol consumption and unemployment rates were employed.
   Antidepressant sales and the density of psychotherapists in the population were negatively associated with suicide rates.
   This study provides evidence that decreasing suicide rates were associated with both increasing antidepressant sales and an increasing density of psychotherapists. The decrease of suicide rates could reflect a general improvement in mental health care rather than being caused by antidepressant sales or psychotherapist density alone.

AB There are twice as many suicides as homicides in the United States, and the suicide rate is rising. Suicides increased 12% between 1999 and 2009. Mental health professionals often treat suicidal patients, and suicide occurs even among patients who are seeking treatment or are currently in treatment. Despite these facts, training of most mental health professionals in the assessment and management of suicidal patients is surprisingly limited. The extant literature regarding the frequency with which mental health professionals encounter suicidal patients is reviewed, as is the prevalence of training in suicide risk assessment and management. Most importantly, six recommendations are made to address the longstanding insufficient training within the mental health professions regarding the assessment and management of suicidal patients.

AB Cultural differences in suicide can be indicative of varying social pressures placed on individuals. High suicide rates in U.S. honor cultures have been proposed to reflect pressures associated with maintaining one's reputation. We extend this argument by highlighting that honor concerns differentially impact individuals based on gender, ethnicity, and age. Controlling for relevant confounds, we show that suicide rates were highest among older European American men from honor cultures, presumably because aging may render these men less capable of conforming to cultural ideals of masculinity. We discuss the need for process-focused and subgroup analyses when examining the effects of culture on suicide.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS

DE Suicide; Method; Hanging
ID TRENDS; PREVENTION; DEATHS; STATES
AB Background: The lethality of the suicide method employed is a strong risk factor for the completion of suicide. We examined whether annual changes in the pattern of suicide methods is related to annual changes in suicide rates in South Korea, the United States (US), and Finland.
   Methods: We analyzed annual data from 2000-2011 for South Korea and Finland, and 2000-2010 for the US in order to examine trends in the rates and methods of suicide. Data on suicide methods were obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO) mortality database.
   Results: Along with an annual rapid increase in suicide rates, the incidence of hanging increased steadily while suicide by self-poisoning steadily decreased in South Korea. In the US, along with an annual increase in suicide rates, the proportion of suicides committed by hanging increased while those committed with the use of firearms steadily decreased. In Finland, annual changes in the suicide rate and suicide method were not statistically significant during the study period.
   Conclusions: Our present findings suggest that the increased use of specific lethal methods for suicide, namely hanging, is reflected in the increased suicide rates in the Korean and the US populations. The most effective approach for reducing overall suicide rates may be the implementation of population-based initiatives that reduce both the accessibility (e. g., access to firearms) and the social acceptability (e. g., effective and responsible regulations for reporting suicide) of lethal methods of suicide.

AB Research continues to demonstrate that vulnerable youth are susceptible to the influence of reports and portrayals of suicide in the mass media. The evidence is stronger for the influence of reports in the news media than in fictional formats. However, several studies have found dramatic effects of televised portrayals that have led to increased rates of suicide and suicide attempts using the same methods displayed in the shows. Recent content analyses of newspapers and films in the United States reveal substantial opportunity for exposure to suicide, especially among young victims. One approach to reducing the harmful effects of media portrayals is to educate journalists and media programmers about ways to present suicide so that imitation will be minimized and help-seeking encouraged. Recently released recommendations for journalists are attached as an appendix. Similar initiatives with the entertainment industry would be highly desirable.

AB This study examined the moderating effects of 3 risk factors-perfectionistic personal discrepancy, perfectionistic family discrepancy, and discrimination-on the associations between interpersonal risk factors (i.e., perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness) and suicide ideation in a sample of 466 Asian international students studying in the United States. We focused specifically on perceived discrimination and maladaptive perfectionism as moderating risk factors to Joiner's (2005) interpersonal theory of suicidal behavior. We incorporated both personal and family discrepancy as indicators of maladaptive perfectionism. Personal discrepancy refers to the tendency of individuals to perceive that they failed to meet their own standards, whereas family discrepancy refers to individuals' tendency to perceive that they failed to meet their families' standards. Results highlight the significance of studying this overlooked population in the suicide ideation literature. Maladaptive perfectionism (i.e., personal and family discrepancy) as well as discrimination were found to be positively associated with suicide ideation. Moreover, family discrepancy and perceived discrimination were found to intensify the associations between interpersonal risk factors (i.e., perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness) and suicide ideation. These findings underscore the importance of considering interpersonal factors in addressing suicidal risks with populations from collectivistic cultures. Research and clinical implications are also addressed.

AB OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to present an example of a non-U.S. lawsuit in which a radiologist was found negligent in the case of a psychiatric patient who died by suicide after reading a radiology report sent directly to him.
   CONCLUSION. Although the lawsuit and its outcome do not influence laws in the United States or any country other than the one in which the case was tried, it should stimulate the radiologic community into giving serious thought to the format and manner in which reports of radiologic examinations are communicated to patients.

AB Homicides followed by the suicide of the perpetrator are a rare yet very serious form of interpersonal violence that occurs mainly in partnerships and families. No systematic research on homicide-suicide has ever been conducted in the Netherlands. This study provides an overview of the international homicide-suicide literature. Additionally, this article describes, for the first time, the incidence and patterns of homicide-suicide in the Netherlands and compares these to homicides not followed by suicide. To do so, an existing record containing all homicide cases in the Netherlands in the period 19922006 was used. Additional information on homicide-suicide events was retrieved through newspaper analysis. A total of 135 people died in 103 events. Homicide-suicide occurs with an annual incidence of 0.07 to 0.02 per 100,000 persons per year. People who commit homicide-suicide cannot be easily equated to those accused of other types of homicide.

ID SOUTH-KOREA; RATES; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MORTALITY; TRENDS; GENDER
AB The patterns of association between age and suicide rate vary by country, subpopulation and gender, and over time. To shed light on factors associated with these differences, we analysed suicide data from four populations, two 'Western' (Australia, the United States [US]) and two Asian (Japan and Hong Kong). We computed suicide rates in five-year age-groups (between 10 and 14 years and 85+ years) for men and women separately, and present graphical representations of the age patterns during selected five-year periods. Rates and age patterns differed markedly, as did gender patterns except in Hong Kong. In 1964-8, male suicide rates in Australia and US were represented by upward-sloping graphs, whereas in Japan the pattern was bimodal. By 1979-83, male patterns in Australia and US were bimodal, but Japan's was trimodal, including a middle-age peak reached in 1994-98. In contrast, female age patterns in the Western countries were shallowly convex or uniform, while in Hong Kong and Japan the upward-sloping graphs became, over time, less steep; by 2009-13, the pattern in Japan was uniform (flat). In recent decades, suicide rates of older men in Australia, US and Japan, and older women in Japan and Hong Kong, have fallen considerably. Suicide rates of men aged 45-64 in Australia and US also fell, though by 2009-13 the US rate had risen again. The suicide rate of Australian men in their twenties halved between 1994-98 and 2009-13, while rates for younger men and women in Japan have risen since 1994-98. In Hong Kong, suicide rates of young men have increased. Age patterns of suicide likely reflect period and cohort effects shaped by socioeconomic stressors, availability of health and welfare services, access to lethal methods of suicide, and other factors. Greater understanding of their impact on age patterns of suicide can result in potential preventive solutions.

AB Suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States. Individuals with disabilities are more likely to experience suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and deaths by suicide, therefore, it is imperative that vocational rehabilitation (VR) support staff be knowledgeable and skilled at interacting with people in crisis. This survey explores the suicide-related knowledge, comfort, and competency in a multistate sample of 93 VR support staff. Almost 90% of the sample reported having worked with suicidal clients, with over a third reporting doing so more than once per year. However, less than a third of participants reported having received training on suicide. Participants were generally knowledgeable about suicide and willing to ask about suicide and work with suicidal clients but rated themselves low in both overall suicide assessment and crisis intervention competency and in specific skills. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB Service members (SM) are at increased risk of psychiatric conditions, including suicide, yet research indicates SMs believe seeking mental health treatment may negatively impact their military careers, despite a paucity of research examining actual career impacts. This study examined the link between seeking outpatient mental health (MH) treatment and military career impacts within the United States Marine Corps. In Phase 1, a retrospective medical record review of outpatient MH treatment-seeking Marines (N = 38) was conducted. In Phase 2, a sample of outpatient MH treatment-seeking Marines (N = 40) was matched to a non-treatment-seeking sample of Marines (N = 138) to compare career-progression. In Phase 1, there were no significant links between demographic, military, and clinical characteristics and referral source or receipt of career-affecting treatment recommendations. In Phase 2, MH treatment-seeking Marines in outpatient settings were more likely than matched controls to be separated from the military (95.0% versus 63.0%, p = 0.002), but no more likely to experience involuntary separation. MH treatment-seeking Marines were more likely to have documented legal action (45.0% versus 23.9%, p = 0.008) and had a shorter time of military service following the index MH encounter than matched controls (p < 0.001). Clinical, anti-stigma, and suicide prevention policy implications are discussed.

TI Evaluation of competence to consent to assisted suicide: Views of
   forensic psychiatrists
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID WASHINGTON-STATE; UNITED-STATES; EUTHANASIA; PHYSICIANS; ATTITUDES;
   OREGON
AB Objective: Mental health evaluation of competence to consent has been proposed as an important safeguard for patients requesting assisted suicide, yet mental health professionals have not developed guidelines or standards to aid in such evaluations. The authors surveyed a national sample of forensic psychiatrists in the United States regarding the process, thresholds, and standards that should be used to determine competence to consent to assisted suicide. Method: An anonymous questionnaire was sent to board-certified forensic psychiatrists between August and October 1997. Results: Of the 456 forensic psychiatrists who were sent the questionnaire, 290 (64%) responded. Sixty-six percent believed that assisted suicide was ethical in at least some circumstances, and 63% thought that it should be legalized for some competent persons. Twenty-four percent indicated that it was unethical for psychiatrists to determine competence; however, 61% thought such an evaluation should be required in some or all cases. Seventy-eight percent recommended a very stringent standard of competence. Seventy-three percent believed that at least two independent examiners were needed to determine competence, and 44% favored requiring judicial review of a decision. Fifty-eight percent believed that the presence of major depressive disorder should result in an automatic finding of incompetence. Psychiatrists with ethical objections to assisted suicide advocated a higher threshold for competence and more extensive review of a decision. Conclusions: The ethical views of psychiatrists may influence their clinical opinions regarding patient competence to consent to assisted suicide. The extensive evaluation recommended by forensic psychiatrists would likely both minimize this bias and assure that only competent patients have access to assisted suicide, but the process might burden terminally ill patients.

AB Purpose of review
   Suicide is the third leading cause of death among young people in the U.S. and represents a significant public health problem worldwide. This review focuses on recent developments in our understanding of the epidemiology and risk factors for adolescent suicide and suicidal behavior.
   Recent findings The suicide rate among children and adolescents in the U.S. has increased dramatically in recent years and has been accompanied by substantial changes in the leading methods of youth suicide, especially among young girls. Much work is currently underway to elucidate the relationships between psychopathology, substance use, child abuse, bullying, internet use, and youth suicidal behavior. Recent evidence also suggests sex-specific and moderating roles of sex in influencing risk for suicide and suicidal behavior.
   Summary
   Empirical research into the causal mechanisms underlying youth suicide and suicidal behavior is needed to inform early identification and prevention efforts.

AB Suicidal individuals are unlikely to engage in face-to-face treatment. The Internet is emerging as an innovative approach for intervention delivery, particularly for those unable or unwilling to attend traditional treatment. Participants (N=459) were recruited to fill out online questionnaires on suicide ideation and help-seeking modality preference. The majority of participants endorsed preferring face-to-face help over web-based help. Results from multinominal logistic regression indicated that suicide ideation was significantly related to preferring online methods versus face-to-face methods. This study highlights that the Internet can provide a novel platform to treat individuals at risk of suicide.

AB Sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth are disproportionately affected by suicide-related thoughts and behaviors relative to their heterosexual and/or non-transgender peers. Theory and empirical evidence suggest that there are unique factors that contribute to this elevated risk, with distinguishable differences among SGM subgroups. Although SGM youth suicide prevention research is in its nascence, initial findings indicate that interventions which focus on family support and acceptance may be beneficial. It is critical that we develop and test tailored interventions for SGM youth at risk for suicide, with specific attention to subgroup differences and reductions in suicide-related thoughts and behaviors as outcomes.

AB Limited research exists that examines the contribution of family factors to the development and treatment of suicide. Although suicidal behavior occurs within an individual, the context in which it occurs can add necessary insights for understanding and preventing suicide. In this article, the existing literature on the family's psychosocial role in the development of suicidal behavior is reviewed. Additionally, a review of the limited research on the family's role in treatment following a suicidal action is provided. Finally, several directions for future research and clinical work are discussed to enhance our understanding of the family's role in preventing suicide.

AB Suicide rates are higher in rural than in urban areas in the United States. One explanation that is frequently offered is scarcity of health and mental health treatment providers in rural areas. The current study tested whether number of providers per capita would explain differences in urban and rural suicide rates within the counties of California, using data from 1993-2001. Results indicate suicide rates were higher in more rural counties, entirely due to higher rural rates among European Americans. Findings also confirmed that there were fewer physicians and mental health care providers per capita in rural areas. Nonetheless, number of providers per capita was not related to suicide rates and thus could not explain the rural-urban differential in suicide rates. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The objective was to evaluate correlations between suicide, homicide and socio-demographic variables by an ecological study. Mortality and socio-demographic data were collected from official records of the Ministry of Health and IBGE (2010), aggregated by state (27). The data were analyzed using correlation techniques, factor analysis, principal component analysis with a varimax rotation and multiple linear regression. Suicide age-adjusted rates for the total population, men and women were 5.0, 8.0, and 2.2 per 100,000 inhabitants respectively. The suicide rates ranged from 2.7 in Para to 9.1 in Rio Grande do Sul. Homicide for the total population, men and women were 27.2, 50.8, and 4.5 per 100,000, respectively. The homicide rates ranged from 13.0 in Santa Catarina to 68.9 in Alagoas. Suicide and homicide were negatively associated, the significance persisted among men. Unemployment was negatively correlated with suicide and positively with homicide. Different socio-demographic variables were found to correlate with suicide and homicide in the regressions. Suicide showed a pattern suggesting that, in Brazil, it is related to high socioeconomic status. Homicide seemed to follow the pattern found in other countries, associated with lower social and economic status.

TI Do Search Engine Helpline Notices Aid in Preventing Suicide? Analysis of
   Archival Data
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
LA English

AB Background: Search engines display helpline notices when people query for suicide-related information.
   Objective: In this study, we aimed to examine if these notices and other information displayed in response to suicide-related queries are correlated with subsequent searches for suicide prevention rather than harmful information.
   Methods: Anonymous suicide-related searches made on Bing and Google in the United States, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and Taiwan in a span of 10 months were extracted. Descriptive analyses and regression models were fit to the data to assess the correlation with observed behaviors.
   Results: Display of helpline notices was not associated with an observed change in the likelihood of or future suicide searches (P=.42). No statistically significant differences were observed in the likelihood of people making future suicide queries (both generally and specific types of suicide queries) when comparing search engines in locations that display helpline notices versus ones that do not. Pages with higher rank, being neutral to suicide, and those shown among more antisuicide pages were more likely to be clicked on. Having more antisuicide Web pages displayed was the only factor associated with further searches for suicide prevention information (hazard=1.18, P=.002).
   Conclusions: Helpline notices are not associated with harm. If they cause positive change in search behavior, it is small. This is possibly because of the variability in intent of users seeking suicide-related information. Nonetheless, helpline notice should be displayed, but more efforts should be made to improve the visibility and ranking of suicide prevention Web pages.

AB Introduction: For ED patients at risk of suicide, counseling to reduce access to lethal means (including firearms) is recommended yet not routine. To enhance practice uptake, we sought to examine the attitudes and beliefs of emergency nurse leaders concerning the acceptability and effectiveness of lethal-means counseling.
   Methods: We invited a nurse leader (ED nurse manager or Chief Nursing Officer [CNO]) at each hospital-based emergency department in the 8-state Mountain West region of the United States to complete a closed-ended telephone survey. Questions assessed current practices and leaders' views on suicide prevention and lethal-means counseling. Reponses were weighted to all eligible hospitals to adjust for nonresponse.
   Results: From 363 eligible hospitals, 190 emergency nurse leaders responded (overall response rate: 52%). Emergency nurse leaders thought providers at their emergency departments did an excellent job of safety counseling (74%) for suicidal patients. Most respondents believed that talking about firearms with suicidal patients is acceptable to patients (77%), supported by hospital administration (64%), effective in preventing suicide (69%), and something that providers should do (91%). However, the majority also had doubts about whether suicide is preventable (60%).
   Discussion: Despite expressing high levels of support for the acceptability and effectiveness of lethal-means counseling, high proportions of emergency nurse leaders expressed skepticism regarding the preventability of suicide, a finding consistent with previous work. Our results support the need to address and modify misperceptions about prevention of suicide in any efforts for widespread implementation and dissemination of lethal-means counseling.

AB In 2011 researchers published a paper that exposed a puzzling paradox: the happiest states in the U.S. also tend to have the highest suicide rates. In the current study, we re-examine this relationship by combining data from the Multiple Mortality Cause-of-Death Records, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and the American Communities Survey to determine how subjective well-being and suicide are related across 1563 U.S. counties. We extend the original study in important ways: by incorporating both absolute and relative measures of subjective well-being; by examining the happiness-suicide association at a more suitable level of analysis; and by including a more robust set of control variables in the model. Contrary to the previous study, we do not observe any significant relationship, negative or positive, between the absolute and relative well-being of places and suicide rates at the county-level. Implications for the study of suicide rates and relative deprivation are discussed.

AB Little is known about how facility-level characteristics affect the risk of suicide and suicide attempts in juvenile justice residential facilities. This leaves facility administrators and mental health providers without evidence-based guidance on how the facility itself affects risks. The current study uses data from two recently developed censuses of juvenile justice facilities in the United States to examine the relationship between facility-level characteristics and the likelihood of a facility reporting serious suicide attempts and deaths from suicide. Results suggest highest risks for facilities housing larger populations of Black young people and for facilities locking sleeping room doors. Lower risks are found for facilities screening all young people within 24 hours of arrival.

AB Suicide by burning is an extreme act that is uncommon in the United States and throughout the Western world. The characteristics of people who complete such acts are not well understood. To address this issue, we examined the death records of the King County Medical Examiner's Office in Washington State over the 13 years from 1996 to 2009. Twenty-five cases of suicide by burning were identified and used to characterize decedent demographics, circumstances of death, and motivating factors. Compared to other methods of suicide, burning demonstrated a significant overrepresentation of decedents who were women, 40-59 years of age, and Asian/Pacific Islander. They also tended to have previous psychiatric illness and/or substance abuse issues. Self-burning predominantly occurred at the decedent's residence with the intent of suicide given. There was no unifying theme in motivating factors. Together, these data represent the characteristics of people whose death is because of suicide by burning in King County, Washington.

AB Analyses of individual and aggregated data have yielded an association between suicide and unemployment, particularly for men in younger age groups. Examination of the relationship of elderly suicide rates with measures of unemployment in a cross-national study of 27 countries did not produce any statistically significant association between these two variables. Also, the magnitude of the actual correlations was small. One reason for low magnitude of correlations may be better welfare systems in the studied countries which mainly reported medium and high income.

DT Review
DE assisted suicide; Switzerland; debate
ID EUTHANASIA
AB Assisted suicide is allowed in 3 states of the United States (Oregon, Washington, Montana) but only if performed by a physician.
   On the opposite, in Switzerland, at the beginning of the 20th century, the Swiss Penal Code referred to assisted suicide in the context of honor or an unhappy love affair. It was only in 1985 that Exit Deutsche Schweiz (Exit for German-speaking Switzerland) "medically'' assisted the first patient to end his life.
   Even if authorized by the Swiss law upon certain conditions, assisted suicide is subject to debates for ethical reasons. The Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences described directives to guide physicians on this difficult subject.
   Different studies showed an increase in the number of medical-assisted suicide in Switzerland since the 1990s. Now, this number seems to be quite stable. Assisted suicide is authorized in a few hospitals under strict conditions (especially when returning home is impossible).
   Thus, according to the Swiss law, any person could perform assisted suicide; this is essentially performed by 3 main associations, using pentobarbital on medical prescription as lethal substance.
   Generally speaking, the Swiss population is rather in favor of assisted suicide. Among politics, the debate has been tough until 2010, when the Federal Council decided not to modify the Swiss Penal Code concerning assisted suicide.

AB Brenner, Barry, David Cheng, Sunday Clark, and Carlos A. Camargo, Jr. Positive association between altitude and suicide in 2584 U.S. counties. High Alt. Med. Biol. 12:31-35, 2011.-Suicide is an important public health problem worldwide. Recent preliminary studies have reported a positive correlation between mean altitude and the suicide rate of the 48 contiguous U.S. states. Because intrastate altitude may have large variation, we examined all 2584 U.S. counties to evaluate whether an independent relationship between altitude and suicide exists. We hypothesized that counties at higher elevation would have higher suicide rates. This retrospective study examines 20 yr of county-specific mortality data from 1979 to 1998. County altitude was obtained from the U.S. Geologic Survey. Statistical analysis included Pearson correlation, t tests, and multivariable linear and logistic regression. Although there was a negative correlation between county altitude and all-cause mortality (r = -0.31, p < 0.001), there was a strong positive correlation between altitude and suicide rate (r = 0.50, p < 0.001). Mean altitude differed in the 50 counties, with the highest suicide rates compared to those with the lowest rates (4684 vs. 582 ft, p < 0.001). Controlling for percent of age > 50 yr, percent male, percent white, median household income, and population density of each county, the higher-altitude counties had significantly higher suicide rates than the lower-altitude counties. Similar findings were observed for both firearm-related suicides (59% of suicides) and nonfirearm-related suicides. We conclude that altitude may be a novel risk factor for suicide in the contiguous United States.

ID UNITED-STATES; STRATEGIES; RATES
AB Objective Firearms are a highly lethal and commonly used means of suicide. Firearm retailers may be an important group of community members to train as they guide sales and have conversations about firearm-related laws and safety issues with customers. This study presents findings from the largest survey to date of independently owned firearm retailers (n = 178) in Washington State with the goal of ascertaining the extent of willingness to engage in suicide prevention efforts and factors that may underlie willingness. Methods Descriptive analyses and logistic regressions assess factors related to self-reported willingness to engage in suicide prevention activities guided by a well-tested theoretical model. Results Respondents are unaware that suicide is the leading type of firearm fatality and have high levels of exposure to suicide in their personal and professional lives. The majority endorse a willingness to learn and engage in suicide prevention activities. Knowledge about warning signs of suicide and beliefs about the preventability of suicide are predictive of a willingness to engage in prevention efforts. Reluctance to discuss personal issues with customers is negatively associated with willingness to engage in prevention efforts. Conclusions Suggestions for how to improve outreach to firearm retailers to enhance suicide prevention efforts are discussed.

AB Background: Over the past decade, suicide rates have increased among certain racial/ethnic minority groups in the United States. To better understand suicide vulnerability among people of color, studies have examined the relations between social risk factors-such as discrimination-and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. However, the literature has been inconsistent, calling for more population studies.
   Methods: This study analyzed data from two surveys: (1) The National Survey of American Life; and (2) The National Latino and Asian American Survey, which taken together are representative of Black, Latino, and Asians in the United States. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the association between levels of discrimination on the Everyday Discrimination Scale and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Additional models tested for effect modification by race and by psychiatric diagnosis.
   Results: We found that individuals who reported the highest levels of discrimination had greater odds of reporting lifetime suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts, when compared with people who did not report discrimination, after adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics. Notably, discrimination increased odds of reporting an unplanned suicide attempt and a suicide attempt without the intent to die. Adjusting for psychiatric diagnoses attenuated these effects. We found no evidence of effect modification by race or by psychiatric diagnosis.
   Limitations: Data were cross-sectional, which did not allow for causal inferences.
   Conclusions: Future translational research can explore how screening for discrimination may help identify individuals and groups of racial/ethnic minorities at risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

AB This paper places unmarried people into the mainstream of American history. It looks at the cultural construct of singlehood as a threat for the future of the American people during the Progressive Era. This fear of singlehood was based upon intellectual exchanges between Europe and the United States, and established a correlation between marital status and suicide. It is no coincidence that advocates of the "race suicide theory" targeted unmarried people, not only in their discourse, but also in the social practices they implemented.

AB African-American (AA) adolescents (13-19 years of age) have disproportionately higher rates of suicide. In this study, to explore the nature of suicidal deaths and suicide attempts in African- American adolescents, we utilized the Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBS) and the Web-Based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS) database from years 2001 to 2017. The rate of AA male suicides increased by 60% and for AA females increased by 182% from 2001 to 2017. Suicides were the second leading cause of death for AA adolescents. Additionally, in 2017 alone, 68,528 AA males and 94,760 AA females made suicide attempts serious enough that they had to be treated by health professionals. Males were most likely to use firearms (52%) or to hang/suffocate themselves (34%) to commit suicide. Females used hanging/suffocation (56%) or firearms (21%) to commit suicides. The ten states with the greatest number of AA adolescent suicides (2015-2017) were: Georgia, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York, and Missouri. There is an urgent need to further explore the changing nature and epidemiology of AA adolescent suicides and to study for whom and under what circumstances interventions can reduce suicides and suicidal behaviors in AA adolescents.

TI Does place of residence affect risk of suicide? a spatial epidemiologic

SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH; INFECTION; CANCER
AB Background: Approximately 32,000 people take their own lives every year in the United States. In Kentucky, suicide mortality rates have been steadily increasing since 1999. Few studies in the United States have assessed spatial clustering of suicides. The purpose of this study was to identify high-risk clusters of suicide at the county level in Kentucky and assess the characteristics of those suicide cases within the clusters.
   Methods: A spatial epidemiological study was undertaken using suicide data for the period January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2008, obtained from the Kentucky Office of Vital Statistics. Descriptive analyses using Pearson's chi-square test and t-test were performed to determine whether differences existed in age, marital status, year, season, and suicide method between males and females, and between cases inside and outside high-risk spatial clusters. Annual age-adjusted cumulative incidence rates were also calculated. Suicide incidence rates were spatially smoothed using the Spatial Empirical Bayesian technique. Kulldorff's spatial scan statistic was applied on all suicide cases at the county level to identify counties with the highest risks of suicide. Temporal cluster analysis was also performed.
   Results: There were a total of 5,551 suicide cases in Kentucky from 1999 to 2008, of which 5,237 (94%) were included in our analyses. The majority of suicide cases were males (82%). The average age of suicide victims was 45.4 years. Two statistically significant (p < 0.05) high-risk spatial clusters, involving 15 counties, were detected. The county level cumulative incidence rate in the most likely high-risk cluster ranged from 12.4 to 21.6 suicides per 100,000 persons. The counties inside both high-risk clusters had relative risks ranging from 1.24 to 1.38.
   Conclusions: Statistically significant high-risk spatial clusters of suicide were detected at the county level. This study may be useful for guiding future research and intervention efforts. Future studies will need to focus on these high-risk clusters to investigate reasons for these occurrences.

AB This study examines the effect of state excise taxes on different types of alcoholic beverages (spirits, wine, and beer) on alcohol-attributable injury mortalities-deaths caused by motor vehicle accidents, suicides, homicides, and falls-in the United States between 1995 and 2004, using state-level panel data. There is evidence that injury deaths attributable to alcohol respond differently to changes in state excise taxes on alcohol-specific beverages. This study examines the direct relationship between injury deaths and excise taxes without testing the degree of the association between excise taxes and alcohol consumption. The study finds that beer taxes are negatively related to motor vehicle accident mortality, while wine taxes are negatively associated with suicides and falls. The positive coefficient of the spirit taxes on falls implies a substitution effect between spirits and wine, suggesting that an increase in spirit tax will cause spirit buyers to purchase more wine. This study finds no evidence of a relationship between homicides and state excise taxes on alcohol. Thus, the study concludes that injury deaths attributable to alcohol respond differently to the excise taxes on different types of alcoholic beverages.

AB We examined the change in Swiss suicide rates since 1969, breaking down the rates according to the method used. The descriptive analyses of the main suicide methods are presented. The suicide rates reached a peak in the late 1970s/early 1980s and declined in more recent years. Firearm suicides and suicides by falls were the exception and sustained their upwards trend until the 1990s. Suicide by vehicle exhaust asphyxiation showed a rapid decline following the introduction of catalytic converters in motor vehicles. No substantial method substitution was observed. Suicide by poisoning declined in the 1990s but rose again following an increase in assisted suicide in somatically incurable patients. Suicide is too often regarded as a homogeneous phenomenon. With regard to the method they choose, suicide victims are a heterogeneous population and it is evident that different suicide methods are chosen by different people. A better understanding of the varying patterns of change over time in the different suicide methods used may lead to differentiated preventive strategies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB A history of multiple suicide attempts conveys greater risk for suicide than a single attempt. Impulsivity may partially explain the association between multiple attempts and increased risk. We examined trait impulsivity, ability to engage in goal-directed behaviors, and impulse control among psychiatrically hospitalized United States military personnel and their dependents. Individuals with a history of multiple versus single attempts had significantly higher motor impulsivity, indicating spur of the moment action. Providers are encouraged to directly assess and treat motor impulsivity among suicidal individuals. Further research should explore whether motor impulsivity is a mechanism of change in psychosocial suicide prevention interventions.

AB Multifaceted evidence (family. twin, adoption, molecular genetic, geographic, and surname studies of suicide) suggests genetic risk factors for suicide. The migrant study design is also informative in this context, but underused. In particular, immigrant studies of suicide with a continental European host country are unavailable. The correspondence of suicide prevalence among 22 immigrant groups in Austria (1970-2006) with those of the homelands during the same period was analyzed. Immigrant and homeland suicide rates were significantly positively associated. Controls for age of suicide victim, immigrant group size, national pride, and quality of life in the homelands left the finding essentially unchanged. This correspondence of immigrant and country-of-birth suicide rates is consistent with the assumption of population differences in the prevalence of genetic risk factors for suicide, for which there is emerging evidence.

AB Awareness is considered the initial step in suicide prevention efforts in the United States and many nations around the world. Yet there is limited research to guide effective approaches to increasing awareness. A recent review by Dumesnil and Verger (2009) provides a helpful overview of international suicide prevention awareness efforts and called for expert consensus on approaches. An edited book by Hornik (2002) is another comprehensive summary of successful public health communication efforts across the world, with examples of efforts that were more or less successful. Using lessons learned from these reviews, this chapter considers some specific targeted campaign efforts in the United States. Included are efforts aimed at federal and state policy-makers; the news media and entertainment media; and two US demographic groups: high school youth and military veterans. It reviews the goals and intended outcomes for these awareness programmes and highlights opportunities for research for these particular target audiences. Safety issues unique to suicide prevention efforts are considered. With these conclusions in mind, the chapter considers some current research challenges: efficient means of assessing awareness needs in target groups; and how to work with cultural values within target groups, using an example that harnesses new media.

AB Issues related to professional sport transcend far beyond the world of sport itself. Previous research on the topic of sport and suicide has found that a significant association exists between the success of professional sport teams and the well-being of people in general. Data on suicide rates in United States' metropolitan areas were analyzed from 2006 to 2007 and from 2009 to 2010 to measure the association between suicide rates and the success of professional sport teams in these same metropolitan areas. Results from statistical analyses reveal that the successes of professional sport teams are significantly related to lower suicide rates, while the only game in town hypothesis was not supported.

The data were from the Filipino American Community Epidemiological Study (Takeuchi, 2011). The results showed that the important predictors for suicide ideation were depressive disorder, substance use disorder, and years in the United States. The important predictors for suicide attempt were the number of family relatives and family conflict. Clinicians are advised to investigate familial and cultural factors among Filipino Americans. How family and cultural factors may affect suicidal behaviors were further discussed.

TI The relationship between antidepressant prescription rates and rate of

   DEPRESSION; PREVENTION; CHILDREN; BEHAVIOR; DATABASE; MAINTENANCE
AB Objective: In 2002, 264 children and adolescents ages 5 - 14 died by suicide in the United States, the fifth leading cause of death. Of these suicides, 260 were in the 10 - 14 year age group, making suicide the third largest cause of death behind accidents and malignancy. Although 60% of suicides in the general population occur in the midst of a mood disorder, usually untreated, little is known about the relationship between treatment of mood disorders and youth suicide. The FDA recently linked adverse event reports of suicidal ideation among children and adolescents in randomized controlled trials to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and consequently required a change in labeling that included a black box warning regarding SSRI use for all age groups. Given that the age-adjusted suicide rate is about six times higher in 15 - 19 year olds compared with 10 - 14 year olds, the risk-benefit ratio may be different in younger children. Therefore, this study examined the association between antidepressant medication prescription rate and suicide rate in children ages 5 - 14 prior to the FDA findings by analyzing associations at the county level across the United States.
   Method: National county-level suicide rate data among children ages 5 - 14 were broken down by sex, income, and race during the period 1996 - 1998. National county-level antidepressant prescription rate data were expressed as number of pills prescribed per person. The primary outcome measure was the suicide rate in each county expressed as number of suicides for a given population size.
   Results: After adjustment for sex, race, income, access to mental health care, and county-to-county variability in suicide rates, higher SSRI prescription rates were associated with lower suicide rates in children and adolescents.
   Conclusions: The aggregate nature of these observational data precludes a direct causal interpretation of the results. More SSRI prescriptions are associated with lower suicide rates in children and may reflect antidepressant efficacy, treatment compliance, better quality mental health care, and low toxicity in the event of a suicide attempt by overdose.

AB Celebrity suicides that are reported heavily in the media may increase risk for others' suicidal behavior. This study examined whether Internet search volumes for suicide-related terms changed after three celebrity suicide deaths (Robin Williams, Chester Bennington, and Alexander McQueen) and three celebrities who died by means other than suicide (David Bowie, Azzedine Alaia, and Paul Walker). Suicide search terms included suicide, how to suicide, commit suicide, depression, hanging, and suicide prevention. Observed suicide search volumes in the United States were collected from Google Trends for the 10 weeks before and the 2 weeks following each celebrity's death. Predicted search volumes for the 14 days postdeath were forecasted from the predeath search volumes and predicted search volumes were then compared to the true, observed search volumes. Search volumes for suicide terms significantly increased following Robin Williams' suicide death. Some of the terms increased in search volume following Chester Bennington's and Alexander McQueen's suicide deaths, but not significantly. Most search volumes for nonsuicide celebrity deaths did not change following their deaths. Celebrity suicide deaths can lead to significant, national increases in Internet search volumes for suicide-related terms for celebrities of high prominence. Results highlight the critical importance of reporting suicide deaths in the media responsibly.

AB According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide is the third leading cause of death in adolescence in the United States. Nonfatal forms of suicidal behavior are the most common reasons for the psychiatric hospitalization of adolescents in many countries. The risk for suicide attempt among offspring of suicide completers is multifactorial, challenging experts to develop a strategy that includes assessment and management that consider these factors. Although treatment of depression is necessary, antisuicide treatment strategies that solely target depression may not be sufficient to reduce suicidal risk. Other factors, such as impulsive aggression and parental history of sexual abuse, also contribute to suicidal risk.

AB This study verified variations in suicide rates throughout the days of the week among Israel Defense Force soldiers during 1974-2001. Results confirmed the findings of most previous studies. The first workday was associated with a 60% increase in suicide rate among young men. This increase was not observed among female reserve or professional soldiers. This finding might indicate a particular susceptibility of men to contextual and situational factors. The explanation of the increased suicide risk on the first workday stresses such processes as the broken-promise effect as well as difficulty in facing the demands of service and transitions from the weekend to the workweek.

AB An extensive body of research has demonstrated an association between gun ownership and suicide that extends beyond the effects of a range of covariates. We aimed to expand on extant research by examining the extent to which gun ownership predicts statewide overall suicide rates beyond the effects of demographic, geographic, religious, psychopathological, and suicide-related variables. By extending the list of covariates utilized, considering those covariates simultaneously, and using more recent data, we sought to present a more stringent test. Gun ownership predicted statewide overall suicide rates, with the full model accounting for more than 92% of the variance in statewide suicide rates. The correlation between firearm suicide rates and the overall suicide rate was significantly stronger than the correlation between nonfirearm suicide rates and the overall suicide rate. These findings support the notion that access to and familiarity with firearms serves as a robust risk factor for suicide. Therefore, means safety efforts aimed at reducing accessibility and increasing safe storage of firearms would likely have a dramatic impact on statewide overall suicide rates.

TI Exposure to Suicide in the Community: Prevalence and Correlates in One
   US State
SO PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; ADOLESCENTS; CHILDREN; DEATH
AB Objective. Suicide has been identified as a major public health issue. Exposure to suicide (i.e., knowing someone who died by suicide) is far more pervasive than previously considered and might be associated with significant adverse outcomes. As suicide becomes more commonly discussed in the public arena, a compelling need exists to determine who is exposed to suicide and how this exposure affects those left behind. This study estimated the proportion of the population exposed to suicide and delineated factors that predict significant psychiatric and psychosocial morbidity following that exposure.
   Methods. A dual-frame random-digit-dial survey was conducted on a sample of 1,736 U.S. adults in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Depression and anxiety were compared in suicide-exposed and suicide-unexposed individuals. Relationships were examined between psychiatric outcomes and perceptions of closeness to the decedent.
   Results. Forty-eight percent of weighted participants (n=816/1,687) reported lifetime exposure to suicide. Current depression and anxiety symptoms were higher in suicide-exposed than in suicide-unexposed individuals. Suicide exposed individuals were twice as likely as suicide-unexposed individuals to have diagnosable depression and almost twice as likely to have diagnosable anxiety. Suicide-exposed individuals were more likely than suicide-unexposed individuals to report suicide ideation (9% vs. 5%). Closeness to the decedent increased the odds of depression and anxiety and almost quadrupled the odds of posttraumatic stress disorder.
   Conclusion. Exposure to suicide is pervasive and occurs beyond family; as such, it is imperative to identify those with perceived closeness to the decedent. This hidden cohort of suicide-exposed people is at elevated risk for psychopathology and suicidal ideation.

AB Guided by Durkheim's classic theory of suicide, this article examines suicide trends and determinants in Eastern European countries for the period of 1989-2006, with particular attention given to the association between postcommunist social change and suicide mortality. I find that countries characterized by more drastic structural change experienced increased suicide rates during the period immediately after the fall of communism. Yet continued reforms were associated with reductions in suicide in more recent years. Further, I observe large gender differences in suicide patterns. Male suicide rates are consistently and strongly related to structural change, while female rates remain almost unaffected. By directly and statistically substantiating the relationship between postcommunist transition and suicide death rates, this study provides a more thorough and textured account of the social consequences of the fall of communism in Eastern Europe.

AB Objective: To examine the risk factors for suicidal behaviour in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients.
   Method: HIV substance dependent positive patients who had attempted suicide were compared with HIV substance dependent positive patients who had never attempted suicide for suicide risk factors.
   Results: Among the 149 HIV positive patients examined almost half had attempted suicide. Significantly more HIV positive patients who had attempted suicide were female. Attempters were significantly younger than non-attempters. Significantly more of the attempters had a family history of suicidal behaviour. Attempters also reported significantly more childhood trauma, scored significantly higher for neuroticism, had experienced significantly more comorbidity with depression, and more of them had received antidepressant medication.
   Conclusion: These data suggest that both distal and proximal risk factors are involved in suicidal behaviour in HIV positive substance dependent patients.

AB Suicide is a significant public health problem. It is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, and the rate has risen in recent years. Many suicide deaths are among people recently seen or currently under care in clinical settings, but suicide prevention has not been a core priority in health care. In recent years, new treatment and management strategies have been developed, tested, and implemented in some organizations, but they are not yet widely used. This article examines the feasibility of improving suicide prevention in health care settings. In particular, we consider Zero Suicide, a model for better identification and treatment of patients at risk for suicide. The approach incorporates new tools for screening, treatment, and support; it has been deployed with promising results in behavioral health programs and primary care settings. Broader adoption of improved suicide prevention care may be an effective strategy for reducing deaths by suicide.

AB Eight years of war and repeated deployments have led to both physical and psychological wounds in the United States Army. This paper will discuss both old and new challenges, including suicide, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI) and pain management. While an array of behavioral health services has long been available to address the troubling effects on our Soldiers and Families, these services are clearly strained. These services include Combat and Operational Stress Control, routine behavioral health care, and suicide prevention. Pre-clinical services, such as Chaplains, Military One Source and Army Community Service also offer support. We have multiple other initiatives to provide outreach, education and training, including "Battlemind," Combat and Operational Stress Control, Warrior Adventure Quest and RESPECT-MIL. There continue to be major challenges that will face our service members, their Families and the United States.

ID GUN OWNERSHIP; SUICIDE
AB Background: Among developed nations, the United States has the highest rate of civilian gun ownership, and the highest homicide rate, We examine whether the United States is merely an exception, or if a relationship between gun availability and homicide exists across all developed nations,
   Methods: Homicide rates for the early 1990s come from 26 of 27 of the highly industrialized or high-income countries with greater than 1 million population as classified by the World Bank. Two common proxies for gun availability are used, the percentage of suicides with a firearm, and the"Cook index," the average of the percentage of suicides with a firearm and the percentage of homicides with a firearm.
   Results: In simple regressions (no control variables) across 26 high-income nations, there is a strong and statistically significant association between gun availability and homicide rates.
   Conslusion: Across developed countries, where guns are more available, there are more homicides.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between family cohesion and suicide ideation in a national, adult community sample of Asian Americans (N = 2072). The data for this study were drawn from the National Latino and Asian American Study, the first national epidemiological study of Asian Americans mental health. The results indicate that family cohesion was negatively related to suicide ideation. In addition, English language proficiency moderated the relationship between family cohesion and suicide ideation. Family cohesion was related to lower odds of suicide ideation among low English proficiency Asian Americans. In contrast, family cohesion was not significantly related to suicide ideation among high English proficiency Asian Americans. Further, the findings are consistent with a model in which the relationship between family cohesion and suicide ideation was partially mediated by psychological distress. Practical implications for addressing suicide ideation among Asian Americans are discussed.

AB IMPORTANCE Suicide is one of the top 10 leading causes of mortality among middle-aged women. Most work in the field emphasizes the psychiatric, psychological, or biological determinants of suicide.
   OBJECTIVE To estimate the association between social integration and suicide.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We used data from the Nurses' Health Study, an ongoing nationwide prospective cohort study of nurses in the United States. Beginning in 1992, a population-based sample of 72 607 nurses 46 to 71 years of age were surveyed about their social relationships. The vital status of study participants was ascertained through June 1, 2010.
   EXPOSURES Social integration was measured with a 7-item index that included marital status, social network size, frequency of contact with social ties, and participation in religious or other social groups.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome of interestwas suicide, defined as deaths classified using the codes E950 to E959 from the International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision.
   RESULTS During more than 1.2 million person-years of follow-up (1992-2010), there were 43 suicide events. The incidence of suicide decreased with increasing social integration. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model, the relative hazard of suicide was lowest among participants in the highest category of social integration (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.09-0.58]) and second-highest category of social integration (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.26 [95% CI, 0.09-0.74]). Increasing or consistently high levels of social integration were associated with a lower risk of suicide. These findings were robust to sensitivity analyses that accounted for poor mental health and serious physical illness.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Women who were socially well integrated had a more than 3-fold lower risk for suicide over 18 years of follow-up.

AB Identifying whether suicides in a region are due to characteristics of the residents living there or to some enduring feature of the region is difficult when using cross-sectional studies. To distinguish these factors, we compared the suicides of a region's residents with people who were temporarily visiting the region. Using U.S. death records from 1973-2004, we focused on states with the highest and lowest suicide rates over this period. The high suicide region consisted of Arizona, Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, and Wyoming; the low suicide region consisted of Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York. For each region, we considered three groups of decedents: residents who died inside the region, residents who died outside the region, and visitors to the region. Proportionate mortality ratios were calculated for all suicides and separately for firearm suicides. In the high suicide region, visitors to and residents away from the region both had elevated suicide levels, to about the same extent as residents dying inside the region. Therefore, short-term exposure to the region and being a resident of the region each predicted suicide. In the low suicide region, the suicides of residents at home were reduced, but their suicides rose dramatically once they left the area. There was no decrease in suicides among visitors to the region. Firearm use was related to the suicide levels of each region. Overall, the results suggest that both the available means to commit suicide and the contextual features of the regions contributed to their extreme suicides. We discuss how an examination of visitors can help researchers generate novel inferences about the causes of suicide.

AB This paper employs community-level data to examine the relationship between suicide behaviors, measured at age eleven, and two mental health outcomes assessed nine-years later. Specifically, we assess the role and significance of suicide ideation and suicide attempts in substance dependence and depressive symptomatology. We evaluate these linkages in the context of two hypothesized mediators: exposure to social stress and T-1 depressive symptoms. Results indicate suicide ideation and attempts are significant predictors of later mental health problems. However, controlling for T-l depression and stress exposure explains away the relationship between suicide attempts and later mental health. In contrast, suicide ideation remained a robust predictor of depression and drug dependence. The implications of these findings are discussed.

   WEIGHT
AB Associations between overweight, sexual assault history, and suicide attempts were examined among 31,540 adolescents from the combined 2009 and 2011 nationally representative Youth Risk Behavior Surveys samples. These variables have not previously been studied concurrently. It was hypothesized that overweight and sexual assault, together, would interact and result in increased suicide attempts. Findings across analyses included (a) no significant associations between sexual assault and overweight in females or males (p=.65 and p=.90, respectively), (b) statistically significant associations between female (but not male) overweight status and suicide attempts (p=.001), (c) a strong association between sexual assault and suicide risk in males (p<.001) and females (p<.001), and (d) an elevated risk for suicide in overweight males with co-occurring sexual assault, with over 33% of males with such histories attempting suicide. Preliminary findings have powerful implications for research and secondary prevention.

AB There has been little previous study of the association between dietary factors and suicide. The association between food exposures and suicide attempt history was investigated in a sample of 270 individuals with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder. Individuals who had a suicide attempt history were almost 3 times as likely to report eating cured meat, typically prepared with added nitrates, compared to patients without a suicide attempt history, adjusting for demographic and clinical variables. A suicide attempt history was 6 times greater in those who in addition were cigarette smokers and had a history of substance abuse compared to those who did not have any of these risk factors. If dietary factors were shown to affect suicide risk, an additional method of risk reduction would be available which could be widely disseminated to address this major public health problem.

AB Suicide in the US Army is a high-profile public health problem that is complex and poorly understood. Adding to the confusion surrounding Army suicide is the challenge of defining and understanding individuals/populations dying by suicide: Data from recent studies have led to a better understanding of risk factors for suicide that may be specifically associated with military service, including the impact of combat and deployment on increased rates of psychiatric illness in military personnel. The next steps involve applying these results to the development of empirically supported suicide prevention approaches specific to the military population. This special article provides an overview of suicide in the Army by synthesizing new information and providing clinical pearls based on research evidence.

AB Objective: Physician suicide is an important public health problem as the rate of suicide is higher among physicians than the general population. Unfortunately, few studies have evaluated information about mental health comorbidities and psychosocial stressors which may contribute to physician suicide. We sought to evaluate these factors among physicians versus non-physician suicide victims.
   Methods: We used data from the United States National Violent Death Reporting System to evaluate demographics, mental health variables, recent stressors and suicide methods among physician versus non-physician suicide victims in 17 states.
   Results: The data set included 31,636 suicide victims of whom 203 were identified as physicians. Multivariable logistic regression found that having a known mental health disorder or a job problem which contributed to the suicide significantly predicted being a physician. Physicians were significantly more likely than non-physicians to have antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and barbiturates present on toxicology testing but not antidepressants.
   Conclusions: Mental illness is an important comorbidity for physicians who complete a suicide but postmortem toxicology data shows low rates of medication treatment. Inadequate treatment and increased problems related to job stress may be potentially modifiable risk factors to reduce suicidal death among physicians. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The study compared the prevalence of common suicide risk factors between poisoning deaths classified as injuries of undetermined intent or suicides among women. Data were derived from the 2003-10 National Violent Death Reporting System. Multiple logistic regression assessed the factors associated with 799 undetermined deaths (relative to 3,233 suicides). Female decedents with lower education, a substance use problem, and a health problem were more likely to be classified as undetermined death. Older women, those with an intimate partner problem, financial problem, depressed mood, mental health problem, attempted suicide, and disclosed intent to die were less likely to be classified as undetermined death. The present study raises the possibility that many (perhaps most) undetermined female poisoning deaths are suicides.

AB This study examines the inclusion of preventive factors and new media developments in media recommendations on suicide reporting. Of the 193 member states of the United Nations screened for media recommendations, information was available for 74 countries. Similarities and differences in their contents were analyzed by cluster analysis. Results indicate that of these 74 countries, 38% have national suicide prevention programs, 38% have media recommendations, and 25% have press codes including suicide reporting. Less than 25% of the media recommendations advise against mentioning online forums, suicide notes, pacts, clusters, hotspots, details of the person, and positive consequences. No more than 15% refer to self-help groups, fictional and online reporting. We conclude that media recommendations need to be revised by adding these preventive factors and by including sections on new media reporting.

DT Article
ID PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; UNITED-STATES; BURDEN; DEPRESSION
AB dThese authors argue that estimates of the net economic cost of suicide should go beyond accounting for direct medical costs and indirect costs from loss of earnings by those who commit suicide. There are potential savings from (a) not having to treat the depressive and other psychiatric disorders of those who kill themselves; (b) avoidance of pension, social security and nursing home care costs; and (c) assisted-suicide. By combining all of these costs and savings, it is concluded that the net economic cost of the 30,906 completed suicides in 1990 entailed an economic gain for the society of roughly $5.07 billion in year-2005 dollars. This calculation does not include estimated costs due to the psychological pain and suffering of the survivors. Suicide should be prevented based on humane considerations, not on the economic cost involved.

This study investigated suicide circumstances among non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islanders, non-Hispanic Native American/Alaskan Natives, and Hispanics by sex and age. Using de-identified National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) Restricted Access Database files from 2006-2015, we examined proximal circumstances of suicide among decedents aged 10 years and older. Hierarchical logistic regression analysis revealed racial/ethnic differentials in non-alcohol substance abuse problem, intimate partner problem, and physical health problem across sex and age, controlling for potential confounders. Study findings highlight priority areas for suicide interventions.

As such, suicide prevention efforts must continue to focus on expanding dissemination of suicide-specific interventions. Methods: This review explores telemental health through two-way synchronous clinical video telehealth (CVT) technologies as one approach to improving access to suicide-specific interventions. Results: Studies were reviewed if (1) the modality of interest was telemental health by CVT and (2) management, assessment, or intervention of suicidal thoughts or behaviors was discussed. A total of 22 studies were included. Conclusions: Findings from the limited existing studies are synthesized, and recommendations are provided for future research, clinical, and educational advancements.

AB Dramatic changes in the age distribution of suicide in the U.S. are associated with variations in the demographic characteristics of birth cohorts. Using an age-period-cohort-characteristic model, we show that cohort characteristics theoretically linked to integration and regulation have substantively strong and statistically significant relationships with changes in age-specific suicide rates from 1930 to 1995. Members of relatively large cohorts and of cohorts with higher percentages of nonmarital births are at greater risk for suicide throughout their life spans. These results appear for the total population and for race-sex subgroups, even though the age distributions of suicide differ substantially across these demographic groups. They can account for recent sharp increases in youth suicide, as well as more moderate increases in earlier decades.

AB Objectives In this analysis, we ask whether there is systematic variation in the reporting of suicide by medicolegal system and if so whether this biases estimated effects of social correlates on suicide. Methods With cause of death records (19992002) and 2000 Census data, we use negative binomial regression to analyze the effects of medicolegal system on suicide and nonsuicide mortality aggregated at county of occurrence. Results We find that elected coroners have slightly lower official suicide rates than medical examiners (MEs; all of whom are appointed) and appointed coroners. In addition, we find that omitting medicolegal system does not bias estimates of the social determinants of suicide. Conclusion Contrary to arguments that MEs' greater scientific training makes them more likely to underreport suicides, we conclude that appointed death investigators (MEs and appointed coroners) underreport suicide to a lesser degree than elected coroners, who are subject to greater public pressures that result in the misclassification of suicides.

AB Background
   To study the potential association of antidepressant use and suicide at a population level, we analyzed the associations between suicide rates and dispensing of the prototypic SSRI antidepressant fluoxetine in the United States during the period 1960 - 2002.
   Methods and Findings
   Sources of data included Centers of Disease Control and US Census Bureau age-adjusted suicide rates since 1960 and numbers of fluoxetine sales in the US, since its introduction in 1988. We conducted statistical analysis of age-adjusted population data and prescription numbers. Suicide rates fluctuated between 12.2 and 13.7 per 100,000 for the entire population from the early 1960s until 1988. Since then, suicide rates have gradually declined, with the lowest value of 10.4 per 100,000 in 2000. This steady decline is significantly associated with increased numbers of fluoxetine prescriptions dispensed from 2,469,000 in 1988 to 33,320,000 in 2002 ( r(s) = -0.92; p < 0.001). Mathematical modeling of what suicide rates would have been during the 1988 - 2002 period based on pre-1988 data indicates that since the introduction of fluoxetine in 1988 through 2002 there has been a cumulative decrease in expected suicide mortality of 33,600 individuals (posterior median, 95% Bayesian credible interval 22,400 45,000).
   Conclusions
   The introduction of SSRIs in 1988 has been temporally associated with a substantial reduction in the number of suicides. This effect may have been more apparent in the female population, whom we postulate might have particularly benefited from SSRI treatment. While these types of data cannot lead to conclusions on causality, we suggest here that in the context of untreated depression being the major cause of suicide, antidepressant treatment could have had a contributory role in the reduction of suicide rates in the period 1988 - 2002.

AB Evidence continues to amass on the significant impact of media coverage on suicide. The research literature on the impact of news reports of nonfictional suicides as well as fictional suicide stories is reviewed in order to determine the nature and scope of the influence of the mass media on suicide. The current review, building upon earlier reviews, is limited to English language publications or English translations of articles and/or abstracts. The interactive factors that may moderate the impact of media stories are also reviewed. Such interactive factors include characteristics of the stories (agent), individuals' attributes (host), and social context of the stories (environment). Recommendations are presented for the reporting of suicide stories, which may minimize the risk of imitative suicides. The media's positive role in educating the public about risks for suicide and shaping attitudes about suicide is emphasized. In summary, the existence of suicide contagion no longer needs to be questioned. We should refocus our research efforts on identifying which particular story components promote contagion under which circumstances and which components are useful for preventive programming.

AB The purpose of this study was to assess the independent association of physical illness and functional limitations with suicide mortality risk. The Cox proportional hazards model was used with data from the 1986-1994 National Health Interview Survey linked to the 1986-1997 National Death Index to analyze the effects of chronic physical illness and functional limitations on suicide deaths (ICD-9 E950-959). After controlling for potential confounders at baseline, functional limitations were shown to be a significant predictor of suicide. Also, psychiatric comorbidity increased the risk of completing suicide. Interestingly, chronic conditions alone were not predictive of suicide completion when functional limitation was added to the model. Implications for the clinical management of suicidal behavior among patients with chronic conditions are discussed.

AB US suicide rates have declined in recent years, reversing earlier trends. We examined suicide rates among 4 age groups from 1970 to 2002 and the factors that may have contributed to the decline. We paid particular attention to newer antidepressants because of recent concerns and controversy about a possible association with suicidal behaviors. These trends warrant more extensive analysis of suicide rates among specific subgroups, including consideration of additional variables that may influence rates differentially.
   The relative contributions of depression diagnosis and treatment, postsuicide attempt care, and other contextual factors (e.g., overall economic conditions) also deserve attention. If the decline is associated with contextual factors, clarifying these associations will better inform public policy decisions and contribute to more effective interventions for preventing suicide.

AB Firearm suicides are frequent and well described in the forensic literature, particularly in Europe and the United States. However, the use of homemade and improvised firearms is less well described. The present case reports a suicide with an original improvised gun created using an air-compressed pellet gun and a dumbbell pipe. The aims of this study were to describe the scene, the external examination of the corpse, the body scan, and the autopsy; to understand the mechanism of death; and to compare the results with a review of the forensic literature to highlight the epidemiology of homemade firearm use, the tools used for homemade and improvised firearms in suicides versus homicides, and the manners in which homemade firearms are used (homicide or suicide, particularly in complex suicide cases).

AB Background: Suicide is the leading cause of death in Korean adolescents and it exposes school teachers to the impact of student suicide. Aims: This study aimed to explore the bereavement experience of teachers following student suicide. Method: Using semistructured questions, five female teachers working at secondary schools in Korea were interviewed on their bereavement experiences. Data were analyzed using a phenomenological approach. Results: Participants described their experiences in dimensions of individuals and professions, yielding four major themes and 11 subthemes. They made efforts to learn about the suicide as a first step toward understanding. Participants suspended their grief in public owing to the atmosphere in their workplace. They aimed to tolerate the suicide and recognized their role anew in preventing student suicide. Conclusion: Following student suicide, bereaved teachers experience a variety of effects, dysfunctions, and adjustments as individuals and professionals. Their experience should be understood in both individual and collective ways in school settings and in the cultural context. The findings encourage school health providers to develop programs and policies to help teachers bereaved by student suicide.

AB Effects of weather variables on suicide are well-documented, but there is still little consistency among the results of most studies. Nevertheless, most studies show a peak in suicides during the spring season, and this is often attributed to increased temperatures. The purpose of this study is to test the relationship between monthly temperature and monthly suicide, independent of months or seasons, for five counties located across the United States. Harmonic analysis shows that four of the five counties display some seasonal components in the suicide data. However, simple linear regression shows no correlation between suicide and temperature, and discriminant analysis shows that monthly departure from mean annual suicide rates is not a useful tool for identifying months with temperatures that are colder or warmer than the annual average. Therefore, it appears that the seasonality of suicides is due to factors other than temperature.

AB Background: Many mental health professionals (MHPs) encounter youth at risk for suicide but lack knowledge and confidence to assist these individuals. Unfortunately, training for MHPs on suicide risk assessment and management is often not adequately accessible. Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether MHPs' knowledge, attitudes, perceived social norms, and perceived behavioral control in working with at-risk suicidal youth improve following an online training (QPRT: Question, Persuade, Refer, Treat). Method: QPRT was provided to 225 MHPs from three large urban areas in the United States. Suicide prevention literacy, attitudes, perceived social norms, and perceived behavioral control in assessing and managing suicide risk were assessed before and after training. Data were also collected on training engagement and completion. Results: Suicide prevention literacy in most competency domains and perceived behavioral control increased significantly after participation in QPRT. Suicide prevention attitudes and some knowledge domains did not significantly improve. MHPs reported high satisfaction with the training. Conclusion: The current study provides initial support for offering MHPs online suicide risk assessment and management training. Online training programs may be an engaging and feasible means for providing advanced suicide prevention skills to MHPs who may have numerous barriers to accessing face-to-face training.

AB Among the different research methods on suicide notes, the theoretical conceptual approach allows a particularly thorough understanding of the suicidal act. The present study focuses on 78 suicide notes collected in Geneva, Switzerland, between 2006 and 2014. The socio-demographic and medical data of the writers' notes were collected. The conceptual content of the notes was analyzed by two independent raters using the Leenaars method. The results showed that the concepts that appeared most frequently in the notes were: Inability to adjust, Rejection-aggression, Unbearable pain, and Ego. Very few differences were found in the conceptual content when stratified for age, gender, socio-economic status, or religion. This study confirms and complements the findings of similar studies on the content of suicide notes.

AB As detailed in the lead article in this Special Issue, the Survivors of Suicide Loss Task Force of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention in the United States has recently worked to formulate national guidelines to mitigate the harmful aftereffects of suicide in social and family systems. In the present article, we elaborate on one of four strategic directions addressed by the Task Force, namely, the development of goals and objectives for surveillance, research and evaluation of the impact of suicide loss. By emphasizing methodological guidelines for the conduct of future studies and illustrating progressive programs of investigation as leading exemplars, we hope to contribute to the sophistication of research on public health initiatives, peer support and professional intervention with communities, families and individuals affected by suicide loss.

ID RISK; IMPACT; LIABILITY; PATIENT
AB Suicide is the eleventh leading cause of death, accounting for almost 30,000 deaths each year in the United States. The loss of a patient to suicide is the most feared outcome among mental health professionals, while the fear of litigation and liability after such suicide may be a close second. This article will familiarize mental health professionals with the legal issues of professional negligence in suicide cases. We begin with an introduction to malpractice liability for suicidal patients, followed by an explanation of the essential elements of professional negligence and relevant legal terminology. We then discuss general theories of liability involving suicide, and provide illustrative legal case examples. We conclude with a discussion of risk management procedures that can substantially reduce one's exposure to malpractice liability. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Suicide prevention must be transformed by integrating injury prevention and mental health perspectives to develop a mosaic of common risk public health interventions that address the diversity of populations and individuals whose mortality and morbidity contribute to the burdens of suicide and attempted suicide. Emphasizing distal preventive interventions, strategies must focus on people and places-and on related interpersonal factors and social contexts-to alter the life trajectories of people before they become suicidal. Attention also must be paid to those in the middle years-the age with the greatest overall burden. We need scientific and social processes that define priorities and assess their potential for reducing what has been a steadily increasing rate of suicide during the past decade.

AB The present study represents an early stage investigation into the phenomenon whereby those with bipolar disorder attempt suicide more frequently than those with unipolar depression, but do not tend to attempt suicide during mania. Data for this study were obtained from baseline measurements collected in a randomized treatment study at a major southwestern United States military medical center. We demonstrated the rarity of suicide attempts during mania, the higher frequency of suicide attempts in those with bipolar disorder compared to those with depression, and the persistence of effects after accounting for severity of illness. These results provide the impetus for the development and testing of theoretical explanations.

AB The marked variation regarding the suicide rate in 34 European countries is well described by regressing the national suicide rate on the capital cities' latitudes and on an interaction term of squared latitude multiplied with longitude. The interaction term explains 40.8% and 29.1% of men's and women's suicide rate, respectively, and latitude explains a further significant increment of 10.9% and 10.6% variance of men's and women's suicide rate, respectively. This regression model quantifies the Finno-Ugrian suicide hypothesis of Kondrichin and of Marusic and Farmer. The European countries highest in suicide rate constitute a contiguous, J-shaped belt, spanning from Finland to Austria. This area maps onto the second principal component identified for European gene distribution, representing ancestral adaptation to cold climates and the Uralic language dispersion. Thus, population differences in genetic risk factors may account for the spatial pattern in European suicide rates.

AB Few studies have examined associations of inhalant use and inhalant use disorders (IUDs) to suicide ideation and attempts. We investigated these relationships in the largest comorbidity survey conducted in the United States. Suicidal ideation was significantly more prevalent among inhalant users than nonusers and severity of inhalant use problems was positively related to suicidal ideation. Among persons with IUDs, 67.4% had thought about committing suicide and 20.2% had attempted suicide. Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that respondents with IUDs reported significantly higher levels of suicide ideation than inhalant nonusers. Inhalant use is associated with significantly increased risk for suicide ideation, especially among women and persons with DSM-IV IUDs.

AB The emergence of suicidal ideation and suicide-related behaviour in patients receiving drug treatment is of concern because of the overall burden of these conditions and the possible link with completed suicide. Observational studies have been useful in generating hypotheses of causality but are confounded by the association between various disease states and increased suicide-related behaviour and completed suicide. The demonstration of causality requires experimental studies, especially randomised controlled trials, and meta-analyses. Unfortunately, the lack of uniform requirements for defining, detecting and recording suicidal ideation, suicide-related behaviour and completed suicide creates difficulties in comparing studies.
   Nevertheless, there is evidence of an association between SSRIs and other newer antidepressant drugs and treatment-emergent suicidal ideation and suicide-related behaviour in both children and adults; however, an increase in completed suicide as a result of treatment with SSRIs and other newer antidepressant drugs has not been demonstrated. Atomoxetine has also been associated with treatment-emergent suicidality, based on the results of a meta-analysis. Although similar associations have been proposed for some antiepileptic drugs, isotretinoin and interferon-alpha, they are yet to be supported by evidence from randomised controlled trials or meta-analyses.

AB Objective: The objective in this prospective study is to evaluate the frequency, mortality and demographic properties of suicides in our province (Batman City, Turkey). Material and Methods: All cases of suicides who admitted to the emergency department of the Batman State Hospital between April 2005 and November 2007 were included in the study. Patients' gender, age, history, educational and martial status, time and method preferred for suicide, suicide causes and mortality rate were reported. The results were discussed with similar studies in literature. Results: There were 328 (0.2%) suicide cases among 146.000 patients who admitted to our emergency department. Of the suicide cases, 75.9% were females and 24.1% were males. The mean age of cases was 23.5 +/- 7.4 years. The suicide made a peak between the ages of 15 and 24. The majority of cases attempted suicide by taking drugs orally (93.0%). Antidepressants were the most common agents (74.4%) among the drugs incriminated in suicide. The majority of cases attempted suicide due to family problems (39.2%). Nineteen patients were taken to intensive care unit (ICU). Organophosphates and hanging for suicide attempts were the main cause of suicide in the patients who admitted to ICU. The majority of deaths occurred clue to hanging (91.7%). The mortality rate for all patients was 3.7%. Conclusion: In our study the the most common method for suicide attempt was drugs. Martality was most frequent with hanging. Females attempted suicide more frequently. The suicide made a peak between the ages of 15 and 24. The majority of cases attempted suicide due to family problems

AB War veterans are at elevated risk of suicide, nonfatal suicide attempts, and suicidal ideation. Suicide is a leading cause of death among veterans. Understanding protective and risk factors for suicide in this high risk group is of great clinical importance, particularly considering the increasing number of war veterans in the United States. The interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide (1) is presented as an explanatory model of suicide in war veterans. In this model, a desire for suicide, comprised of an unmet basic need to belong and a perceived sense of burdensomeness to close others, and the acquired competence to inflict potentially fatal self-harm interact to confer risk for suicide. This chapter describes each component of the interpersonal-psychological theory and its relevance to war veterans. The interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide provides a promising framework to explain suicide in war veterans and may inform the development of screening, prevention, and intervention strategies. Clinical implications derived from the theory and directions for future research are discussed.

AB This paper reviews recent literature on factors influencing suicide behaviours, including thoughts, plans, and attempts, in immigrant and ethno-cultural minority groups, to inform a more comprehensive understanding of suicide behaviours in increasingly culturally diverse populations. Thirty-three studies published between 2002 and 2013 were identified through digital databases searches and included in this review. Analysis of study findings focused on impacts of ethno-cultural identity and acculturation, other cultural and immigration influences, and family and community supports on suicide behaviours. Policy, practice, and research recommendations are identified, to inform relevant suicide prevention efforts and enhance mental health supports for immigrant and ethno-cultural minority populations.

AB Violence is a leading source of morbidity and mortality in the United States. In this article, we suggest a public health framework for preventing community violence, intimate partner violence and sexual violence, and suicide as key forms of interpersonal and self-directed violence. These types of violence often co-occur and share common risk and protective factors. The gender, racial/ethnic, and age-related disparities in violence risk can be understood through an intersectionality framework that considers the multiple simultaneous identities of people at risk. Important opportunities for cross-cutting interventions exist, and intervention strategies should be examined for potential effectiveness on multiple forms of violence through rigorous evaluation. Existing evidence-based approaches should be taken to scale for maximum impact. By seeking to influence the policy and normative context of violence as much as individual behavior, public health can work with the education system, criminal justice system, and other sectors to address the public health burden of interpersonal violence and suicide.

AB The influences of parental divorce and alcohol abuse on adult offspring lifetime suicide attempt have not been examined in national data. This study analyzed data from the 2001-2002 NESARC to estimate main and interaction effects of parental divorce and alcohol abuse on lifetime suicide attempt. Adjusted for controls, parental divorce and parental alcohol abuse independently increased odds of lifetime suicide attempt. The effect of parental divorce was not significantly moderated by parental alcohol abuse. Further research is needed to examine whether additional parental and offspring psychiatric and substance use covariates attenuate the association between parental divorce and lifetime suicide attempt.

AB The United States system of immigrant detention centers has been the subject of considerable scrutiny with respect to health care of detainees. We sought to characterize the rates and types of deaths that have occurred within this system between the years 2003-2015. We analyzed a file of detainee deaths released by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as part of a freedom of information request. Between 2003 and 2015, 150 deaths were recorded. During this time period, the annual rate of death among detainees dropped dramatically, whether measured by annual admissions or by person years of exposure. The most common causes of death were cardiovascular, cancer and suicide. More research is needed to adequately account for the contributors to these declining rates of death in immigration detention settings.

DE suicide; contagion; Werther effect; youth; 13 Reasons Why
ID MEDIA COVERAGE; FILMS; RISK
AB Objective: "13 Reasons Why," a Netflix series, included a controversial depiction of suicide that has raised fears about possible contagion. Studies of youth suicide in the United States found an increase on the order of 10% following release of the show, but this has not been replicated in other countries. This study aims to begin to address that gap by examining the relationship between the show's release and youth suicide in Canada's most populous province. Methods: Suicides in young people (under the age of 30) in the province of Ontario following the show's release on March 31, 2017, were the outcome of interest. Time-series analyses were performed using data from January 2013 to March 2017 to predict expected deaths from April to December 2017 with a simple seasonal model (stationary R-2 = 0.732, Ljung-Box Q = 15.1, df = 16, P = 0.52, Bayesian information criterion = 3.09) providing the best fit/used for the primary analysis. Results: Modeling predicted 224 suicides; however, 264 were observed corresponding to 40 more deaths or an 18% increase. In the primary analysis, monthly suicides exceeded the 95% confidence limit for 3 of the 9 months (May, July, and October). Conclusion: The statistical strength of the findings here is limited by small numbers; however, the results are in line with what has been observed in the United States and what would be expected if contagion were occurring. Further research in other locations is needed to increase confidence that the associations found here are causal.

AB According to the latest statistics from the American Association of Suicidology, there were approximately 41,000 suicides in the United States, accounting for 112 suicides per day or one every 12.8 minutes (Drapeau & McIntosh, 2015). Survivors bereaved by suicide often experience complicated grief and feelings of social isolation. The study was a secondary data analysis from a study which involved 44 participants over the age of 18 from Southwestern Pennsylvania. Symptoms of depression and loneliness were assessed in relation to reported social support available to participants. The findings support the notion that increased availability of support can decrease symptoms of depression. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB According to Durkheim (1897), periods of economic, social, or political change result in a state of anomie or normlessness. Anomic periods lead to deregulation of desires and suffering. Durkheim hypothesized that, as an expression of suffering, societies and groups experience an increase in suicide rates. This paper provides two formal tests of Durkheim's (1897) theory of anomie - a behavioral aggregate analysis and an attitudinal individual-level analysis - on the backdrop of the 2008 economic crash. The first analysis assesses the relationship between unemployment and suicide in the European Union between 2000 and 2010. Results provide conditional support for Durkheim's theory: suicide rates increased following the crash and decreased once economic stability resumed in 2010 for males only. A second attitudinal analysis identified factors contributing to the gendered relationship between anomie and suicide. Results indicated that traditional Durkheimian regulatory mechanisms, such as marriage and divorce, contributed to the gender-specific results.

AB Introduction: Suicide is among the 10 most common causes of death in the United States. Researchers have identified a number of factors associated with completed suicide, including marijuana use, and increased land elevation. Colorado is an ideal state to test the strength of these associations. The state has a completed suicide rate well above the national average and over the past 15 years has permitted first the medical and, as 2014, the recreational use of marijuana. Objectives: To determine if there is a correlation between medical marijuana use, as assessed by the number of medical marijuana registrants and completed suicides per county in Colorado. Methods: The number of medical marijuana registrants was used as a proxy for marijuana use. Analysis variables included total medical marijuana registrants, medical marijuana dispensaries per county, total suicide deaths, mechanism of suicide death, gender, total suicide hospitalizations, total unemployment, and county-level information such as mean elevation and whether the county was urban or rural. Analysis was performed with mixed model Poisson regression using generalized linear modeling techniques. Results: We found no consistent association between the number of marijuana registrants and completed suicide after controlling for multiple known risk factors for completed suicide. Conclusion: The legalization of medical marijuana may not have an adverse impact on suicide rates. Given the concern for the increased use of marijuana after its legalization, our negative findings provide some reassurance. However, this conclusion needs to be examined in light of the limitations of our study and may not be generalizable to those with existing severe mental illness. This finding may have significant public health implications for the presumable increase in marijuana use that may follow legalization.

AB By studying the number and method of homicidal poisoning in Miami-Dade County, Florida; New York City, NY; Oakland County, Michigan; and Sweden, we have confirmed that this is an infrequently established crime.
   Several difficulties come with the detection of homicidal poisonings. Presenting symptoms and signs are often misdiagnosed as natural disease, especially if the crime is committed in a hospital environment, suggesting that an unknown number of homicides go undetected.
   In the reported cases analyzed, the lethal agent of choice has changed over the years. In earlier years, traditional poisons such as arsenic, cyanide, and parathion were frequently used. Such poisonings are nowadays rare, and instead, narcotics are more commonly detected in victims of this crime.

AB Suicide timing varies across several psychiatric disorders, which may share common underlying pathophysiological mechanisms with epilepsy. We investigated suicide timing in people with epilepsy.
   Using cross-sectional, population-based U.S. National Violent Death Reporting System data from 2003 through 2014 in 18 States, we identified 1310 suicides with epilepsy and 102,582 suicides without epilepsy among those 10 years and older. We compared patterns of suicide mortality ratios between those with and without epilepsy by month of year, week of month, day of week, time of day, and overall by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. As the suicide patterns seen among persons without epilepsy, suicides in persons with epilepsy occurred significantly more often during the morning, afternoon, and evening hours than at night in all subgroups except females. Compared to Sundays, suicides in persons with epilepsy were only significantly increased on Mondays and Tuesdays in those aged >= 45 years and only on Mondays in men. This pattern differs from persons without epilepsy whose suicides significantly increased on Mondays and significantly decreased on Saturdays in nearly all study subgroups. Suicides in persons with epilepsy did not exhibit the timing patterns of persons without epilepsy by week of month (significant decreases from the third to fifth weeks compared to the first week among those aged >= 45 years, males, and Non-Hispanic whites) and month of year (significant increases from January to November peaking from June to September compared to December in all study groups). Compared to the general population or people without epilepsy, previous and current studies suggest that in people with epilepsy, suicide timing differs from and suicide rates significantly exceed those in people without epilepsy. Preventing suicide in people with epilepsy should focus not only on the peak times of occurrence but also across all time periods. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The effects observed in these ecological (group-level) analyses were of small size, with correlation coefficients ranging from .05 to .25, thus mostly falling below the nominal statistical significance level. The present evidence nevertheless adds to several recent findings from international geographical studies by Lester and by Voracek of a positive association of intelligence and suicide mortality by indicating that this pattern may also exist on the within-nation level.

AB The presence of firearms in the home increases the risk of suicide for residents. As a result, clinicians and professional organizations recommend counseling about temporary removal of firearms from the home of potentially suicidal individuals. In some states, however, firearm laws may affect the ability to easily transfer a gun temporarily to reduce suicide risk. In particular, universal background check (UBC) laws-which require a background check whenever a gun is transferred, even by non-gun dealers-may also apply to temporary transfers intended to reduce suicide risk. Clinicians have previously reported that confusion regarding state firearm laws and uncertainty over the legality of a temporary transfer have affected their ability to effectively counsel patients. We summarize the laws of all 50 states and specifically examine the relevant firearm laws of 3 representative states with UBCs and different approaches-Maryland, Colorado, and California. We identify both helpful and problematic aspects of state laws regarding temporary transfer of firearms. We provide recommendations for amending UBC laws to make it easier for clinicians and patients to temporarily transfer firearms.

AB A central objective of the Surgeon General's National Strategy for Suicide Prevention is to focus on older adults. We review individual risk-factors for suicide in late life and then introduce an ecological model to expand conceptualization of elder suicide. We first look at the role of firearms, providing evidence that firearm availability increases the means of elder suicide and gun access policies can contribute to reducing risk. Next, we focus on primary care providers, documenting how older adults often come into contact with these professionals before ending their lives and how these providers could take a more active role in mediating individual-level risk factors. We then turn our attention to the intersection between gun access and primary care and consider how advancing standards of care concerning gun access and suicide risk might be an effective policy alternative for blocking the pathway to suicide among older adults.

AB Annual suicide rates of Hungary were unexpectedly high in the previous century. In our narrative review, we try to depict, with presentation of the raw data, the main descriptive epidemiological features of the Hungarian suicide scene of the past decades. Accordingly, we present the annual suicide rates of the period mentioned and also data on how they varied by gender, age, urban vs. rural living, seasons, marital status, etc. Furthermore, the overview of trends of other factors that may have influenced suicidal behavior (e. g., alcohol and tobacco consumption, antidepressant prescription, unemployment rate) in the past decades is appended as well. Based on raw data and also on results of the relevant papers of Hungarian suicidology we tried to explain the observable trends of the Hungarian suicide rate. Eventually, we discuss the results, the possibilities, and the future tasks of suicide prevention in Hungary.

AB Objective: A high percentage of suicide victims have seen a primary care physician in the months before committing suicide. Thus, primary care physicians may play an important role in suicide prevention.
   Method: The authors mailed a survey to directors of training programs in family practice, internal medicine, and pediatrics, and 50.5% responded. Data obtained were analyzed with WebStat.
   Results: Training directors reported deficiencies in training in suicide and depression. Notably, less than half of the internal medicine and pediatrics training directors who replied reported that teaching about suicide was adequate. The majority of them indicated a need for standardized curricular materials on suicide and depression.
   Conclusions: Experts could provide standardized curricula to primary care residencies in the recognition and management of suicide and depression. More robust training about these vital mental health concerns in primary care could reduce morbidity and mortality.

ID PSYCHIATRIC-PATIENTS; SCOTLAND; INPATIENTS; ENGLAND; TRENDS; WALES
AB This retrospective case note review describes the demographic, forensic and psychiatric backgrounds of 14 in-patient suicides in a maximum secure hospital. The majority were schizophrenic with chronic treatment-resistant illnesses, who had committed proportionally more violent offences, had a history of serious self-injury but no recognized clear depressive episodes. This profile is markedly different from that reported in general psychiatric in-patients, out-patients and suicides in prison, but is similar to that described in a maximum secure hospital in the United States and in long-stay patients in Canada. Many of the patients had continued to experience significantly subjective distress over many years. The clinical relevance of this series is discussed in the context of the assessment of suicidal intent in psychotic patients. We speculate that the decrease in in-patient suicides in the State Hospital may be due to a less restrictive ward milieu, increased staff/patient ratios, or the introduction of Clozapine.

AB The statistics on suicide in the United States are noteworthy, with current estimates revealing that one suicide occurs every 17 minutes. Although minimally addressed in the nursing literature in the 1990s, nursing student suicide and its effects remain important topics to revisit. Nursing program administrators and faculty innately know how to assist surviving nursing students through a crisis such as this. However, the same attention and resolve do not appear to be focused on surviving nursing faculty and staff. This article profiles a crisis intervention approach that may be considered for implementation in nursing programs before a crisis (such as a nursing student suicide) occurs so that appropriate and systematic interventions are put into action for all who may be affected.

AB Social, economic, violence, political, and gun access predictors of suicide and gun suicide were examined via sociological autopsy. The model predicting suicide rates overall had the best results, chi(2)(9, N = 50) = 5.279 (CMIN, the goodness of fit statistic that represents the minimum discrepancy between the unrestricted sample covariance matrix and the restricted covariance matrix) p = .809, [the goodness of fit statistic that represents the minimum discrepancy between the unrestricted sample covariance matrix and the restricted covariance matrix] indicating an excellent fit of the data and theoretical model. The model explained 76% of the variance in state suicide rates and was a significantly better predictor than one could expect by chance, F(6,43) = 22.889, p < .001). All path coefficients were significant predictors of suicide with the exception of violence climate, which was not included. This study contributes to the theoretical knowledge by adding a comprehensive framework of analysis and model useful for prevention.

TI Oregon's guidelines for physician-assisted suicide: A legal and ethical
   analysis
SO UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID EUTHANASIA
AB Oregon's Death With Dignity Act was first passed by a ballot initiative in 1994, but numerous judicial challenges delayed implementation of the Act. In November of 1997, following the United States Supreme Court decisions in Vacco v. Quill and Washington v. Glucksberg, which left the states' power to regulate physician-assisted suicide undisturbed, the Oregon voters upheld their law. Oregon remains the only state in the nation to authorize physician-assisted suicide. The Task Force to Improve the Care of Terminally Ill Oregonians published a Guidebook for health care providers on the Oregon Act, and the New England Journal of Medicine recently issued a special report on the first year's experience under the Act. This paper analyzes the legal context of the Oregon Death With Dignity Act, discusses the efficacy of the tenets in the Guidebook, and explores ethical issues underlying the guidelines, particularly those pertaining to the meaning of a patient's request for assisted suicide and processes supporting informed consent.

AB While Russia perennially has one of the highest suicide rates in the world, researchers had little access to valid data during the Soviet era to examine this issue. Transparency increased following the dissolution of the USSR, and this article employs newly available vital statistics data to describe the demographic, temporal, and spatial patterns of suicide in Russia. The discussion reveals that suicide mortality in Russia is among the highest in the world and is more than three times higher than in the United States; exhibited radical changes between 1984 and 1994; varies widely within the country, with a general increase in rates from west to east; and is highest among working-age males.

AB Several reports indicate that suicide follows a seasonal pattern with a dominant peak during the month of maximum daylight. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that sunshine exposure may trigger suicidal behavior. We found a remarkably consistent pattern of seasonality with peak incidence around June in the northern hemisphere and December in the southern hemisphere. Moreover, there was a positive association between the seasonal amplitude of suicide (measured by relative risk) and total sunshine in the corresponding country. These findings indicate that sunshine may have a triggering effect on suicide, and suggests further research in the field of sunshine, regulated hormones, particularly melatonin.

AB To identify various biopsychosocial risk factors associated with suicidality in juvenile detention facilities and the effectiveness of suicide prevention protocols currently in use. Medical literature searches were conducted using databases like Pub Med, Ovid, and Google Scholar to identify studies conducted in and outside of United States. The prevalence of suicide among youth imprisoned at detention facilities has risen. Psychiatric disorders are common among such population, making them vulnerable to suicidal tendencies. Suicide risk screening within first 24 h of admission to the detention facility has shown to lower the risk of suicide. Identification of high risk individuals and their further psychiatric assessment is advocated. Much of work with regards to screening tools and instruments is underway and further study is required to get a better understanding.

AB The high rates of suicide attempts among adolescent Hispanic females in the United States have been well established by epidemiological and clinical studies. In this paper, we review the research history of Latina suicide attempts and their characteristics. Then we apply multi-faceted conceptual and empirical criteria found in the anthropological and psychiatric literature about cultural idioms of distress to the suicide attempts of young Latinas. We contrast the suicide-attempt phenomenon to the well-known ataque de nervios and propose that the phenomenon may reflect a developmental or cultural variant of the ataque. The attempt-as-idiom proposition is intended to invite discussion that can deepen our understanding of the cultural roots of the suicide attempts and their possible designation as cultural idiom. Establishing the meaning of suicide attempts within a cultural perspective can assist psychological and psychiatric research and clinical interventions.

AB Alcohol misuse increases risk of suicidal behavior in older adults. The Depressive Symptom Inventory-Suicidality Subscale (DSI-SS; Metalsky & Joiner, 1997) and its relation to suicide attempt history was examined to see if it differed for older adults as a function of their alcohol use. Structural equation modeling was used in a sample (N = 1,061) of older adult outpatients to examine the scales measurement invariance and population heterogeneity and its relation to suicide attempt history. Analyses supported the equivalence of the DSI-SS in risky and nonrisky drinkers. The DSI-SS significantly predicted past suicide attempts. Findings support the viability of the DSI-SS as suicide screening tool for older adults.

AB Suicide in adolescents is a global tragedy. Research-identified correlates of suicide in youth include depression, academic failure, loss of friends, social isolation, and substance abuse, among others. This review focuses on the potential link between chronic illness in adolescents and increased suicide risk. Research suggests that chronic illness is a risk factor for depression in adolescents that may induce suicide ideation and attempts; however, this risk may be increased even more in young adulthood if the underlying causes of depression are not resolved. This risk needs to be considered against the research data noting an increase in suicide attempts and completions, in each decade of life from adolescence into adulthood. Although more research is clearly needed, it can be concluded that suicide risks are seen in adolescents with chronic illness and all of these young people should be screened for depression and other risk factors for suicide on a regular basis.

   Methods A negative binomial regression model and county mortality data are used to estimate the effect of recession and rurality on county-level suicides from 2002-2016.
   Results After accounting for differences in population, urban counties have more female suicides than rural counties, but urban counties experience smaller increases in female suicide numbers during periods of recession than rural counties. Long-term factors such as high chronic poverty or unemployment have a greater impact on male suicide rates, while short-term economic crises have a larger impact on female suicides. Higher percentages of children in the county have an increasing effect on male suicides, but a decreasing effect on female suicides. Finally, farm-dependent counties have fewer suicides than non-farm-dependent counties. This holds true for both males and females.
   Conclusions Periods of recession impact suicide numbers; however, this effect is most noticeable for females, with rural counties having larger increases in female suicide numbers than their urban counterparts during recession years.

AB We assessed the moderating role of posttraumatic growth on the relationship between traumatic life events and suicidal ideation and behavior, suicide risk, and college adjustment. The sample of 557 college students completed questionnaires measuring their severity and number of traumatic life events, posttraumatic growth, suicidal thoughts, behavior, risk, and college adjustment. Students with the most severe traumatic life events, if they had experienced posttraumatic growth following their trauma, were less likely to have high suicide risk and more likely to have better college adjustment. Posttraumatic growth may be important in ameliorating the effects of suicide-inducing trauma.

AB Background Social factors have been shown to be predictors of suicide. It is not known whether these factors vary between countries.
   Aims To present a first European overview of socio-economic inequalities in suicide mortality among men and women.
   Method We used a prospective follow-up of censuses matched with vital statistics in ten European populations. Directly standardised rates of suicide were computed for each country.
   Results In men, a low level of educational attainment was a risk factor for suicide in eight out often countries. Suicide inequalities were smaller and less consistent in women. In most countries, the greater the socio-economic disadvantage, the higher is the risk of suicide. The population of Turin evidenced no socio-economic inequalities.
   Conclusions Socio-economic inequalities in suicide are a generalised phenomenon in western Europe, but the pattern and magnitude of these inequalities vary between countries. These inequalities call for improved access to psychiatric care for lower socio-economic groups.

AB The object is to analyse the influence of the economic cycle on suicide and homicide rate in the Czech Republic. The homicide and suicide are deliberately overlooked, because it has a negative impact on the development of the economic cycle. For that reason it belongs to delicate issues in the Czech Republic and other countries.
   In recent years, the Czech Republic passed through major changes in the economic situation. In 2008, the economic recession began in the United States and gradually affected many countries around the world, including the Czech Republic. The work will also analyse the impact of these changes.
   GDP data, information about suicide and homicide will be used from the Czech Statistical Office.
   The work presents the development of GDP, suicide and homicide rate in the Czech Republic. It will analyze the existence of a relation between GDP and suicide, GDP and homicide. Results will be compared with the economic theory of the business cycle on suicide and homicide by Henry and Short.

AB Objective. Research on occupation and suicide has neglected multivariate models. It is not clear, for example, if persons in alleged "high-risk" occupations have high suicide risk because of occupational stress associated with the occupation or because of the demographic composition of the people in the occupation. The present study explores the relationship between occupation and suicide for 32 occupational groups. Methods. Data are from the national mortality file tapes, which cover 21 states. They refer to 9,499 suicides and 134,386 deaths from all other causes in 1990. Results. Bivariate logistic regression models find a total of 15 occupations with either significantly higher (e.g., dentists, artists, machinists, auto mechanics, and carpenters) or lower (e.g., clerks, elementary school teachers, cooks) risk than the rest of the working-age population. Multivariate models that remove the demographic covariates of occupation find only eight occupations with greater or lower than expected risk of death by suicide. Conclusion. The results underscore the need for demographic controls in the assessment of occupational risk of suicide. They are consistent with a previous study based on data from England. The findings provide the first systematic evidence on the problem for the United States.

AB Euthanasia is a debatable issue. It is illegal all over the world. The Netherlands is the only country where euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are openly practised since the physician performing these acts will not be prosecuted under certain circumstances. There were several court cases and court decisions that affected the development of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in individual countries. When a patient asked for euthanasia, it was very important to find out the underlying reasons and make all legal means available to relieve the pain and other distressing symptoms.

AB Suicide is a leading cause of death in older adulthood, and most (80%) older men who die of suicide do so with firearms. This paper examines a number of risk factors and precipitating circumstances that contribute to suicidal behavior involving firearms among men aged 65 and older. Data were obtained from the 2003 to 2007 National Violent Death Reporting System restricted access database. Using multivariate logistic regression, a model was developed to differentiate older male suicide decedents who used firearms from those who used other suicide methods. The results show that the presence of a health problem at the time of death was one of the best predictors of suicide with a firearm. Place of suicide (predominantly rural) and veteran status further increased likelihood of firearm use among older men. Suicides occurring in mostly rural counties and in the South were significantly more likely to involve firearms. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for suicide researchers, clinicians, policymakers, and men and masculinity scholars.

AB Some peculiarly low male-to-female suicide ratios have been reported in the Far Eastern populations. This article attempts to investigate whether there are gender differences in suicide risk by socio-demographic factors in Hong Kong, and hereby to explain the low male-to-femate suicide ratios. The effects of marital status, duration-of-residence, and occupational status on suicide are first studied by periodic suicide rates in 1990-1992, and 2000-2002, then by Poisson regression. Some interesting results are found: Unlike most findings elsewhere, migration in Hong Kong did not induce suicide; occupational status was negatively related to suicide only for men but not for women; the particularly low male-to-female suicide ratio was not due to a larger protection from marriage for men than for women as reported in the literature, but very probably to a very high suicide rate for the non-working population. The authors suggest some plausible explanations of the findings and hence further research to be conducted.

AB Introduction: The purpose of this study was to document the association between education and suicide risk, in light of rising suicide rates and socioeconomic differentials in mortality in the U.S.
   Methods: Differentials and trends in U.S. suicide rates by education were examined from 2000 to 2014 using death certificate data on 442,135 suicides from the National Center for Health Statistics and Census data. Differences in the circumstances and characteristics of suicide deaths by education were investigated using 2013 data from the National Violent Death Reporting System for nine states. Analyses were conducted in 2016.
   Results: Between 2000 and 2014, men and women aged Z25 years with at least a college degree exhibited the lowest suicide rates; those with a high school degree displayed the highest rates. Men with a high school education were twice as likely to die by suicide compared with those with a college degree in 2014. The education gradient in suicide mortality generally remained constant over the study period. Interpersonal/relationship problems and substance abuse were more common circumstances for less educated decedents. Mental health issues and job problems were more prevalent among college-educated decedents.
   Conclusions: The findings highlight the importance of social determinants in suicide risk, with important prevention implications. (C) 2017 American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The suicide rate in the United States has climbed each year for more than a decade, highlighting the need for greater understanding of, and prevention strategies for suicidal behavior. Nightmares have been shown to be associated with suicidal behavior independent of several psychiatric risk factors for suicide, such as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The specific role of nightmares in contributing to suicide remains unclear due to the difficulty in delineating causal factors. However, the reporting, screening and treatment of nightmares continues to remain rare making progress difficult. Research is beginning to make some progress in uncovering the mechanisms by which nightmares increase suicide risk providing opportunities for intervention and prediction of suicidal behaviors.

AB Objective: To determine the proportion of youth suicides in New York City from 1999 to 2002 in which antidepressants were detected at autopsy. Method: This is a medical examiner surveillance study of suicides in New York City among those younger than 18 years of age. The outcome measure is serum toxicology for antidepressants. Results: From 1999 through 2002, there were 41 individuals younger than 18 years of age among residents of New York City who committed suicide. Thirty-six (87.8%) had a serum toxicological analysis and an injury death interval of 3 days or less. There was one (2.8%) suicide in which both buproprion and sertraline were detected at the time of autopsy. Antidepressants were not detected in any of the other youth suicides. Conclusions: The detection of antidepressants at autopsy was quite rare in youth suicides in New York City from 1999 to 2002.

AB Gun control is the prototypical example of controlling the environment for the means of suicide, an effective public health approach to suicide prevention. Canada's Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1977 (Bill C-51) provides an excellent opportunity to illustrate the effects of legislative gun-control laws and the impact on suicide. The research in Canada supports the significant effect of C-51 in reducing suicides and firearm suicides, even if one controls for socioeconomic factors, although not equally for all ages. The young, a high-risk group, show the most significant decrease, without significant substitution of other methods (displacement). Studies on gun-control laws from New Zealand, the United States, and Australia support the Canadian findings. It is concluded that, although not equally applicable in all countries, gun control may well have significant applications in reducing suicide worldwide.

AB Suicide is a major public health concern in South Korea, and self-poisoning by pesticides is one of the common methods of suicide. Pesticide ban policies have been successful for suicide prevention; however, no studies have shown their effect according to occupational groups. The present study analyzed suicide and suicide by pesticide rates among South Korean workers aged 15-64 in 2003-2017, their associations with occupational groups, and the impact of three major economic indices on these factors. Workers in the agriculture, forestry, and fishery industries had relative risks of 5.62 (95% CI: 5.54-5.69) for suicide overall and 25.49 (95% CI: 24.46-26.57) for suicide by pesticide. The real gross domestic product had a positive association with suicide overall only in the last five-year period investigated in this study, and the unemployment rate consistently had a positive association. The economic status and policy for suicide prevention affected suicide and suicide by pesticide rates differently among occupational groups and different time periods. Policy addressing suicidal risk for different occupational groups should be of concern in South Korea.

AB This study describes the prevalence of suicide ideation in 109 Global School-based Health Surveys (GSHS) conducted from 2003-2010 representing 49 different countries and 266,694 school-attending students aged 13-15 years primarily living in developing areas of the World. Prevalence of suicide ideation varied widely among and between countries, regions, and by gender, with an overall mean prevalence of suicide ideation of 15.3%. When grouped by region, Africa had the highest percentage of participants reporting suicide ideation (19.8%). The wide variability in the prevalence of suicide ideation found in this study confirms that school psychologists and counselors must be prepared to deal with the unique needs and characteristics of the specific populations of youth they serve, as the needs are likely to vary substantially from locality to locality, and country to country.

TI The Legacy of Minimum Legal Drinking Age Law Changes: Long-Term Effects

AB Background: Prior to the establishment of the uniform drinking age of 21 in the United States, many states permitted legal purchase of alcohol at younger ages. Lower drinking ages were associated with several adverse outcomes, including elevated rates of suicide and homicide among youth. The objective of this study is to examine whether individuals who were legally permitted to drink prior to age 21 remained at elevated risk in adulthood.
   Methods: Analysis of data from the U.S. Multiple Cause of Death files, 1990 to 2004, combined with data on the living population from the U.S. Census and American Community Survey. The assembled data contained records on over 200,000 suicides and 130,000 homicides for individuals born between 1949 and 1972, the years during which the drinking age was in flux. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate whether adults who were legally permitted to drink prior to age 21 were at elevated risk for death by these causes. A quasi-experimental analytical approach was employed, which incorporated state and birth-year fixed effects to account for unobserved covariates associated with policy exposure.
   Results: In the population as a whole, we found no association between minimum drinking age and homicide or suicide. However, significant policy-by-sex interactions were observed for both outcomes, such that women exposed to permissive drinking age laws were at higher risk for both suicide (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.18, p = 0.0003) and homicide (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.25, p = 0.0028). Effect sizes were stronger for the portion of the cohort born after 1960, whereas no significant effects were observed for women born prior to 1960.
   Conclusions: Lower drinking ages may result in persistent elevated risk for suicide and homicide among women born after 1960. The national drinking age of 21 may be preventing about 600 suicides and 600 homicides annually.

AB Many Americans own guns to protect themselves against other people, but there is evidence that both victimization and gun access increase suicide risk. We conducted qualitative interviews with informants of 17 suicide cases in New Orleans of the 60 who died between January 2015 and April 2016 to understand the relationship between past trauma, gun access and storage, and suicide. Nine cases had experienced a past trauma, including three who had recently had a family member killed by homicide. Eight died via firearm; of those, seven owned the guns they used to take their lives and stored them locked (but loaded) at home or in their cars. Preventing community violence and addressing its sequelae may be important for reducing suicides. A multi-pronged strategy consisting of policies, education, and marketing will likely be needed to address the risk of suicide conferred by gun access.

AB Suicides in the US military were observed rising in 2004, most notably in the Army and Marine Corps, and particularly, in the Army National Guard (ARNG). Alarmed, Army leaders and researchers have offered various explanations and prescriptions, often lacking any evidence. In the present study, three data sets were used to examine evidence for various perspectives on suicidedispositional risk, social cognitive, stressor-strain, and social cultural/institutional, each having different emphases on relevant explanatory variables and underlying mechanisms of suicide. Primary risk factors associated with having committed suicide among the 2007-2010 ARNG suicide cases were age (young), gender (male), and race (white), supporting the dispositional risk perspective on suicide. Some evidence supported the stressor-strain perspective in that postdeployment loss of a significant other and a major life change showed statistically significant, yet weaker associations with increased suicide intentions. Implications of results are discussed for future research and preventive strategies.

ID DEPRESSION; MEN; DIAGNOSIS; PATHOLOGY
AB Background: A diagnosis of cancer is associated with increased risks of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Genital-system cancer comprises nearly a third of all cancers in males. We used the SEER database to identify the incidence of and risk factors for suicide death in male patients with genital-system cancer in the United States.
   Method: Patients were selected from the SEER database, and X-tile software was used to find the best cutoffs for stratifying age. Logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors for suicide death. Only variables that were statistically significant in the univariate logistic regression models were analyzed in multivariate logistic regression models.
   Result: This study found that age (18-66 vs >= 76 years: OR=3.300, P<0.001; 67-75 vs >= 76 years: OR=1.832, P<0.001), being unmarried (OR=1.332, P=0.010), being divorced, separated, or widowed (OR=1.338, P=0.002), caucasian (OR=2.074, P=0.003) and not receiving surgery or having an unknown surgery status (OR=1.405, P<0.001) significantly increased the risk of suicide death. A particularly important finding was that a time of<1 year after the diagnosis was related to an increased risk of suicide death (<1 vs >= 10 years: OR=1.761, P=0.008).
   Conclusion: We found that a number of factors significantly increased the risk of suicide. Importantly, a time of<1 year after the diagnosis was related to an increased risk of suicide death, which indicates the importance of identifying and treating people at risk of suicide as early as possible. These can help clinicians to understand suicidal patients and provide them with appropriate support. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This article reviews the findings of 84 sociological studies published over a 15-year period. These studies deal with tests of the modernization and/or social integration perspectives on suicide. Research on modernization, religious integration, and political integration often questioned or reformulated the traditional Durkheimian perspective. A major new theoretical development, Pescosolido's religious networks perspective, gained some empirical support in the 15-year period. The strongest support for social integration theory came from research on marital integration, wherein more than three quarters of the research found a significant relationship. Finally, further research on migration, a force lowering social integration, continued to tend to find a positive link to suicide.

AB Suicide rates of male and female physicians are about 3-5 times higher compared with the general public. Detailed studies about medical student suicides in the United States exist but similar current data from German speaking countries are lacking.
   In this study suicide among medical students in Germany, Austria and Switzerland was analyzed using Medline and Google search engines and information from insurance companies, public institutions, statistical agencies and leading scientists in Germany, Austria and Switzerland was requested. The incidence of suicide among medical students at the Medical University of Innsbruck was also examined.
   In publications from German speaking countries some medical student suicides are mentioned but current statistics were not available. Between 2006 and 2011 the Tyrolean State Police in Austria registered 14 suicides by students of all disciplines. At Innsbruck Medical University (approximately 2,800 medical students) it was found that 6 medical students committed suicide between June 2007 and June 2012 (rate 36 per 100,000).
   The suicide risk of medical students at the Medical University of Innsbruck appears to be increased. Because of a lack of comparable data it is not possible to show whether these observations can be extrapolated to other universities. It appears that there was no single special event which triggered suicide by the medical students but a combination of individual risk factors and the environment was involved. However, this problem receives insufficient attention.

AB Objective
   To assess trends in the use of antidepressants among young suicides after the warning that these drugs might increase the risk of suicide.
   Method
   Individual data of all 845 suicides in the 10- to 19-year age group in Sweden in the time period 1992-2003 (baseline), and in 2004-2010 (after the warning). Outcome data are prescriptions of antidepressants prior to death and detections of antidepressants in post-mortem toxicology.
   Results
   After the warning, suicide in this age group increased for five consecutive years (60.5%). The increase occurred among individuals not treated with antidepressants.
   Conclusion
   This study provides further support for the hypothesis that the warning, contrary to its intention, may have increased young suicides by leaving a number of suicidal young persons without treatment with antidepressants.

AB Traditionally, African Americans have registered lower rates of suicide than other ethnic groups. In the last 20 years this pattern has changed, particularly among young African Americans. To date, the research conducted regarding this phenomenon has been limited for a variety of reasons and previous research has been inconclusive in determining risk factors of African American suicide. The purpose of this paper is to identify risk and protective factors specific to African American suicide. To determine the factors, the 1993 National Mortality Follow-back Survey was analyzed. The risk factors identified include being under age 35, southern and northeastern residence, cocaine use, firearm presence in home, and threatening others with violence. Some of the. protective factors associated with African American suicide include rural residence and educational attainment. These results provide valuable information about completed African American suicides in relation to Whites. Several of these factors are unique to African Americans.

AB Exposure to the suicide of another is common, but the magnitude and effects of such exposure are not well quantified. From a national random telephone survey of U.S. adults, we estimated the 12-month incidence of exposure to suicide and its association with suicidal ideation, planning, and behavior. Of 5,2 3 8 respondents, 342 (a weighted 7.0% representing 13.2 million persons) reported knowing a suicide decedent from the previous year. Univariate analysis showed persons reporting such exposure were significantly more likely to describe suicidal ideation and behavior than those unexposed; multivariate analysis showed no association. Though the risk related to suicide exposure may be small, given the magnitude of exposure, it may warrant intervention efforts because of its potential societal impact.

AB Issue: Although the exact number is often disputed, it has been reported that approximately 300 to 400 physicians in the United States take their own lives annually. Despite calls from key interest groups for prevention and treatment protocols of physician suicide, little systematic change has taken place. Evidence: Research on suicide risk factors among physicians has expanded. Increasing reports are surfacing that highlight suicidal ideation and depression in medical school, residency training, and later professional practice. Implications: The purpose of this article is to draw attention to the problem of physician suicide with an emphasis on the role of medical education. Multiple accreditation bodies should be involved to effect a change in physician suicide prevalence. Thirty years have demonstrated that without mandates, large-scale change will not occur. We adapted some of the 2012 National Strategy for Suicide Prevention goals to medical education as a guide.

AB We conducted a case-control study of the association between nearly lethal suicide attempts and facets of alcohol consumption; namely, drinking frequency, drinking quantity, binge drinking, alcoholism, drinking within 3 hours of suicide attempt, and age began drinking. Subjects were 13-34 years of age. In bivariable analyses, all measures were associated with nearly lethal suicide attempts. Odds ratios ranged from 2.4 for alcoholism to 7.0 for drinking within 3 hours of attempt. All exposure variables except age began drinking exhibited a J-shaped relationship between alcohol exposure and nearly lethal suicide attempt. After controlling for potential confounders and other measures of alcohol exposure, drinking within 3 hours of attempt remained most strongly (odds ratios > 6) associated. Alcoholism remained significantly associated in most models, but at lower strength.

AB In the past decade, the U.S. military has observed increased suicides among its personnel, and now, rates for the military services exceed civilian age-adjusted rates. Numerous and varied approaches to suicide prevention are now evident, though with measured success. To address this need, levels typically used in the health field to describe interventions (i.e., primary, secondary, and tertiary) are described and used. The discussion clarifies fundamental differences in the stage at which the negative health condition is intervened, and for the intervention, its purpose, target audience, and strategy aim among approaches to suicide prevention. More important current gaps and possible directions for future approaches to suicide prevention are identified. Lacking are secondary prevention approaches, in particular, those that more effectively identify those at-risk and provide access to appropriate behavioral health care. Research findings to-date suggest these would lead to decreased suicides.

Ten percent of the more than 20 million primary care visits for depression each year involve mental health issues, and account for 62% of the antidepressants prescribed in the United States. 1,2 Psychiatric disorders appear to be underrecognized and undertreated in primary care. Suicidal ideation is present in a significant percentage of depressed primary care patients but rarely discussed.(3) This article describes the warning signs and risk factors associated with suicide and recommends screening tools that can help PCPs identify patients at risk.

AB Suicide is a major public health issue in Canada. The quality of health care services, in addition to other individual and population factors, has been shown to affect suicide rates. In publicly managed care systems, such as systems in Canada and the United Kingdom, the quality of health care is manifested at the individual, program and system levels. Suicide audits are used to assess health care services in relation to the deaths by suicide at individual level and when aggregated at the program and system levels.
   Large health administrative databases comprise another data source used to inform population-based decisions at the system, program and individual levels regarding mental health services that may affect the risk of suicide. This status report paper describes a project we are conducting at the Institut national de sante publique du Quebec (INSPQ) with the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System (QICDSS) in collaboration with colleagues from Wales (United Kingdom) and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.
   This study describes the development of quality of care indicators at three levels and the corresponding statistical analysis strategies designed. We propose 13 quality of care indicators, including system-level and several population-level determinants, primary care treatment, specialist care, the balance between care sectors, emergency room utilization, and mental health and addiction budgets, that may be drawn from a chronic disease surveillance system.

   VIOLENCE; HEALTH; YOUTH
AB Objective: Across the US, firearms are used in approximately 60% of all suicide deaths. Little research has assessed the role and determinants of firearms in suicide in major urban areas.
   Methods: The authors collected data on all suicide deaths between 1990 and 2000 from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York City (NYC) and assessed trends and correlates of firearm related suicide deaths.
   Results: During the period studied, there were a total of 6008 suicides in NYC; 1200 (20.0%) were firearm related suicides. There was a decrease in total suicides, total firearm suicides, and the proportion of firearm related suicides. In multivariable modeling, characteristics of suicide decedents associated with a greater likelihood of firearm suicide were: male, black race, residing in the outer boroughs, and use of cannabis.
   Conclusions: The proportion of suicides caused by firearms in NYC is low compared to other parts of the US; differential access to means of committing suicide and the differential importance of firearms in different racial and ethnic groups may contribute to this observation. Innovative, local population based interventions that target non-firearm related suicide may contribute to lower suicide mortality overall in urban areas.

AB To identify the demographic and clinical factors associated with suicidal death among patients with bladder urothelial carcinoma, patients diagnosed from 1973 to 2013 were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Using a competing risks model, factors associated with suicidal death included older age, unmarried status, white race, male gender, regional disease, living in the Southeast United States, and not undergoing a radical cystectomy.
   Background: Previous studies suggest that patients with bladder cancer (BCa) are at increased risk of suicide compared with the general population. The objective of this study is to improve our understanding of patients at high risk for suicidal death and to better characterize patients at risk of delayed suicide years after diagnosis. Patients and Methods: Patients with bladder urothelial carcinoma were identified between 1973 and 2013 using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (n = 333,679). Competing risks models were performed to generate hazard ratios (HRs) to identify variables associated with suicidal death. Among patients dying of suicide, logistic regression modelling was used to generate odds ratios (ORs) for factors associated with suicide > 36 months after diagnosis. Results: There were 794 patients (0.24%) that died of suicide, 190,734 patients (57.2%) that died from other causes, and 142,151 patients (42.6%) that were alive. Significant factors associated with suicide included diagnosis between 1973 and 1983 (HR, 2.22), unmarried (HR, 1.74), white race (HR, 2.22), male (HR, 6.91), regional disease (HR, 2.49), living in the Southeast United States (HR, 2.43), and not undergoing a radical cystectomy (HR, 1.42). Older age was associated with suicide, whereas younger age was protective. No radical cystectomy (OR, 0.45), older age (OR, 0.32), unmarried status (OR, 0.65), and regional disease (OR, 0.19) were significantly associated with decreased odds of suicidal death > 36 months after diagnosis. Conclusions: Those at highest risk for suicidal death include male gender, the elderly, white, unmarried, and patients with nonlocalized disease. These patients may benefit from targeted survivorship care plans. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Context Lack of data on the lifetime prevalence and age at onset of suicide ideation, plans, and attempts among blacks in the United States limits the creation and evaluation of interventions to reduce suicide among black Americans.
   Objective To examine the prevalence and correlates of suicide ideation, planning, and attempts across 2 ethnic classifications of blacks in a nationally representative sample.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Data are from the National Survey of American Life, a national household probability sample of 5181 black respondents aged 18 years and older, conducted between February 2001 and June 2003, using a slightly modified adaptation of the World Health Organization World Mental Health version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Bivariate and survival analyses were used to delineate patterns and correlates of nonfatal suicidal behavior.
   Main Outcome Measures Self-reports of lifetime suicide ideation, planning, and attempts.
   Results Survey respondents, categorized as African Americans and Caribbean Americans, reported lifetime prevalence of 11.7% for suicide ideation and 4.1% for attempts. Among the respondents who reported ideation, 34.6% transitioned to making a plan and only 21% made an unplanned attempt. Among 4 ethnic-sex groups, the 7.5% lifetime prevalence for attempts among Caribbean black men was the highest among black Americans. The greatest risk of progressing to suicide planning or attempt among ideators occurred within the first year after ideation onset. Blacks at higher risk for suicide attempts were in younger birth cohorts, less educated, Midwest residents, and had 1 or more Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition disorders.
   Conclusions This study documents the burden of nonfatal suicidality among US blacks, notably Caribbean black men, and individuals making planned attempts. Advancing research on the transition from suicide planning to attempt is vital to the efficacy of health care professionals' ability to screen blacks at risk for suicide.

AB Problem Little is known of the needs of parents after their child has made a suicide attempt. The goal of this research was to create and pilot an acceptable and effective survey for parents whose child has made a suicide attempt so that their needs and concerns are known. Method The Social-Ecological Model was used as a framework to better understand the problem of adolescent suicide from the parent perspective. Collaboration with interdisciplinary staff at a rural mental health facility in the United States occurred to create and pilot the survey tool with content and practice experts validating the survey questions. Findings Five parents completed the pilot survey. Results showed that parents have unmet needs after their child's suicide attempt; reporting the need to ensure safety for their child and the need for understanding how to help their child. Parents stated interest in attending a focus group to discuss their needs and noted transportation and childcare being primary barriers to attending a focus group. Conclusion Results from this research will inform the planning focus groups of parents whose child has made suicide attempt.

AB Decision-making at the end-of-life in the United States has evolved over the last 50 yr, beginning with the development of the concept of brain death as a criterion for permitting patients who are in a state of, irreversible coma' to be considered as 'dead' for purposes of ventilator withdrawal and organ transplantation. Since then, a firm consensus has emerged in American law and ethics that 'Patients have a virtually unlimited right to refuse any unwanted medical treatment, even if necessary for life itself.' With regard to patients who are unable to make decisions for themselves, both Europe and the United States are converging toward a view that respects a role for surrogates in decision-making while recognizing the need to limit their authority. Beyond decisions to withdraw and withhold treatments, both the United States and Europe are experimenting with active hastening of the dying process through euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. In the author's opinion, the next big question to be addressed in end-of-life decision-making is 'Just how bad does the neurological condition and prognosis need to be before it is acceptable to allow a decision to withdraw life support'? Although the practices described here have wide acceptance throughout the United States and Europe, the worldwide emergence of religious fundamentalism and the associated vitalistic view about the sanctity of life may result in significant changes over the next few decades.

AB China is the only country in the world where the suicide rate for women is higher than that for men. In particular there is current concern about a high suicide rate for women living in rural areas. In this study, two samples of young women ages 20 to 35, one from rural China (n = 52) and one from rural United States (n = 52) were interviewed as to suicide ideation and suicide risk, as related to psychosocial variables of self-esteem, coping, social support, and attitudes toward suicide. Significant mean differences were obtained between samples on all eleven variables. The pattern of intercorrelations between variables showed both similarities and differences in the two samples. A stepwise multiple-regression analysis indicated that the same four variables, albeit in different order, were predictive of suicide: these variables were self-esteem, instrumental support, the attitude that suicide is morally bad, and an overall rating of coping.

DT Article
DE Firearms; Mortality; California; Epidemiology

AB Purpose: Firearm mortality is a significant problem in the United States. Previous studies have largely focused on firearm mortality at the national or state level, leaving open the question of within-state variation. This study examined firearm mortality within California.
   Methods: We used Multiple Cause of Death data files to identify all firearm fatalities in California from 2000 to 2015. We described firearm mortality rates and counts over time, by age and county, stratifying by intent, gender, and race/ethnicity. County-level rates were smoothed with empirical Bayes estimates from random-effect Poisson models.
   Results: From 2000 to 2015, there were 24,922 firearm homicides and 23,682 firearm suicides in California. Rates of firearm homicide decreased 30% and suicide rates increased 1% since the mid-2000s, but these trends varied substantially by county. Due to a decline in firearm homicides in metropolitan areas, there was no significant difference in these rates between urban and rural counties by 2015. Non Hispanic black men had the highest rate of firearm homicide, but Hispanic men had the greatest number of deaths.
   Conclusions: We found considerable intrastate variation in firearm mortality in California. Our results will be of interest to researchers, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Similar epidemiologic profiles of firearm mortality are warranted for other states. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In light of the ongoing debate over tighter firearm regulations, this paper considers the relationship between gun prevalence and suicide. I exploit a reform in Switzerland that reduced the prevalence of military-issued guns in private households. In Switzerland, military service is compulsory for men, and military-issued guns account for nearly half of the total number of firearms available. The results show that the firearm suicide rate decreases by 9% for a reduction in gun prevalence of 1000 guns per 100,000 inhabitants. The elasticity of gun suicides with respect to firearm prevalence is +0.48, but converges towards zero for low levels of gun prevalence. The overall suicide rate is negatively and significantly related to firearm prevalence, which indicates that non-gun methods of suicide are not perfect replacements for firearms.

AB This study presents the changes in the overall and firearm suicide rates for Quebec (Canada) before and after Bill C-17, which was implemented to secure safe storage of firearms. It covers 20,009 suicide cases reported to the coroner's office. Interrupted time series analysis is used to compare suicide rates in the two periods. Firearm suicide rates have dropped among males and females, but the downward trends were not significant when compared to those prior to the law. Hanging suicide rates have risen considerably among men and women, but those upward trends did not increase significantly when compared with those preceding the law. The decline in suicide rates involving firearms has not resulted in a parallel decline in overall suicide rates. The analyses suggest that Bill C-17 neither improved the downward trend in firearm suicide, which had already begun before the enactment of the law, nor reduced the upward trend of the overall suicide rate. Correlation analyses between firearm suicide, hanging suicide, and the overall suicide rate suggest that firearm suicide is replaced by hanging suicide among males.

TI Gun laws and sudden death - Did the Australian firearms legislation of

AB Mass murders in Dunblane, United Kingdom, and Port Arthur, Australia, provoked rapid responses from the governments of both countries. Major changes to Australian laws resulted in a controversial buy-back of longarms and tighter legislation. The Australian situation enables evaluation of the effect of a national buy-back, accompanied by tightened legislation in a country with relatively secure borders. AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) was used to predict future values of the time series for homicide, suicide and accidental death before and after the 1996 National Firearms Agreement (ATA). Men compared with observed values, firearm suicide was the only parameter the ATA may have influenced, although societal factors could also have influenced observed changes. The findings have profound implications for future firearm legislation policy direction.

DT Article
DE Asian; Chinese; elderly; international; suicide; prevention
ID GENDER; AGE; ILLNESS; OLD
AB Objective: Asian culture venerates elderly people. It was hypothesized that elderly suicides would be proportionately lower in Asian societies than in English-speaking countries (ESC).
   Method: Elderly (i.e. aged 75 years or more) to general population suicide ratios were compared for six Asian societies and six ESC. based upon the latest 5-year suicide rates.
   Results: Males: The general population suicide rate was highest in rural China (227 per million) and third highest in Japan (217 per million), but other countries with high rates were all ESC (ranging from 224 to 198 per million). Asian countries had the six highest elderly suicide rates, 1327-1373 per million, whilst the highest ESC elderly rate was in the United States (507 per million). Asian societies had the widest range of elderly/general ratios, ranging from 6.62 to 2.6. Females: The overall suicide rates were higher in Asian countries (5795 per million) than in ESC (40-56 per million). Asian elderly suicide rates differed (932 per million in rural China to 154 per million in Korea) but the highest ESC rate was in Australia (76 per million). The Asian countries elderly/general ratios ranged from 5.82 : 1 to 2.70 : 1, but the widest ESC ratio was 1.71 : 1, in the United Kingdom.
   Conclusion: There is a need for country-specific prevention measures in elderly people, and particularly for older women in Asian countries.

AB Background: Suicide and suicidal behaviour are multifaceted events requiring complex solutions. Controlling the environment vironment is a neglected solution, despite strong support for this approach from the World Health Organization (WHO).
   Method: To discuss this approach from a global view, this review is written by authors from various cultures. American, Australian. Canadian, Chinese, Cuban, Dutch, Indian, Irish, Japanese, Lithuanian, Native North American, Russian, and South African.
   Results: We examine gun control illustrate the environmental control approach, however, the worldwide diversity of suicide methods calls for diverse responses. Further, controlling the environment encompasses more than restricting the means of suicide, which we illustrate with examples of toned-down media reports and restricted medicine availability.
   Conclusions: Controlling the environment may be viable strategy for preventing suicide, although research shows that few clinicians implement such approaches.

AB Background: There is an ongoing debate on the effectiveness of suicidal behavior prevention measures in the military. The association of three widely used tools with severe suicide attempts was assessed in this setting.
   Methods: Thirty-nine Israeli soldiers (59% males), mean age 19 yrs., who attempted suicide during military service were divided into two groups: severe (n = 14; 35.9%) and moderate suicide attempts, and were assessed using the Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI), Suicide Intent Scale (SIS) and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).
   Results: Seven items from the SSI (p = 0.008), two items from SIS and one item from C-SSRS were associated with severe suicide attempts. Kendall's tau-b correlation with bootstrap demonstrated stability of these correlations.
   Conclusion: Greater severity of suicidal ideation was associated with more severe suicide attempts. The combination of male gender, available firearms and current severe suicide ideation is high-risk danger sign in a military setting, even when reported intent to die is low.

AB Globally, older adults have higher suicide rates than other age-groups. However, it is predominantly men who die of suicide in late adulthood, with variability by culture. In the United States, European-descent men are overrepresented among suicide decedents. In this article, theories and evidence about aging adversities, individual dispositions, and cultural influences were evaluated for their potential to explain the suicide vulnerability of European-descent older men. Aging adversities were not found to account for these men's suicide proneness. European-descent older men are exposed to less severe aging adversities than older women or ethnic-minority menthough they may be more impacted by them. Rigidity in coping and in sense of self, consistent with hegemonic-masculinity scripts, emerged as individual-level clues. The indignities-of-aging and the masculinity-of-suicide scripts may be cultural influences. This analysis shows how consideration of masculinities and suicide scripts expands our understanding of older men's suicide as well as, likely, our tools for its prevention.

AB The link between substance use and suicide is well established. However, little research analyzes how substance use is related to the method of suicide. This article analyzes how specific drugs are associated with method of suicide, a critical topic because drug use bears on the etiology of suicide and may lead to policies aimed at deterring suicide. We use the Colorado Violent Death Reporting System and logistic regression to examine postmortem presence of drugs among 3,389 hanging and firearm suicides in Colorado from 2004 to 2009. Net of demographic controls, we find that opiates are positively associated with firearms (odds ratio [OR] = 1.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.27, 2.86]) while antidepressants are positively associated with hanging (OR = 1.45, 95% CI = [1.04, 2.03]). For cocaine and opiates, the association between drug use and violent method vary by educational attainment. Importantly, knowledge of the presence and type of specific drug is strongly associated with the method of suicide.

DT Article
ID GREAT RECESSION; RATES; INCREASE; IMPACT
AB Problem/Condition: Suicide is a public health problem and one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States. Substantial geographic variations in suicide rates exist, with suicides in rural areas occurring at much higher rates than those occurring in more urban areas. Understanding demographic trends and mechanisms of death among and within urbanization levels is important to developing and targeting future prevention efforts.
   Reporting Period: 2001-2015.
   Description of System: Mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) include demographic, geographic, and cause of death information derived from death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. NVSS was used to identify suicide deaths, defined by International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) underlying cause of death codes X60-X84, Y87.0, and U03. This report examines annual county level trends in suicide rates during 2001-2015 among and within urbanization levels by select demographics and mechanisms of death. Counties were collapsed into three urbanization levels using the 2006 National Center for Health Statistics classification scheme.
   Results: Suicide rates increased across the three urbanization levels, with higher rates in nonmetropolitan/rural counties than in medium/small or large metropolitan counties. Each urbanization level experienced substantial annual rate changes at different times during the study period. Across urbanization levels, suicide rates were consistently highest for men and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives compared with rates for women and other racial/ethnic groups; however, rates were highest for non-Hispanic whites in more metropolitan counties. Trends indicate that suicide rates for non-Hispanic blacks were lowest in nonmetropolitan/rural counties and highest in more urban counties. Increases in suicide rates occurred for all age groups across urbanization levels, with the highest rates for persons aged 35-64 years. For mechanism of death, greater increases in rates of suicide by firearms and hanging/suffocation occurred across all urbanization levels; rates of suicide by firearms in nonmetropolitan/rural counties were almost two times that of rates in larger metropolitan counties.
   Interpretation: Suicide rates in nonmetropolitan/rural counties are consistently higher than suicide rates in metropolitan counties. These trends also are observed by sex, race/ethnicity, age group, and mechanism of death.
   Public Health Action: Interventions to prevent suicides should be ongoing, particularly in rural areas. Comprehensive suicide prevention efforts might include leveraging protective factors and providing innovative prevention strategies that increase access to health care and mental health care in rural communities. In addition, distribution of socioeconomic factors varies in different communities and needs to be better understood in the context of suicide prevention.

AB Given the increasing rate of death by suicide in the United States, it is imperative to examine specific risk factors and to identify possible etiologies of suicidal behavior in at-risk clinical subpopulations. There is accumulating evidence to support an elevated risk of death by suicide in individuals with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this review article, after defining terms used in suicidology, we discuss the associations of TBI with death by suicide, suicide attempt, and suicidal ideation. A model for repetitive TBIs, leading to chronic traumatic encephalopathy, is also discussed as a neuroinflammatory process, with discussion about its possible link with suicide. The review concludes with an overview of interventions to prevent suicidal behavior.

AB An association between divorce and suicide risk has been noted in numerous studies, but the gender profile of this risk has not been clearly established. This article reviews the evidence on gender differentials in suicide risk following the breakdown of an intimate relationship (including divorce and separation). Nineteen published articles that included individual-level data were identified. Twelve reported a greater risk of suicide in men following relationship breakdown, two indicated a greater risk in women, and a further five showed no clear gender differential. Although there are possible indications of increased risk for men, no definitive conclusion about gender differential can be drawn. Furthermore, research is required that directly compares men with women for suicide risk following relationship breakdown.

AB This exploratory study evaluated the association between suicide and occupational exposure to electromagnetic fields, pesticides, and hydrocarbon solvents. The study population comprised 11,707 suicide deaths and 132,771 eligible controls identified from United States death certificate files for the years 1991 and 1992. Exposure assignment was based on job title reported on the death certificates. Exposure to electromagnetic fields and pesticides was weakly associated with suicide risk, while little evidence for an increased risk was seen for hydrocarbon solvents. The association for electromagnetic field exposure was highest for suicide between the ages 20 and 35 (odds ratio; OR = 1.5), while the highest risk of suicide for pesticide exposure was seen between the ages of 35 and 4 9 years (OR = 1.5). Further investigation to replicate these findings seems warranted, using higher quality occupational data.

DT Article
ID BEREAVEMENT; PERSPECTIVE; MORTALITY
AB Objectives. This study examined whether marital status is associated with suicide rates among various age, sex, and racial groups, in particular with widowhood among young adults of both sexes.
   Methods. US national suicide mortality data were compiled for the years 19911996, and suicide rates were broken down by race, 5-year age groups, sex, and marital status.
   Results. Data on suicide rates indicated an approximately 17-fold increase among young widowed White men (aged 20-34 years), a 9-fold increase among young widowed African American men, and lesser increases among young widowed White women compared with their married counterparts.
   Conclusions. National data suggest that as many as 1 in 400 White and African American widowed men aged 20-35 years will die by suicide in any given year (compared with 1 in 9000 married men in the general population).

AB The purpose of the present study is to determine if connection with female (FC) and male caregivers (MC) could buffer the negative effects of intergenerational acculturative conflict (IAC) on suicide risk among Mexican descent adolescents and emerging adults. The sample included 722 Mexican descent adolescents and emerging adults (age range: 14-25 years, M = 19.69; SD = 1.75) from a U.S. high school and public university located near the United States-Mexico border. The majority of the sample were women (65.9%) and born in the United States (92.8%). Data were collected via self-report measures. The significant findings of linear regression analyses were: 1) Higher MC-IAC was related to higher levels of past year suicide risk, while higher levels of FC and MC connection were related to lower levels; and 2) Both MC and FC connection protected youth against the negative impact of IAC on suicide risk. Results are discussed in terms of the importance of both the MC and FC relationship quality in the context of IAC on suicide risk among Latinx youth. Suggestions will be made to include both MC and FC caregivers in research, prevention, and intervention efforts.

AB Recent research indicates that suicide rates are elevated in those living at higher altitudes in both the United States and South Korea. A possible mechanism that was proposed is metabolic stress associated with hypoxia. This commentary discusses these results, and also the association between elevated suicide rates and other conditions associated with hypoxia (smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma). Tryptophan hydroxylase may not normally be saturated with oxygen, so mild hypoxia would decrease serotonin synthesis. Low brain serotonin is known to be associated with suicide. Thus, the commentary proposes and discusses the hypothesis that decreased brain serotonin synthesis associated with hypoxia is a mechanism that may contribute to suicide in conditions causing hypoxia. Finally the commentary proposes various studies that could test aspects of this hypothesis.

AB We have little understanding of the increased active duty military suicide rates found in the United States, and little understanding of what is historically normative for combatants. Therefore, we examined historical records on suicides among the British Army during the Crimean War for the years 1854-1856. There were 18 documented suicides in the British Army during this period. Calculating an accurate annual suicide rate per 100,000 is impossible because it is unclear how many of the 111,313 military personnel were in country for each of the 2 years of the war. However, the range is conservatively estimated between 8 and 16 per 100,000, with the likely answer somewhere near the middle. This suggests the possibility that increasing suicide rates among active duty military may be a modern U.S. phenomenon.

AB Important resources from family support systems, employment, and educational attainment inhibit the risk of death. Independently, these factors are particularly salient for suicide, but how they combine to affect mortality is less clear. Analyses of National Health Interview Survey data from 1986 to 2004 (N = 935,802), prospectively linked to mortality through 2006 (including 1,238 suicides), reveals a process of compensation in the way work status and family combine to affect adult suicide: Individuals who are not working experience more suicide defense from more protective family support systems than do working adults. But a process of reinforcement occurs in the combination of education and family: More education associates with more protection from the family than does less education. The findings demonstrate how families and resources combine to affect mortality in unique ways.

AB Background The incidence of adolescent suicide is rising in the United States, yet we have limited information regarding short-term prediction of suicide attempts. Our aim was to identify predictors of suicide attempts within 3-months of an emergency department (ED) visit. Methods Adolescents, ages 12-17, seeking health care at 13 pediatric EDs (Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network) and one Indian Health Service Hospital in the United States were consecutively recruited. Among 10,664 approached patients, 6,448 (60%) were enrolled and completed a suicide risk survey. A subset of participants (n = 2,897) was assigned to a 3-month telephone follow-up, and 2,104 participants completed this follow-up (73% retention). Our primary outcome was a suicide attempt between the ED visit and 3-month follow-up. Results One hundred four adolescents (4.9%) made a suicide attempt between enrollment and 3-month follow-up. A large number of baseline predictors of suicide attempt were identified in bivariate analyses. The final multivariable model for the full sample included the presence of suicidal ideation during the past week, lifetime severity of suicidal ideation, lifetime history of suicidal behavior, and school connectedness. For the subgroup of adolescents who did not report recent suicidal ideation at baseline, the final model included only lifetime severity of suicidal ideation and social connectedness. Among males, the final model included only lifetime severity of suicidal ideation and past week suicidal ideation. For females, the final model included past week suicidal ideation, lifetime severity of suicidal ideation, number of past-year nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) incidents, and social connectedness. Conclusions Results indicate that the key risk factors for adolescent suicide attempts differ for subgroups of adolescents defined by sex and whether or not they report recent suicidal thoughts. Results also point to the importance of school and social connectedness as protective factors against suicide attempts.

AB This paper documents a marked increase in the all-cause mortality of middle-aged white non-Hispanic men and women in the United States between 1999 and 2013. This change reversed decades of progress in mortality and was unique to the United States; no other rich country saw a similar turnaround. The midlife mortality reversal was confined to white non-Hispanics; black non-Hispanics and Hispanics at midlife, and those aged 65 and above in every racial and ethnic group, continued to see mortality rates fall. This increase for whites was largely accounted for by increasing death rates from drug and alcohol poisonings, suicide, and chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis. Although all education groups saw increases in mortality from suicide and poisonings, and an overall increase in external cause mortality, those with less education saw the most marked increases. Rising midlife mortality rates of white non-Hispanics were paralleled by increases in midlife morbidity. Self-reported declines in health, mental health, and ability to conduct activities of daily living, and increases in chronic pain and inability to work, as well as clinically measured deteriorations in liver function, all point to growing distress in this population. We comment on potential economic causes and consequences of this deterioration.

AB Although many studies have examined associations between family structure and child outcomes, few have considered how the increase in single-parent households since the 1960s may have affected child mortality rates. We examined state-level changes in the percentage of children living with single parents between 1968 and 2010 and state-level trends in mortality among children and youth (age 19 or younger) in the United States. Regression models with state and year fixed effects revealed that increases in single parenthood were associated with small increments in accidental deaths and homicides. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Background: Relatively little is known regarding the relationship between attitudes toward suicide, suicide attempt (SA) history, and future suicidal behaviors. Aims: Utilizing a sample of firefighters, this study compared attitudes toward suicide between individuals with/without a career SA history and evaluated whether certain attitudes toward suicide are associated with a greater self-reported likelihood of making a future SA. Method: US firefighters (N = 818) completed self-report measures. One-way ANOVAs and linear regression analyses were utilized to address study aims. Results: Firefighters with a career SA reported significantly greater normalization/glorification of suicide - yet lower attributions of suicide to isolation/depression - than those without this history. More stigmatizing attitudes toward suicide and greater normalization/glorification of suicide were each significantly associated with greater self-reported future SA likelihood. Limitations: Data were cross-sectional and findings may not be generalizable. Conclusion: Firefighters who have made an SA during their firefighting careers may normalize and glorify suicide more than those who have not. These attitudes may be associated with greater self-perceived risk for future SAs. Research is needed to replicate findings and evaluate strategies for targeting potentially harmful beliefs about suicide among SA survivors.

DT Article
ID BEHAVIOR; RATES
AB IMPORTANCE Suicide is a leading cause of death among youth aged 10 to 19 years in the United States, with rates traditionally higher in male than in female youth. Recent national mortality data suggest this gap may be narrowing, which warrants investigation.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate trends in suicide rates among US youth aged 10 to 19 years by age group, sex, race/ethnicity, and method of suicide.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional study using period trend analysis of US suicide decedents aged 10 to 19 years from January 1, 1975, to December 31, 2016. Data were analyzed for periods defined by statistically significant changes in suicide rate trends. Suicide rates were calculated using population estimates.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Period trends in suicide rates by sex and age group were assessed using joinpoint regression. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated using negative binomial regression comparing male and female suicide rates within periods.
   RESULTS From 1975 to 2016, we identified 85 051 youth suicide deaths in the United States (68 085 male [80.1%] and 16 966 female [19.9%]) with a male to female IRR of 3.82 (95% CI, 3.35-4.35). Following a downward trend until 2007, suicide rates for female youth showed the largest significant percentage increase compared with male youth (12.7% vs 7.1% for individuals aged 10-14 years; 7.9% vs 3.5% for individuals aged 15-19 years). The male to female IRR decreased significantly across the study period for youth aged 10 to 14 years (3.14 [95% CI, 2.74-3.61] to 1.80 [95% CI, 1.53-2.12]) and 15 to 19 years (4.15 [95% CI, 3.79-4.54] to 3.31 [95% CI, 2.96-3.69]). Significant declining trends in the male to female IRR were found in non-Hispanic white youth aged 10 to 14 years (3.27 [95% CI, 2.684.00] to 2.04 [95% CI, 1.45-2.89]) and non-Hispanic youth of other races aged 15 to 19 years (4.02 [95% CI, 3.29-4.92] to 2.35 [95% CI, 2.00-2.76]). The male to female IRR for firearms increased significantly for youth aged 15 to 19 years(chi(2) = 7.74; P = .02 for sex x period interaction). The male to female IRR of suicide by hanging or suffocation decreased significantly for both age groups (10-14 years: chi(2) = 88.83; P < .001 for sex x period interaction and 15-19 years: chi(2) = 82.15; P < .001 for sex x period interaction). No significant changewas found in the male to female IRR of suicide by poisoning across the study period.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A significant reduction in the historically large gap in youth suicide rates between male and female individuals underscores the importance of interventions that consider unique differences by sex. Future research examining sex-specific factors associated with youth suicide is warranted.

AB In the United States, rural locations have higher rates of suicide than urban locations. One factor associated with an increased risk of suicide is posttraumatic stress. After a traumatic event, however, individuals from rural places are at a decreased risk of suicide compared with urban individuals. This article examines one possible reason for decreased suicide risk among rural individuals who have experienced trauma: locus of control. Internal locus of control is associated with decreased suicidal behaviours. While there is limited knowledge on the prevalence of internal loci of control among rural residents, self-reliance and independence, constructs congruent with internal locus of control, are prevailing characteristics of rural individuals. In a sample of 187 adults with trauma histories, rural, rural-fringe, and urban individuals do not significantly differ in suicide risk, locus of control, or posttraumatic stress symptoms. Locus of control predicts suicide risk, such that a more external locus of control is associated with increased risk, but it does not mediate the relation between posttraumatic stress and risk of suicide.

DE suicide; prevention; psychiatric illness
AB About 35,000 people commit suicide every year in the United States. Almost all are seriously, but treatably, mentally ill. Most come to the attention of a physician, in an emergency room, primary practice setting, or psychiatric hospital or office, during the days, weeks or months before they die. Since 1995, suicide has been the second most commonly reported of all Joint Commission hospital sentinel events (not just psychiatric events). Suicide is involved in the majority of psychiatric malpractice lawsuits. It takes life from patients, parents from children, children from families, and valuable people from society. Suicide is a terrible way to lose a relative or friend, leaving much greater damage than most natural or accidental death. This paper discusses four points to be considered by those who want to improve this situation: 1) Suicide is rarely "voluntary" in any clinical sense of the term; 2) A great many suicides are preventable once a clinician becomes involved; 3) Suicide is worth preventing; 4) There are practical approaches to prevention that work.

AB Suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts have been found to be predictors of suicide. This study aims to estimate the suicidal behaviors in rural China. We studied 784 respondents as informants of suicide and 1,247 respondents as informants of community living controls, with the NCS-R measures on suicidal behaviors. The lifetime prevalence of ideation, plans, and attempts among the informants of suicide was 18.1, 4.1, and 1.7%, and the 12-month prevalence was 12.1, 2.2, and 0.4%, respectively. The prevalence scores were higher for the family members than for friends of suicide. The risk factors for suicidal behaviors include being parents or spouse of the suicide, female gender, low education level, and being never married. As suicidal behaviors are more observed among those who have a suicide death in the family or among close friends, suicide screening and intervention efforts should be focused on this type of population.

   TUTORIAL
AB Objectives: Our goal was to identify if there might be associations between a major public health problem, i.e., violent deaths, and a potential macro-level determinant, i.e., political party in office.
   Methods: Vital statistics, labor statistics, and GDP data were obtained for the years 1900-2010. Independent t tests were used to compare homicide, suicide, and total violent death rates during Republican and Democratic administrations and between states voting for Republican and Democratic presidential candidates. Correlation and hidden Markov modeling were used to assess the relationships among party of the president and changes in unemployment rate, GDP, and violent death.
   Results: The party of the president was significantly associated with annual changes in suicide and homicide rates, unemployment rates, and GDP (p < 0.001 to p < 0.05, depending on the measure and time lag), with higher violent death and unemployment increases being associated with Republican presidencies and higher GDP with Democratic ones. Adjusting for unemployment and GDP reduced but did not eliminate party effect Suicide and homicide rates were higher in states that voted for the Republican candidate for presidency than in states that voted for the Democratic candidate (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.07).
   Conclusions: Violent deaths were associated with an increase under Republican presidents and a decrease under Democratic presidents, were higher in states that vote for the Republican than for the Democratic presidential candidates, and increased alongside increasing unemployment and falling national GDP. As with heart disease, obesity and cancer, identified associations with environmental factors can increase understanding of the public health problem and point to ways of reducing it. Future research beyond the boundaries of the United States could help elucidate the relationship between government, socioeconomic policy orientation, and violent death rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Are news reports of suicide contagious? A stringent test in six US

SO JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
LA English
DT Article
ID TEENAGE SUICIDES; STORIES; OVERDOSE; AGE
AB Past evidence of suicidal contagion from news reports in the United States is based largely on national data prior to 1980 using proxies for suicide stories rather than local news sources. Our research examined more proximal effects of suicide news reporting for 4 months in 1993 in 6 U.S. cities controlling for a wide range of alternative sources of media and interpersonal influence. In addition, predictions for the effect based on suicide contagion theories were examined for 3 age groups (15-25, 25-44, and older than 44). Local television news was associated with increased incidence of deaths by suicide among persons younger than 25 years. Newspaper reports were associated with suicide deaths for both young persons and persons older than 44 years. An unexpected protective effect of television news reports was observed in the 25-44 age range, nevertheless, news reporting was associated with an aggregate increase in suicide deaths. The results support theories of media contagion but also suggest that media depiction can inhibit suicide among some audience members.

AB Suicide is second to only accidental death as the leading cause of mortality in young men across the world. Although suicide rates for young men have fallen in some high-income and middle-income countries since the 1990s, wider mortality measures indicate that rates remain high in specific regions, ethnic groups, and socioeconomic groups within those nations where rates have fallen, and that young men account for a substantial proportion of the economic cost of suicide. High-lethality methods of suicide are preferred by young men: hanging and firearms in high-income countries, pesticide poisoning in the Indian subcontinent, and charcoal-burning in east Asia. Risk factors for young men include psychiatric illness, substance misuse, lower socioeconomic status, rural residence, and single marital status. Population-level factors include unemployment, social deprivation, and media reporting of suicide. Few interventions to reduce suicides in young men have been assessed. Efforts to change help-seeking behaviour and to restrict access to frequently used methods hold the most promise.

AB Background: Although extensive studies on adolescent suicidal behavior have been conducted in developed countries such as the United States, little data exist on risk factors for suicide among adolescents in culturally and socially disadvantages settings, such as Jamaica. Aims: To conduct a preliminary investigation of risk factors associated with suicide ideation and attempt among youths in Western Jamaica. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 342 adolescents aged 10-19 years from 19 schools. Results: Multivariate analysis showed that a history of self-violence, violent thoughts toward others, mental health diagnoses other than depression, and a history of sexual abuse were positively associated with suicide attempt. Sexual abuse, mental health diagnoses other than depression, self-violence, and ease of access to lethal substances/weapons were positively associated with suicide ideation. Conclusions: We found a relatively high prevalence of suicide ideation and suicide attempts among adolescents living in Western Jamaica. An accurate understanding of the prevailing risk factors for suicide attempts will promote a more sympathetic approach to victims and facilitate prevention efforts.

AB Deaths by suicide and nonfatal suicide attempts are pervasive problems in the United States, especially among those of child-bearing age. Prior research has indicated that parenthood is a protective factor against suicide. However, no study has examined the reasons for why some parents attempt suicide. Questionnaires (n = 87) and follow-up interviews (n = 75) were completed with parents who recently attempted suicide and were recruited in the Emergency Department. Respondents reported family or relationship problems, depression, and child-related issues as the most common reasons for their attempt. Those who identified parenting as an impetus endorsed significantly more symptoms of depression and higher levels of stress related to dysfunctional parent-child interactions. Over a third of parents reported their child had been informed of their suicide attempt, and nearly a fourth of parents reported their child had been present at the time of the suicide attempt. These findings indicate that parenthood can be a risk factor for suicide among parents with high parenting stress or those experiencing custody issues.

AB Understanding the beliefs that protect individuals against suicide can help to enhance suicide prevention strategies. One measure of suicide non-acceptability is the moral objections to suicide (MOS) subscale of the reasons for living inventory (RFLI). This study examined the MOS and suicidal ideation of White, Black, and Hispanic individuals with mood disorders. We expected minority individuals to have stronger objections to suicide.
   Method: Eight hundred and four, White (588), Black (122) and Hispanic (94) participants with DSM-IV diagnoses of MDD or bipolar disorder were administered the scale for suicide ideation, the reasons for living inventory and several measures of clinical distress.
   Results: Higher suicidal ideation was modestly correlated with lower MOS scores overall (r = 0.15, p = 0.001). Among Blacks however the relationship was inverted: despite having higher suicidal ideation than Whites or Hispanics, Blacks reported the least accepting attitudes toward suicide.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that attitudes regarding the acceptability of suicide may be independent of suicidal ideation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB American Indians (AIs) experience increased suicide rates compared with other groups in the United States. However, no past studies have examined AI suicide by way of a recent empirically supported theoretical model of suicide. The current study investigated whether AI suicidal ideation can be predicted by two components: thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, from the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide (T. E. Joiner, 2005, Why people die by suicide. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press). One hundred seventy-one AIs representing 27 different tribes participated in an online survey. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that perceived burdensomeness significantly predicted suicidal ideation above and beyond demographic variables and depressive symptoms; however, thwarted belongingness did not. Additionally, the two-way interaction between thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness significantly predicted suicidal ideation. These results provide initial support for continued research on the components of the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide, an empirically supported theoretical model of suicide, to predict suicidal ideation among AI populations.

AB Media reports connecting UN peacekeeping dudes by Canadian soldiers to their subsequent suicide prompted this study of peacekeeping as suicide risk. In a case-control design we retrospectively compared 66 suicides in the Canadian military between 1990 and 1995 with two control groups: (a) 2,601 controls randomly selected from the electronic military database and (b) 66 matched controls with complete personnel and medical data. S;Ve found no increased risk of suicide in peacekeepers except among a subgroup of air force personnel. Here confounding individual factors, isolation from supports, and possibly inadequate preparation for deployment elucidated their suicides. Theater of deployment (e.g., Bosnia) did not affect the suicide rate. Military suicides experienced psychosocial stresses and psychiatric illness more often than their matched controls. We conclude that although peacekeeping per se does not increase overall suicide risk, military lifestyles may strain interpersonal relationships, encourage alcohol abuse, and contribute to psychiatric illness and suicide in a minority of vulnerable individuals irrespective of peacekeeping assignment. Careful selection, and preparatory military training that encourages intragroup bonding and mutual support, mall protect against suicide risk.

AB In this study we examined self-reported suicide attempts and their relationship to other health risk factors in a community sample of 16,644 adolescents. Fifteen percent endorsed suicide attempts (10% single; 5% multiple attempts). We hypothesized that multiple attempters would show higher prevalence of comorbid health risks than single or non-attempters. The three groups showed significant differences in ten health risk domains, on factors such as depressed mood, sexual assault, weight problems, and drug and alcohol use (ORs: 3.26-13.57). Repeated suicide attempts appear to be related to increased vulnerability and likelihood of harm in multiple domains of health risk.

AB The institution of active euthanasia has been legal in Colombia since 2015. In California, the regulation on physician-assisted suicide will come into effect on January 1, 2016. The legal institution of active euthanasia is not accepted under the law of the United States of America, however, physician-assisted suicide is accepted in an increasing number of member states. The related regulation in Oregon is imitated in other member states. In South America, -Colombia is not the first country to legalize active euthanasia: active euthanasia has been legal in Uruguay since 1932. The North American legal tradition markedly differs from the South American one and both are incompatible with the Central European rule of law. In Hungary and in most European Union countries, solely the passive form of euthanasia is legal. In the Benelux countries, the active form of euthanasia is legal because the supranational law of the European Union does not prohibit it. Notwithstanding, European Union law does not prescribe legalization of either the active form of euthanasia, or the physician-assisted suicide.

AB Recent increases in death by suicide in the United States have led to national calls for improvements in how suicide risk screening and assessments are conducted. As health care providers and leaders in mental health practice, psychologists should be immersed in cutting edge education and training in suicide assessment. In this article, we describe the limits of the traditional medical model approach and review modern developments in suicide risk assessment. Six important shifts in how contemporary psychologists formulate and approach suicide assessment are reviewed. These include: (a) acknowledgment that suicide risk factors are not especially helpful to psychologist-practitioners; (b) a movement away from medical model formulations and toward social constructionist and collaborative orientations; (c) progress in theoretical knowledge pertaining to suicidal individuals; (d) recognition that the clinical encounter and comprehensive suicide assessment interviews are essential to developing and maintaining a therapeutic relationship; (e) advancements in how clinicians question patients about suicide ideation; and (f) methods for monitoring suicide ideation over time. Psychologists who understand and apply these approaches to suicide risk assessment will be more capable of conducting competent suicide assessment and treatment and thereby contribute to national suicide prevention efforts.

AB Domestic violence homicides and suicides are significant causes of deaths among women in India. This study examined characteristics and motives of various types of domestic violence-related homicides and suicides (n = 100) in India using newspaper reports (2011-2012). The majority of victims were found to be young women, mostly killed by burning or strangulation methods. The most frequently reported motive was dowry demands followed by a history of domestic violence or harassment and family conflict. The findings highlight the need for stronger prevention/intervention programs in India to identify and intervene with women at high risk for being killed or committing suicide.

AB This study explored differences in intimate partner homicides (IPHs) among Asian Americans. Data from newspapers and femicide reports by different state coalitions on 125 intimate partner killings occurring between 2000 and 2005 were analyzed. Men were the perpetrators in nearly 9 out of 10 cases of Asian IPHs. Gender differences were found in ages of victims and perpetrators, types of relationship between partners, and methods of killing. Most homicides occurred among South-east Asians, and East Asians had the highest within-group proportion of suicides. The findings call for culturally competent risk assessment and intervention strategies to prevent IPHs among at-risk Asian Americans.

AB An increasing number of studies demonstrate that individuals with a history of suicidality exhibit impaired executive functioning abilities. The current study examines whether these differences are linked to suicidal thoughts or suicidal actsa crucial distinction given that most people who think about suicide will not act on their thoughts. A large online sample of U.S. participants with a history of suicide ideation (n=197), suicide attempts (n=166), and no suicidality (n=180) completed self-report measures assessing executive functioning, suicide ideation and attempts; in addition, depression, self-efficacy, and history of drug abuse and brain injury were assessed as potential covariates. Individuals with recent suicide attempts reported significantly worse executive functioning than ideators. This difference was not accounted for by depression, self-efficacy, history of drug abuse or brain injury. Self-reported executive functioning may represent an important short-term risk factor for suicide attempts.

AB The association between suicide and combat injuries sustained during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan was examined. A retrospective population-based cohort design was conducted using official military records to identify combat injuries (October 7, 2001, to December 31, 2007). Those who were injured during combat had higher crude suicide rates than those who deployed and were not injured (incidence rate ratio [IRR]=1.50; confidence interval [CI]=1.06, 2.12), or never deployed (IRR=1.46; CI=1.04, 2.06). After adjusting for demographics, these findings were no longer statistically significant. Although our data did not support an elevated suicide risk among wounded service members, additional research is needed to examine the impact of injury severity.

AB Objective: To determine if Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a risk factor for suicide attempts.
   Methods: Data were drawn from the National Comorbidity Replication Survey (NCS-R), a nationally representative sample of adults (N =8098).
   Results: Of the 365 adults with current ADHD, 16% attempted suicide. After controlling for the presence of comorbid disorders, logistic regression analyses revealed that the ADHD was not a not a strong predictor of suicide attempts; having one or more comorbid disorders was associated with fourfold to twelvefold elevated risk. Limitations: The small sample size of respondents with ADHD who attempted suicide significantly reduced the probability of determining which specific comorbid disorders were correlated with parasuicide.
   Conclusions: Early treatment of ADHD and comorbidity may reduce the risk of suicide attempts and improve its prognosis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Moderated mediation analysis was used with 186 adolescents who responded to the Profiles of Student Life: Attitudes and Behavior survey. Physical abuse increased risk directly and indirectly through reduced self-esteem. Involvement in youth programs moderated the direct effect. Community service moderated the indirect effect. Results indicate 2 hours per week of involvement in youth programs and 2 hours per week of community service mitigated suicide attempt risk associated with abuse. Providing avenues for youth experiencing abuse to increase their community service and involvement is recommended.

AB Drug abuse has been widely linked to suicide risk. We examined the factors that affect adolescent drug users' suicide attempts in South Korea. This study analyzed the data of 311 adolescents who had used drugs such as inhalants, psychotropic drugs, and marijuana (195 males and 116 females). Among 311 subjects, 109 (35.0%) had attempted suicide during the last 12 months. After adjusting for other variables, depressive mood (OR=19.79) and poly-drug use (OR=2.79), and low/middle levels of academic achievement compared with a high level (OR=3.72 and 4.38) were independently associated with increased odds of a suicide attempt, while better perceived health (OR=0.32) was independently associated with reduced odds of a suicide attempt. For adolescent drug users, preventive work should be directed toward the active treatment of drug use, depression, and physical health and reinforcing proper coping strategies for academic and other stress.

AB Drawing on constructs of masculinity as it relates to both gun ownership and men's health, we use a rich data set, the New Jersey Violent Death Reporting System as well as hospital discharge data, to analyze 3,413 completed male suicides between the years of 2003 and 2009. We test the hypotheses that the use of firearms is more common when physical health problems are cited as suicide circumstances, and that suicide decedents who use firearms have poorer physical health than those who used other methods. Results show that firearms are disproportionately used in male suicides when physical health is listed as a circumstance. Additionally, among suicide decedents with a hospitalization during the 3 years prior to death, those who used firearms were in poorer health than those who used other methods. These findings have implications for prevention efforts, because restricting access to lethal means is an important aspect of suicide prevention.

AB Links between emotion dysregulation, suicide ideation, and suicidal versus non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) are poorly understood within military samples. United States service members and beneficiaries (N = 186), psychiatrically hospitalized following a suicidal crisis, completed the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz & Roemer, 2004), and reported lifetime suicide ideation, attempts, and NSSI. We expected that emotion dysregulation would positively associate with worst lifetime suicide ideation, multiple suicide attempt status, and lifetime NSSI. Suicide ideation severity and multiple suicide attempts did not associate with DERS components. Notably, difficulties with impulse control (feeling out of control while distressed) was positively associated with NSSI history. Theoretical models that clearly describe the role of emotion dysregulation in suicidal thoughts, its progression to suicidal actions, and NSSI are needed to advance clinical care for this highly vulnerable group. Longitudinal and micro-longitudinal study designs require further investigation.

   ASSOCIATION
AB Context: The Food and Drug Administration has issued a boxed warning concerning increased suicidal ideation and behavior associated with antidepressant drug treatment in children and adolescents. It is unknown whether antidepressant agents increase the risk of suicide death in children or adults.
   Objective: To estimate the relative risk of suicide attempt and suicide death in severely depressed children and adults treated with antidepressant drugs vs those not treated with antidepressant drugs.
   Design: Matched case-control study.
   Setting: Outpatient treatment settings in the United States.
   Participants: Medicaid beneficiaries from all 50 states who received inpatient treatment for depression, excluding patients treated for pregnancy, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or other psychoses, mental retardation, dementia, or delirium. Controls were matched to cases for age, sex, race or ethnicity, state of residence, substance use disorder, recent suicide attempt, number of days since hospital discharge, and recent treatment with antipsychotic, anxiolytic/hypnotic, mood stabilizer, and stimulant medications.
   Main Outcome Measures: Suicide attempts and suicide deaths.
   Results: In adults (aged 19-64 years), antidepressant drug treatment was not significantly associated with suicide attempts (odds ratio [OR], 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86-1.39 [521 cases and 2394 controls]) or suicide deaths (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.52-1.55 [86 cases and 396 controls]). However, in children and adolescents (aged 6-18 years), antidepressant drug treatment was significantly associated with suicide attempts (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.12-2.07 [263 cases and 1241 controls]) and suicide deaths (OR, 15.62; 95% CI, 1.65-infinity [8 cases and 39 controls]).
   Conclusions: In these high-risk patients, antidepressant drug treatment does not seem to be related to suicide attempts and death in adults but might be related in children and adolescents. These findings support careful clinical monitoring during antidepressant drug treatment of severely depressed young people.

AB Position statements opposing legalization of physician-assisted suicide by organizations such as the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine rightly emphasize that palliative care should be the standard of care for the dying, and that the inadequacies that exist in its delivery should be remedied. But such position statements generally understate the limitations of palliative care to alleviate some end-of-life suffering, and they do not provide adequate guidance about how physicians should approach patients with intractable suffering who are prepared to die. In this manuscript, we briefly present. data about severe suffering before death for terminally ill patients, including those enrolled in hospice programs. We also review some of what is known about requests and responses for physician-assisted suicide in Oregon and in the rest of the United States. Preliminary data from Oregon suggest that legally sanctioned access to physician-assisted suicide is used by a very small number of patients and seems to be associated with improved delivery of hospice and palliative care. Physicians of good will, deep religious convictions, and considerable palliative care experience exist on both sides of the debate about legalization of physician-assisted suicide. In an effort to respect this diversity, and to encourage out profession to continue to struggle with the genuine dilemmas faced by some patients toward the end of their lives and by their families, we argue in favor of medical organizations' taking a position of studied neutrality on this contentious issue.

AB Background The United States military has lost more troops to suicide than to combat for the second year in a row and better understanding combat-related risk factors for suicide is critical. We examined the association of killing and suicide among war veterans after accounting for PTSD, depression, and substance use disorders. Methods We utilized a cross-sectional, retrospective, nationally representative sample of Vietnam veterans from the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study (NVVRS). In order to perform a more in depth analysis, we utilized a subsample of these data, the NVVRS Clinical Interview Sample (CIS), which is representative of 1.3 million veterans who were eligible for the clinical interview by virtue of living in proximity to an interview site, located within 28 standard metropolitan regions throughout the United States. Results Veterans who had higher killing experiences had twice the odds of suicidal ideation, compared to those with lower or no killing experiences (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.073.67), even after adjusting for demographic variables, PTSD, depression, substance use disorders, and adjusted combat exposure. PTSD (OR = 3.42, 95% CI = 1.0910.73), depression (OR = 11.49, 95% CI = 2.1262.38), and substance use disorders (OR = 3.98, 95% CI = 1.0115.60) were each associated with higher odds of suicidal ideation. Endorsement of suicide attempts was most strongly associated with PTSD (OR = 5.52, 95% CI = 1.2125.29). Conclusions Killing experiences are not routinely examined when assessing suicide risk. Our findings have important implications for conducting suicide risk assessments in veterans of war. Depression and Anxiety 00:16, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The text is concerned with suicides in the Czech Republic. It seeks to determine which social variables, and to what extent, have affected suicidal behaviour since 1989. The authors draw on Durkheim's theory that society prevents suicidal tendencies. They formulate six hypotheses to account for the effects of social variables (year, sex, age, education, and marital status) on suicide rates, which they test using data from 1995 to 2010. Their findings show that time weakens the odds for committing suicides. Regardless of the time, women and people who are young, more educated, and living in a marriage face the lowest risk of suicide. That marriage works as a shield against suicide is especially true for men (its protective function for women is significantly lower). In the period observed, there was a relative increase in the effect of two social variables: middle age (45-69 years) and lower education. The structure of variables explaining suicide rates changed during the time period observed.

AB Using nationwide, 7-year population-based data for 1997-2003, we examined marital status to see if it predicted suicide among the ethnic Chinese population of Taiwan. Using cause of death data, with a case-control design, two groups-total adult suicide deaths, n = 17,850, the study group, and adult deaths other than suicide, n = 71,400 (randomly selected from age, sex, and geographic region matched controls, four per suicide)-were studied. Using multiple logistic regression analysis including age-marital status interaction, adjusted estimates show divorced status to be the most detrimental for suicide propensity, with males showing stronger effect size. Females never married, aged below 35 and 65-plus, and widowed 65-plus had lower suicide odds.

AB An increase of Bhutanese refugee suicides were reported in the US between 2009 and 2012. This investigation examined these reported suicides in depth to gain a better understanding of factors associated with suicide within this population. The study employed 14 psychological autopsies to elicit underlying motivations and circumstances for self-inflicted death and to identify potential future avenues for prevention and intervention among refugee communities. Disappointment with current (un)employment, lack of resettlement services and social support, and frustrations with separation from family were believed to contribute to suicidal acts. Suicide within refugee populations may be connected with experiences of family withdrawal, integration difficulties, and perceived lack of care. It is important to assess the effectiveness of improving refugee services on the mental health of migrants. More research is needed in order to better understand, and respond to, suicide in resettled populations.

AB Introduction: Understanding the geographic patterns of suicide can help inform targeted prevention efforts. Although state-level variation in age-adjusted suicide rates has been well documented, trends at the county-level have been largely unexplored. This study uses small area estimation to produce stable county-level estimates of suicide rates to examine geographic, temporal, and urban-rural patterns in suicide from 2005 to 2015.
   Methods: Using National Vital Statistics Underlying Cause of Death Files (2005-2015), hierarchical Bayesian models were used to estimate suicide rates for 3,140 counties. Model-based suicide rate estimates were mapped to explore geographic and temporal patterns and examine urban-rural differences. Analyses were conducted in 2016-2017.
   Results: Posterior predicted mean county-level suicide rates increased by >10% from 2005 to 2015 for 99% of counties in the U.S., with 87% of counties showing increases of >20%. Counties with the highest model-based suicide rates were consistently located across the western and northwestern U.S., with the exception of southern California and parts of Washington. Compared with more urban counties, more rural counties had the highest estimated suicide rates from 2005 to 2015, and also the largest increases over time.
   Conclusions: Mapping county-level suicide rates provides greater granularity in describing geographic patterns of suicide and contributes to a better understanding of changes in suicide rates over time. Findings may inform more targeted prevention efforts as well as future research on community-level risk and protective factors related to suicide mortality.

AB Over the past decade, suicide remains one of the leading causes of death among adolescents and a public health priority. Court-involved non-incarcerated juvenile justice youth frequently present with risk factors for suicide. Among these court-involved youth, 14% (n = 50) endorsed a lifetime history of suicidal ideation and attempts. Three main factors were associated with increased risk: prior offense, substance use, and childhood sexual abuse histories. This study highlights the importance of understanding suicidal behavior among nondetained juvenile justice populations. Community-based court involvement provides a rare opportunity to coordinate screening and suicide prevention efforts for youth and their families.

AB Background: This study examined the impact that the violent incident at Columbine High School may have had on reports of behaviors related to violence and suicide among U.S. high school students.
   Methods: Nationally representative data from the 1999 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) were analyzed using logistic regression analyses.
   Results: Students who completed the 1999 YRBS after the Columbine incident were more likely to report feeling too unsafe to go to school and less likely to report considering or planning suicide than were Students who completed the 1999 YRBS before the incident.
   Conclusions: These results highlight how an extreme incident of school violence can affect students nationwide.

AB One of sociology's defining debates centers on explanations of the geographic patterning of suicide. this classic debate is revisited using techniques of spatial analysis and data for two geographies: late nineteenth-century French departments, and late twentieth-century U.S. counties. Results of the French analysis contradict Durkheim's claim that "imitation" plays no role in shaping the geographic patterning of suicide. Suicide rates for northern and southern French departments cluster geographically even when the clustering of multiple dimensions of social integration is controlled. These findings are replicated in a contemporary analysis of nonwestern U.S. counties. Results for the American West, however support the Durkheimian view that suicide clusters in geographic space only because important structural predictors of suicide, including measures,of social integration, do so as. well. These discrepant findings are reconciled and it is concluded that the geographic patterning of suicide is shaped by both social integration and imitation.

AB Using Norway 1948-2004 as a case, I test whether changes in variables related to social integration can explain changes in suicide rates. The method is the Box-Jenkins approach to time-series analysis. Different aspects of family integration contribute significantly to the explanation of Norwegian suicide rates in this period. The estimated effect of separations is stronger than the effect of divorces, both for men and women, probably because separations are closer in time to the "real" marital breakup. This difference has not been demonstrated in earlier time-series research. Marriages decrease the suicide rates for males. The unemployment estimate for men has a negative sign, contributing to fewer suicides. Both increasing alcohol (beer) consumption and fewer marriages seem to be implicated in the soaring suicide rate for young men since 1970.

AB Objective: Limited data are available to understand the prevalence and correlates of suicidal behavior among U.S. Latino subgroups. This article compares the prevalence of lifetime suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among major U.S. Latino ethnic subgroups and identifies psychosociocultural factors associated with suicidal behaviors.
   Method. The National Latino and Asian American Study includes Spanish- and English-speaking Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and other Latinos. A total of 2554 interviews were conducted in both English and Spanish by trained interviewers between May 2002 and November 2003. Lifetime psychiatric disorders were measured using the World Health Organization-Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Descriptive statistics and logistic models were used to determine demographic, clinical, cultural, and social correlates of lifetime suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.
   Results: The lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among Latinos was 10.1% and 4.4%, respectively. Puerto Ricans were more likely to report ideation as compared with other Latino subgroups, but this difference was eliminated after adjustments for demographic, psychiatric, and sociocultural factors. Most lifetime suicide attempts described by Latinos were reported as occurring when they were under the age of 18 years. Any lifetime DSM-IV diagnoses, including dual diagnoses, were associated with an increased risk of lifetime suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among Latinos. In addition, female gender, acculturation (born in the United States and English speaking), and high levels of family conflict were independently and positively correlated with suicide attempts among Latinos, even among those without any psychiatric disorder.
   Conclusions: These findings reinforce the importance of understanding the process of acculturation, the role of family, and the sociocultural context for suicide risk among Latinos. These should be considered in addition to psychiatric diagnoses and symptoms in Latino suicide research, treatment, and prevention, especially among young individuals.

AB Background: Suicide is the third cause of death among adolescents in United States and between 5 to 12% of teenagers have history of suicide attempt. Therefore suicide is a public health problem in this age group. Aim: To compare the clinical characteristics of hospitalized adolescents who attempted suicide with those without a history of suicide attempt. Material and Methods: The clinical records of adolescents aged less than 18 years, hospitalized in a psychiatric clinic, were analyzed. Forty six patients aged 15 2 years (72% females) had a history of suicide attempt and were considered cases and 81 patients aged 15 +/- 2 years (52% females) did not have a history of suicide attempt and were considered controls. Demographical and clinical characteristics of both groups were compared. Psychiatric diagnoses were based oil the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM IV). Results: No significant differences were found between groups in the length of hospital stay. The Most common psychiatric diagnosis was depressive disorder, found in 71 and 35% of suicide and non suicide attempters, respectively (p < 0.01). Personality diagnosis Was deferred in most studied cases. Conclusions: Depression is more common among hospitalized adolescents who attempt suicide. (Rev Med Chile 2010; 138: 160-167).

AB A total of 622 suicides were reported among students attending 645 distinct campuses from 2004-2005 through 2008-2009. Adjusting for gender in the population at risk of 14.9 million student-years and for the source of these data, the student suicide rate of 7.0 was significantly and substantially lower than for a matched national sample. Suicide rates by firearm were significantly and substantially lower for both female and male students. Hanging was significantly and substantially lower for male students, less prominently so for female students. It is principally the ninefold decrease in the availability of firearms on campuses (vs. homes) and secondarily other features of the campus environment that are the bases for lower student suicide rates.

AB Background: Participant safety is an important concern in mental-health-oriented research. Investigators conducting studies in the United States that include potentially suicidal individuals are often required to develop written suicide risk management (SRM) protocols. But little is known about these protocols. It is possible that such protocols could serve as templates for suicide risk management in clinical settings. Aims: To elucidate common (best) practices from mental health intervention researchers. Methods: We conducted a systematic descriptive analysis of written SRM protocols. A convenience sample of studies funded by the United States' National Institute of Mental Health in 2005 were scanned to discover projects in which investigators were likely to identify and take responsibility for suicide risk in their participant pool. Qualitative methodology was used to create a checklist of tasks perceived to be operationally significant for insuring the safety of suicidal participants. The checklist was applied to all protocols to determine the variability of patient safety tasks across protocols. Results: We identified 45 candidate studies, whereof 38 investigators were contacted, resulting in the review of 21 SRM protocols. Three main categories emerged: overview, entry/exit, and process. Overall, 19 specific tasks were identified. Task frequency varied from 7% to 95% across protocols. Conclusions: The SRM checklist provides a framework for comparing the content of SRM protocols. This checklist may assist in developing SRM protocols in a wide range of settings. Developing guidelines and standard methodologies is an important step to further development of suicide prevention strategies. More research is necessary to determine the impact of SRM protocols on participant safety.

AB Reno, Elaine, Talia L. Brown, Marian E. Betz, Michael H. Allen, Lilian Hoffecker, Jeremy Reitinger, Robert Roach, and Benjamin Honigman. Suicide and high altitude: an integrative review. High Alt Med Biol 00:000-000, 2017. Introduction: Suicide rates are greater at high altitudes, and multiple mechanisms have been suggested for this relationship, including hypoxia, differences in population density, characteristics of suicide victims, and firearms ownership and access. To better understand these potential mechanisms, studies evaluating the associations between high altitude and suicide were examined. Methods: A literature review of published studies on high altitude and suicide was conducted in Medline, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane CENTRAL database. We extracted and analyzed all studies that met the inclusion criteria, excluding foreign language studies and letters. Most of the measurements and results were synthesized using modified Letts' criteria. Results: Searches using an extensive list of keywords returned 470 articles, but only 6 met the inclusion criteria. The studies' samples ranged in size from 8871 to 596,704, while studies which did not document sample size reported suicide rates. In five of the studies selected, individuals living at high altitudes were at greater risk of suicide. Four studies used aggregated data at a county or state level to analyze variables, such as age, gender, race, socioeconomic factors, and firearms access. All the studies found that high altitude was independently associated with suicide. One study found that many individual characteristics of those who committed suicide were different at high altitudes than low altitude, including a lack of access or barriers to mental healthcare. Depression exacerbated by hypoxia was hypothesized as a possible biologic mechanism in three studies. Conclusion: These research studies published since 2009 support an association between high altitude and suicide rates at the state or county level, but do not provide sufficient data to estimate the effect of high altitude on an individuals' suicide risk. Although the impact of hypoxia on mood and depression has been hypothesized to be a contributing cause, many other individual factors likely play more important roles.

AB This study examines historical trends in the relationship between homicide and suicide rates and considers the extent to which gender differences exist in that relationship. From the perspective of the integrated homicide-suicide theory, gender differences in the homicide-suicide relationship stem from differences in the manner in which males and females attribute blame and responsibility for negative life events. Consistent with expectations, the data indicate that females engage in less homicide but in more suicide than males. Seemingly unrelated regression techniques were used to further examine gender differences in the relationship between homicide and suicide rates by analyzing U.S. data for 1960 through 2000. The results indicate more gender similarities than differences in that temporal trends in the production and direction of lethal violence for both males and females tend to be associated with similar social and economic factors.

AB IMPORTANCE Little is known about recent trends in rural-urban disparities in youth suicide, particularly sex-and method-specific changes. Documenting the extent of these disparities is critical for the development of policies and programs aimed at eliminating geographic disparities.
   OBJECTIVE To examine trends in US suicide mortality for adolescents and young adults across the rural-urban continuum.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Longitudinal trends in suicide rates by rural and urban areas between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2010, were analyzed using county-level national mortality data linked to a rural-urban continuum measure that classified all 3141 counties in the United States into distinct groups based on population size and adjacency to metropolitan areas. The population included all suicide decedents aged 10 to 24 years.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Rates of suicide per 100 000 persons.
   RESULTS Across the study period, 66 595 youths died by suicide, and rural suicide rates were nearly double those of urban areas for both males (19.93 and 10.31 per 100 000, respectively) and females (4.40 and 2.39 per 100 000, respectively). Even after controlling for a wide array of county-level variables, rural-urban suicide differentials increased over time for males, suggesting widening rural-urban disparities (1996-1998: adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.98; 2008-2010: adjusted IRR, 1.19; difference in IRR, P = .02). Firearm suicide rates declined, and the rates of hanging/suffocation for both males and females increased. However, the rates of suicide by firearm (males: 1996-1998, 2.05; and 2008-2010: 2.69 times higher) and hanging/suffocation (males: 1996-1998, 1.24; and 2008-2010: 1.63 times higher) were disproportionately higher in rural areas, and rural-urban differences increased over time (P = .002 for males; P = .06 for females).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Suicide rates for adolescents and young adults are higher in rural than in urban communities regardless of the method used, and rural-urban disparities appear to be increasing over time. Further research should carefully explore the mechanisms whereby rural residence might increase suicide risk in youth and consider suicide-prevention efforts specific to rural settings.

AB Native American (Native) adolescents have the highest suicide rates in the United States, yet no conceptual models describing risk factors specific to this population exist. We sought to further hone a Native-specific conceptual model developed from quantitative data with qualitative data collected from a longitudinal series of interviews with (N = 22) Native adolescents who had attempted suicide. Four levels of suicide risk emerged, detailing individual, family, community, and societal factors that affect youths' pathways to suicide, along with a variety of subthemes and constructs. Some themes parallel established models of suicide risk; however, others are unique to the experience of this sample, including the impact of overtaxed households and family composition, significant grief burden, contagion, and stigma surrounding treatment seeking. We suggest adaptations of existing themes and constructs in the model. We discuss practical implications for research and intervention development, along with strengths and limitations of the study.

AB Studies of college student suicide can be grouped into the following 4 eras: 1920-1960, 1960-1980, 1980-1990, and 1990-2004. The suicide rate for students has declined monotonically across these 4 eras, from 13.4 to 8.0 to 7.5 and, most recently, to 6.5. The decreasing proportion of men in the student populations studied largely accounts for this decline. Since 1960, the suicide rate for students has consistently been about half the rate of the general US population, matched for age and gender. This highly favorable relative suicide rate is the result of firearms having been effectively banned from campuses. Additional population-oriented approaches warrant implementation to further reduce student-suicide rates. Approaches focused on high-risk groups also hold promise. These findings are based upon and may be most valid for the 70% of all students who attend 4-year colleges and universities full time.

AB Suicide in war veterans has being a focus of researchers, administration and media since the time of Vietnam War. Over the years there has been some research in this area. However till now there is no consensus as to whether suicide rates are higher in war veterans compared to general population. However, studies have shown that veterans have many known risk factors for suicide as found in general population. In addition there is evidence to suggest that some of the risk factors like experience of combat, presence of combat guilt, severe physical trauma and higher prevalence of mental illnesses like depression and PTSD make this population more vulnerable to suicide. There is urgent need to develop suicide prevention programmes specifically for veterans.

AB Objective To examine suicide risk by eating disorder severity and symptom presentation in a nationwide sample of college students. Method The Healthy Minds Study is the largest mental health survey of college populations in the United States. We analyzed the most recent available data (2015-2017) with 71,712 randomly selected students from 77 campuses. We estimated associations between two measures of suicidality (ideation and attempts) and three validated measures of eating disorder symptoms (the SCOFF, weight concerns scale, and the eating disorder examination questionnaire binge and purge items). Importantly, we also controlled for co-occurring symptoms of depression and anxiety, based on validated screening tools. The large, diverse sample provided a unique opportunity to assess whether certain individual characteristics were associated with increased risk. Results Eating disorder symptoms, even at subthreshold levels, were highly predictive of suicidality. Relative to students with no apparent eating disorder symptoms, students with the highest symptom levels (a SCOFF score of 5) had 11 times higher odds of attempting suicide, while those with subthreshold symptoms had two times higher odds. We also observed a strong association between suicide attempts and eating disorder presentations that included purging. Students from marginalized backgrounds, particularly gender and sexual minorities, were at increased risk for suicide and eating disorders. Discussion In the largest known study to date, findings suggest that eating disorders should be a priority within broader campus suicide prevention efforts, should be assessed along a continuum of severity and symptom presentation, and should focus on reaching vulnerable students.

AB The goal in this study was to assess if there is any constancy in detections of psychoactive substances in consecutive suicides. Toxicologic findings in 179 suicides in San Diego County, California, between 1981 and 1982, and 333 suicides in Mobile County, Alabama, between 1990 and 1998, were compared. Alcohol was detected in about 30% of suicides in both samples. Abusable prescription psychoactive substances, i.e., benzodiazepines and opiates, were detected in one fifth of cases in both locations. Nonabusable prescription psychoactive substances, mainly antidepressants, were found in more suicides in Mobile than in San Diego. Detection rates of different classes of psychoactive substances have not changed much in the past decade. Detection of alcohol, cocaine, or cannabis in about 40% of suicides supports the clinical practice of discouraging consumption of these substances in depressed patients. Another challenge is the low rate of detection of antidepressants in suicide, which suggests undertreatment of depression in suicides. Continued reporting of routine, comprehensive, toxicologic findings in suicides is useful to monitor patterns of use of psychoactive substances in this group and to guide suicide prevention in clinical practice and public health policy.

AB This study examined the interrelation of domestic abuse, forgiveness of self, forgiveness of others, and suicide behavior in a community sample of 101 patients receiving primary care from a clinic in the southeastern United States. As expected, it was found that more frequent experience of domestic abuse was associated with more frequent suicide behavior. Results from conducting mediation analyses and using bootstrapping techniques provided support for a model in which the relationship between domestic abuse and suicide behavior was accounted for by forgiveness of self, but not by forgiveness of others. The article concludes with a discussion of some of the implications of the present findings for practice and the study's limitations.

AB IMPORTANCE Suicide is a leading cause of deaths in the United States. Although the emergency department (ED) is an opportune setting for initiating suicide prevention efforts, ED-initiated suicide prevention interventions remain underdeveloped.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether an ED-initiated intervention reduces subsequent suicidal behavior.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This multicenter study of 8 EDs in the United States enrolled adults with a recent suicide attempt or ideation and was composed of 3 sequential phases: (1) a treatment as usual (TAU) phase from August 2010 to December 2011, (2) a universal screening (screening) phase from September 2011 to December 2012, and (3) a universal screening plus intervention (intervention) phase from July 2012 to November 2013.
   INTERVENTIONS Screening consisted of universal suicide risk screening. The intervention phase consisted of universal screening plus an intervention, which included secondary suicide risk screening by the ED physician, discharge resources, and post-ED telephone calls focused on reducing suicide risk.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was suicide attempts (nonfatal and fatal) over the 52-week follow-up period. The proportion and total number of attempts were analyzed.
   RESULTS A total of 1376 participants were recruited, including 769 females (55.9%) with a median (interquartile range) age of 37 (26-47) years. A total of 288 participants (20.9%) made at least 1 suicide attempt, and there were 548 total suicide attempts among participants. There were no significant differences in risk reduction between the TAU and screening phases (23% vs 22%, respectively). However, compared with the TAU phase, patients in the intervention phase showed a 5% absolute reduction in suicide attempt risk (23% vs 18%), with a relative risk reduction of 20%. Participants in the intervention phase had 30% fewer total suicide attempts than participants in the TAU phase. Negative binomial regression analysis indicated that the participants in the intervention phase had significantly fewer total suicide attempts than participants in the TAU phase (incidence rate ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52-1.00; P=.05) but no differences between the TAU and screening phases (incidence rate ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.71-1.41; P=.99).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among at-risk patients in the ED, a combination of brief interventions administered both during and after the ED visit decreased post-ED suicidal behavior.

   The Role of Compatibility Heuristics
SO COUNSELING PSYCHOLOGIST

ID SEXUAL ORIENTATION; COLLEGE-STUDENTS; GENDER; HELP; AGE
AB The incidence and prevalence of death by suicide and nonlethal suicidal behaviors such as suicide attempts, thoughts, and feelings are increasing in the United States and throughout the world. Efforts to prevent suicide deaths and suicide attempts, and reduce the likelihood that suicidal thoughts and feelings will lead to those outcomes, rest on the accuracy of suicide risk assessments primarily conducted in the context of clinical interviews. Despite being armed with lists of empirically derived correlates of suicide (i.e., risk factors), suicide risk assessment continues to be a challenging task faced by counseling psychologists and other mental health professionals on a daily basis. As Shea (1999) has suggested, this challenge in a large part is a function of differing values and beliefs regarding suicide between the clinician and the client that create barriers to accurate assessment. The thesis of this contribution to the Major Contribution is that the barriers to suicide risk assessment are much broader than values and beliefs when in the context of cultural differences between the clinician and client. Thus, we present an argument for the adoption of a set of compatibility heuristics as a framework for suicide risk assessment in the cross-cultural suicide risk assessment environment.

ID UNITED-STATES; FIREARMS; BEHAVIOR; AGE; HEALTH; HOME
AB The aim of this research is to assess if home firearm access increases the risk of nonfatal suicidal attempts among adolescents. Such a gun focus has largely been limited to case-control studies on completed suicides. This line of research has found that household gun access increases the risk of suicide due to features of available firearms (e.g., provide little time for rescue). We extend this risk factor perspective to the study of nonfatal suicide attempts among a national sample of adolescents. Current findings reveal that home handgun access, but not long gun only access, is associated with an increased risk of attempted suicide in cross-sectional models. In panel models, however, we find no significant association between home firearm access (of any gun type) and risk of attempted suicide. The implications of these findings for research on suicidal behavior among adolescents are discussed.

AB The aim of this study is to analyse how area characteristics affect suicide mortality and to assess whether the effects of individual socio-economic characteristics vary in socio-economically different areas. Data come from the 1990 census records of 15-99-year-old Finns linked to death records in 1991-2001 including 13,589 suicides. Area characteristics were obtained for 85 functional regions. We show that hypotheses of interaction between individual and area socio-economic status for suicide mortality are not supported. However, area socio-economic characteristics, family cohesion and voting turnout are consistently related to suicide. The effects of median income and income inequality are less consistent. Adjusting for individual level variables partly attenuate these associations. The results indicate that improving the areas people live in may prevent suicide.

   of a firearm in suicide deaths across 17 US states
SO JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Suicide; Firearm; Risk factor
ID PREVENTION; PATTERNS; WOMEN; MEN
AB Background: Suicides are of growing public health concern in the United States. Although the demographics of firearm suicides are well established, the sex and age differences in the role that life circumstances play in the risk for firearm suicide are not known.
   Methods: We used suicide deaths from the National Violent Death Reporting System from 2003 to 2011 in 17 U.S. states to assess the difference in the relation between six life circumstances and risk of firearm versus nonfirearm suicides across sex and age groups. Mixed effect logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
   Results: The risk of using a firearm as compared to other means for suicide were greater among white, male, non-Hispanic, older (>50 years of age), and currently married U.S. residents. Among all age and sex groups, the odds of firearm use were 21-29% greater in the presence of a recent crisis. Having a financial problem was significantly associated with firearm use among younger men (OR=1.14, 95% CI = 1.07-1.21), younger women (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.02-1.39), and older women (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.05-1.39), while physical health issues were associated with risk of firearm suicide among older men (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.65-1.92).
   Limitations: Misclassification due to multiple data sources.
   Conclusion: The life circumstances associated with a preference of using firearm for suicide differ by sex and by age.

AB Objectives. We aimed to determine the percentage of suicide attempts attributable to individual Axis I and Axis II mental disorders by studying population-attributable fractions (PAFs) in a nationally representative sample.
   Methods. Data were from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions Wave 2 (NESARC; 2004-2005), a large (N = 34 653) survey of mental illness in the United States. We used multivariate logistic regression to compare individuals with and without a history of suicide attempt across Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Axis I disorders (anxiety, mood, psychotic, alcohol, and drug disorders) and all 10 Axis II personality disorders. PAFs were calculated for each disorder.
   Results. Of the 25 disorders we examined in the model, 4 disorders had notably high PAF values: major depressive disorder (PAF = 26.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 20.1, 33.2), borderline personality disorder (PAF = 18.1%; 95% CI = 13.4, 23.5), nicotine dependence (PAF = 8.4%; 95% CI = 3.4, 13.7), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PAF = 6.3%; 95% CI = 3.2, 10.0).
   Conclusions. Our results provide new insight into the relationships between mental disorders and suicide attempts in the general population. Although many mental illnesses were associated with an increased likelihood of suicide attempt, elevated rates of suicide attempts were mostly attributed to the presence of 4 disorders.

Various mental disorders may be a cause for increased violence. This article outlines the elements of the risk assessment (for harm to self and/or others) in patients in crisis and addresses which contributing factors may be modifiable. This article also proposes a practical framework for the management of risk regarding suicide and violence.

AB Gender differences in suicide completion rates have been attributed to the differences in lethality of suicide methods chosen by men and women, but few empirical studies have investigated factors other than demographic characteristics that might explain this differential.
   Data from the 621 suicides in Summit County, Ohio during 1997-2006 were disaggregated by gender to compare known correlates of suicide risk on three methods of suicide-firearm, hanging and drug poisoning.
   Compared to women, men who completed suicide with firearms were more likely to be married and committed the act at home. Unmarried men were likelier to hang themselves than married men, but unmarried women were less likely to hang themselves than married women. Men with a history of depression were more likely to suicide by hanging, but women with depression were half as likely to hang themselves compared to the women without a history of depression. Men with a history of substance abuse were more likely to suicide by poisoning than men without such history, but substance abuse history had no influence on women's use of poisoning to suicide. For both sexes, the odds of suicide by poisoning were significantly higher for those on psychiatric medications.

AB Objective: The increase of nonmedical prescription opioid use (NMPOU) in the United States has become a public health concern. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between nonmedical prescription opioid misuse and past-year suicidality (suicide ideation-SI, suicide plan-SP, and suicide attempts-SA) among U.S. adults.
   Method: Secondary data analysis was conducted using the 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health with 42,625 respondents. NMPOU was grouped in 4 categories: (1) never used, (2) current user, (3) recent user, and (4) past user. The outcome variables were SI, SP and SA and they were predicted in multivariable logistic regression.
   Results: Compared to the never-use of NMPO groups, the current, recent, and past users of NMPO showed significantly higher likelihoods of SI, SP, and SA models adjusting for sociodemographic and mental health-related factors. Presence of a major depressive episode had the significantly highest Odds Ratio of SI, SP, and SA. Suicidality among NMPO users is high, and there are multiple, sociodemographic and mental health related factors associated with this finding.
   Conclusion: Policy and prevention efforts to improve screening and treatment should focus on the at-risk populations identified in this study.

However, few studies have examined similarities and differences between Veteran and nonveteran suicide decedents using a combination of next of kin psychological autopsy and data from a state Office of the Medical Examiner (OME). For the current study, next of kin of a one-year cohort of male suspected suicide decedents in Utah completed psychological autopsy interviews with trained research staff. Next of kin of 70 Veterans and 356 nonveterans completed the interviews, which included demographic, behavioral, psychosocial, and clinical variables. The psychological autopsy data then were combined with OME data for the presented analyses. Results showed that Veteran and nonveteran suicide decedents differed on multiple factors, including age at death. Specifically, male nonveteran suicide decedents were younger at age of death compared to Utah Veterans and to a national sample. Veteran decedents also were more likely to have a history of suicide attempts and more likely to have access to firearms compared to nonveterans. Other between-group differences, including Veterans being more likely to have lived alone and method of death (e.g., gunshot, hanging, etc.), were no longer statistically significant after adjustment for age at death. Conclusions: these findings have significant clinical and practical importance, as they highlight the risk for suicide in younger nonveterans and older Veterans in Utah. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Drug poisoning is the leading method of suicide-related deaths among females and third among males in the United States. Alcohol can increase the severity of drug poisonings, yet the prevalence of alcohol overdoses in suicide-related drug poisonings (SRDP) remains unclear. Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample was examined to determine rates of inpatient hospital stays for SRDP and co-occurring alcohol overdoses in adolescents (ages 1217) and young adults (ages 1824) between 1999 and 2008. Among adolescents, there were 14,615 hospitalizations for drug poisonings in 2008, of which 72% (10,462) were suicide-related at a cost of $43 million. Rates of SRDP in this age group decreased between 1999 and 2008. The prevalence of co-occurring alcohol overdoses increased from 5% in 1999 to 7% in 2008. Among young adults, there were 32,471 hospitalizations for drug poisonings in 2008, of which 64% (20,746) were suicide-related at a cost of $110 million. Rates of SRDP did not change significantly between 1999 and 2008. The prevalence of co-occurring alcohol overdoses increased from 14% in 1999 to 20% in 2008. Thus, while rates of SRDP decreased for adolescents and remained unchanged for young adults, the prevalence of co-occurring alcohol overdoses increased for both age groups. Such hospitalizations provide important opportunities to employ intervention techniques to prevent further suicide attempts.

AB This study examined the circumstances preceding suicide among Asian and Pacific Islander Americans (APIAs) and White American decedents using data from the National Violent Death Reporting System in the United States. After controlling for gender and age, APIAs had lower rates of recent disclosure of suicide ideation, recent mental health treatment, recent mental health problems, and intimate partner problems, but higher rates of school problems than White Americans. There were also significant RacexAge moderation effects for recent mental health, financial, and school problems and a significant RacexGender moderation effect for intimate partner problems.

AB Background: Exposure to suicide and closeness to a suicide decedent may be relevant to means safety, especially in firearm owners. This study examines how such factors are associated with firearm owners' current firearm storage methods and openness to changing storage methods.
   Method: 300 firearm owners completed a survey on Amazon's Mechanical Turk program; 176 participants reported being exposed to suicide. Perceived closeness was rated as Not at all close, Close, or Extremely Close.
   Results: Those exposed to suicide were more open to secure storage and temporarily storing the firearm with a trusted individual to prevent someone else's suicide. Those close to the suicide decedent were more likely to use secure storage practices, more open to using secure storage methods to prevent their own and someone else's suicide, and had a higher degree of storage methods in place compared to those not close to the decedent.
   Limitations: The sample may not be representative of all American firearm owners exposed to suicide.
   Conclusions: Being close to a suicide decedent may influence firearm owners' current storage practices and openness to changing storage methods. Such individuals may better relate to the suicide decedent and realize the significance of using secure storage methods to prevent suicide.

AB Suicide has been the second leading cause of death for 18- to 24-year-olds in the United States since 2011. The stress experienced by undergraduate college students has the potential to increase one's risk for suicide. Resilience theory was used as a theoretical framework to examine the interplay between risk and protective factors. A cross-sectional and correlational design was used to assess the mediating effects of positive thinking and/or social support on suicide resilience in 131 college students 18 to 24 years old who completed an online survey. The study found an indirect effect of self-esteem on suicide resilience through positive thinking and social support indicating that as self-esteem increases, positive thinking and social support also increase, which leads to an increase in resilience. The study also found a direct effect of self-esteem, positive thinking, and social support on suicide resilience. The findings inform the development of tailored interventions to build suicide resilience in college students.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY

ID PRIMARY-CARE; UNITED-STATES; DEPRESSION; DISORDERS; PLACEBO;
   EPIDEMIOLOGY; POPULATION; EFFICACY; CHILDREN; YOUTH
AB Objective: In March 2004 the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned physicians and patients regarding increased risk of suicide with 10 newer antidepressant drugs. Available data leave considerable uncertainty regarding actual risk of suicide attempt and death by suicide during antidepressant treatment. The authors used population-based data to evaluate the risk of suicide death and serious suicide attempt in relation to initiation of antidepressant treatment.
   Method: Computerized health plan records were used to identify 65,103 patients with 82,285 episodes of antidepressant treatment between Jan. 1, 1992, and June 30, 2003. Death by suicide was identified by using state and national death certificate data. Serious suicide attempt (suicide attempt leading to hospitalization) was identified by using hospital discharge data.
   Results: In the 6 months after the index prescription of antidepressant treatment, 31 suicide deaths (40 per 100,000 treatment episodes) and 76 serious suicide attempts (93 per 100,000) were identified in the study group. The risk of suicide attempt was 314 per 100,000 in children and adolescents, compared to 78 per 100,000 in adults. The risk of death by suicide was not significantly higher in the month after starting medication than in subsequent months. The risk of suicide attempt was highest in the month before starting antidepressant treatment and declined progressively after starting medication. When the 10 newer antidepressants included in the FDA advisory were compared to older drugs, an increase in risk after starting treatment was seen only for the older drugs.
   Conclusions: The risk of suicide during acute-phase antidepressant treatment is approximately one in 3,000 treatment episodes, and risk of serious suicide attempt is approximately one in 1,000. Available data do not indicate a significant increase in risk of suicide or serious suicide attempt after starting treatment with newer antidepressant drugs.

AB Mental health related hospitalizations and suicide are both significant public health problems within the United States Department of Defense (DoD). To date, few evidence-based suicide prevention programs have been developed for delivery to military personnel and family members admitted for psychiatric inpatient care due to suicidal self-directed violence. This paper describes the rationale and detailed methodology for a study called Safety Planning for Military (SAFE MIL) which involves a randomized controlled trial (RCT) at the largest military treatment facility in the United States. The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a brief, readily accessible, and personalized treatment called the Safety Planning Intervention (Stanley and Brown, 2012). Primary outcomes, measured by blinded assessors at one and six months following psychiatric discharge, include suicide ideation, suicide-related coping, and attitudes toward help seeking. Additionally, given the study's focus on a highly vulnerable patient population, a description of safety considerations for human subjects' participation is provided. Based on this research team's experience, the implementation of an infrastructure in support of RCT research within DoD settings and the processing of regulatory approvals for a clinical trial with high risk suicidal patients are expected to take up to 18-24 months. Recommendations for expediting the advancement of clinical trials research within the DoD are provided in order to maximize cost efficacy and minimize the research to practice gap.

AB Older adults in the United States and many countries around the world die by suicide at elevated rates compared with younger adults. However, relatively little is known about psychotherapeutic approaches to managing and treating suicide risk among older adults. The patient in this case presented with elevated suicide risk and was treated with interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) informed by the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide. This theoretical model proposes that thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness are causes of suicide ideation. IPT guides therapists to look for one of four interpersonal stressors that may be present in a client's life-grief, role transitions, interpersonal disputes, and interpersonal sensitivity (i.e., skills deficits). The Interpersonal Theory provides a rationale for choosing one problem focus over another. Specifically, the problem area that allows the therapist and patient to target and ameliorate thwarted belongingness and/or perceived burdensomeness is selected. The positive outcome of reduced suicide risk in this case illustrates how targeting the constructs of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness with IPT may help older adults resolve suicide ideation and prevent recurrences of suicidal crises.

AB Objectives. This study examined rural-urban gradients in US suicide mortality and the extent to which such gradients varied across time, sex, and age.
   Methods. Using a 10-category rural-urban continuum measure and 1970-1997 county mortality data, we estimated rural-urban differentials in suicide mortality over time by multiple regression and Poisson regression models.
   Results. Significant rural-urban gradients in age-adjusted male suicide mortality were found in each time period, indicating rising suicide rates with increasing levels of rurality. The gradient increased consistently, suggesting widening rural-urban differentials in male suicides over time. When controlled for geographic variation in divorce rate and ethnic composition, rural men, in each age cohort, had about twice the suicide rate of their most urban counterparts. Observed rural-urban differentials for women diminished overtime. In 1995 to 1997, the adjusted suicide rates for young and working-age women were 85% and 22% higher, respectively, in rural than in the most urban areas.
   Conclusions. The slope of the relationship between rural-urban continuum and suicide mortality varied substantially by time, sex, and age. Widening rural-urban disparities in suicide may reflect differential changes over time in key social integration indicators.

AB Critical suicidology (White, Marsh, Kral, & Morris, 2016) offers a critique of positivism as the mainstream rhetoric of scientific research. In this article, the authors add a critique to the moral detachment of scientific inquiry (Wilkinson & Kleinman, 2016) in suicidology. They provide a discussion at the intersection of theory and research when considering moral care of all stakeholders in the implementation of suicide research toward the development of more humanitarian policies and program alternatives. The authors reflect upon their experience of conducting an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (Finlay, 2011) on suicide in the U.S. military.

AB Purpose: Research suggests that the Great Recession of 2007-2009 led to nearly 5000 excess suicides in the United States. However, prior work has not accounted for seasonal patterning and unique suicide trends by age and gender.
   Methods: We calculated monthly suicide rates from 1999 to 2013 for men and women aged 15 and above. Suicide rates before the Great Recession were used to predict the rate during and after the Great Recession. Death rates for each age-gender group were modeled using Poisson regression with robust variance, accounting for seasonal and nonlinear suicide trajectories.
   Results: There were 56,658 suicide deaths during the Great Recession. Age-and gender-specific suicide trends before the recession demonstrated clear seasonal and nonlinear trajectories. Our models predicted 57,140 expected suicide deaths, leading to 482 fewer observed than expected suicides (95% confidence interval 2079, 943).
   Conclusions: We found little evidence to suggest that the Great Recession interrupted existing trajectories of suicide rates. Suicide rates were already increasing before the Great Recession for middle-aged men and women. Future studies estimating the impact of recessions on suicide should account for the diverse and unique suicide trajectories of different social groups. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: There is convergent evidence from adoption, family, geographical, immigrant, molecular genetic, twin and, most recently, surname studies of suicide for genetic contributions to suicide risk. Surnames carry information about genetic relatedness or distance and, in patrilineal surname systems, are a close substitute for Y-chromosome markers and haplotypes, since surname transmission is similar to the transmission of the nonrecombining part of the Y chromosome. This study investigated whether differences in regional suicide rates correspond to the genetic structure of the Austrian population.
   Methods: Differences in district-level standardized suicide rates 1988-94 between the five major surname regions identified for Austria were analyzed. The surname regions used in the analysis reflect the contemporary population structure and closely follow the natural borders found in the topography of Austria, less so its administrative division into nine states.
   Results: Surname region accounted for a significant (P < 0.001) and substantial (38%) portion of the variance in district-level suicide rates. Adjusting the suicide rates for a set of five social and economic indicators that are established ecological correlates of suicide prevalence (income, and rates of the divorced, unemployed, elderly and Roman Catholics) left the results essentially unchanged.
   Conclusions: Regional differences in suicide rates within Austria correspond to the genetic structure of the population. The present evidence adds to related findings from geographical and surname studies of suicide that suggest a role for genetic risk factors for suicidal behavior. Genetic differences between subpopulations may partially account for the geography of suicide. Study limitations and directions for future research are discussed.

ID UNITED-STATES; AUSTRALIA; TURKEY; RATES
AB The objective of this study is to address the question: are those who leave suicide notes representative of the larger population of those who commit suicide? The method involves an analysis of a full population of suicides by residents of Queensland, Australia for the full year of 2004, with the information drawn from Coronial files. Our overall results suggest that, and in support of previous research, the population who leaves suicide notes are remarkably similar to those who do not. Differences are identified in four areas: first, and in contrast to prior research, females are less likely to leave a suicide note; second, and in support of previous research, Aboriginal Australians are less likely to leave suicide notes; third, and in support of some previous research, those who use gas as a method of suicide are more likely to leave notes, while those who use a vehicle or a train are less likely to leave notes; finally, our findings lend support to research which finds that those with a diagnosed mental illness are less likely to leave notes. The discussion addresses some of the reasons these disparities may have occurred, and continues the debate over the degree to which suicide notes give insight into the larger suicide population.

AB Recently, there have been calls for the decriminalization (or depenalization) of nonfatal suicidal behavior (attempted suicide) in Ghana, India, Uganda, and other societies that currently criminalize nonfatal suicidal behavior. Despite this, there is a dearth of systematic studies that examine the extent, nature, and characteristics of attempted suicide prosecutions in countries that currently criminalize nonfatal suicidal behavior. The current study, therefore, explores the phenomenon of criminal prosecution and punishment for suicide attempters in Ghana, one among several countries where nonfatal suicidal behavior is a crime. Drawing from data extracted from local Ghanaian print and electronic news media articles, the study examines the sociodemographic characteristics of suicide attempt survivors, the patterns of nonfatal suicidal behavior, as well as the criminal justice outcomes of the criminal prosecutions. The findings indicate that the majority of defendants pled guilty to or were found guilty of the charge and sentenced to penalties ranging from monetary fines to incarceration. The results are discussed with regard to their implications for reducing nonfatal suicidal behavior in Ghana.

AB Suicide is a preventable public health problem and a leading cause of death in the United States. Despite recognized need for community-based strategies for suicide prevention, most suicide prevention programs focus on individual-level change. This article presents seven first person accounts of Finding the Light Within, a community mobilization initiative to reduce the stigma associated with suicide through public arts participation that took place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from 2011 through 2012. The stigma associated with suicide is a major challenge to suicide prevention, erecting social barriers to effective prevention and treatment and enhancing risk factors for people struggling with suicidal ideation and recovery after losing a loved one to suicide. This project engaged a large and diverse audience and built a new community around suicide prevention through participatory public art, including community design and production of a large public mural about suicide, storytelling and art workshops, and a storytelling website. We present this project as a model for how arts participation can address suicide on multiple fronts-from raising awareness and reducing stigma, to promoting community recovery, to providing healing for people and communities in need.

AB IMPORTANCE Understanding geographic and community-level factors associated with suicide can inform targeted suicide prevention efforts.
   OBJECTIVES To estimate suicide rates and trajectories, assess associated county-level contextual factors, and explore variation across the rural-urban continuum.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study included all individuals aged 25 to 64 years who died by suicide from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2016, in the United States. Spatial analysis was used to map excess risk of suicide, and longitudinal random-effects models using negative binomial regression tested associations of contextual variables with suicide rates as well as interactions among county-level contextual variables. Data analyses were conducted between January 2019 and July 2019. EXPOSURE County of residence.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Three-year county suicide rates during an 18-year period stratified by rural-urban location.
   RESULTS Between 1999 and 2016, 453 577 individuals aged 25 to 64 years died by suicide in the United States. Decedents were primarily male (349 082 [77.0%]) with 101 312 (22.3%) aged 25 to 34 years, 120 157 (26.5%) aged 35 to 44 years, 136 377 (30.1%) aged 45 to 54 years, and 95 771 (21.1%) aged 55 to 64 years. Suicide rates were higher and increased more rapidly in rural than in large metropolitan counties. The highest deprivation quartile was associated with higher suicide rates compared with the lowest deprivation quartile, especially in rural areas, although this association declined during the period studied (rural, 1999-2001: incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.438; 95% CI, 1.319-1.568; P<.001; large metropolitan, 1999-2001: 1.208; 95% CI, 1.149-1.270; P<.001; rural, 2014-2016: IRR, 1.121; 95% CI, 1.032-1.219; P=.01; large metropolitan, 2014-2016: IRR, 0.942; 95% CI, 0.887-1.001; P=.06). The presence of more gun shops was associated with an increase in county-level suicide rates in all county types except the most rural (rural: IRR, 1.001; 95% CI, 0.999-1.004; P=.40; micropolitan: IRR, 1.005; 95% CI, 1.002-1.007; P<.001; small metropolitan: IRR, 1.010; 95% CI, 1.006-1.014; P<.001; large metropolitan: IRR, 1.012; 95% CI, 1.006-1.018; P<.001). High social capital was associated with lower suicide rates than low social capital (IRR, 0.917; 95% CI, 0.891-0.943; P<.001). High social fragmentation, an increasing percentage of the population without health insurance, and an increasing percentage of veterans in a county were associated with higher suicide rates (high social fragmentation: IRR, 1.077; 95% CI, 1.050-1.103; P<.001; percentage of population without health insurance: IRR, 1.005; 95% CI, 1.004-1.006; P<.001; percentage of veterans: IRR, 1.025; 95% CI, 1.021-1.028; P<.001).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study found that suicide rates have increased across the nation and most rapidly in rural counties, which may be more sensitive to the impact of social deprivation than more metropolitan counties. Improving social connectedness, civic opportunities, and health insurance coverage as well as limiting access to lethal means have the potential to reduce suicide rates across the rural-urban continuum.

DE Suicide; epidemiology; mortality; decedent age
AB As calculated using health gap summary measures, suicide is predicted to rank as the fourteenth most burdensome global health condition by the year 2020, and suicide rates are still climbing rapidly in many countries of the world. Unfortunately, the unique and challenging methodological issues which confront clinical suicide epidemiologists complicate investigations which could potentially inform suicide prevention efforts. There is, for instance, a popular, albeit largely unexplored, theory that environmental and biological influences impact suicidal behavior differentially by age group. However, neither the validity of the theory itself nor the potential mediators of the age-suicide relationship are well explicated. The usual approach to age group analysis for suicide decedents is to use fixed intervals (e. g., five-year intervals) to define age groups. However, when the data are available for many years, the suicide rate can vary over time for a given age group, and displaying the rate over time for multiple age groups can be confusing. In this paper, we use a method of cluster analysis to derive internally consistent age groups which exhibit distinct changing patterns across time. The method is applied to the US suicide data between 1960 and 2007.

AB Objectives. Studies show that the seasonality of suicide (spring/early summer peak, winter low) is mainly the consequence of the seasonal incidence of depression-related suicides. The aim of the present study was to analyse the relationship between increasing antidepressant utilization and national suicide rate of Hungary between 1998 and 2006, with particular regard to seasonal patterns and gender differences. Methods. Time trend analysis (ARIMA) had been applied to investigate the correlation between the trend of antidepressant prescription and both of suicide rates and seasonality index. Results. During the 9 years of the study period there was a significant (P < 0.001) correlation between the steadily increasing antidepressant prescription (113%) and continuous decline in total national suicide rate (23%) as well as both in females and males (21 and 23%, respectively), but this relationship was 8-fold stronger in males. Increasing antidepressant utilization was associated with significantly decreased seasonality of suicides only among males. Conclusions. The results suggest that decreasing seasonality of suicides could be a good marker of lowering rate of depression-related suicides in the population particularly among males.

AB Objective: The choice of the suicide method is influenced by the individual's sex, age, cultural value system and the method's availability. Therefore, we studied the chosen method in relation to the investigated motive, age and sex. Method: The study included all residents of Middle Franconia, dying from suicide due to death certificate and police investigations. 2062 suicides were included. Data was categorized by method and underlying reason. Results: Women preferred self-poisoning and men predominantly chose hanging with the distribution changing with regard to the underlying motive, especially in suicide due to family distress and lovesickness. The association between method and underlying reason of suicide was highly significant (chi(2)-test, chi(2) = 268.5, p < 0.0001), in male (chi(2) = 166.7, p < 0.0001) and in female subjects (chi(2) = 132.7, p < 0.0001). Furthermore, there were differences regarding the suicide method concerning the age. Conclusions: Certain motives tended to be associated with some suicide methods, so that the means to commit suicide should be further taken into account in preventive as well as in therapeutic measures.

AB Outpatient visits for sleep-related difficulties and the rate of suicide in the United States have both increased by more than 20% since 1999. Research suggests that anywhere from 75% to 91% of suicide decedents had contact with a physician within the year prior to fatally attempting suicide. Although the prevalence of such contacts among sleep clinicians is unknown, it is important to note that sleep disturbances in general are both a risk factor and potential warning sign for suicide. Screening for suicide risk among sleep patients is recommended, especially among those with a history of psychiatric and chronic medical conditions. Using evidence-based screening tools, such as the Columbia suicide severity rating scale, when screening patients for suicide risk is recommended despite the need for more research on the efficacy of suicide screening. For sleep clinic professionals who do not have the time to comprehensively assess and manage suicide risk, they are encouraged to implement suicide prevention policies within their departments and clinics and to follow the best available evidence to inform these policies. A protocol for screening for suicide risk in sleep clinics is outlined along with triage and documentation recommendations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Significant research questions persist regarding the short- and long-term outcomes of Latina adolescents who attempt suicide. To address these limitations, we utilize an ecodevelopmental framework to identify potential factors that shape differential outcomes following a suicide attempt. Through an exploratory, longitudinal, qualitative research design, we investigate two research questions: How do trajectories of well-being vary among Latina teens after a suicide attempt? What risk and protective factors might contribute to different trajectories? We conducted qualitative interviews with 17 Latina participants living in predominantly low-income households in New York City. Interviews took place within the 6 months following their suicide attempts, and again, 12 months later. Analysis revealed three distinct trajectories after a suicide attempt: resilience, tenuous growth, and chronic stress. Our findings elucidate potential factors that contribute to resilience following a suicide attempt and underscore the importance of prevention and intervention programs that foster adolescents' connectivity across ecodevelopmental contexts.

AB In many motorized countries, inhalation of carbon monoxide from motor vehicle exhaust gas (MVEG) has been one of the leading methods of suicide. In some countries it remains so (e.g., Australia 16.0% of suicides in 2005). Relative to other methods it is a planned method and one often used by middle-aged males. The study provides a review of countermeasures aimed at restricting this method of suicide. The prevention measures identified were catalytic converters (introduced to reduce carbon monoxide for environmental reasons); in-cabin sensors; exhaust pipe modification; automatic idling stops; and helpline signage at suicide "hotspots." Catalytic converters are now in 90% of new vehicles worldwide and literature supports them being associated with a reduction in exhaust-gassing suicides. There remain, however, accounts of exhaust-gas fatalities in modem vehicles, whether accidentally or by suicide. These deaths and also crashes from fatigue could potentially be prevented by in-cabin multi-gas sensors, these having been developed to the prototype stage. Helpline signage at an exhaust-gassing suicide "hotspot" had some success in reducing suicides. The evidence on method substitution and whether a reduction in MVEG suicides causes a reduction in total suicides is inconsistent.

TI Homicide and suicide rates associated with implementation of the Brady
   Handgun Violence Prevention Act

DT Article
ID CRIME; CITY; LAWS
AB Context In February 1994, the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act established a nationwide requirement that licensed firearms dealers observe a waiting period and initiate a background check for handgun sales. The effects of this act have not been analyzed.
   Objective To determine whether implementation of the Brady Act was associated with reductions in homicide and suicide rates.
   Design and Setting Analysis of vital statistics data in the United States for 1985 through 1997 from the National Center for Health Statistics.
   Main Outcome Measures Total and firearm homicide and suicide rates per 100000 adults (greater than or equal to 21 years and greater than or equal to 55 years) and proportion of homicides and suicides resulting from firearms were calculated by state and year. Controlling for population age, race, poverty and income levels, urban residence, and alcohol consumption, the 32 "treatment" states directly affected by the Brady Act requirements were compared with the 18 "control" states and the District of Columbia, which had equivalent legislation already in place.
   Results Changes in rates of homicide and suicide for treatment and control states were not significantly different, except for firearm suicides among persons aged 55 years or older (-0.92 per 100000; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.43 to -0.42). This reduction in suicides for persons aged 55 years or older was much stronger in states that had instituted both waiting periods and background checks (-1.03 per 100000; 95% CI, -1.58 to -0.47) than in states that only changed background check requirements (-0.17 per 100000; 95% CI, -1.09 to 0.75),
   Conclusions Based on the assumption that the greatest reductions in fatal violence would be within states that were required to institute waiting periods and background checks, implementation of the Brady Act appears to have been associated with reductions in the firearm suicide rate for persons aged 55 years or older but not with reductions in homicide rates or overall suicide rates. However, the pattern of implementation of the Brady Act does not permit a reliable analysis of a potential effect of reductions in the flow of guns from treatment-state gun dealers into secondary markets.

   DIVORCE; SUPPORT
AB Suicide rates for adolescents have doubled since 1970 and tripled since 1960, even as rates for other age groups have declined. Using a Becker-type model of household production and consumption, we demonstrate conditions under which utility maximizing parents allocate time away from time-intensive commodities like children's well-being, and towards market work and less time-intensive consumption commodities. This reallocation of time towards market work has mixed effects on children' mental health: higher money income tends to improve family and children's wellbeing, but the loss of parental time has an opposite effect on children's mental health and increases the risk of adolescent suicide. Empirical evidence using state panel regressions of adolescent suicide rates on economic, social and demographic variables is consistent with predictions based on our model; our results indicate that the favorable effect of higher incomes has more than offset the negative effect of lost parental time.

AB BackgroundOur goal was to assess the prevalence of 9 different types of precipitating circumstances among suicide decedents, and examine the association between circumstances and postmortem blood alcohol concentration (BAC0.08g/dl) across U.S. ethnic groups.
   MethodsData come from the restricted 2003 to 2011 National Violent Death Reporting System, with postmortem information on 59,384 male and female suicide decedents for 17 U.S. states.
   ResultsAmong men, precipitating circumstances statistically associated with a BAC0.08g/dl were physical health and job problems for Blacks, and experiencing a crisis, physical health problems, and intimate partner problem for Hispanics. Among women, the only precipitating circumstance associated with a BAC0.08g/dl was substance abuse problems other than alcohol for Blacks. The number of precipitating circumstances present before the suicide was negatively associated with a BAC0.08g/dl for Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics.
   ConclusionsSelected precipitating circumstances were associated with a BAC0.08g/dl, and the strongest determinant of this level of alcohol intoxication prior to suicide among all ethnic groups was the presence of an alcohol problem.

AB Firearms account for half of all U.S. suicide deaths, but research on mechanisms through which firearms confer risk is limited. Although research has indicated firearm ownership and the unsafe storage of firearms are associated with an elevated risk of suicide, such research cannot provide insight into the extent to which a history of using a gun plays a role. We recruited a community sample (N = 100; 76% female; 44% Black) oversampled for prior suicidal behavior in a high gun ownership state (Mississippi). Consistent with hypotheses, a greater number of lifetime experiences of firing a gun were associated with elements of the capability for suicide (fearlessness about death, pain tolerance, pain persistence) and lifetime suicide attempts, but not with suicide ideation or simple pain detection. These findings indicate that guns may confer risk of suicide in part through increased comfort and aptitude with the weapon, a notion consistent with the construct of practical capability. Furthermore, these findings are consistent with research indicating that guns do not cause healthy individuals to become suicidal, but rather increase risk among already suicidal individuals. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of considering practical experience with guns as well as simple ownership and storage methods.

AB Research on homicides followed by suicides has relied heavily on small samples and relatively short time spans of data. This study helps to fill this gap by examining 26years of homicide-suicide data from Cuyahoga County, Ohio, between 1991 and 2016. The main data source for the study is medical examiner files. Analyses of the data indicate the rate of homicide-suicide in Cuyahoga County is consistent with other studies but fluctuates considerably across years studied. The majority of victims are female while perpetrators are overwhelmingly male. Black people are overrepresented as victims and offenders. Use of drugs and/or alcohol leading up to the incident is common among perpetrators. Both the homicides and suicides were overwhelming committed with firearms. When comparing our results to the typology of murder-suicides developed by Marzuk, Tardiff, and Hirsch (JAMA 1992;267:3179), we find amorous jealousy is a significant motivating factor in a many cases, including those involving nonintimate partners. Our findings underscore the importance of widespread use of lethality assessment instruments.

AB There is recent, although limited, evidence that among men the risk of death from suicide is strongly inversely related to body weight. An unanswered question is whether the reported association between relative body weight and suicide holds for men and women equally. This study aimed to determine the effects of body mass index on suicide risk among men and women in the United States. We analyzed data from the combined 1986-1994 National Health Interview Surveys linked to the 1986-2002 Multiple Cause of Death file through the National Death Index. Survival analysis indicated that for each 5 kg/m(2) increase in body mass index the risk of suicide decreased by 18% and 24%, for men and women, respectively. These findings may help us to better understand and prevent suicide. However, further research is needed to unpack the observed association between body weight and suicide risk into its component pathways and mechanisms.

AB For more than a decade, there has been an intense debate about the ethics and legality of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) in the United States.(1.5) In June 1997, the US Supreme Court unanimously ruled that there is neither a constitutional right nor a constitutional prohibition to euthanasia or PAS.(6,7) This permitted Oregon to experiment with legalizing PAS. During this decade, most other states have consistently opposed legalization. In the weeks after the US Supreme Court decision, the Florida Supreme Court also ruled that there is no constitutional right to PAS.(8) At least 7 state legislatures have voted to explicitly prohibit euthanasia and PAS.' Indeed, a bill to legalize euthanasia or PAS has been considered by a full chamber of a state legislature in only one state, Maine, and that bill was defeated 99 to 42.(10) In November 1998, 70% of the voters of Michigan resoundingly defeated a referendum to legalize PAS, while in November 2000 Maine voters also rejected legalizing PAS.(11)

AB Purpose: Suicide is a significant health problem internationally. Those who complete suicide may have different behaviors and risk factors than those who attempt a non-fatal suicide. The purpose of this article is to analyze the concept of suicide lethality and propose a clear definition of the concept through the identification of antecedents, attributes, and consequences. Methods: A literature search for articles published in the English language between 1970 and 2016 was conducted using MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Pubmed, Psychlit, Ovid, PsycINFO, and Proquest. The bibliographies of all included studies were also reviewed to identify additional relevant citations. A concept analysis was conducted on the literature findings using six stages of Walker and Avant's method. Findings: The concept analysis differentiated between suicide, lethality, suicidal behavior, and suicide lethality. Presence of a suicide plan or a written suicide note was not found to be associated with the majority of completed suicides included in the definition of suicide lethality. There are a few scales that measure the lethality of a suicide attempt, but none that attempt to measure the concept of suicide lethality as described in this analysis. Conclusions: Clarifying the concept of suicide lethality encourages awareness of the possibility of different suicidal behaviors associated with different suicide outcomes and will inform the development of future nursing interventions. A clearer definition of the concept of suicide lethality will guide clinical practice, research, and policy development aimed at suicide prevention.

AB American individuals attempt suicide at alarmingly high rates of approximately 1.1 million times per year. Yet the United States has failed to adopt a systematic approach to suicide prevention, particularly via universal screening. Given the increasing number of individuals with suicidal ideation presenting to emergency departments (EDs), all patients who present to the ED for treatment should be screened, as opposed to only individuals with mental health complaints. In the current article, barriers to suicide screening in the ED are discussed, as well as strategies to move ED providers toward the goal of universal screening. The current article entreats nurses to be leaders in achieving universal screening and provides practical actions to begin the process. Specific recommendations for action include improving training, increasing lethal means assessment, and achieving compliance with The Joint Commission suicide screening guidelines.

The results show a significant lag between the onset of marital fertility decline in the nation's northeastern census divisions and its onset in western and southern census divisions. Empirical models indicate the presence of cultural, economic, and legal impediments to the diffusion of marital fertility control and illustrate the need for more inclusive models of fertility decline.

AB Women's mortality due to violent deaths is a public health issue that has received national attention. Many data systems only collect death certificate data, which provide very limited information about the circumstances surrounding a violent death. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) is the first and only surveillance system to capture data from death certificates, coroner/medical examiner reports, and law enforcement reports allowing for a more comprehensive picture and targeted prevention efforts. The system currently operates in 40 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico; however, with additional funding from the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, this surveillance system will fully expand to cover all 50 states. A number of analyses have been conducted using NVDRS data to compare suicide and homicide among women with men; however, only a handful of studies have been conducted among subgroups of women. The present study provides an overview of NVDRS while highlighting a few key analytic studies with implications for suicide and homicide prevention/intervention among women. Data from the 2014 NVDRS Surveillance Summary are also presented to emphasize the unique opportunity to use NVDRS data to study the characteristics of suicide and homicide among women. The summary includes data from 18 states that were collected statewide. This information can provide state and local public health experts with essential data on female suicide and homicide, not provided in other surveillance systems, to help shape prevention and intervention efforts.

AB How can psychologists know which of the many variables in an individual's clinical presentation are most salient to that person's suicide risk? Such certainty requires an empirically validated prediction model that is specific to the population served. Data obtained through the U.S. Air Force (USAF) Office of Special Investigations and the USAF Institute for Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health Risk Analysis were analyzed using multivariate strategies of prediction based on an empirically validated model of suicide prediction (G.

TI Epidemiology of suicide and the impact on Western trauma centers

AB Background: Suicide represents the eleventh leading cause of death in the United States. Most suicides are a result of self-directed injury and are commonly treated in trauma centers. The purpose of this article is to characterize the epidemiology of suicide in the Western Mountain states and to describe the impact of these injuries on trauma centers.
   Methods: Data were accumulated from the National Trauma Data Bank, the American Association of Suicidology, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System. Variables analyzed included the epidemiology of suicide in relation to regional location, age, gender, mechanism of injury, mortality, disposition, Total Functional Independence Measure (TFIM) score, and length of stay in the intensive care unit versus the hospital floor. Statistical analysis was performed on select data points to demonstrate relative significance. Several comparisons were made among intentional injuries directed at oneself, at others, and unintentional injuries with respect to the above variables.
   Results: The Western region of the country has maintained the highest suicide rates since 1990, with 8 of the 10 Western Mountain states having rates twice as high as the national average. Approximately 88% of suicides presenting to trauma centers involve firearms, stabbings, or falls, usually causing injuries that lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Suicide attempts represent 2% of all admissions to trauma centers, with two thirds of these patient dying while in the hospital. Average length of stay in the intensive care unit and on hospital floors was 2.2 and 5.2 days, respectively, which was higher than the average length of stay of either unintentional injuries or intentional injuries directed at others.
   Conclusion: The Western Mountain states represent an endemic region for suicide. Because of the violent nature of these injuries, they often require significant medical care and finances usually provided by state governments. Suicides also contribute to the morbidity and mortality in a disproportionate manner in comparison with motor vehicle crashes and homicides. In conclusion, the Western region bears a larger burden than other regions in caring for this subset of patients with respect to medical and financial resources. Increased public awareness and preventative measures can aid in reducing not only the overall incidence of suicide but also the patient load and costs that are incurred on this country's health care system.

AB Objectives: Suicide during pregnancy and postpartum is a tragic event for the victim and profoundly impacts the baby, the family and the community. Prior efforts to study risks for pregnancy-associated suicide have been hampered by the lack of data sources which capture pregnancy and delivery status of victims. Introduction of the United States National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) offers new insights into violent deaths by linking multiple data sources and allowing better examination of psychosocial risk factors.
   Methods: The analysis used data from 17 states reporting to the NVDRS from 2003 to 2007 to,evaluate suicide patterns among pregnant, postpartum, and nonpregnant or postpartum women. Demographic factors, mental health status, substance use, precipitating circumstances, intimate partner problems and suicide methods were compared among groups.
   Results: The 2083 female suicide victims of reproductive age demonstrated high prevalence of existing mental health diagnosis and current depressed mood, with depressed mood significantly higher among postpartum women. Substance use and presence of other precipitating factors were high and similar among groups. Intimate partner problems were higher among pregnant and postpartum victims. Postpartum women were more likely to die via asphyxia as cause of death compared to poisoning or firearms.
   Conclusions: These findings describe important mental health, substance use and intimate partner problems seen with pregnancy-associated suicide. The study highlights mental health risk factors which could potentially be targeted for intervention in this vulnerable population. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: In the United States, suicide rates are highest among European American older adults. This phenomenon calls attention to cultural factors, specifically, the suicide beliefs and attitudes of European Americans. Beliefs and attitudes matter in the vulnerability to suicide. As predicted by cultural scripts of suicide theory, suicide is most likely among individuals and in communities where it is expected and is most acceptable. This study examined beliefs about the precipitants of, and protectors against older adult suicide, as well as suicide attitudes, in a predominantly European American community.
   Design and Methods: Two hundred and fifty-five older adults (86% European American) and 281 younger adults (81% European American) indicated what they thought were the most likely older adult suicide precipitants and protectors, and their opinion about older adult suicide, depending on precipitant.
   Results: Health problems were the most endorsed older adult suicide precipitants. Suicide precipitated by health problems was also rated most positively (e. g., rational, courageous). Older adults, persons with more education, and persons who did not identify with a religion expressed the most favorable attitudes about older adult suicide, across suicide precipitants. Men viewed older adult suicide as more admissible, and women, with more sympathy. Perceived suicide protectors included religiosity among older adults, and supportive relationships among younger adults.
   Conclusions: The belief, in this study's predominantly European American community, that older adult suicide is triggered by health problems, together with favorable attitudes about older adult suicide, suggest an enabling older adult suicide script, with implications for suicide risk and prevention.

AB The integration of spiritual and emotional health is key for the development of a comprehensive public health approach to suicide prevention. Faith communities play a unique and powerful role in shaping this integration. This case study investigated one United States-based, predominantly White Unitarian Universalist faith community's efforts in the development of promising practices for "upstream, midstream, and downstream" approaches to suicide prevention. Through a series of in-depth interviews with stakeholders (leadership, volunteers, family members with lived experience), response patterns were used to identify key strategies to promote mental health and prevent suicide. These key strategies include developing healthy social connectedness across one's life, finding ways to make meaning by connecting with something larger than oneself, and cultivating a community that is compassionate and knowledgeable when assisting its members through emotional crises.

Cases requiring emergency admission to intensive care were collected from medical records of the University Hospital in Messina (Italy) for the years 2006-2010. 107 cases of serious attempted suicide were examined, 39 of which ended in the death of the patient. The results showed the following variables to be linked highly significantly (P < 0.01) and have good nominal association (V > 0.30) with a fatal suicidal attempt: the year of the attempt, deceased father, history of physical illness prior to hospitalization and method used to carry out the suicide attempt. These results confirm the severity and the multidisciplinary importance of this phenomenon.

AB Theoretical and empirical literature suggests that nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) may represent a particularly important risk factor for suicide. The present study examined the associations of NSSI and established suicide risk factors to attempted suicide in four samples: adolescent psychiatric patients (n = 139), adolescent high school students (n = 426), university undergraduates (n = 1,364), and a random-digit dialing sample of United States adults (n = 438). All samples were administered measures of NSSI, suicide ideation, and suicide attempts; the first three samples were also administered measures of depression, anxiety, impulsivity, and borderline personality disorder (BPD). In all four samples, NSSI exhibited a robust relationship to attempted suicide (median Phi = .36). Only suicide ideation exhibited a stronger relationship to attempted suicide (median Phi = .47), whereas associations were smaller for BPD (median r(pb) = .29), depression (median r(pb) = .24), anxiety (median r(pb) = .16), and impulsivity (median r(pb) = .11). When these known suicide risk factors and NSSI were simultaneously entered into logistic regression analyses, only NSSI and suicide ideation maintained significant associations with attempted suicide. Results suggest that NSSI is an especially important risk factor for suicide. Findings are interpreted in the context of Joiner's interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide; specifically, NSSI may be a uniquely important risk factor for suicide because its presence is associated with both increased desire and capability for suicide.

AB Study Objectives: The purpose of the study was to examine whether insomnia symptoms and nightmares mediated the relation between alcohol use and suicide risk. Further, we examined whether this mediation was moderated by gender.
   Design: The study consisted of questionnaires administered online examining insomnia symptoms, nightmares, alcohol use, and suicide risk.
   Setting: University.
   Patients or Participants: 375 undergraduate students at a large, public university in the southeastern United States.
   Interventions: N/A.
   Measurements and Results: Results indicated that insomnia symptoms significantly mediated the relation between alcohol use and suicide risk; however, this mediation was moderated by gender. For women, there was both a direct effect of alcohol use on suicide risk as well as an indirect effect of alcohol use through insomnia symptoms increasing suicide risk. For men, there was no direct effect of alcohol use on suicide risk, but there was a significant indirect effect of alcohol use increasing suicide risk through insomnia symptoms. Nightmares were not related to alcohol use, and the association between nightmares and suicide risk was found to be independent of alcohol use
   Conclusions: Insomnia symptoms are an important factor in explaining the mechanism by which alcohol use increases suicide risk.

SO JOURNAL OF MIDDLE EAST WOMENS STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID MEDIA
AB Why do novels and studies originating in the United States and Europe sympathetically depict Middle Eastern women who commit or support forms of violence identified as terrorist? This article draws on scholarship on cosmopolitanism and the sentimental novel, as well as on novelistic and journalistic accounts of Palestinian female suicide bombers from the United States and Algeria/France: Barbara Victor's Army of Roses: Inside the World of Palestinian Suicide Bombers (Rodale, 2003) and Yasmina Khadra's The Attack (Doubleday, 2005). It argues that sentimental terror narratives use gendered, maternal imagery to produce a liberal stance on terrorism that combines sympathetic comprehension of the forces that foster violence with condemnation of the violence itself The article uses Syrian novelist Khaled Khalifa's Madih al-Karahiya (In Praise of Hatred, 2006) as an alternative literary depiction of gender and violence, aimed at a Syrian audience, that produces non-normative forms of sympathy to foster national reconciliation after civil conflict.

AB The relationship between ecstasy use and suicidal behavior among adolescents in the United States was examined. Data from the adolescent subsample (ages 12-17, N = 19,301) of the 2000 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse were used in the analyses. Information on adolescent substance use, suicidal behaviors, and related sociodemographic, family, and individual factors was obtained in the survey. The rate of past year suicide attempt among adolescents with lifetime ecstasy use was almost double that of adolescents who had used other drugs only, and nine times that of adolescents with no history of illicit drug use. In multinomial logistic regression analyses controlling for related factors, the effect of ecstasy use remained significant. Adolescent ecstasy users may require enhanced suicide prevention and intervention efforts.

AB Psychiatric disorders, which include substance use disorders, are known antecedents of suicidal behavior. The prevalence of suicidal ideation among those using alcohol ranges from 15 to 50%, which is similar to the prevalence rate among other substance users. For suicide attempts, prevalence estimates are upwards of 50% among adults using alcohol or other substances and 20% in substance-using adolescent populations. Injection drug use in particular appears to impart the greatest risk for both fatal and non-fatal suicidal acts. Data consistently demonstrate an association between alcohol and other drug use and both fatal and non-fatal suicidal behavior, including ideation, attempts and completed suicide.

AB The connection between the victim-offender relationship and injury patterns has been established in the lethal violence literature; however, this association has not been explored in the study of homicide followed by the perpetrator's suicide. Using data from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), we address this research gap by examining violence inflicted on 1,718 homicide-suicide victims that occurred between 2003 and 2013. Results show some support for variation in injury across intimacy and relationship status while considering victim and offender characteristics; however, results were not as predicted. Avenues for future research are discussed.

AB This study examined differences in three major risk areas associated with suicidality (suicidal ideation and suicide attempts) separately by gender: 1) substance use, 2) aggression/victimization, and 3) risky sexual behaviors. This study is a secondary data analysis of the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance (YRBS) survey, consisting of data collected from a nationally representative sample of high school students. Early alcohol onset, having had sex before age 13, injection drug use, and being forced to have sex were associated with suicidality across gender. Smoking in girls was associated with making a plan to attempt suicide and actual suicide attempts. Fighting was related to suicidality for girls, while fighting in school was related to suicidality for boys. The importance of examining risk factors for suicidality separately for boys and girls is discussed.

TI Age-period-cohort analysis of suicide mortality by gender among white

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH

AB Background: Previous studies suggested that the racial differences in U.S. suicide rates are decreasing, particularly for African Americans, but the cause behind the temporal variations has yet to be determined. This study aims to investigate the long-term trends in suicide mortality in the U.S. between 1983 and 2012 and to examine age-, period-, and cohort-specific effects by gender and race.
   Method: Suicide mortality data were collected from the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS) and analyzed with the Joinpoint regression and age-period-cohort (APC) analysis.
   Results: We found that although age-standardized rate of suicide in white males, white females, black males, and black females all changed at different degrees, the overall situation almost has not changed since these changes offset each other. By APC analysis, while the age effect on suicide demonstrate an obvious difference between white males and females (with the peak at 75 to 79 for white males and 45 to 54 for white females), young black people are predominantly susceptible to suicide (risk peaks in early 20s for black males and late 20s for black females). Cohort effects all showed a descending trend, except that in white males and females which showed an obvious increase peaked in around cohort 1960. There was a similar period effect trend between different genders in the same race group, but between the races, differences were found in the period before 1990 and after 2000.
   Conclusion: We confirmed that the distinction in age-specific suicide rate patterns does exist by gender and by race after controlling for period and cohort effects, which suggested that minorities' age patterns of suicide may have been masked up by the white people in the whole population. The differences of period effects and cohort effects between white and black Americans were likely to be mainly explained by the difference in race susceptibility to economic depression.

AB Adolescent suicide remains a major public health problem. Parenting behaviors can significantly impact the psychological well-being of youth. This study examined whether adolescent suicide differed based on specific parenting behaviors and whether the impact of such behaviors differed based on age of the adolescent. A secondary analysis of the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health was performed. Results indicated that adolescents who were female, older and who had parents who never/seldom performed authoritative parenting behaviors were at elevated risk for suicidal ideation, making a suicide plan and attempting suicide. The parenting behaviors placing adolescents at highest risk for all three suicide measures were never/seldom telling their children they were proud of them, never/seldom telling them they did a good job, and never/seldom helping them with their homework. The impact of these parenting behaviors on suicide was largest among younger adolescents (12-13 year olds). Results illustrate the critical importance of authoritative parenting in helping to protect adolescents from suicide. Findings may be beneficial to professionals aimed at developing efforts to prevent adolescent suicide. Parents should be educated on authoritative parenting and specific behaviors they can perform to protect youth against suicide.

AB Importance Suicide is a leading cause of death among youths. The relationship between mental health, psychosocial factors and youth suicidality needs further analysis.
   Objective To describe paediatric suicide in the USA and the impact of mental health and substance abuse using the National Child Death Review Case Reporting System (CDR-CRS). To identify psychosocial correlates contributing to suicide and whether these factors are more common among individuals with history of mental illness or substance abuse.
   Design Deidentified data (CDR-CRS) from 2004 to 2012 was obtained from 29 participating states. Demographic data and psychosocial correlates, including age, gender, cause of death, history of mental illness and/or substance abuse, school concerns, previous suicide attempts and family history of suicide, were collected.
   Results A total of 2850 suicides were identified. Mean age was 15.6 +/- 1.9 years; (range 7-21 years) 73.6% male and 65.1% Caucasian. The leading causes of death were asphyxia (50.2%) and weapon/firearm (36.5%). Among all subjects, 25.5% had history of mental illness and 19.0% had history of substance abuse. 60.0% had no report of mental illness or substance abuse. Subjects with both mental illness and substance abuse were more likely to have school concerns (OR=4.1 (p<0.001)), previous suicide attempts (OR=4.2 (p<0.001)) and a family history of suicide (OR=3.2 (p<0.001)) compared with subjects without those characteristics.
   Conclusions Most suicide records in the CDR-CRS had no indication of mental illness or substance abuse. The youth with mental-illness/substance-abuse issues were more likely to have other compounding psychosocial correlates that may be warning signs of suicide.

AB Support groups for suicide survivors (those individuals bereaved following a suicide) are widely used, but little research evidence is available to determine their efficacy. This paper outlines the pressing public health need to conduct research and determine effective ways to identify and meet the needs of suicide survivors, particularly through survivor support groups. After describing the various approaches to survivor support groups, we explain the need for further research, despite the inherent challenges. Finally, we pose several questions for researchers to consider as they work with survivors to develop a research agenda that sheds more light on the experiences of survivors and the help provided by survivor support groups.

Data include 459 violent deaths (homicides, suicides, and accidents) autopsy reports written by more than 20 death certifiers from four medico-legal institutions in two countries (France and the United States). Multinomial models show that compared with accidental deaths, weapon use and decedents' characteristics both influence a homicide verdict, but not a suicide one. In addition, French practitioners are more likely than Americans to reach a conclusion of homicide or suicide compared with accident, and homicides are more likely to be certified by male practitioners.

ID CHRONIC TRAUMATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; TABLE ANALYSIS SYSTEM; BRAIN-INJURY;
   RISK; DEPRESSION; CONCUSSION
AB Background: There is current disagreement in the scientific literature about the relationship between playing football and suicide risk, particularly among professional players in the National Football League (NFL). While some research indicates players are at high risk of football-related concussions, which may lead to chronic traumatic encephalopathy and suicide, other research finds such a connection to be speculative and unsupported by methodologically sound research.
   Purpose: To compare the suicide mortality of a cohort of NFL players to what would be expected in the general population of the United States.
   Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.
   Methods: A cohort of 3439 NFL players with at least 5 credited playing seasons between 1959 and 1988 was assembled for statistical analysis. The vital status for this cohort was updated through 2013. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), the ratio of observed deaths to expected deaths, and 95% CIs were computed for the cohort; 95% CIs that excluded unity were considered statistically significant. For internal comparison purposes, standardized rate ratios were calculated to compare mortality results between players stratified into speed and nonspeed position types.
   Results: Suicide among this cohort of professional football players was significantly less than would be expected in comparison with the United States population (SMR = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.24-0.82). There were no significant differences in suicide mortality between speed and nonspeed position players.
   Conclusion: There is no indication of elevated suicide risk in this cohort of professional football players with 5 or more credited seasons of play. Because of the unique nature of this cohort, these study results may not be applicable to professional football players who played fewer than 5 years or to college or high school players.

TI Suicide Disclosure in Suicide Attempt Survivors: Does Family Reaction
   Moderate or Mediate Disclosure's Effect on Depression?
SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
ID STIGMA; PREVENTION; PRODUCT
AB Existing literature has found a link between disclosure of a stigmatized identity and improved mental health; however, research on the impact of suicide disclosure to family members is scarce. Suicide attempt survivors (n=74) in the United States were examined to assess whether family reaction moderates or mediates the relationship between suicide disclosure and subsequent depression symptoms. Family reaction did not moderate but did mediate the relationship between disclosure and depression symptoms while controlling for time since most recent attempt. Higher rates of disclosure predicted more positive family reactions, which in turn predicted less severe depression symptoms. Findings indicate that family members can play an essential role in the recovery process after an attempt occurs, which has important implications for both researchers and clinicians who seek to decrease stigma for attempt survivors while simultaneously decreasing the likelihood of future attempts.

AB Parental divorce during childhood is associated with an increased risk of suicide attempts for male but not female offspring. This study examines whether parental remarriage has a differential effect on suicide risk for male and female adult offspring. Using the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), the sample consists of respondents who experienced parental divorce (N = 6,436). Multivariable regressions were estimated. Females who lived with a stepparent were significantly more likely to report a lifetime suicide attempt compared with females who had not. Clinicians should note that female depressed patients who have a history of childhood parental divorce and remarriage may be at more risk for suicide attempt than previously recognized.

AB The World Health Organization (WHO) provides annual mortality statistics from 1950 onward based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). In this paper we evaluate the effects of ICD form revisions on suicide rates for 71 countries. The changes between ICD-6, ICD-7, ICD-8, and ICD-9 did not have an overall effect on reported suicide rates. The transitions to ICD-8 and ICD-9 were, however, associated with country-specific changes in the suicide rate in some countries. The change from ICD-9 to ICD-10 was associated with an overall change of -.73 suicides per 100,000 inhabitants. It is recommended that researchers using the WHO mortality data for longitudinal cross-national studies control for the ICD form used at different time points.

AB Suicide is the fifth-leading cause of death in Korea, accounting for 4.4% of all deaths. Therefore, suicide is a serious medical problem, as well as a social problem. In this paper, we provide a social psychiatric perspective on suicide and recommend suicide prevention strategies based on programs with roots in the Gwangju mental health pilot project and an analysis of suicide patterns in Seoul. First, early intervention and active case management are mandatory to prevent suicide among individuals with mental illnesses such as depression, schizophrenia, and alcohol use disorder. To this end, mental health and welfare centers, addiction management centers, suicide prevention centers, and care program after a suicide attempt in the emergency department of general hospitals should collaborate via a multidisciplinary approach. Second, crisis intervention should be provided in collaboration with the police, government officials, and mental health agencies to people who are at immediate risk of suicide. Additionally, case management services should be expanded for individuals who are treated at hospitals for psychiatric illness. Third, social welfare services should be offered to low-income individuals at risk of suicide. Fourth, the mass media should restrict reporting about suicide and follow the relevant reporting guidelines. Finally, access to methods of committing suicide, such as charcoal for burning and agrichemical poisoning, should be regulated by the government. Proactive psychosocial strategies implemented with government support will prevent suicide-related deaths and decrease the suicide rate in Korea.

AB This review examines the literature during the past 10 years about suicide risk and suicide during adolescence and young adulthood of individuals with eating disorders. Epidemiological surveys are summarized, including suicide rates, parasuicidal behaviors, associated risk factors, and comorbid psychopathology. Critical implications for the comprehensive assessment and treatment planning, including safety considerations, are discussed. Two clinical cases of women with long-standing eating disorders are described to highlight both the pragmatic considerations and the complex clinical challenges of working with patients with eating disorders who become suicidal. The potentially life-threatening issues of safety have not received sufficient attention, neither in the medical literature nor by the treating clinicians. All health care professionals who are treating patients with an eating disorder must be keenly aware of the serious risks of suicidal behavior and of suicide in this population.

AB Homicide followed by suicide (H-S) is a lethal event in which an individual kills another individual and subsequently dies by suicide. This article presents a review of research carried out in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, and the United States of America over the past 60 years on the prevalence of mental illness among the perpetrators of H-S. Analysis of the available data indicated a great disparity in the results of the different studies. Overall, depression was the most frequent disorder reported (about 39% of the cases in the 20 studies that assessed depressive disorders), followed by substance abuse (about 20% in 10 studies) and psychosis (about 17% in 11 studies). This review, therefore, indicated that mental illness plays an important role in H-S. The prevention of these events depends on the identification and treatment of psychiatric disorder in potential perpetrators. J Am Acad Psychiatry Law 40:462-8, 2012

AB Objectives. We sought to report clinical and demographic factors associated with suicide among depressed veterans in an attempt to determine what characteristics identified depressed veterans at high risk for suicide.
   Methods. We used longitudinal, nationally representative data (1999-2004) to determine suicide rates among depressed veterans, estimating time until suicide using Cox proportional hazards regression models.
   Results. Of 807 694 veterans meeting study criteria, 1683 (0.21%) committed suicide during follow-up. Increased suicide risks were observed among male, younger, and non-Hispanic White patients. Veterans without service-connected disabilities, with inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations in the year prior to their qualifying depression diagnosis, with comorbid substance use, and living in the southern or western United States were also at higher risk. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with comorbid depression was associated with lower suicide rates, and younger depressed veterans with PTSD had a higher suicide rate than did older depressed veterans with PTSD.
   Conclusions. Unlike the general population, older and younger veterans are more prone to suicide than are middle-aged veterans. Future research should examine the relationship between depression, PTSD, health service use, and suicide risks among veterans.

ID MENTAL-ILLNESS; COVERAGE; NEWS
AB Background: Evidence suggests that suicide mortality increases after high-profile suicide deaths. Indeed, suicide in the United States increased disproportionately after the suicide by suffocation of well-known comedian Robin Williams in August 2014. Such increases are often attributed to irresponsible media coverage of the suicide contributing to "copycat suicides." However, recent research indicates that the mainstream Canadian media have significantly improved their suicide coverage, with high fidelity to suicide reporting guidelines after Williams' death. As such, the aim of the present study is to examine suicide mortality in Canada after Robin Williams' suicide. Methods: We obtained deidentified monthly suicide count data from January 1999 to December 2015 stratified by age, sex, and method of suicide from Statistics Canada. We used time-series analyses to estimate the expected number of suicides in the months following Robin Williams' death. This was done using a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving averages (SARIMA) method. Expected suicides were then compared with observed suicides. Results: August 2014 was the month with the highest number of suicides from 2010 to 2015. The time-series model indicated a 16% increase in the expected number of suicides during the months from August to December 2014 inclusive. Moreover, males over 30 had the greatest number of excess suicides, and suicides by suffocation (the method used by Robin Williams) were also higher in August and the following months. Interpretation: Suicides increased in Canada after Robin Williams' death, despite the improved mainstream media coverage witnessed in other studies. Other factors (e.g., social and alternative media) may have contributed to the observed increase in suicide.

AB The US State Department increasingly relies on efforts of public diplomacy to improve America's image abroad. We test the theoretical efficacy of these efforts through an experiment. Participants were recruited in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. All but those participants randomly assigned to a control group read a quote about religious tolerance and pluralism in the United States. We varied the attribution of this quote to President Bush, to an unnamed US Ambassador, to an ordinary American, or to no one. We then asked respondents a battery of questions about their opinions of the United States before and after a long discussion with other participants about the United States. We find that the identity of the messenger matters, as those who read the quote attributed to Bush tended to have lower opinions of the United States. After the discussion, these views partially dissipated. Post-discussion views were more heavily influenced by how other participants viewed the United States. After controlling for the source and location of the discussion, when the discussion took place among people with more positive initial views of the United States, views of the United States improved. However, when there was a large range of views in the discussion, post-discussion views of the United States were relatively worse. Based on this study, we suggest new directions for the conduct of public diplomacy.

AB Suicide, due to its increased occurrence in recent years, has been a chief concern of the U.S. military. While there have been many published studies on the topic, conspicuously absent are studies that have included reserve military personnel. To fill this gap, this study reports descriptive statistics of personnel information and events surrounding 706 Army National Guard suicides that had occurred from 2007 through 2014. Comparative personnel information for random samples of nonsuicides for similar years (8years, 1,000 cases per year) allowed examining factors associated most with suicide. Findings were very similar to those observed in the active duty Army and civilian populations. Primary risk factors for suicide were as follows: age (young), gender (male), and race/ethnicity (White). Most suicides occurred in nonmilitary status (86%) involving personal firearms (72%). Most frequent events surrounding the suicide were as follows: poor military performance (36% of all suicides), parent-family relationship problems (28%), substance abuse (27%), past behavioral health problem (20%), current behavioral health problems (10%), income problems (22%), and full-time employment problems (18%). Implications of findings for suicide prevention are discussed.

AB Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3 beta) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders and schizophrenia. To examine its role in suicide, we determined GSK-3 beta messenger RNA (mRNA) in human postmortem brain from suicide and normal control subjects using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. We found that GSK-3 beta mRNA was highly abundant in almost all of the 12 brain areas we studied. We also found a significant age effect on GSK-3 beta and that GSK-3 beta mRNA level were significantly higher in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus of teenage normal controls compared with adult normal controls and was significantly decreased in PFC of teenage suicide but not adult suicide victims compared with respective normal control subjects. The decrease observed in the mRNA levels in teenage suicide but not in adult suicide victims may represent a neurodevelopmentally associated decrease and may be important in the pathophysiology of teenage suicide.

AB Murder-suicide is a relatively rare event, and familicide is rarer still. However, it is certainly not unknown, and has been described in the scientific literature from both a socio-criminological and pathological-forensic perspective since the last century. In a civilized urban area such as Milan and province, where there is a general reduction in the homicide rate, homicide-suicide occurs almost exclusively within the family, and has specific features that differentiate it from other types of homicide, whether connected with general criminality or organized crime. This article analyses the quantitative and qualitative features of cases of homicide-suicide occurring in Milan and province between 1990 and 2009 (20 years), considering temporal aspects and the development of the events, the weapons used, and the epidemiological and psychopathological features of the perpetrators and their victims.

AB This exploratory study seeks to better understand the link between peer-related violence (perpetration and victimization) and suicide risk among youth. The study uses data gathered from Arizona, Nevada, and Wyoming, where the highest rates of adolescent suicide in the United States are found. The data derive from in-school surveys of eighth-grade students conducted during 1998 and 1999. Higher levels of reported suicide risk were prominent among the multiethnic, urban, and female respondents. Male and female respondents who perpetrated violence by initiating fights, threatening to use weapons, and using weapons to assault others were more likely to be classified in the high-risk suicide group than those who did not. General results were similar for victims and those witnessing violence. Implications for prevention programming and future research are discussed.

AB There is now a substantial literature on risk factors for suicide across the life course. Therefore, it is essential to extend this knowledge by considering more fully which age- and gender-specific groups bear the greatest public health burden owing to suicide and its antecedents. With this in mind, suicide mortality rates alone may not sufficiently inform U.S. policy makers who must distribute scarce suicide prevention resources.
   We compared age- and gender-specific mortality rates, age- and gender-specific estimates of years of potential life lost, and age- and gender-specific present value of lost earnings that individuals would have contributed to society had they lived to their full life expectancies.
   Men in the middle years of life contribute disproportionately to the public health burden because of completed suicide. The substantial burden evident in this group has not translated into a public health priority.

AB Evidence on the relationship between income inequality and suicide is inconsistent. Data from the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for all fatal injuries was collected to conduct a multilevel case-control study. In multilevel models, suicide decedents (n = 374) were more likely than accident controls (n = 45 3) to reside in neighborhoods with greater income inequality even after controlling for individual characteristics; this relation was modified by age with an effect overall and among decedents aged 15-34 but not among decedents 35-64. These data suggest that income inequality may contribute to the risk of suicide in younger adults.

AB Background: Theory is the foundation of science; this is true in suicidology. Over decades of studies of suicide notes, Leenaars developed a multidimensional model of suicide, with international (crosscultural) studies and independent verification. Aim: To corroborate Leenaars's theory with a psychological autopsy (PA) study, examining age and sex of the decedent, and survivor's relationship to deceased. Method: A PA study in Norway, with 120 survivors/informants was undertaken. Leenaars theoretical-conceptual (protocol) analysis was undertaken of the survivors' narratives and in-depth interviews combined. Results: Substantial interjudge reliability was noted (K = .632). Overall, there was considerable confirmatory evidence of Leenaars's intrapsychic and interpersonal factors in suicide survivors' narratives. Differences were found in the age of the decedent, but not in sex, nor in the survivor's closeness of the relationship. Older deceased people were perceived to exhibit more heightened unbearable intrapsychic pain, associated with the suicide. Conclusion: Leenaars's theory has corroborative verification, through the decedents' suicide notes and the survivors' narratives. However, the multidimensional model needs further testing to develop a better evidence-based way of understanding suicide.

AB Suicide rates among American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) young people are significantly higher than other ethnic groups in the United States. Not only are there great differences when comparing AI/AN rates and those of other Americans, some tribal groups have very low rates of suicide while other Native communities have much higher rates. Despite this obvious variability, there is little research to help understand the factors associated with these differences. The current study considers the correlates of suicidal behavior in one rural Alaska Native region that suffers disproportionately from suicide. The analysis describes suicide behavior between the years 2001-2009, and considers the characteristics associated with both suicide deaths and nonfatal suicidal behavior. In multivariate analyses we identified gender, method of suicide and history of previous attempt as significant predictors of fatal suicide behavior, similar to results obtained from analyses on the same community's data from the previous decade. This descriptive study can offer some insights to shape prevention efforts in this and other rural, tribal communities.

ID RISK; BEHAVIOR; CARE
AB In the United States, suicide increased by 24% in the past 20 years, and suicide risk identification at point-of-care remains a cornerstone of the effort to curb this epidemic (1). As risk identification is difficult because of symptom under-reporting, timing, or lack of screening, healthcare systems rely increasingly on risk scoring and now artificial intelligence (Al) to assess risk. Al remains the science of solving problems and accomplishing tasks, through automated or computational means, that normally require human intelligence. This science is decades-old and includes traditional predictive statistics and machine learning. Only in the last few years has it been applied rigorously in suicide risk prediction and prevention. Applying Al in this context raises significant ethical concern, particularly in balancing beneficence and respecting personal autonomy. To navigate the ethical issues raised by suicide risk prediction, we provide recommendations in three areas-communication, consent, and controls-for both providers and researchers (2).

AB Suicide rates among American Indian youth in the United States are two to three times the national average. Risk factors for American Indian youth include depression, alcohol use, hopelessness and stress, and family conflict, abuse, poverty, and instability In this descriptive study, the authors aimed to obtain parents' and elders' perspectives on community needs and to identify strengths on which the community might build to reduce youth suicide risk. Data were collected from focus groups with 40 American Indian parents and from individual interviews with 9 American Indian elders. The major task participants addressed was holding the family together and healing intergenerational pains. Topics parents discussed were holding onto cultural values, holding the family together getting through school, and getting a job. These findings substantiate previous research and provide useful information for the design of culturally appropriate family or community-based interventions to prevent American Indian youth suicide.

AB More than 36,000 people in the United States die from suicide annually, and suicide is the third leading cause of death in adolescence. Adolescence is a time of high risk for suicidal behavior, as well as a time that intervention and treatment may have the greatest impact because of structural brain changes and significant psychosocial development during this period. Functional and structural neuroimaging studies in adults who have attempted suicide suggest distinct gray matter volume abnormalities in cortical regions, as well as prefrontal cortical and dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus neural circuitry differences compared with affective and healthy adult controls. Recent functional neuroimaging studies in adolescents with a history of suicide attempt suggest differences in the attention and salience networks compared with adolescents with depression and no history of suicide attempt and healthy controls when viewing angry faces. In contrast, no abnormalities are seen in these areas in the absence of emotional stimuli. These networks may represent promising targets for future neuroimaging studies to identify markers of risk for future suicide attempt in adolescents.

AB Background: Clinician training deficits and a low and declining autopsy rate adversely impact the quality of death certificates in the United States. Self-report and records data for the general population indicate that proximate mental and physical health of minority suicides was at least as poor as that of white suicides.
   Methods: This cross-sectional mortality study uses data from Multiple Cause-of-Death (MCOD) public use files for 1999-2003 to describe and evaluate comorbidity among black, Hispanic, and white suicides. Unintentional injury decedents are the referent for multivariate analyses.
   Results: One or more mentions of comorbid psychopathology are documented on the death certificates of 8% of white male suicides compared to 4% and 3% of black and Hispanic counterparts, respectively. Corresponding female figures are 10%, 8%, and 6%. Racial-ethnic discrepancies in the prevalence of comorbid physical disease are more attenuated. Cross-validation with National Violent Death Reporting System data reveals high relative underenumeration of comorbid depression/mood disorders and high relative overenumeration of schizophrenia on the death certificates of both minorities. In all three racial-ethnic groups, suicide is positively associated with depression/mood disorders [whites: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 31.9, 95% CI = 29.80-34.13; blacks: AOR = 60.9, 95% CI = 42.80-86.63; Hispanics: AOR = 34.7, 95% CI = 23.36-51.62] and schizophrenia [whites: AOR = 2.4, 95% CI = 2.07-2.86; blacks: AOR = 4.2, 95% CI = 2.73-6.37; Hispanics: AOR = 4.1, 95% CI = 2.01-8.22]. Suicide is positively associated with cancer in whites [AOR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.69-1.93] and blacks [AOR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.36-2.48], but not with HIV or alcohol and other substance use disorders in any group under review.
   Conclusion: The multivariate analyses indicate high consistency in predicting suicide-associated comorbidities across racial-ethnic groups using MCOD data. However, low prevalence of documented comorbid psychopathology in suicides, and concomitant racial-ethnic discrepancies underscore the need for training in death certification, and routinization and standardization of timely psychological autopsies in all cases of suicide, suspected suicide, and other traumatic deaths of equivocal cause.

AB The objectives of this study were to identify the gender-specific prevalence of suicide attempts among those with migraine and to examine what factors are associated with suicide attempts among migraineurs. This study was a nationally representative analysis of the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey - Mental Health (CCHS-MH) with 21,744 respondents, of whom 2,223 had migraine. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were conducted. Those with migraine had a much higher prevalence of ever attempting suicide than those without migraine (men: 7.5% vs 1.9%; women; 9.3% vs 2.7%, p < .001). Among migraineurs, the odds of suicide attempts were higher among poorer respondents, those in chronic pain and those with a history of childhood adversities, substance dependence and/or mental illness. Targeted out-reach is needed to reduce suicidality in this vulnerable population.

AB Studies of inpatient suicide attempts and completions on medical-surgical and intensive care units are rare, and there are no large studies in the United States. We reviewed 50 cases, including 45 suicide attempts and 5 completed suicides, that occurred on medical surgical or intensive care units in the Veterans Health Administration between December 1, 1999 and December 31, 2012. The method, location, and the root causes of the events were categorized. The most common methods included cutting with a sharp object, followed by overdose and hanging. Root causes included problems with communication of risk, need for staff education in suicide assessment, and the need for better treatment for depressed and suicidal patients on medical units. Based on these results, we made our recommendations for managing suicidal patients on medical-surgical and intensive care units, including improved education for staff, standardized communication about suicide risk, and clear management protocols for suicidal patients.

AB In this article, Professor McClurg makes the case for mandatory safe gun storage laws as a means of reducing adolescent suicides. He has argued in other articles in favor of safe storage as a means of reducing accidental shootings and criminal misuse of stolen guns. The article begins by analyzing firearms suicides in the U.S., which McClurg calls "the forgotten statistic in the gun control debate." He reviews numerous studies establishing a nexus between guns and suicide, particularly between guns in the home and adolescent suicide. He then examines ten different studies showing that large percentages of American gun owners engage in unsafe firearm storage practices. He concludes by calling for the passage of safe storage laws similar to those enacted in Australia and Canada as a way to reduce gun tragedies of all types-especially adolescent suicides-resulting from unauthorized users gaining access to unsecured guns.

AB Introduction: Suicide is the 11th leading cause of death in the United States. The objective of this study is to document the characteristics of aviation-related suicides and suicide attempts. Methods: Aviation accidents reported by the National Transportation Safety Board between 1983 and 2003 were screened for cases in which suicide was listed as a probable cause. For each suicide case, two accidents were randomly selected as controls, matched on sex of pilot, type of flight, state, and year of occurrence.,Mantel-Haenszel summary Chi-square tests were used to compare cases to controls. Conditional logistic regression modeling was performed to assess the association of pilot and flight characteristics with suicide.-related crashes. Results: During the 21-yr study period, 37 pilots committed or attempted suicide by aircraft, with 36 resulting in at least one fatality. All the cases were men and involved general aviation flights. Toxicological test results revealed that 24% of the cases had used alcohol and 14% had used other illicit drugs. Underlying factors included domestic and social problems (46%), legal trouble (40%), and pre-existing psychiatric conditions (38%). Compared with controls, suicide cases involved younger pilots (p < 0.05), were less likely to have another occupant (p < 0.0001), were more destructive to the aircraft (p < 0.0001), and were more likely to have occurred away from the airport (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Aviation crashes caused by suicide differ from unintentional aviation accidents in pilot characteristics, crash circumstances, and outcomes.

AB This study integrates, refines, and updates previous findings pertaining to positive ecologic (population-level) associations between intelligence and suicide prevalence across nations by using corrected and revised national IQ estimates and, further, a quality-of-human-conditions index, both recently published by Lynn and Vanhanen. Across a global 85-nation sample of sex-specific total suicide rates and a Eurasian 48-nation sample of sex-specific elderly suicide rates, these were positively associated with updated national IQ estimates. The associations were stronger for the general population than for elderly persons, independent of the quality of human conditions, and notedly stronger in exponential fitting of suicide rates with national IQ than in linear fitting, thereby indicating that shifts or differences in national IQ correspond to proportional, not absolute, changes in suicide rates. Implications of these findings and the question of generalizability of such associations to the individual level are discussed.

AB ObjectiveThis article investigates the role of social context on individual suicide mortality with attention paid to the possibility that contextual effects are simply the sum of individual characteristics associated with suicide.
   MethodsWe use restricted data from the 1986-2006 National Health Interview Survey-Linked Mortality Files, which include nearly 1 million records and 1,300 suicides, to examine the role of familial and socioeconomic context on adult suicide.
   ResultsResults show that adults living in cities with more socioeconomic disadvantage and fewer families living together have higher odds of suicidal death than adults living in less disadvantaged cities and cities with more families living together, respectively, after controlling for individual-level socioeconomic status, marital status, and family size.
   ConclusionThe findings support classic sociological arguments that the risk of suicide is indeed influenced by the social milieu and cannot simply be explained by the aggregation of individual characteristics.

AB Suicide is a major mental health problem in the United States and an issue that significantly impacts the mental health treatment community. Although the suicide rate remains relatively stable, the discipline of counseling psychology has broadened in scope and work settings have diversified. Thus, counseling psychology trainees are increasingly exposed to suicidal clients. Despite this reality research suggests that comprehensive, systematic training in suicidology in counseling psychology programs rarely occurs. One reason for this slate of affairs may be that the suicide literature is spread across a variety of disciplines, making it difficult for educators and practitioners to stay informed about the knowledge base in suicidology. The purpose of this contribution, therefore, is to provide counseling psychology educators and practitioners with an overview of the field of suicidology as it applies to the training and practice of counseling psychology.

AB Objective: To examine age, period and cohort effects on Australian suicide rates.
   Method: Male suicide rates for successive 5-year periods between 1919 and 1998, and for 1999 were displayed graphically to examine interactions between age, period and cohort effects.
   Results: There has been a pronounced period effect on male suicide rates in all age groups over the last few decades, with lower rates in wartime and peak rates for most cohorts in the 1960s. Peak rates of all adult female 5-year age cohorts occurred in the 1960s or early 1970s.
   Conclusion: Most so-called cohort effects appear to be associated with environmental changes that may not be a function of the cohort itself. While much attention has focused on the rising suicide rates in young males in Australia, local media and health authorities have given little emphasis to the high rates found in elderly males.

AB Colleges and universities are increasingly recognizing the need to expand suicide-prevention efforts beyond the standard, clinical-intervention paradigm of suicide prevention, which relies on referral to, and treatment by, mental health services. These services frequently struggle, however, to provide effective, comprehensive care. After reviewing findings that support the need to adopt a broader, problem-focused paradigm, the article provides a framework for bridging this paradigm with the clinical-intervention approach and for conceptualizing a full continuum of preventive interventions. For each level of intervention (ranging from the individual to the ecological), we describe the goals and methods used, and provide examples to illustrate the role of psychiatrists and other campus mental health providers in the collaborative partnerships that must form to support a comprehensive, campus-wide suicide-prevention strategy.

AB Youth suicide is a serious public health issue in the United States. It is currently the third leading cause of death for youth aged 10 to 19. School-based prevention programs may be an effective method of educating youth and enhancing their help-seeking. Most school-based suicide prevention programs have not been rigorously evaluated for their effectiveness. This evaluation employs a comparison group to measure whether program group participants differed significantly from comparison group participants on pretest-posttest measures while assessing the immediate impact of the Surviving the Teens (R) Suicide Prevention and Depression Awareness Program. Findings indicate several positive outcomes in program group students' suicide and depression knowledge, attitudes, confidence, and behavioral intentions compared with the comparison group. Suicide prevention specialists and prevention planners may benefit from study findings.

   UNITED-STATES; FATALITIES; INCIDENTS; DEATHS
AB BACKGROUND: This is a systematic review of suicide and homicide-suicide events involving aircraft. In aeromedical literature and in the media, these very different events are both described as pilot suicide, but in psychiatry they are considered separate events with distinct risk factors.
   METHODS: Medical databases, internet search engines, and aviation safety databases were searched in a systematic way to obtain relevant cases. Relevant articles were searched for additional references.
   RESULTS: There were 65 cases of pilot suicide and 6 cases of passengers who jumped from aircraft found. There were also 18 cases of homicide-suicide found involving 732 deaths. Pilots perpetrated 13 homicide-suicide events. Compared to non aviation samples, a large percentage of pilot suicides in this study were homicide-suicides (17%).
   DISCUSSION: Homicide-suicide events occur extremely rarely. However, their, impact in terms of the proportion of deaths is significant when compared to deaths from accidents. There is evidence of clustering where pilot suicides occur after by media reports of suicide or homicide-suicide. Five of six homicide-suicide events by pilots of commercial airliners occurred after they were left alone in the cockpit. This, along with a sixth incident in which active intervention by a Japan Air crew saved 147 lives, suggests that having two flight members in the cockpit is potentially protective. No single factor was associated with the risk for suicide or homicide-suicide. Factors associated with both events included legal and financial crises, occupational conflict, mental illness, and relationship stressors. Drugs and/or alcohol played a role in almost half of suicides, but not in homicide-suicides.

ID GREAT RECESSION; UNEMPLOYMENT; MORTALITY; RATES; IMPACT; COUNTRIES
AB While the subsequent persistence of suicide after an economic shock has received much attention among economists, no study has investigated the persistence of suicide through the concept of persistence in macroeconomic theory. This study employed the quantile structural breaks tests to identify possible structural changes in various suicide rates under the framework of the repeat cross-sectional quantile regression model in the US over the period from January 1999 to December 2013 for the first time. Together with the QAR-based unit root test, we found that positive shocks have significant impacts on various suicide rates, and the persistence of suicide was confirmed for all suicide rates in some pre-specified quantiles except for the suicide rate of the middle age (aged 35-54) group. Specifically, the persistence of suicide was identified in the lower quantiles for the overall suicide rate and the suicide rate of the middle-old age (aged 55-64) group. There exists persistence of suicide in the two tails of quantiles for the suicide rates of the young (aged 15-34) and the elderly (aged 65 and older) groups. The surveillance system established for suicide prevention should target the middle-old age (aged 55-64) group during economic downturn periods and target the young (aged 15-34) and the elderly (aged 65 or older) groups during periods from economic downturns to recessions.

AB Objectives. We compared the prevalence of risk factors for Black and White suicide decedents in Fulton County, Georgia, from 1988-2002.
   Methods. We used data from the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office to compile information on suicides that occurred in Fulton County between 1988 and 2002. We used the chi(2) test and logistic regression to identify associations between suicide risk factors and race.
   Results. Black suicide decedents were more likely than White suicide decedents to be male (odds ratio [OR] = 2.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.38, 3.09), to be younger, (<= 24 y [OR=4.74; 95% CI=2.88, 7.81]; 25-34 y [OR=2.79; 95% CI = 1.74, 4.471; 35-44 y [OR 1.86; 95% CI = 1.13, 3.071), and to hurt others in a suicide (OR = 4.22; 95% CI 1.60, 11.15) but less likely to report depression (OR=0.63; 95% CI = 0.48, 0.83), to have a family history of suicide (OR=0.08; 95% CI = 0.01, 0.61), or to leave a suicide note (OR=0.37; 95% CI =0.26, 0.52).
   Conclusions. Future research should consider that Black suicide decedents are less likely to report depression than White suicide decedents. This suicide risk difference is important when developing effective suicide prevention programs.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the methods used and demographic data of women suicides by examining postmortem investigation and autopsy reports from the Branch of the Council of Forensic Medicine in Diyarbakir Province, Turkey, between 1996 and 2001. Fifty-eight percent (174/302) of suicides were females and 42% (128/302) were males. The suicide rates were similarly higher for females than for males (2.6 and 1.8 per 10,000 population, respectively).
   Over half of female suicides (56.3%) occurred in those under 20 years of age. The most common suicide method for women was hanging (32.2%), and for men was firearms (51.7%), but for women younger than 20 years the most frequent method was firearms. Among the female suicides, five (2.8%) were known to have attempted suicide at least once in the past. Twenty-nine women (16.7%) were documented to have any psychiatric illness. None of the women had a history of drug or alcohol abuse. A suicide note was found in only six cases (3.4%). The predominant suicide motive was family problems (in 32% or 56/174).
   The higher rate of suicide in females than in males, and the absolute female predominance in suicides in Diyarbakir, Turkey, are in contrast to most of the medical literature and statistical information about suicide rates by country, in which suicide rates are usually higher among males.

AB Purpose: Given increasing youth suicide rates and liberalization of marijuana-use laws, this study examined postmortem marijuana toxicology test results among suicide decedents aged 15-19 (youth) compared to those aged 20-29 (young adults).
   Methods: Data were from the 2005-2015 National Violent Death Reporting System (N = 6002 decedents aged 15-19 and N = 20,925 decedents aged 20-29). Following descriptive analysis, logistic regression models were used to test associations of marijuana-positive toxicologies with incident year, state in which injury/death incurred, interactions between incident year and state, and suicide means.
   Results: Marijuana was the most commonly substantiated substance among youth and the second most commonly substantiated substance, after alcohol, among young adults. The odds of a marijuana-positive toxicology among youth were 2.21 (95% CI = 1.78-2.73) higher in 2012-2015 than in 2005-2011 and were 1.46 (95% CI = 1.18-1.79) higher in states with marijuana legalization or decriminalization laws; however, the incident year x state interaction term was not significant, and only the main effect of incident year remained significant (AOR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.34-2.59) in the interaction model. Among young adults, the main effects of incident year, state, and interaction effects (AROR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.61-2.53) were all significant. For both age groups, the odds of a marijuana-positive toxicology were lower among decedents who used poisoning than firearms.
   Conclusions: Liberalized marijuana policies do not appear to have influenced increases in marijuana-positive toxicologies among youth, but marijuana-positive rates were higher among those who died in recent years and by more violent/lethal means. Youth suicide prevention strategies should include monitoring marijuana use, education on marijuana's harms, and substance use treatment.

AB Aim Assess the impact of heavy drinking on homicide and suicide mortality in Russia between 1956 and 2002. Measures and design Alcohol-related mortality was used as a proxy for heavy drinking. We used autoregressive integrated moving average techniques to model total and sex-specific alcohol-homicide and alcohol-suicide relationships at the population level. Findings We found a positive and significant contemporaneous association between alcohol and homicide and between alcohol and suicide. We found no evidence of lagged relationships. These results held for overall and sex-specific associations. Conclusion Our results lend convergent validity to the alcohol-suicide link in Russia found by Nemtsov and to the alcohol-homicide associations found in cross-sectional analyses of Russia. Levels of alcohol consumption, homicide and suicide in Russia are among the highest in the world, and the mounting evidence of the damaging effects of consumption on the social fabric of the country reveals the need for intervention at multiple levels.

AB Objectives. We compared the prevalence of risk factors for Black and White suicide decedents in Fulton County, Georgia, from 1988-2002.
   Methods. We used data from the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office to compile information on suicides that occurred in Fulton County between 1988 and 2002. We used the X2 test and logistic regression to identify associations between suicide risk factors and race.
   Results. Black suicide decedents were more likely than White suicide decedents to be male (odds ratio [OR]=2.06; 95% confidence interval [Cl] = 1.38, 3.09), to be younger, (! 24 y [OR = 4.74; 95% Cl = 2.88, 7.811; 25-34 y [OR = 2.79; 95% CI = 1.74, 4.471; 35-44 y [OR = 1.86; 95% Cl = 1. 13, 3.071), and to hurt others in a suicide (OR = 4.22; 95% Cl = 1.60, 11.15) but less likely to report depression (OR = 0.63; 95% Cl = 0.413, 0.83), to have a family history of suicide (OR =0.08; 95% C1 = 0.01, 0.61), or to le3ve a suicide note (OR = 0.37; 95% C1 = 0.26, 0.52).
   Conclusions. Future research should consider that Black suicide decedents are less likely to report depression than White suicide decedents. This suicide risk difference is important when developing effective suicide prevention programs.

AB BACKGROUND: Suicide prevention is a public health priority, but no data on the health care individuals receive prior to death are available from large representative United States population samples.
   OBJECTIVE: To investigate variation in the types and timing of health services received in the year prior to suicide, and determine whether a mental health condition was diagnosed.
   DESIGN: Longitudinal study from 2000 to 2010 within eight Mental Health Research Network health care systems serving eight states.
   PARTICIPANTS: In all, 5,894 individuals who died by suicide, and were health plan members in the year before death.
   MAIN MEASURES: Health system contacts in the year before death. Medical record, insurance claim, and mortality records were linked via the Virtual Data Warehouse, a federated data system at each site.
   KEY RESULTS: Nearly all individuals received health care in the year prior to death (83 %), but half did not have a mental health diagnosis. Only 24 % had a mental health diagnosis in the 4-week period prior to death. Medical specialty and primary care visits without a mental health diagnosis were the most common visit types. The individuals more likely to make a visit in the year prior to death (p<0.05) tended to be women, individuals of older age (65+ years), those where the neighborhood income was over $40,000 and 25 % were college graduates, and those who died by non-violent means.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that opportunities for suicide prevention exist in primary care and medical settings, where most individuals receive services prior to death. Efforts may target improved identification of mental illness and suicidal ideation, as a large proportion may remain undiagnosed at death. (C) Society of General Internal Medicine 2014

   CARE; MEDICINE; SERVICEMEMBERS; RESILIENCE
AB Objective: The authors sought to develop and validate models using electronic health records to predict suicide attempt and suicide death following an outpatient visit.
   Method: Across seven health systems. 2,960,929 patients age 13 or older (mean age, 46 years; 62% female) made 10,275,853 specialty mental health visits and 9,685,206 primary care visits with mental health diagnoses between Jan.1, 2009, and June 30, 2015. Health system records and state death certificate data identified suicide attempts (N=24,133) and suicide deaths (N=1,240) over 90 days following each visit. Potential predictors included 313 demographic and clinical characteristics extracted from records for up to 5 years before each visit: prior suicide attempts, mental health and substance use diagnoses, medical diagnoses, psychiatric medications dispensed, inpatient or emergency department care, and routinely administered depression questionnaires. Logistic regression models predicting suicide attempt and death were developed using penalized LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) variable selection in a random sample of 65% of the visits and validated in the remaining 35%.
   Results: Mental health specialty visits with risk scores in the top 5% accounted for 43% of subsequent suicide attempts and 48% of suicide deaths. Of patients scoring in the top 5%, 5.4% attempted suicide and 0.26% died by suicide within 90 days. C-statistics (equivalent to area under the curve) for prediction of suicide attempt and suicide death were 0.851 (95% CI=0.848, 0.853) and 0.861 (95% CI =0.848, 0.875), respectively. Primary care visits with scores in the top 5% accounted for 48% of subsequent suicide attempts and 43% of suicide deaths. C-statistics for prediction of suicide attempt and suicide death were 0.853 (95% CI=0.849, 0.857) and 0.833 (95% CI=0.813, 0.853). respectively.
   Conclusions: Prediction models incorporating both health record data and responses to self-report questionnaires substantially outperform existing suicide risk prediction tools.

TI Use of Age-Adjusted Rates of Suicide in Time Series Studies in Israel
SO ISRAEL JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY AND RELATED SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID INTEGRATION
AB Durkheim's modified theory of suicide was examined to explore how consistent it was in predicting Israeli rates of suicide from 1965 to 1997 when using age-adjusted rates rather than crude ones. In this time-series study, Israeli male and female rates of suicide increased and decreased, respectively, between 1965 and 1997. Conforming to Durkheim's modified theory, the Israeli male rate of suicide was lower in years when rates of marriage and birth are higher, while rates of suicide are higher in years when rates of divorce are higher, the opposite to that of Israeli women. The corrected regression coefficients suggest that the Israeli female rate of suicide remained lower in years when rate of divorce is higher, again the opposite suggested by Durkheim's modified theory. These results may indicate that divorce affects the mental health of Israeli women as suggested by their lower rate of suicide. Perhaps the "multiple roles held by Israeli females creates suicidogenic stress" and divorce provides some sense of stress relief, mentally speaking. The results were not as consistent with predictions suggested by Durkheim's modified theory of suicide as were rates from the United States for the same period nor were they consistent with rates based on "crude" suicide data. Thus, using age-adjusted rates of suicide had an influence on the prediction of the Israeli rate of suicide during this period.

AB We developed linguistics-driven prediction models to estimate the risk of suicide. These models were generated from unstructured clinical notes taken from a national sample of U. S. Veterans Administration (VA) medical records. We created three matched cohorts: veterans who committed suicide, veterans who used mental health services and did not commit suicide, and veterans who did not use mental health services and did not commit suicide during the observation period (n = 70 in each group). From the clinical notes, we generated datasets of single keywords and multi-word phrases, and constructed prediction models using a machine-learning algorithm based on a genetic programming framework. The resulting inference accuracy was consistently 65% or more. Our data therefore suggests that computerized text analytics can be applied to unstructured medical records to estimate the risk of suicide. The resulting system could allow clinicians to potentially screen seemingly healthy patients at the primary care level, and to continuously evaluate the suicide risk among psychiatric patients.

AB Suicide is a growing cause of death in the United States. Research shows that therapists who treat people who are struggling with suicidal ideation (SI) experience anxiety. The purpose of this study is to develop an understanding around what it is like to work with clients with SI and what therapists do when working with clients who have SI. Data was collected from nine participants about the experiences of working with clients who were experiencing SI. Results indicated three major themes: (a) self-of-the-therapist issues, (b) issues relating to power, and (c) issues relating to treatment.

SO TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE bombing; control; guidance; suicide; technology; terrorism
AB Suicide bombing can be understood as a technology that successfully integrates people, cultures, and hardware into precise, intelligent, lethal weapons systems. Locking access to the sophisticated electronic guidance systems of their enemies, terrorists have developed a cost-effective alternative technology by using social and cultural pressure to convert human beings into guidance systems for terrorist ordnance. This demonstrates that while terrorists tend to be imitative in their technologies, effective and difficult to predict. A significant implication that arises from this discussion is that the American tendency to assume that "high-tech" devices will automatically confer an advantage on the United States in the struggle against terrorism should be reconsidered.
